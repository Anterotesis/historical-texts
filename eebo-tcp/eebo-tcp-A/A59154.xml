            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Present thee with that long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
most exact History of
the Lawes, Government, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and present state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of that great Monarchy
of <hi>China;</hi> in its circuit little less
then all Europe; Heretofore (as
zealous of its rare treasures) shut
and locked up from the curious eyes of strangers: so that
this booke (first) yeilds to thee a full discovery thereof.
&amp; (I dare say) the most valuable, that this our world hath
been acquainted with, since that of America; whereby
now the furthest East, as well as West, is disclosed, and
laid open to the present age. For, as for some former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
thou mayst have seen thereof, thou wilt by this
discerne them to be as fabulous, as they are compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and imperfect.</p>
                  <p>It was written by one, who, after, first, a strict educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in all sorts of learning, for two and twenty yeares
space lived in that Kingdome, was resident at the Court,
and in the greatest Cities thereof: and in all that time
<pb facs="tcp:64464:3"/>
(as designing such a worke) was a diligent Observator
and Collector of all their manners and customs; as
likewise (after much paines taken in the Language)
a great student of their Histories, and Writings. Whose
laborious worke, after it had already bin clothed in
many other Languages, besides the Authors, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comly
entertained in most states of Europe, it was
thought fit no longer to be concealed to a Nation, either
for curiosity of knowledge, or industry of forraigne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
no way yeilding to her neighbours.</p>
                  <p>The variety of the subjects handled therein is so
great (as comprehending the whole fabricke of that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
their Politicks, Oeconomicks, Sciences, Mechanicks,
Riches, Merchandise, &amp;c.) that those of whatsoever
profession, may reap no small benefit in reading the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
managements and practices therein, of so ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a People. Whose manners also (as their site) are so
remote and different in most things from ours, that (I
may say) in this piece is happily united, with the truth of
History, the delight of a Romance: where it will be
no small pleasure to thee to see their braines, as well as
their bodies, as it were of a severall mould from the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans,</hi>
and their inventions in many things, to
walke antipodes to us, and yet in these no way below us,
but in many superiour; or what in them appears less com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
yet will the knowledge thereof not be ungratefull
unto thee, because tis new and singular. As for many
morall vertues, thou wilt find them so far to transcend
us therein, that they may be proposed as an excellent pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne,
(as also they are a shame) to Christian states.
Lastly, to correct and reforme any their defects, and
<pb facs="tcp:64464:3"/>
make the nation perfectly happy, the light of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
hath of late visited this people, who sate in darknes:
so that now (after America also enlightned) there is
no end of the world left, wherinto the sound of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
is not gone forth. The foundation of which being
(there) already laid, there is great hopes that it may soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
come to a ful purity, reformation &amp; perfection, &amp; the
indefatigable pains &amp; undaunted courage of those labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
who cultivate it in the East, provoke a greater dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
andemulation therein, in our planters in the West;
where the Gospel (as following a conquest) may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
both with much more safety and authority.</p>
                  <p>To the end of this Treatise, I have added the History
of the Tartarian invasian of China, much enlarged &amp;
freed from divers Erratas of the former Edition; which
gives thee an account of the Chinesse affaires till the
yeare 1653. (Reader, thus much I thought good to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise
thee in the front of this Booke, that thou mayst
not be so great an hinderance to thy selfe, as not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with so curious and beneficiall a discourse.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho writeth of things farre
remote, doth almost alwayes
incurre the inconvenience of
many, and those no small de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects:
hence it is, that we see
many Books, whose Authours,
for their personal Qualities,
might deserve more credit than
may justly be given to their
writings. As for those, who
have written of <hi>China,</hi> I have perused some of them, who lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in oblivion almost all Truths, take the liberty to wander
in discourses altogether fabulous: for this Kingdome being
so remote, and having alwayes with much Care avoided all
Communication with Strangers, reserving onely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
the knowledge of their own Affairs, with a most parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Caution: hence it followes, that nothing is knowne
without the Confines thereof, but what doth, as it were,
overflow into the skirts of the Country of <hi>Cantone,</hi> (a
part of this Empire, whither the Portugheses have been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to come) so that the most internall and secret knowledge
thereof hath been reserved, either for the Natives of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
who know well enough how to conceale it; or for those,
who, upon a better Motive, have, to discover it, little lesse
then forgotten their own nature, their language, their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
and manner of living, and transformed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the naturall humour of that Country.</p>
                  <p>Now this last hath by divine dispensation, fallen to the lott
<pb facs="tcp:64464:4"/>
of the Religious of the Company of <hi>Iesus;</hi> who although
they came late to the Culture of the Church, are, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
arrived to that honour to be reckoned among the
first, that after Saint Thomas the Apostle, did cultivate those
remote Confines of the world.</p>
                  <p>It is now fifty eight years, that they have laboured under
this so distant Climate, where directing all their force and
endeavours, to the conversion of Souls, they account it a
manifest Theft, to employ any otherwise that time which they
owe to the Service of God, and is of so much importance
for the Eternall Salvation of men. Hence it is, that never
any yet did, or would it have been permitted him, if he had
desired it, to employ himselfe in writing the Relation of this
Kingdome; except it were Father <hi>Nicolaus Trigalzius,</hi> after
he had by permission with-drawn himself from the culture of
Christianity among the <hi>Chineses,</hi> and passed from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vpon the same occasion I have undertaken to give a
briefe account thereof, sufficient at least for the instruction
of those, who desire to be informed concerning those parts:
forbearing to make a more large discourse at the present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
reserving it for another time; which may be, when wee
shall returne to that vast Country, with new Labourers
in so great a number, that some of the greatest Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Experience among us, may find leisure and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to undertake a perfect Relation.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, abbreviating, as much as 'tis possible,
this Information, without rendring that knowledge confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
which wee pretend to gratify the world with, we shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the work into two parts. The first containeth the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
part of the Kingdome; that is, the Provinces, Land, and
Fruits; and in a manner, the formal part too; that is, the
people, their learning, and customes. The second, the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Christianity there, the progresse thereof, the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
suffered therein; and finally the condition, wherein
I left it, at my departure thence. I hope this worke shall gain
some esteem and credit, if not for the greatnesse of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
at least for the certainty of the reality of it; having
<pb facs="tcp:64464:5"/>
taken what I write, from the infallible Testimony of mine
eyes; which though they may not be of the quickest sighted,
yet have had the advantage to reiterate very often their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations.
And if he which vieweth for a long time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
his sight be not of the best, doth commonly see
more, then he who looketh in haste, be his eyes never so
good: I, who, for the space of two and twenty years,
have had the opportunity to observe all Passages of
<hi>China,</hi> have certainly seen so much what <hi>I</hi> write, and what
others have written, who have not seen them sowell, that
<hi>I</hi> must necessarily speak of them with more Certainty then
they, although with lesse Eloquence.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hina</hi> in its extent is one great continued
Continent, without having any thing
which devides it: and taking it from the
latitude of <hi>Haynam</hi> (which is not farre
distant from the Continent, and lyeth
in nineteen degrees) it extends it self
twenty foure degrees, inclining towards
the East; and ending in fourty three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
it comes to make a circuite so much
the more spacious, by how much the
coasts thereof run along in various and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall
windings; and so comes to be the
chiefest kingdome of the world in greatnesse, and almost equall to all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.
On the west side thereof are many small Islands, but so neere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that they seem all to Compose but, as it were, one body.</p>
                     <p>All this Monarchy is divided into fifteen Provinces; each of which
is a spacious Kingdome, and so they were all anciently; each having a
King of its own. Of those nine, which they call the Southern Provinces,
the greatest part of them are watered with large rivers, and some of those,
having so great plenty of water, that in many places the opposite banks are
out of sight, one of the other; and elsewhere, that which appeareth, is
hardly to be distinguished what it is. They are all navigable, and are
frequented with so a great concourse of divers sorts of vessels, that what
might be said upon this occasion, will hardly seem credible: I shall onely
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64464:10"/>
say, that in this, they do exceed all other rivers of the world. In an Arme
of the river of <hi>Nanchim,</hi> which with a moderate breadth runneth down to
<hi>Hamchen,</hi> I stayed eight dayes for a passage through that vvonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of vessels: and whilest an houre-glasse of sand was running out, I
counted three hundred small ships, reckoning only those which came up
the river. It is a marvellous thing, there being so many, that all are so vvell
accommodated for Merchandize, and so convenient for passengers; They
are all covered and kept very neat, and some of them so beautified and
adorned with pictures, that they seem rather made for the recreation, than
the traffick of Merchants.</p>
                     <p>The manner, after which they are governd is very notable: for the
Marriners keep all without the place, where the passengers make their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode,
there being space enough without for them to run up and down,
that trim the Sayles and guide the Bark, without any disturbance
of the others, who enjoy a pleasant ease and rest. In which the Barks of the
province of <hi>Hanceo</hi> exceed the rest.</p>
                     <p>The six Northern provinces, as they come nearest to our latitude, do
most resemble our climate, and are more dry and healthfull than the rest.
But in all of them (more or lesse) there are not wanting many of a long
and happy life; there being to be found many, and very vigorous and
lusty old men.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>Of the same more particularly.</head>
                        <p>This Kingdom is so populous, that not only the Villages, but even the
Cities are in sight one of another; and in some places, where the rivers are
most frequented, the habitations are almost continued. Of these there are
foure sorts; great Cities which they call <hi>Fu:</hi> the lesser, which they call
<hi>Cen,</hi> (concerning these, Writers have somewhat differed in their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:)
Townes, which they call <hi>Hien;</hi> and Castles, which they call
<hi>Cid.</hi> Besides these, there are Villages and Hamlets almost innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Of all these the Walls are kept night and day with a four-fold
Guard at the sound of a Bell, even to the innermost City of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as if they were alwayes in a condition of Warre: shewing, that to
prevent the least imaginable danger, which may fal out in an houre; it
is good to stand, during life, upon our guard: for ordinarily all sudden
ruines proceed from a long confidence. The streets are kept by Courts
of Guard and Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>inels, with so much rigour, that if they find them asleep,
or stragled from their Post, or that they do not speedily answer, they are
presently condemned to the <hi>Bastinado,</hi> which is immediately executed in
the same place. The publick gates are shut every night with great care, and
if there fall out any accident, they are not opened, til they are satisfied,
how the Fact was done. In the year one thousand six hundred thirty
four, I was in the City of <hi>Kiamsi,</hi> where thirty theeves broke prison, and
having routed the guards, wounding some and killing others, set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
at liberty. The Fact was known; and the opening of the gates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suspended according to their inviolable custome, before next night
the Malefactors were all taken, nor could the greatnesse of the City hide
any one of them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64464:10"/>This Kingdom is so exceeding populous, that I having lived there two
and twenty years, was in no lesse amazement at my coming away, than I
was in the beginning, at the multitude of the people: certainly, the truth
exceedeth all Hyperboles; not onely in the Cities, Townes, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
places, (in some of which one cannot walk without great violence
of thrusting and crowding;) but also in the High-wayes, there is as
great a concourse, as is usually in Europe at some great feastivall, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
meeting. And if we will referre our selves to the generall register

an infinite number) there are reckoned of them to be fifty eight milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and fifty five thousand, one hundred and fourescore.</p>
                        <p>The houses, where they inhabite, are not so sumptuous and lasting, as
ours: yet are they more convenient for the good contrivance, and more
pleasant for their exquisite neatnesse. They use much in their houses
<hi>Charam,</hi> an excellent vernish, and painting of an accurate diligence. They
build them not very high, esteeming them more convenient for being
low, as well for habitation, as for good accommodation. The richer sort of
people doe plant the courts and approaches to their houses with flowres
and small trees; and, towards the North, they use fruit trees. In like
manner, where they have roome enough, they set greater trees, and raise
artificiall mountaines; to which end they bring from farre, great pieces of
rocks: They keep there severall sorts of fowl; as Cranes and Swannes,
and other beautifull birds: and also wild beasts, as Stagges, and fallow
Deare: They make many fish-ponds, where are to be seen gliding up and
downe painted fish with gilded finns, and other things likewise of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
and delight.</p>
                        <p>Their way of building is in this manner. They frame first exactly the
roofe of the house, which they set upon pillars of wood, the which by
how much the bigger they are, are so much the more esteemed: after they
fit up the walls with brick, or some such like matter. There is a Tradition,
that, anciently, they made their buildings according to exact rules of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and proportion; of which Art there are yet some bookes remaining;
but those rules are now only observed in the Kings palaces, and in publick
workes; as, towres of Cities and Townes, which they make of severall
formes; as round; square; octangular; very beautifull, with staires,
some winding, some plaine, and Balansters on the out-side.</p>
                        <p>In the vessels and utensiles of their house they are both very curious
and expensive; using much the abovesaid <hi>Charam,</hi> a sort of vernish,
which is taken from certaine trees, proper only to that, and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring,
Countries: and in truth it is an excellent thing, as well for the
perfection of the matter, (as may be seen in the workes which come from
thence) as for the easinesse in working it, as well in making new things, as
in retrimming the old, and reducing them to their former beauty.</p>
                        <p>As for plenty; whereas this kingdome, by reason of its large extent,
doth participate of diverse latitudes and climates, it produceth and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
so great varietie of fruits, that nature seems there to have laid upon
heapes, what shee but scatters through the rest of the world. It hath
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64464:11"/>
within its owne doores all that is necessary for mans life, together with all
superfluity of delicacies: whence it hath, not only no need to take almes
of other Countries; but, with what it is able to spare, (which is both much
and very good) it satisfieth the desires of the neighbouring and remote
kingdomes, who have always a longing desire to see and enjoy it. Its
chiefe sustenance is that which is most used throughout the world, to wit,
wheat and rice; some Countries making most use of the one, and some
of the other. <hi>China</hi> produceth both in so great plenty, that a <hi>Pico</hi> of
each (a <hi>Pico</hi> containes 125 pound of our weight) is commonly worth
five Reals, (that is, about halfe a crowne of English mony) and if it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to seaven and a halfe 'tis counted a dearth.</p>
                        <p>The Northern Provinces use for their proper sustenance Wheate, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Maiz; eating Rice but seldome, as we doe in Europe; leaving it
for the Southern Provinces; Which although they have Wheat in great
plenty, make use of it with the same moderation, as we doe of Rice, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other sort of fruit. They have Pulse of diverse kindes, the reliefe of
the poorer sort of people, and the ordinary provinder, in stead of Barly,
for the Beasts of Burthen. They use Herbes much; they being the food of
the ordinary people, almost all the year throughout; &amp; the chiefe Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
of their Apothecaries shops, for their physicke; which is founded only
upon Herbes and very safe physick. Yet they want both Endive and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus,
but have in stead thereof others, which we want.</p>
                        <p>Flesh they have every where plentifully, even in small villages. That
which they use most constantly throughout the yeare, is Hogs-flesh,
Beefe is sold there without any bones, they taking them alwayes out, first.
Venison they have not so plentifull: nor doe they much affect it; although
they have there the same which here afford us so much recreation; as,
wild Boares, Stagges, fallow Deare and Hares, but no Conies. Of fowle
there is great plenty, they have all ours in great abundance: Partridges
of two sorts, one whereof differeth not from ours, but only in their call.
The Nightingales, though they are bigger than ours, have the same voice
and manner of singing. Other birds there are which we have not here,
and are in great esteeme, as well for their beauty to the eye, as for their
excellent taste to please the Palat. The birds which we see painted in their
workes that come into Europe have, without doubt, for the most part, the
resemblance of those there. Art alwaies favouring nature, or but little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
from her. They are excellent in bringing up of tame fowle, and
have of every sort without number; Geese they have in so great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that they feed up and downe the fields in huge flocks. That which
is reported of their hatching egges by art, is very certaine; but it is only in
the spring time, and then they have no need of the dam.</p>
                        <p>Wild Beasts, as Tigers and Wolves there are in abundance through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the kingdome, though they doe not much hurt. There are Elephants
alwaies to be seen at court, but they are brought from other Countries.
For tame creatures they have all ours, as well for burthen (without using
Oxen for this, as they are faine to doe throughout all India) as also for til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of their land, in which they make use of Oxen. In the Southern parts
the <hi>Bufolo's</hi> undergoe the chiefe labour. They have store of horses, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64464:11"/>
without mettle, and little worth. Coaches were formerly much in use
with them, and growing out of fashion there, we tooke them up, being
first used, in Italy and Spain, in the yeare 1546. Since they have only used
Chaires and Sedans, finding them of lesse pompe and expence, and of
greater convenience; wherefore to this day in all their journies they serve
themselves with litters carried by Mules, or Chaires borne by 4, 6, or 8,
men, according to the quality of the persons. Those which they use most
in Cities are in forme not unlike unto ours. Those in which the women
are carried, are bigger, more convenient, and more beautified; and also
the manner of carrying them is different. In the two Cities of <hi>Penckin</hi>
and <hi>Nanckin,</hi> where there is a greater concourse of all sorts of people,
they have in all publick places a good quantity of Horses and Mules, with
handsome furniture, and very well fitted with bridles and saddles, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ready to be hired by such persons, as are desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and lesse expence, to travell up and downe the City upon their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                        <p>In the Northern provinces, they have but little fish, (except it be at the
Court; which, for being such, wants nothing.) The reason is, because
in those parts there are no many Rivers: yet they cause great store of
fish to be brought from the Southern P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ovinces, (which very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
therein, taking them on the sea coasts, in lakes, and in pooles in
great plenty) dried and accommodated in diverse manners, so much as is
sufficient. In the River of <hi>Nanckin</hi> there is every yeare a fishing for the
Kings use; and till that be done, there is a prohibition upon a rigorous
penalty for any other person to fish: and the voyage being between five
and fourty and threescore daies journy, yet it is brought fresh and sweet,
without salting it. Troutes are not there so much esteemed as with us; but
Sturgeon every whit as much; which, when it is sold at the dearest, doth
not exceed five-pence the pound: By which you may perceive the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of all other things.</p>
                        <p>Among fruits; Cherries, and Mulberries have there no esteeme, for
their tast is not very good; they use the greatest part of those fruits we
have in Europe: but they are not comparable to ours, neither in quantity
nor quality, except it be the Oranges of <hi>Cantone,</hi> which may well be called
the <hi>Queens</hi> of Oranges: and are by some esteemed to be, not so much
Oranges as <hi>Muscatell</hi> Grapes, disguised in that forme and habit. The
Southern provinces have the best fruit of all India; particularly <hi>Cantone;</hi> for
they have <hi>Anans, Manghas, Bananas, Giachas,</hi> &amp; <hi>Giambas;</hi> &amp; above all, there
are some fruits proper to them of a particular excellency, such as in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone</hi>
are the <hi>Licie,</hi> (so the <hi>Portughess</hi> call them; but the <hi>Chineses,</hi> Lici.)
These on the outside are of an Orange colour, and when they are ripe doe
very much beautify the trees they grow on. They are made like chast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts,
in the forme of an heart: when the shell is pilled of, which is only
contiguous to it, the fruit remaines like a pearl in colour, very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to the sight, but more to the taste.</p>
                        <p>There is likewise a fruit called <hi>Longans,</hi> named by the <hi>Chineses, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mien,</hi>
that is, Dragons eye, they are in figure and greatnesse not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
a small nut, but the <hi>Pulpe</hi> is very little, and different; but between
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64464:12"/>
the shell and the stone it is sweet and wholesome: this fruit is found in
<hi>Cantone</hi> and <hi>Fokien.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Throughout the kingdome there are red figges, (a name put upon them
by the <hi>Portugheses:</hi> for in the <hi>Chinese</hi> tongue they are called <hi>Suzu:</hi>) it
is a fruit very different from figges in colour, figure and taste; the colour
on the outside is red, on the inside like gold; the figure is of the bignesse
of an Orange, bigger or lesser; for there is as much diversitie of them, as
there is among us of figges. The rinde is very thinne, and is of so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
good taste, that in my opinion it may be reckoned among the
chiefest in the world. They have one or two seeds, which are like unto
blanched Almonds: the best are in the cold Countries. The provinces
<hi>Honan, Xiansi, Xensi,</hi> and <hi>Xantum</hi> enjoy the best in quality, and in great
quantity; and dry enough of them to serve the whole kingdome. When
they are dry, they are better than our dried figges, to which they have
some kind of resemblance.</p>
                        <p>The province of <hi>Hamcheu</hi> produceth a particular fruit, which they
call <hi>Iammoi,</hi> as bigge as a plumbe, round, and in colour and taste like
unto the best <hi>Mulberries:</hi> but the tree is very different.</p>
                        <p>Peaches there are none, unlesse it be in the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi> where
there are some of a notable bignesse: some are red both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
others of a yellow colour, of the same figure and taste with ours.</p>
                        <p>There are Melons every where in great abundance: but the best are not
to be compared to our good ones: there are water melons in great plenty
and very good.</p>
                        <p>Grapes are very rare and scarce, and grow only in Arbours, and close
walkes, except it be in the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi> where they are in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and where they also dry them in great plenty. They make not their
wine of Grapes, but of Barly, and in the Northern parts, of Rice; where
they also make it of Apples, but in the Southern parts of Rice only; yet
this is not ordinary Rice, but a certaine kind of it proper to them, which
serveth only to make this liquor, being used in diverse manners.</p>
                        <p>Vineger they make of the same ingredients as their wine; and, in the
Westerne Provinces, of <hi>Millet;</hi> which notwithstanding is sharp and well
tasted.</p>
                        <p>The wine used by the common people, although it will make them
drunke, is not very strong nor lasting, 'tis made at all times of they eare:
but the best only in the winter: It hath a colour very pleasing to the sight;
nor is the smell lesse pleasing to the sent; or the Savour thereof, to the taste:
take altogether, it is a ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

but without any mulct of shame; for they have not yet placed it in
that consideration. Winter and Summer they drink it warm.</p>
                        <p>Flowers are in singular esteeme with these people; and they have some
exceeding beautifull and different from ours; which (yet) they doe not
want. They have Clove-gilleflowres, which have no smell at all. They
endeavour to have, the yeare throughout, flowers for every season in their
gardens, in which they are very curious. They have some flowres, which
in their duration exceed the ordinary stile of nature; in which they seeme
to be exempt from their common tribute of a short life. For when these
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64464:12"/>
plants have no moysture left for the nourishment of their leaves, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the cold, these do fall off, then do new flowres sprout againe, &amp;
those the most odoriferous, during the greatest inclemency of the frost
and snow. These are called <hi>Lamui,</hi> more pleasing to the sent than the eye;
their colour being not unlike that of Bees-wax. They have other flowers
like Lillies, called <hi>Tiaohoa,</hi> which they keep in the house, because that
being carefully taken up with their roots entire and well cleansed from
earth, they live and flourish in the ayre.</p>
                        <p>Their Garments, as also the furniture of their chambers and houses,
they make of wooll, Linnen, Silke and Cotton, which they make great
use of an weave thereof many faire and curious stuffs.</p>
                        <p>The riches of that kingdom is admirable: for besides that the earth is
so fruitfull in all kinde of sustenance, and what ever is necessary for mans
life, as may be perceived by what hath been already said; they do
<hi>vend</hi> unto strangers the best and richest merchandise of all the East; such
as are Gold-threed; Gold in the leafe and Ingot; Rubies; Saphires; small
Pearle; Muske; raw silke; and wrought silk quick-silver, Copper, Tin,
<hi>Tomnaga,</hi> which is a kind of mettall more fine, and as hard as Tin; Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion,
Salt-nitre, Brimstone, Sugar, and other things of lesse importance.</p>
                        <p>Their guilded workes for houshold-stuffe, ornaments and jewells for
women, both for necessity and curiositie, are sufficiently known to the
world: nor doth all this issue out at one port, but by many in a great and
perpetuall commerce. In all this abundant riches of the Country, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
of the inhabitants, Arts and means of gaining their living to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
plenty, they doe not let passe any other thing, that can bring them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
profit; and notwithstanding the sight of so great afluence of noble
commodities, they make a profit of their Beefe-bones; Hogges-haires; and
of the smallest ragge, that is throne into the streetes. There raigneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them that only pledge &amp; suretie of the duration of Empires; that is,
that the publike is rich, and no particulars. They are not so rich there as
in <hi>Europe,</hi> nor so many which can properly deserve that name: nor are the
poor here so many, nor so poor; as those there. The people is infinite, nor
can they have a capitall, or stock, sufficient for so many; or mony to fill
so many purses. Hence it comes to passe, that the partition among them is
such, that much comes to few, a mediocrity to not many, and a little to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
infinite. Their mony is much at one stay, which may be perceived
by the same low price of things, salary of servants, pay of workmanship,
and stipend of publick Ministers.</p>
                        <p>So that even to this day, at least in diverse of these countries they live,
as they did formerly in <hi>Portugall;</hi> when a <hi>Maraved is,</hi> which is worth a
farthing and a half, divided into six blanes, would buy six severall things.
So was it also in <hi>Castile,</hi> not only in ancient times, but even to the raign of
<hi>Don Iohn</hi> the first: the records of which are still preserved: but such tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
and plenty long since are gone out of the world. From hence it is
manifest, how much that admirable duration of the Empire of <hi>China</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
on observing its lawes and ancient customes, without ever ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a gate (that the great ones might seeme greater, and the small ones,
great) to luxurie in apparel, and excesse in diet; which are the irreparable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64464:13"/>
ruine of Common wealths.</p>
                        <p>A pound of mutton is worth a penny, a pigeon a farthing and a halfe,
the hire of a man-servant for a year two hundred farthings, and his dyet
and lodging. But there is a great difference betwixt some places and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
those of the South, as they have the advantage in commerce, so they
exceed the rest in money; and the price of things; which continually
riseth, as we find every day by experience: but even there to this day, the
rate is very moderate.</p>

                     <p>THis kingdome is divided into two parts, South and North; and both
these subdivided into fifteen provinces, as is above-said. To this
Southern part belong nine; which are <hi>Cantone, Quamsi, Yunnam, Fukien, Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amsi,
Suchuem, Utquam, Chekiam, Nankim,</hi> we will treate of these in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and of the rest in the next. That we may proceede distinctly, speaking
of them in the same order that we have named them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cantone</hi> is the first, and lyeth in that part of the South, that is properly
named <hi>Quantum.</hi> It is in the latitude of twenty three degrees, it is large,
rich, and abounding in wheat and rice; of these it produceth each yeare
two harvests, though for the most part they are of a severall graine.
There is store of suger, copper and tin, materials, which they worke, with
great variety, into innumerable sorts of vessels; as also, workes made
with <hi>Charam,</hi> an excellent vernish, and with guilding, some whereof are
transported into <hi>Europe.</hi>

                     <p>The Jesuits in this province had two residencies with their Churches
and houses, vvhich perished by reason of Severall persecutions, as you
shall find hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The people are able Mechanicks, and though of small invention, yet
they imitate excellently whatsoever they find invented. To the City
called also <hi>Cantone</hi> (though the proper name thereof bee <hi>Guamcheufu</hi>)
the <hi>Portugesses</hi> go twice every year with their marchandice. It is distant
from <hi>Macao</hi> an hundred and five miles: and <hi>Macao</hi> is distant from the
first Islands, and from the greater Cities of that Empire fifty four: The
circumference thereof is 15 good miles. The concourse of merchants
thither is very great and therefore it is more peopled than many of the
other Cities. The most and best commodities of that Kingdome are
brought thither, because it is the most open and free seat of trade in that
nation. And to say nothing of the six neighbouring kingdomes, from
whence all sorts of merchandise is brought thither, as well by natives as
strangers: only that which the <hi>Portugesses</hi> take in for <hi>India, Giappone</hi>

lawes of the Kingdom, the Natives of this Province do go into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
of the neighbouring strangers, which are upon the sea-coasts. It yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
gold, good sugar in great quantitie, good Canvas-cloath; for other
linnen there is none in <hi>China.</hi> There is made excellent paper of diverse
kindes, which for plenty, goodnesse, and cheapnesse, is very remarkable,
They make use of printing no lesse conveniently, and (as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
more anciently, than in <hi>Europe,</hi> although not in the very same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
for here, after the printing of each sheet, the letters are taken asunder:
there they carve what they would print upon boards or plate, so that the
bookes are still preserved entire in their work-houses; and therefore as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as there is occasion, they can reprint any book, without the expence
of new setting the letters. This country is scituated upon the Sea-side,
and is another eminent port, from whence are issued out of that Kingdom,
infinite Merchandise, which are carried by the people of this country,
that are industrious, and brought up to it, to <hi>Manila, Giappone,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to the Island <hi>Formosa,</hi> which is even in the sight of the land, (for with a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64464:14"/>
a good wind it is not above 24 houres voyage thither) where they trade
with the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are two houses and Churches there belonging to our company;
under whose Government and direction are a great number of very good
Christians; who have about ten Churches belonging to them, the which
are visited by us very diligently at set times. Two of their chiefe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are in the City of <hi>Fucheu</hi> which is their Metropolis: another in the
City of <hi>Cieumchu,</hi> the rest in other Cities. There are (besides) many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Oratories.</p>
                     <p>The Island <hi>Formosa</hi> lyeth in the Latitude of 22 degrees, it is situated
between the Kingdomes of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Giappone:</hi> before you come thither
you must passe by a great number of Islands named <hi>Liqueu:</hi> the length of
this Island is 150 miles, the breadth 75.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have there a fort placed in a sandy vale, under which
lyeth the Port, which is encompassed with bankes of sand, and if it were
not distinguished and secured by certaine posts set up in the water, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
would be very difficult even to those of the Countrie. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side of the Island toward the East, the <hi>Spanyards</hi> have a fort, distant
from that of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> 90 miles by sea, and by land 45, as is reported.
The soyle of the Island is so fruitfull, that it produceth grasse nine or ten
palmes high (a palme is nine inches, English measure) where the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
feed their cattell. There is so great abundance of Stagges, that it
seemeth incredible to him that hath not seen it. Father <hi>Albertus Miceschi,</hi>
(who lived there in the condition of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lave) relateth, that, riding to the
next woods with leave from the Governour, to gather some medicinall
hearbes, he saw by the way so great a multitude of Stagges, that he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to be the herds belonging to the people of the Country, dispersed
up and downe the fields, till coming neerer he found with his eyes the
contrary. There are also many of those <hi>Animals</hi> called <hi>Alces</hi> or <hi>Elkes,</hi>
the which, I did hitherto beleeve, were only to be found in <hi>Lituania</hi> and
the adjacent Countries. There are also many other <hi>Animals</hi> wholly
differing from ours, and altogether strange to us. It is the likest Country
to <hi>Europe</hi> of all <hi>India:</hi> it enjoyeth an healthfull ayre, and cold, like ours. It
produceth some spices, but not in great plenty; as Pepper in the woods,
and Cynamon on the mountaines, &amp; <hi>Camphire</hi> trees of a notable bignesse,
<hi>China</hi> roots, and <hi>Salsapariglia,</hi> in great quantitie. There are also gold
mines, but the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have not yet open'd them.</p>
                     <p>The people of the Countrie weare no manner of cloathes; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
both men and women doe cover that, which in all the <hi>India's</hi> useth to
be hidden from sight, by the instinct of nature. They dwell in round hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
made with Bulrushes of severall colours, beautifull to behold a farre
off. Their ordinary food is Stagges flesh as fat as porke; and Rice; of
which also they make very strong wine. Many of them doe turne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
by the perswasion of the <hi>Holland</hi> Ministers, and live verteously.
They are tall and active of body, so fleet in running that they are able to
single out, and run downe a Stagge in their hunting. Their Lords doe
weare a Crowne of dead mens skulls, stitched together and embellished
with silke: and these are the heads of their enemies killed by themselves.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64464:14"/>
Their King weareth two wings of various feathers upon his head: others
crowne themselves with apples of gold, others make themselves hornes
of a certaine straw, made up with <hi>Bufolo's</hi> haire: They gird themselves
also about with a girdle of young Bulrushes curiously woven. They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hanging at their breast two Tortoises and a woodden mallet, which
serve them in stead of a drum. There is likewise another Island neere to
it, inhabited by fierce savage people, who kill, whosoever goeth thither.
The above-named father <hi>Miceschi</hi> saw one of them taken by the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,
who was fifteen palmes high, as it seemed to him.</p>
                     <p>The fift place we will give to the Province of <hi>Kiamsi,</hi> which is contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to that of <hi>Cantone</hi> toward the North, in the latitude of 29 degrees.
It takes its beginning from a great ridge of mountaines, which reare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon the confines of <hi>Cantone,</hi> from these Mountaines two Rivers
have their originall; one, which runneth toward the South, and is presently
navigable; the other towards the North; which after it hath watred a
good part of this Province receiveth into his channell another large Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of the Province of <hi>Huquam,</hi> and then runneth forward with the name
of the famous <hi>Nankim.</hi> The skirts of these Mountaines are considerable
for the good Cities that are scituated thereon; very convenient for the
passage of travailers, and for the conduct of Merchandise; which for the
most part passeth upon the backs of men and boyes, according to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
of each, learning this trade from their youth, which is the most
usuall imployment of that Countrie. The voyage is but of one whole
day, and it is very much to see what passeth by in it. For there being no
other bridge; and these Rivers being the most frequented passes of all
<hi>China,</hi> 'tis almost incredible, how great a concourse of people there is, and
what a multitude of commodities, which goe and come without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
The Merchandise is all put in one store-house, and is received
by weight into another with so much fidelitie, that it is not necessary the
owner should be present, because upon all accidents the Hostes are bound
to make good whatsoever is wanting. They are obliged also to give to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
guest of qualitie, or Merchant two banquets, or one at least, as also to
their servants; and if they be not satisfied therewith, they tell them of it,
expostulate, and threaten not to frequent any more their Inne, there not
wanting many others.</p>
                     <p>By this Government they make their covetous Hostes very sumptuous
and bountifull. The Hostes are also obliged, as soone, as their guests are
embarqued, (for if they goe by land this priviledge ceaseth) to send them
a present of two things, or of one at least, as fruit, two fishes, a little
flesh, a couple of pullets; and this without paying, either at your entrance,
abode, or departure; for there is nothing to be payd, either for the lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or bedstead, I say bedstead, because the Hoste allowes you no bed but
every one carrieth one with him at his backe, when he hath no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience;
but they are not so big as our beds, but much lighter. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Hoste consisteth in so much <hi>percent,</hi> which is payd them by the
Boateman for such persons, or goods as are carried by water; and by the
porters for such as passe by land; and as the concourse is great, the profit
cannot be little. Every thing passeth through the hands of Insurers, so
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64464:15"/>
that if any thing be wanting, they supply it and make it up.</p>
                     <p>In the Custome-house (for there is a very famous one here) there is not
so much honour done the Merchant, but more favour. There is no house
where the Merchandise is deposited, weighed or visited; neither is it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the barke; but only a moderate rate is payed for it by the eye,
and according to the Merchants booke of accounts. If the passenger be
no Merchant, although he goe alone in a Barke with his servants, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
five or six chests, and severall other things, which are usually transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from one Country to another, they are not searched nor opened, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe they pay any custome. A good example for the Custome and
Gabell-houses of <hi>Europe,</hi> where a poore traveller is so beastly and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously,
robbed and spoiled; when all he carrieth with him is not
worth so much as they aske him for custome.</p>
                     <p>For strangers ships, which come into the Port of <hi>Macao,</hi> as soone as any
arriveth, they unlade their Merchandise as they please, without any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance;
and when the customers come, they pay them according to the
content of the vessel, without making any enquiry into the qualitie of the
<hi>Cargazon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to returne to the Province of <hi>Kiamsi,</hi> (of which we were discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;)
it particularly aboundeth in Rice and fish, but most of all in people.
So that the <hi>Chinesses</hi> call them <hi>Laochu,</hi> that is to say, Rats. Whereof, we
have a resemblance in <hi>Portugall,</hi> in the Country that lyeth between the
Rivers <hi>Duer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> and <hi>Migno;</hi> which, where it confineth upon <hi>Gallitia</hi> hath so
great multitude of people, that it is therefore called by the same name;
although learned men doe derive it from <hi>Rates,</hi> an ancient part of that
Country.</p>
                     <p>Now this people running over the whole kingdom, like swarmes of
Bees, do fill it with severall Trades whereunto they apply themselves,
and for the greatest part they lead a miserable life, and are therefore so
penurious, niggardly, and drie in their presents, that they passe, in ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
proverbs, through the rest of the Provinces.</p>
                     <p>It is famous for Sturgeon, which it hath of very great bignesse; and
more for the <hi>Porcellane</hi> dishes (indeed the only work in the world of this
kinde) which are made only in one of its Townes: So that all that is used
in the Kingdom, and dispersed through the whole world, are brought
from this place: although the earth, whereof they are made commeth
from another place: but there only is the water, wherewith precisely
they are to be wrought to come to their perfection, for if they be
wrought with other water the worke will not have so much glosse and
lustre. In this worke there are not those mysteries that are reported of it
here, neither in the matter, the form, nor the manner of working; they
are made absolutely of earth, but of a neate and excellent quality. They
are made in the same time, and the same manner, as our earthen vessels;
only they make them with more diligence and accuratenesse. The Blew,
wherewith they paint the <hi>Porcellane,</hi> is <hi>Anill,</hi> whereof they have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
some do paint them with <hi>Vermilion,</hi> and (for the King) with
yellow.</p>
                     <p>This Province, and that of <hi>Chincheo</hi> and <hi>Cantone,</hi> which border one
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64464:15"/>
upon another, do unite, as it were, in an angle, with many Mountaines
between them: In the middle of which Mountaines there is a small
Kingdome, which hath a particular King of its own without any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the <hi>Chinesses;</hi> from whom he doth defend himselfe, if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to assault him; nor is the defence difficult, there being but one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into that kingdome. They admit of the <hi>Chinesse-Physitians</hi> in their
infirmities, but not of their learned men into the administration of their
government. If they have an ill Harvest, and that there is like to be a scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
they go out, and rob in a millitary order, to the sound of the drum.
So in the year 1632 they gave no small trouble to this province of <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amsi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last account shall be concerning the Christianity there, which
hath prospered very well, being also beneficed with two Churches
and houses which we have in that Province, the one in the City of <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi>
which is the Metropolis; The other in the City of <hi>Nauhium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The sixt Province is called <hi>Suchuen,</hi> in the same paralel with that of <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amsi,</hi>
and in the same latitude of 29 degrees, nor hath it any thing in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
differing from the former, worthy the relation.</p>
                     <p>The Province of <hi>Huquam</hi> is the seventh in Scituation, it lyeth more to
the North, in the heighth of 31 degrees, it exceeds the whole Kingdom
for the abundance of Rice. The <hi>Chinesses</hi> say, that that whole Kingdom
is able to give but a breakfast in respect of <hi>Huquam,</hi> which provideth for
the whole yeare. It hath store of oyle, and no lesse Fish, by reason of
the rivers, which it enjoyeth, and the lakes, which seem rather Seas. In
the Metropolis of this Province there was a Residencie begun at the time
of my arrival.</p>
                     <p>The province of <hi>Cakiam,</hi> which is the eighth, lyeth in the Latitude of
30 degrees: it is for the most part scituated by the Sea-side, fertile, plain,
and almost all divided by severall rivers, some whereof run through their
Cities and Townes. In riches it exceeds many of the Provinces, as being,
the Fountain, from whence the best Commodities of that Monarchie
doe flow: it is singular in silke, which it distributeth through every part,
whether it be raw, or wrought; in Balls or in Stuffe. All that goeth out of
the Kingdome any way, cometh from this Province: though all <hi>China</hi>
hath the benefit of the Silk-worme, yet all the rest would not serve them,
to make them Scarfes: the name of the Metropolis is <hi>Hamcheu.</hi> Here we
have two houses, which upon certain good considerations are reduced
to one; where there is cultivated a copious and good Christianity,
and also much honoured, by reason of the number of people of quality
that are in it,</p>
                     <p>Finally, this Province is famous for many things, but particularly for
three. The first is a lake called <hi>Sihu,</hi> which is one of the rarest in the
world. It is in circuite Thirty <hi>Lis,</hi> which are six miles: it is set about
with excellent Palaces, and these environed by pleasant Mountaines
cloathed with grasse, plants, and trees: the water is alwayes running, for
there comming in a current at one and side, issueing out at the other; it is
so cleere, that it inviteth one to behold it with great delight, the smallest
sand, that lyeth at the bottome, being to be discovered. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64464:16"/>
wayes paved with stone, that do crosse over it, offering passage to
those that travell over it, either upon their occasions or curiositie: there
stand ready small Barkes of a considerable burden which are made for
recreation and banquets; the kitchin is in the steerage, or the forecastle,
and the middle space serveth for a hall. Above higher, there is a place for
the women, covered with lattices, that they might not be seen. These
Barkes are painted and guilded after a curious and various manner, and are
provided in great abundance with all things necessary for the navigation
which is short and free from wracks of water, but not so well from those
of wine; there happening many: as also shipwrackes of estates very often;
there being scarce any in the whole kingdome that hath any thing, that
doth not come to spend in these delights, either part or the whole; and
sometimes more than his whole stock is worth.</p>
                     <p>The second is, the excellency of the silke, as well for the plenty above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
as for the curiositie of the Art, with which a good part of it is
wrought, engrayling it with precious and beautifull workes of gold. This
is only after their manner and gusto; and is not sent out of the kingdome,
but as a singular worke is reserved for the Kings Palaces, who every yeare
buyeth up all that is made of this sort.</p>
                     <p>The third is, the worshipping of their Idols; in which is particularly
to be perceived whence the fabrick of their Temples proceeds, which are
without doubt very famous.</p>
                     <p>The last of these nine Southerly Provinces is <hi>Nankim,</hi> scituated in 32
degrees of latitude, and is one of the best Provinces of the kingdome, and
the perfection of the whole realm. It sendeth abroade its commodities,
or workes of importance, to no part; as if they were unworthy, to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
of its perfection; which is most rare in all sort of varietie, and so
much exceeding all the rest, that every one, to sell his commodities the
better, pretendeth, that they are of <hi>Nankim,</hi> and so passeth them off, at a
greater price.</p>
                     <p>That part which is towards the West, is the most rich, and maketh so
much Cotton-wool, that those of the Country affirme, that there is only
in the towne of <hi>Xanuchi</hi> and the precinct thereof, which is large, 200000
Loomes for this stuffe; so that from that place only the King draweth
150000 crownes yearly.</p>
                     <p>In one house there useth to be many of them for they are narrow, as
the stuffe is. Almost all the women are employed in this work.</p>
                     <p>The Court did reside in this Province for a long time; and even to this
day all the Courts of justice and priviledges thereof are conserved in the
City of <hi>Nankim,</hi> whose right name is <hi>Umthienfu;</hi> and it seemeth to me
to be the best and greatest City of the whole Kingdome, both for the
form of the building, the largenesse of the streets, the manners and deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the people, and for the plentie and excellency of all things.</p>
                     <p>It hath admirable places of recreation, and is so populous through its
confines, that the villages succeed one another, in a manner, from three
miles to three miles; although at this day, by reason it wants the presence
of the King it is, in its selfe lesse populous; neverthelesse in diverse parts
thereof it is yet troublesome to walke the streets for the crowde of people
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64464:16"/>
that one meeteth. Besides, the many Palaces, Temples, Towers, and
Bridges doe render it very considerable. In the wall thereof there are
twelve gates, barr'd with Iron, and guarded with Artillery: a good way
without runneth another wall with no small ruines. The circuit thereof
(for I was desirous to know the measure of it) is two daies journey on
horse-back: That of the inner wall is eighteen miles; both the one and
the other have within them many populations, gardens, and fields which
are tilled, the bread whereof useth to be applied to the use of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery
within the City, to the number of fourty thousand.</p>
                     <p>In one part thereof there is cast up an artificiall Mount, on the top where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there is seen a wooden spheare, not armed, although the circles thereof
are placed at the latitude of the same City, which is 32 degrees; a small
latitude in respect of the great colds, but a very large one, for the great
heate which it suffereth: The spheare is in circumference of a notable big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and is a very compleat piece of work.</p>
                     <p>It hath moreover a Tower divided into seaven stories of singular beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the workemanship thereof, it being full of figures, and wrought like
<hi>Percellane:</hi> an edifice, which might be ranked among the most famous
of ancient <hi>Rome.</hi> The river cometh to kisse the feet of this City, and
sendeth up some armes of it selfe into it. The name of the river is <hi>Yanchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiam,</hi>
that is to say, the Sonne of the sea; nor vainly is it so called, it being
the most aboundant in water, of any that is knowne in the world. There
is also great plenty of fish.</p>
                     <p>We have foure Churches in this Province, the first in <hi>Nankim,</hi> with a
house of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and is of a very ancient, and exercised, Christianity:
having suffered foure persecutions, and come of from each of them with
more vigour. The second, in the Towne of <hi>Xamhai,</hi> with a great number
of beleevers. The third in the City of <hi>Xamkiam.</hi> The fourth in the
Towne of <hi>Kiatini:</hi> beside these Churches there are many Oratories.
And so much shall suffice concerning the nine Southern Provinces,</p>

                     <p>SIx are the Provinces, which are called Northern, and their names are
<hi>Honam, Xemsi, Kiansi, Xantum, Pekim,</hi> and <hi>Leaotum.</hi> The first lyeth in
the latitude of 35 degrees, as centre of the Kingdome, and produceth most
gallant fruits, as well those that are proper to the Countrie, as ours in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
nor is the cheapnesse of them lesse: I bought for a farthing and a
halfe 88 Apricocks; it hath nothing else notable, except a Son of the
Kings called <hi>Fovam,</hi> the last of those which came out of the Palace. He
liveth with so great splendour and authoritie of a King, that to be such, he
only wanteth the name and jurisdiction. In <hi>Caifum,</hi> the Metropolis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
we have had onely for these few yeares, a Church and house, but a
good plenty of Christians.</p>
                     <p>The second is <hi>Xemsi;</hi> it lyeth in 36 degrees, and more, to the West:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64464:17"/>
it is very large, but dry for want of water, as also are the three neighbouring
Provinces: notwithstanding it doth abound in Wheate, Barly and <hi>Maize,</hi>
of Rice they have but little. All winter long they give wheat to their
Beasts; which are many; particularly their sheep, which they sheare three
times a year; once in the Spring, another time in the Summer, a third in the
Autume; but the first time of shearing yeeldeth the best wool.</p>
                     <p>From hence cometh all the wooll, of which are made the felts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things used, either in this Province or elswhere. They make there of
no sort of cloath, not using to spin wool, but only Goats-hair; of which
they weave certain Stuffes for the hanging of their roomes, in so great
perfection that the most ordinary are better than ours, and the Best are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
more precious than silk. They make likewise of Goats-haire a
very fine Felt, which they call <hi>Tum,</hi> and is made use of for garments: But
this is not made of every sort of Goats-hair, but of a very fine haire
which lyeth under the first. They pull it out with great care, and make it
up in certain bals of the bignesse of an ordinary loafe, and then put it out to
be wrought with singular skill.</p>
                     <p>Musk is proper to this Province; and because it is in question, after
what manner this excellent perfume is made; I will give you account of
it according to the most diligent enquiry I have made concerning it. It is
the Navel of an Animal about the bignesse of a small Stagge, whose flesh
is very good meate; and only that part is taken containing that precious
matter: but all those Cods, which are brought hither to us, are not true
and perfect Navells; for the <hi>Chinesses</hi> have learnt to falsifie them, by
stuffing some peices of the skin of that <hi>Animall</hi> with musk, that is vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and mingled, with some other things,</p>
                     <p>Here is also Gold found, but not in Mines (for though there be Mines
both of Gold and Silver, the King doth not suffer them to be opened)
but out of Rivers and Eddies: and although it be found only in smal pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and graines, yet being put together, it amounts to a great quantity,
there being Infinite people both young and old, which go in search
of it.</p>
                     <p>There is <hi>Rubarbe</hi> and <hi>Profumo,</hi> which are not found in any other part;
for that which cometh from <hi>Persia</hi> doth not seem to be naturall, to that
place; for, of as many as have travelled through that countrie, there is
not any that gives an account to have seen there that healthfull plant. It
is something tall, with leaves bigger than Cole-worts: it doth not grow
wilde, as some have imagined, but is Cultivated in gardens with a great
deale of care.</p>
                     <p>In this Province is opened the third Gate, the which, as I sayd above, is
a seate of much Merchandise: for it hath two Cities in the borders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<hi>Gaucheu</hi> and <hi>Sucheu</hi> toward the West, (as <hi>Machao</hi> is in the Province of
<hi>Contone</hi> toward the South) from whence come numerous Caravans of
above a thousand in company, of severall Nations and Provinces, but for
the most part Moores, Thus far came Brother <hi>Benedict-Goes</hi> to seek for the
Kingdom of <hi>Cathaya</hi> (which is no other than <hi>China</hi> it selfe) whose voyage
we will here breefly relate,</p>
                     <p>He departed in lent, the year 1603 for to find out the truth of what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64464:17"/>
was reported of the Kingdome of <hi>Cathaca,</hi> by order of the superiors of
<hi>India,</hi> from the Kingdome of <hi>Mogor</hi> and the royal City of <hi>Laor</hi> in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of an <hi>Armenian</hi> carrying Merchandise, as well to live, as to passe
with the more facility. The whole <hi>Caravan</hi> consisted of 500 Persons
(for the most part Sarasens) and used to go every year from this royall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to another in another Kingdom named <hi>Cascar.</hi> After a months voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
he arrived at a City named <hi>Athu,</hi> of the same province with <hi>Laor:</hi>
thence in two months and a half, to <hi>Passaur:</hi> and after another month
and a half, sometimes travelling, and sometimes resting, he came to the
City of <hi>Ghideli,</hi> where he wanted little to have been slain by theeves.
And finally after 20 dayes more he came to the City of <hi>Cabu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> the most
noble Merchant-towne of all the countries subjected to the <hi>Mogor,</hi> from
hence after some stay, he passed to <hi>Parvám,</hi> the last City of the Kingdom
of <hi>Mogor;</hi> then travelling for 20 daies over very high Mountains he came to
<hi>Calcia,</hi> a countrie of faire-hayred people; and in other 25 dayes to <hi>Chema,</hi>
where he was forced to stay a month by reason of Civill broils; and after
many troubles and dangers of theeves and <hi>Banditti,</hi> and having passed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
countries of the Kings of <hi>Samarhan,</hi> they came into the country of <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
and at length he entred into the Metropolitan City of the Kingdom of
<hi>Cascár,</hi> called <hi>Tanghesár,</hi> in the month of November, in the same year.</p>
                     <p>At this City, which is, a noble seate of Merchandise for those King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
the Caravan of Merchants which come from <hi>Cabull,</hi> ended their
voyage, and a new <hi>Caravan</hi> setteth forth from thence to go to <hi>China.</hi> But
our Brother remained here (first) many months, expecting the time of
their departure, and having in the meane time made himselfe known to
the King of the country, he obtained letters of favour and recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to all places whither he should go.</p>
                     <p>The time therefore being come, he departed with ten horses, for to

year following; and having travelled 25 dayes with a great deale of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
over stones and sand, he came to the City of <hi>Aesu,</hi> part of the
Kingdom of <hi>Cascár:</hi> after having passed a desart, called <hi>Caracathai,</hi> that is,
Black-earth; and gone through many Cities, at length he came to a City
called <hi>Cialis</hi> in the same Kingdom of <hi>Cascár.</hi> Here whilest he fitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for his journey, there arrived Merchants which came from <hi>China,</hi>
of whom Brother <hi>Benedict</hi> learned some tydings of the City of <hi>Pekim,</hi>
and of our Fathers, which had been there seen by these Sarasen Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.
So that he was satisfied, that <hi>Cathaya</hi> was nothing else but <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>
and the royall City, named by the <hi>Sarasens Gambalú,</hi> was <hi>Pekim.</hi>
From this City of <hi>Cialis, Benedict</hi> departing with a few in company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
came in twenty dayes to <hi>Pucian,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Turphan, Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Camul</hi> the last City of the Kingdome of <hi>Cialis.</hi> From <hi>Camul</hi> after nine
dayes journey, they came to the wall of <hi>China,</hi> at a placc called <hi>Chiacuon:</hi>
and so had entrance into <hi>China,</hi> which he sought under the name of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaya.</hi>
Excepting therefore eleven dayes journey, which was through a
country peopled by Tartars, all the rest of his voyage was through coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
inhabited by Moors, or <hi>Mahumetans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:64464:18"/>Now to return to our story: with these <hi>Caravans</hi> come Embassadours,
which the Princes of the Moors send to the King of <hi>China,</hi> making every
three yeares a small Embassie, in respect both of the Persons and the
presents; and every five years a great one. The most part of the <hi>Caravan</hi>
remaine in the two above-named Cities; (which are upon the <hi>Frontiers</hi>)
trafficking there with their Merchandise, The others go to comply with
their charge, and to offer the present in the name of five Kings, which are
the Kings of <hi>Rume, Arabia, Camul, Eamarcan, Tursan;</hi> The first four know
nothing of this Embassy: the fifth, although he know of it, doth not make
the present, nor send the Embassy; but hath only this advantage, that he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the Embassadors. The present is made by the Merchants among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs,
&amp; these coming to the Vice-roy of those parts, the King hath advice
given him of their arrival by a paper, called a <hi>memoriall</hi> or <hi>petition:</hi> as soone
as they have leave from the Court, and that their names are inrolled, there
depart 40. or 50. of them, besides many more added to them; who, to
have leave to enter into the kingdome to trade, &amp; to eate at the Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses,
give the captaine a Bribe of about a hundred or six-score crownes
a man. There goeth a long with them a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who entertaineth
them of freecost, while they travell: But if they make any stay (as they
did in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the province, for more than three monthes space)
the Kings expense ceaseth, but not the benefit of their traffique, for all
that while they follow their Merchandise.</p>
                     <p>The Merchandise which they bring, are Salt-<hi>Armoniak,</hi> fine Azure, fine
linnen, carpets, called Raisins, knives, and other small things. The best and
greatest Commoditie is a certain stone, called <hi>Yaca,</hi> which they bring from
the Kingdom of <hi>Yauken;</hi> the worst is of a whitish colour, the finest is green,
it hath been of great price formerly in <hi>China,</hi> and is still of good value.
They make thereof diverse sorts of Jewels for the ornament of the head,
and it is much used in the palaces: the girdle, which the King giveth to the
<hi>Colai</hi> is embrodered with the finest sort therof; which no other is allowed
to use in this ornament. That which they carry back in exchange of their
commodities is <hi>Porcellane, Rubies,</hi> Musk, raw-silk, silk-stuffes, diverse
other rarities and medicinall drugges, as <hi>Rubarb;</hi> And this I do imagine
is the same which is transported from <hi>Persia</hi> to these parts.</p>
                     <p>The Embassadours being arrived, they offer their present, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
of a thousand <hi>Arrabas</hi> of this precious stone (whereof we have
spoken) which maketh 1333. Italian pounds, whereof 300. pounds are of
the finest sort, 340. horses, which are to be left upon the frontier, 300. small
poynted Diamonds; twelve <hi>Cattes</hi> of fine Azure, which is about 100. Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
pounds; 600. knives, &amp; as many files. The last present seeming to me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
to be presented to a King, Ienquird what use the King made of them,
but I could not meet any one was able to inform: only a Captain told me,
that it was a very ancient thing for that present to be composed of such
things, with so much infallibility they durst not make any alteration.
Of the rest of the commodities which they bring, if the King desireth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, he sendeth to see and buy it. At their return the King rewardeth
them with two pieces of cloth of gold for each horse; 30. pieces of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
silk, 30. pound of <hi>Chá,</hi> ten of Musk, 50. of a medicine called <hi>Tienyo,</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64464:18"/>
and as many of Silver. These <hi>Saracens</hi> told me, that the present, which
they gave the King, was not in their country worth above 7000 Crownes,
but what was given them by the King for their Embassie and voyage,
was noe lesse worth then 50000 Crownes: a pretty good gayne, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
from those Princes.</p>
                     <p>From this Province goeth another Caravan for the powerful Kingdom
of <hi>Tibet;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">See a larger dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the ordering of this leafe, and of the many vertues of the drink in the voyage and missions of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanderd <hi>Rhodes</hi> (printed at Paris 1653. 1 part. 13 cap. its called also Tay.</note> which carryeth diverse things; in particular, Silk-stuffs, <hi>Porsellane</hi>
and <hi>Chá. Chá</hi> is a leafe of a tree, about the bignesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Mirtle;</hi> in other
Provinces, of the hearbe <hi>Basil;</hi> and in others, of the small <hi>Pomgranat.</hi>
They drie it over the fire in iron-sives, where it hardens and sticketh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
There is of many sorts of it, as well because the plant is various, as
also that the upper leaves do exceed the other in finenesse; a property al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of all plants. There is of it, from a Crown a pound to four far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
according to the quality of it, there being so many differences
thereof. It being thus dryed and cast into warme water, it giveth it a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
smell and tast, at the first unpleasing, but custome makes it more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable;
Tis much used in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Giappone,</hi> for it serveth not only
for ordinary drink in stead of water; but also for entertainment to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
when they visit them, as wine doth in the Northern parts; it being
throughout all those kingdoms esteemed a wretched niggardlinesse to
give only good words to those that come to their house, although they
be strangers: at least they must have <hi>Chá;</hi> and if the visit be any thing
long, there must be added some fruit or sweet-meates: sometimes they
lay the cloath for this, and when not, they set it in two dishes upon a little
square table. Many vertues are related of this leaf: certain it is, that it is
very wholesome; and that, neither in <hi>China</hi> nor <hi>Giappone,</hi> there is any
troubled with the stone; nor is so much as the name of this disease known:
from whence may be inferred, how great a preservative against this evill
the use of this drink is: it is also certain, that it powerfully delivereth
from the oppression of sleep, whosoever desireth to watch, either for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
or pleasure; for by suppressing the fumes it easeth the head without
any inconvenience: and finally it is a known and admirable help for stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.
For the rest I have not so great an assurance of it that I dare affirm it.</p>
                     <p>There is found also in this Province a most evident signe of the ancient
Christianitie, which hath been there, as we shall relate in its order.</p>
                     <p>In the great Metropolis thereof we have a Church and a house, with a
well founded and fruitfull Christianity; by whom also many particular
Oratories are frequented.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Riansi</hi> is the third of these six Northern Provinces, which we are now
discoursing of: It lyeth in the Latitude of thirty eight degrees; it hath
many mountaines, which makes their Harvest but poore: there is little
wheate, lesse Rice, but most Maiz: it is so aboundant in grapes, that it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the whole Kingdome with Raisins, and might furnish, at least it
selfe, with wine; as it succeeds in a Residence, which we have there,
where we make now only enough for to serve the <hi>Masses,</hi> but send also
sufficient to the next Residencies. It hath wells of fire for the use of their
houses as we have of water in <hi>Europe,</hi> they seeme to be Mines of sulphur
set on fire; so that opening a little the mouth of the well, which must not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64464:19"/>
be very large, it sendeth forth so great a heade, that they rost and boyle
therewith whatsoever meate they desire. Their ordinary fewell, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in all the confines thereof, Stone-coale, not small ones, such as are
found in some of our Countries of <hi>Europe;</hi> but of a very considerable big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
There are Mines very fruitfull of this matter, which burneth with
a great deale of ease. In some parts, as <hi>Pekim</hi> and <hi>Honam</hi> they lay it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in such manner, that the fire lasteth day and night; They make use
of Bellowes to kindle it.</p>
                     <p>We have a house and a Church in the City of <hi>Kiamcheu,</hi> another in
that of <hi>Phucheu;</hi> which are visited at their set times; both the one and the
other have a good and numerous Christianity, and among them, many of
the Nobility. There are not wanting Oratories, (as in other Cities,) by
which the scarsity of Churches is supplied.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Province which is <hi>Xantun,</hi> in the Latitude of 23. degrees,
lying betwixt <hi>Nankim</hi> and <hi>Pekim,</hi> is very poore; it suffereth many times a
loathsome and malignant Infestation by <hi>Grillo's</hi> or field-Crickets, and by
consequence, the terrible horrour of famine.</p>
                     <p>In the yeare 1616 a dogge bought to be eaten, was worth more than a
young man sold for a slave; it produceth store of Cattell, and of our fruits;
great peares, many and good. There groweth here in great number and
varietie a fruit, which seemed to some of us to be a peare of a good kind,
in so great aboundance, that filling the Kingdom, they overflow even to
<hi>Macao</hi> although it be a great way off; and that there are three large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
betwixt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pekim</hi> is the fift Province, scituated in the Latitude of fourty degrees;
it enjoyeth the priviledge of having the Court in a City of the same name.
Though the proper name of it be <hi>Xunthienfu:</hi> by the <hi>Sarances</hi> called,
<hi>Lambalud.</hi> This good fortune befell it, (for so I may call it) at the death
of <hi>Humvù,</hi> when a nephew of his, named <hi>Vunlo,</hi> who dwelt in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and was very potent, usurped by violence the crowne against the
right heire: And so confiding more in them, with whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
lived, as also to be the better able to make resistance against the
<hi>Tartars</hi> which border upon him, he removed the Court from <hi>Nankim</hi>
and planted it here. The people are lesse ingenious, as commonly all Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
people are, but more apt for labour and warre.</p>
                     <p>The soyle is very drie, and favourable for health, but barren of fruits
for the common sustenance: But this want is supplyed by that generall
prerogative of Courts which draw all to them, and overcome in this the
proper nature of the place. It hath Maiz, Wheate, and little Rice, only
for the use of the people of the Palace, which is very numerous, the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darines</hi>
and Souldiers being many thousands. The King keepeth in those
rivers a thousand vessels, flat-bottom'd by reason of the shallownesse of
the water, which only serve for the bringing of victualls to Court; which
they lade in the South: And in <hi>Nankim</hi> there is sowen a certaine Rice for
the King in particular, of such a quality, that being sodde in water, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other addition it maketh a very savoury dish.</p>
                     <p>The City is not so big as <hi>Nankim,</hi> but in that presse of people much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
it; in a word, it is like the Court of so powerfull a Prince. The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64464:19"/>
walls are broad enough for twelve horses to go a breast; They are guarded
night and day, as well in time of peace, as if there were warre. At every
gate they keep a continuall watch, which is the profit of the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi>
which the Queen alloweth them for their wages; and they make good
store of crownes of this exercise: For all those which enter, and bring any
thing with them, pay toll; and those of <hi>Cantone</hi> are used with most rigour,
just like <hi>Spanyards</hi> in a french Inne: I know not the reason of this, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a certaine indignation, which they have against them.</p>
                     <p>The Magistrates of this Court are quite contrary to those of other
crownes and Commonwealths of the world, and are therefore a patterne
of that uprightnesse, which ought to be found in all: I meane, concerning
the pompe and equipage of their persons, which is very moderate. They
are not allowed to be carried in a Sedan, or Chaire, unlesse it be some few
of more particular dignity: The greatest part ride on horse-back, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are ill horsemen, their horses are guided by two servants, that
go by them, one on each side the horse, least their master should fall.</p>
                     <p>Each Judge of a Village, without the precincts of the Court, use more
state, than the most eminent Ministers in the Court: They walke in the
streets with their faces cover'd, as well by reason of the dust, which is
very much, as also for convenience, and to avoid both expence and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
with the <hi>Mandarinesse;</hi> for not being knowne, they dissemble, as
if they saw them not, and make no stay; to verify that <hi>Axiome,</hi> that where
one is least knowne, there is more pleasure and convenience to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
                     <p>The cold, which this Countrie suffereth, is much greater than could
be expected from the Latitude of 40. degrees. The rivers and lakes are so
hard frozen over, that they drive Carts over them without any danger;
they make use of stoves, that are more convenient than ours, and wast not
so much fewell, conveighing the heate by pipes laid under ground; and
so within doores enjoy a pleasant spring in the heart of winter. The same
heate supplieth also the absence of the sun, and by meanes thereof the trees
are clothed with leaves and flowers before their time.</p>
                     <p>In the Court we have a faire Church, built after the fashion of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and a house wherein reside 4 fathers by licence from the King, and are in
much esteeme with all the Magistrates.</p>
                     <p>Besides the Churches in all the places we have already spoken of, (the
greater part whereof are large Cities,) there are also many other habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Christians, which have their Oratories, which are visited by us at
set times, Catechizing and Baptizing the new Christians, conferring and
administring the Holy Sacraments to the others.</p>
                     <p>The sixt and last Province is <hi>Leaotùm</hi> the Northern bound of that
Kingdome; it is famous for a roote which it produceth of so high esteeme,
that at my departure from thence it was sold for twice the weight in sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
It is so excellent a medicine, that if those which are in health doe
take it, it augments their strength and vigour, and if it be given to a sick
person it doth marvellously comfort and warme him: it is called <hi>Ginsem.</hi>
This Province being the frontire next Tartarium, is much wasted, and is
in part possessed by the <hi>Tartors:</hi> here is seen that famous wall so much
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64464:20"/>
talked off, which runneth nine hundred miles in length, with more repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
than effect: for besides that its owne greatnesse and extant is
enough to make it ruinous, the enemy hath now reduced it to a miserable
condition.</p>

                     <p>THe people of <hi>China</hi> are, white, like us in <hi>Europe;</hi> although in the
Province of <hi>Cantone,</hi> lying something within the Tropick they are
of something a browner colour, and particularly in the Islands that lie
neere the maine land. And because those which come hither are only
such as are borderers upon <hi>Macao</hi> (the Centre of those Islands) some have
been perswaded that there were not in all that Kingdome any people very
white: but it is certaine, that excepting the confines of <hi>Cantone,</hi> where
they are something brown, the rest are all white; not unlike to the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the people of <hi>Europe;</hi> and by how much the more Northward
one goeth, by so much the more (as is usually seen) is the whitenesse the
greater.</p>
                     <p>They suffer the haire of their heads to grow as long as it will, both men
and women. They are generally all black-haired; hence cometh that
name, by which this Kingdome is called among other Nations the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the black-hair'd people: they have also black eyes, which are
very little, little noses, and neither large, nor high ones, as among us;
which forme they like not, accounting it a deformity. They have but
little beard for the most part, nor doe they care to have much, although
some of them have so. They delight to have it black, which is the most
ordinary colour; although some few have red beards; which although it
be not abhorred by all as among the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> yet it is not esteemed or
liked among them by any. They clippe not their beard, letting it grow
according to nature. They will be more troubled to loose one haire of
their head, then all the haire of their face: They doe also, in neatnesse and
curiousnesse about their haire, exceed all other Nations. They have for
this purpose many Barbers, of whom it may properly be said, that they
usurp that name; it being derived from the beard, which they never

head.</p>
                     <p>The young children are better proportioned, and have a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Simmetry of beauty than the rest: and this more particularly in the
Southern Provinces. But some places have the advantage in this above
others; as in the Province of <hi>Nankim,</hi> the City of <hi>Nancheu,</hi> where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are esteemed to have the preheminence of all others in beauty; as
formerly in <hi>Portugall,</hi> those of the Towne of <hi>Guimaranes,</hi> from hence the
rich men and the Magistrates provide themselves with Concubines: and so
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64464:20"/>
this gift of nature cometh to be of greater esteeme for their sakes, who are
the great men of the world. As their age beginneth to decline, from 25 to
30 yeares old, they loose not only much of the livelinesse of their colour,
but also of the Simmetry and proportion of their shape: so that ordinarily
they become ill-favoured. The disposition of their body is good; their
strength vigorous; and they are great pains-takers: hence it cometh, that
their land, which is very good, is by art brought to be much more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
and if there be any which is not good, although it be never so little
(there being not a foot of ground, which is unemployed) by force of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
they bring it at length to be fruitfull.</p>
                     <p>As I passed by <hi>Honum,</hi> I saw one ploughing with a plough of 3 Irons,
or plough-sheares, so that at one bout he made 3 furrowes: and because
the ground was good for that seed, which we call here <hi>Feazols</hi> or Kidny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beanes;
this seed was put as it were, in a bushel, or square dish fastened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the upper part of the plough, in such manner, that with the motion
thereof the Beanes were gently scattered upon the earth as corne falleth
upon the Milstone, at the mooving of the Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hopper; so at the same
time the land is plowed &amp; sown with hopes of a future crop. Wheat, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Maiz they sow as we do; &amp; it is very ordinary for one that driveth
a beast laden, to carry a load himself, that none might want employment.</p>
                     <p>They are watchfull to make their advantage of every thing, not
suffering any thing to be lost, how unprofitable soever it seemeth: you
may meet often upon a river many vessels of considerable burthen; laden
only with weeks for lamps, made of the pith of rushes, taken out with a
great facility and dexteritie; others, which carry nothing else but paper
(give me leave to relate it, because it is a notable argument of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and application, which they make in the use of all things) for clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
in their houses of office. This is sold in the streets as well as in
shops, and may in no manner have any thing written upon it; for if it
have any letters upon it, it is among them accounted sacriledge to imploy
it to that use. But as the number of the people is so great, there are not
wanting also among them idle persons and vagabonds, a common and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remediable
plague,</p>
                     <p>They are naturally inclined to be Merchants, and it is incredible, the
Traffick which they make, not only from one Province to another, with
very great profit (so that they which transport <hi>Porsellane</hi> within their own
Kingdom, although they sell it but from one Province to another, gaine
thirty <hi>per Cent.</hi> twice a year) but even in the same City: For almost what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is found in the shopps, is sold in the streets in a lesser quantity; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
in this trade even to little children, as far as they are able, as sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
fruit, herbs, wash-bals, and such like things.</p>
                     <p>The rich Merchants are of good credit, and very punctuall, (as the
<hi>Portughesses</hi> have had experience for many yeares together;) but their way
of bargaining is fuller of craft, and subtilty, than is to be found any
where else in the world: for whereas strangers are not allowed to enter
into the Kingdom, they are all necessitated to treat with the <hi>Chinesses</hi>
in this manner. First they agree about the quality of the commodity,
which each desireth whether it be gold, Silk, or <hi>Porcellane,</hi> or any thing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64464:21"/>
else; when they are agreed of the price, presently the <hi>Portughese</hi> consig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to him a summe of mony, as of 15. or 20. thousand, (or more)
Crownes. Then the <hi>Chinesse</hi> goeth with this money to such parts of the
Kingdome where the commoditie may be had, which the other desireth,
and returneth with it to <hi>Cantone,</hi> where the <hi>Portughese</hi> stayeth expecting
him. This manner of merchandising was practised for many yeares with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any fraud; but a little while since there hath not been wanting some
who have used deceit therein. And at this day the credit thereof is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished;
as I beleeve, through the fault of both Nations.</p>
                     <p>Neverthelesse, the nature of the people and inclination of the whole
nation, as well in those who sell, as those who buy, is much inclined to
guile and deceit, which they put in execution with admirable subtletie.
They will take the flesh from off the breast of a partridge, and fill up the
hollow place with some other thing, and stitch up the cut, whence it was
taken out, and all with so much mastery and skill, that if the buyer be not
an <hi>Argus,</hi> (and if he were, he shall finde no remedy) in stead of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,
he shall buy nothing but feathers and bones. Amongst true Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of Bacon they will foist in others made of wood, but so like, that
they will easily deceive the sight for good ones. It is an ordinary thing to
fat up an old horse, and sell him for a young one; and what is more, to
paint him over with beautifull spots, so well done, as if they were naturall,
choosing for the time of sale, the doubtfull light of the day towards the
dusk of the evening, that the deceit may be the hardlier discovered:
This cheate was put upon one in <hi>Macao,</hi> who notwithstanding was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
buyer, and of good judgement.</p>
                     <p>The bewitching art of extracting the elements and principles from
barren stones and hardest mineralls, which is spread through all parts of
the universe, hath gain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d many practitioners in <hi>China;</hi> They are passionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
addicted to the art of <hi>Alchimy,</hi> with this opinion, that he that hath the
art of making silver, is in the way to find the receit of prolonging life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
extream old age. And how long will men give themselves over to
this fond perswasion, deceived with a vaine hope of obtaining these two
things, so much desired, so uncertaine? Many take great paines in this art,
although they lose much and gaine little; contrary to that which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
in all other trades, which is, to gaine much out of a little. Finally, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these men deceive themselves, or find themselves deceived by the
professours of this science, who are often uncertaine and varying in their
<hi>Maximes,</hi> which ought to be reall and constant; so that the event is alwaies
dangerous and uncertaine. Many there are, which are followers of it,
hoping to make gaine by their deceit, because they dare not rely upon the
certainty of their art.</p>
                     <p>There was one of these, which in <hi>Pekim</hi> offered himselfe to a Magistrate,
promising him great matters from his art. Covetous persons are ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
credulous. He furnisht him with materialls to make his operation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which the other secretly conveyed a piece of silver, which he
privily carryed about him to that intent, the ignorant Magistrate was well
pleased with the product of it, he seeming to him a true sonne of art. Then
the work-man faining to have great occasion to goe to another place,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64464:21"/>
desired leave of him for some dayes, which the Magistrate with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe
consented to, because his covetous desire, being inflamed by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
could not brooke a long absence; But the <hi>Alcyhmyst,</hi> (that used
to fish in the silver seas of <hi>Hydropicall</hi> covetousnesse with those deceitfull
nets, with which he long entertained their hopes, but brought them in
no profit) was absent three whole yeares: at the end of which being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Pekim,</hi> he maketh, as if he knew not the house of this his friend,
though he often passed by the doore; but being discovered by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
he calls him in; who still persisteth in his dissimulation of not
knowing him. The Magistrate questions him concerning the art, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he had made him an experiment: The other confessed, that he knew
the art, but did not remember to have practised it in that place; alledging
for his excuse, that as he had done it in many places, so he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them all. But without much intreatie, promised to doe it againe,
to that intent the Magistrate giveth him 500. crownes to furnish him with
a sufficient store of materialls: Then the <hi>Alchymyst,</hi> without asking leave
as before, conveyeth himselfe away, and never appeareth more. But
for all these experiences there are still enough, which doe hunt after this
art.</p>
                     <p>But returning to our <hi>Chinesses;</hi> they are Affable, courteous, and of good
conversation: and therefore in this particular our men are not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
which dwell only in <hi>Macao</hi> and <hi>Cantone,</hi> because they are there, as
it were, in a continuall warr, by reason of the daily contracts and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which are betwixt the servants of the <hi>Portugesses</hi> and <hi>Chinesses;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
buying and selling produceth frequent disgusts; and if those of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cao</hi>
do beare with them, because they cannot help it, it is alwayes with
hope to be paid with interest from those of <hi>Cantone,</hi> when they come
thither by occasion of the faires: and so there cannot be a friendly and
just traffick betwixt them, but they do treat one another almost like ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>But in the other Provinces and innermost parts of the Kingdom, as we
have said, they converse with us with so much respect and <hi>decorum,</hi> that
in all meetings with them they give us the first place, upon no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
but that we are strangers, and as they call us <hi>Guests</hi> of a remote <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</hi>
In cases of necessity, (which we have many times proved) they
will not faile to lend us what we aske, although it be more worth than the
pawnes we give them; and that without interest.</p>
                     <p>I am sure there cannot be a worser sort of people, than is found in their
prisons, for thither the dregs of the whole Common-wealth are drained,
neverthelesse, we have found courtesie at the hands of those wretches,
who in such places use to be very inhumane. Vpon occasion of the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
which we suffered in the year 1616. our fathers found in those pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
much respect and correspondence, and when the Officers of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for feare of the Tyrant, did bind them and use them harshly: it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
with a great resentment of the prisoners; who not enduring to see
them streightned with manacles upon their wrists, did make them wider
for them by burning them (their manacles being made of wood) with
hot irons.

prisons, the prisoners consulted among themselves how to shew them
some courtesie: and collecting what they were able, they entertained
them with a banquet, which was more acceptable to the fathers, to see
so much Humanity and kindenesse towards strangers among Pagans,
which were kept in that place, for the chastisement of their crimes and
ill manners, than for the good treatment they received. Thus much will
sufficiently demonstrate the naturall courtesie and civility of this Nation.</p>
                     <p>Among them, all acts of cruelty are much abhorred; wherefore among
their punishments there is not used that ordinary inhumanitie and severity,
which is among us, as Quartering; Tearing with pincers; dragging with
horses; and racking. He that deserveth death, is either beheaded, or
strangled.</p>
                     <p>In the yeare 1614. in the City of <hi>Nankim,</hi> an ordinary fellow with more
than ordinary insolence did aspire to the <hi>Empire.</hi> He had already listed
much people, and distributed offices among them, giving order, to cut off
the heads of all the <hi>Mandarines</hi> in one day appointed for their <hi>Rendezvous.</hi>
When the conspiracy was discovered by a male-content, that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>il sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with his allotment, there was, upon this occasion, imprison'd almost
an infinite company of people, which were discover'd by the Tyrants own
book, wherein he kept a list of the conspiratours: the king having notice
of it, gave speedy order, that no more should be imprisoned: by a second or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
he commandeth, that only thirty of the most guilty should remaine in
prison for the space of 30. daies with their heads in the stocks, and that at
the end of 30. daies, whosoever of them remained alive should not be put
to death. (There escaped only two of them;) which is strange, that for
so enormous a wickednesse, there was appointed no greater punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>When many are condemned to die, they are kept in prison till the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitour
of the Province calleth them before him; and perusing the list of
them he appointeth 5, 6. or 7. of them to be executed: if he exceedeth
this number, they give him the name of <hi>Cruell:</hi> The rest are sent back to
prison.</p>
                     <p>They are inclined to vertue; I doe not say they are exempt from vices,
proper to all Pagans, and indeed to all Mortalls; But that they esteeme
those, which make profession of vertue; and particularly of some vertues,
which are dispised by other <hi>Gentiles;</hi> as, Humility, Virginity, Chastity;
and this last is in such esteeme, that if a maiden, or young widdow, lead a
single life with that <hi>Caution</hi> and other vertues requisite to it, they are wont
to erect <hi>Trium-phall Arches</hi> to them, and celebrate their memorie with
publick and magnificent prayses and <hi>panegyricks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their manner of <hi>entertainment</hi> and <hi>complements</hi> are so <hi>Ceremonious,</hi>
that there seemes to be no end of them; and are more proper for <hi>divine
worship,</hi> than humane conversation. This is to be understood of their
visites, and their meetings and incounters, where respect is to
be shewen: for amongst kindred and friends they treat one another
more familiarly. They are so composed in their grab, and wary
in their words, that nothing can cause an open difference betwixt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64464:24"/>
persons of <hi>quality</hi> one against the other, although both of them may
bear a secret spleen and grudging. Hence it is, that capitall enemies may
be seen together at <hi>Banquets,</hi> or other publick meetings without the least
shew of <hi>enmity,</hi> dissembling it dexterously and couragiously under the
<hi>punctilioes</hi> of civility and honour.</p>
                     <p>They magnifie very freely and readily whatsoever is vertuous in the
Actions of their neighbours, couragiously beating down that emulation,
which in almost all other nations suffereth none to be pleased with any
but themselves. When they see any thing which cometh from <hi>Europe,</hi>
although there be in it little art or ingenuity, it is by them commended
with singular applause; and many times with this expression, O, say they,
<hi>These people are not like to us, dul and un-ingenious.</hi> And sometimes of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
made in their own Kingdom, with which by reason of the vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof, they are unacquainted, they will say, that they were not
made there, but brought from <hi>Europe.</hi> A modesty indeed worthy to be
envyed; and so much the more because it is seen in a people that exceed
many others in their abilities, to the shame of those Nations, which have
no eyes to see, but such as are infected with the disparagement of what
they behold.</p>
                     <p>They are not lesse ingenious <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> than the <hi>Manufactures,</hi> which
come from thence, shew them to be, although all which come, are not
made by the best Masters.</p>
                     <p>They are very excellent in workes of <hi>Ivory, Ebony</hi> and <hi>Amber,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Eare-Jewels, pendants, and gallantries of Gold and Silver, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of women. They make chaines to admiration. There was one
brought from thence to <hi>Goa,</hi> which consisting of 300 links, weighed not
3 ounces of gold, and the work was so fine and small, that the links were
hardly to be discerned. They have altogether relinquisht to <hi>Europe</hi> to
be served in plate, there being scarce found among them a vessel of Silver
of a considerable bignesse, no not in the <hi>Emperors palace;</hi> being content to
eat in <hi>Porcellane,</hi> which is the only vessel in the world for neate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
cleanlinesse. There Gold-thread is of lesse weight and worth
than ours; they have a way of twisting of it about paper, which maketh
it seem, as if it were right and massie and is an admirable Artifice.</p>
                     <p>The workmanship of <hi>Europe,</hi> which they most admired, were our
clocks; but now they make of them such as are set upon tables, very good
ones, and will be able to do the like in small ones, if the price of them
there did equall ours. Although they make some things, whose price
would be excessive if we should cause them to be made here, Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in the generall we do much exceed them in <hi>manufactures</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick</hi>
Arts, except it be in that same <hi>Charam,</hi> which is indeed a singular
Artifice.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be denyed, but that they are a people of an admirable Acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
so that that may be worthily appropriated to them, that <hi>Aristotle</hi>
so freely bestoweth upon all the people of <hi>Asia;</hi> saying, that <hi>Asia</hi> exceeded
<hi>Europe</hi> in ingenuity; but was exceeded by <hi>Europe</hi> in valour; this beeing a
thing so approved to us by experience.</p>
                     <p>There are many, which even to this day do call the <hi>Chinesses, Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:64464:25"/>
as if they spake of the <hi>Negroes</hi> of <hi>Guynea,</hi> or the <hi>Tapuyi</hi> of <hi>Brasile.</hi> I have
blusht to hear some stile them so, having been taught the contrary by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years travels among them. Although the fame and manufactures of
<hi>China</hi> are sufficient to teach it us; it beeing now many years that we have
heard the one; and seen the other. Tis a great shame truly: but although
in this relation there are many things, which might satisfie us concerning
the subtelty of their wit, yet I wil give you one example in this following
case.</p>
                     <p>A certain <hi>Chaquen,</hi> (that is, a visitour of a Province, one of the most
important <hi>Employments</hi> of the Kingdom) receiving of his visits, after a few
daies were over, shut up his gates, and refused to admit any further their
businesse or visits; pretending for his excuse, that he was sick; This acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
being divulged; a certain <hi>Mandarine,</hi> a friend of his, began to be
much troubled at it; and with much ado obtained leave to speak with him.
When he was admitted, he gave him notice of the discontent, that was in
the City, by reason that businesses were not dispatched: the other put him
off with the same excuse of his sicknesse: I see no signes of it, replied his
friend; but if your <hi>Lordship</hi> will be pleased to tell me the true cause, I will
serve you in it, to my utmost power, conformable to that affection I bear
you in my heart: know then, replied the <hi>Visitour,</hi> They have stollen the
Kings seale out of the Cabinet where it used to be kept, leaving it locked,
as if it had not been touched; so that if I would give audience, I have not
where withall to seale dispatches. If I should discover my negligence
in the losse of the seale I shall loose, you know, both my <hi>Government</hi> and
my life; so that I know not what to do, unlesse it be to stand in suspence,
as I do, the which is but little avail to me, being more sensible than the
people themselves, of this delay of justice. Well perceived the <hi>Mandarine</hi>
how terrible the occasion of his retirement was; but presently making use
of the quickness of his wit, asked him if he had never an enemy in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
he answered him, yes; and that it was the chief Officer of that City, that
is the <hi>Chifu</hi> or governour, which of a long time had borne a concealed
malice against him. Away then, quoth the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> in great hast, let
your <hi>Lordship</hi> command that all your goods be removed to the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
part of the palace, and let them set fire on the empty part, and call
out for help to quench the fire: to which the governour must of necessity
repair with the first, it being one of the principall duties of his
office. As soon as you see him among the people, call out to him aloud,
and consigne to him the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> thus shut as it is; that it may be secured
in his possession from the danger of the fire: for if it be he which hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the seale to be stollen, he will put it in his place again, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores
you the cabinet; if it be not he, your Lordship shall lay the fault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him for having so ill kept it; and your Lordship shall not only be freed
from this danger, but also revenged of your enemie. The visitour follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
his councel, and it succeeded so well, that the next morning, after the
night this fire was, the governour brought him the seale in the cabinet;
both of them concealing each others fault, equally complying for the
conservation of both. Now if after this example the <hi>Chinesses</hi> must passe
for <hi>Barbarians</hi> as those would have it, who have forced me to relate this
<pb facs="tcp:64464:25"/>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64464:26"/>
story, it must be upon the same account, on which others have said as

                     <head type="sub">Of the manner of their habit.</head>
                     <p>THe materials, of which they make severall sorts of stuffs and cloaths
for the service of their persons, as cloathing, Beds, and other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
of their houses, are wooll, convase, (for they have no other sort of
linnen as I have formerly hinted) silk and cotton: of all which they have
great abundance. Two hundred years before Christ they used garments
with short sleeves, such as the <hi>Giapponeses</hi> use at this day; who are descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of them, and still conserve this ancient habit. This manner of garment
continued here, untill the raign of <hi>Hoan:</hi> in the time of this King, who is
much renowned amongst them, (about 400 years after Christ,) that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
was altered, as well in the people, as the Officers, to that fashion which
is worn at this day: and is the very same throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
although it consist of so many and so large Provinces: nor can it be
altered (no more than any other notable custome among them) without
the Kings particular Order. For these people, which we call <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
have very well understood, that the changing of fashions and customes
in a Nation for those of strange Countries, is as it were, a presage that that
Country will at length be brought into subjection to that other, of whose
fashions and manners they are so enamoured: and we might for proofe
hereof, (if there were occasion) name some particular Countries among
us.</p>
                     <p>These fashioned garments have been conserved for so many yeares;
and reach from the neck to the feet, being all open before; These are for
their under garments, and are made for to sit closer to their bodies. Their
upper garments are large and wider in compasse. And because they use
no buttons, they lap them before, one side over another, as our <hi>Clergie</hi> men
doe their <hi>Cassocks.</hi> Their sleeves are very wide, and the whole garment
without any trimming. A piece of white Taffat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e of the length of ones
hand serveth them for a band; when it is foule, they take it off, and put on
another. This is only to be understood of the <hi>Literati,</hi> or learned men,
and the people of quality; for the common sort of people are not suffered
to weare it.</p>
                     <p>The young men weare indifferently all sorts of colours; but the <hi>Ancient</hi>
men do weare alwaies the most modest. The common people for the
most part are cloathed in black; as all sorts of servants, who are bound
not to alter that colour.</p>
                     <p>Those who are <hi>Governours,</hi> or have <hi>Governed,</hi> upon occasion of <hi>Feasts,</hi>
do weare garments of the finest red. The rich men change their garments
at all the 4 seasons of the year; and the inferiour sort, (although poore)
twice a year, at winter and summer: and upon this occasion many pawn
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64464:27"/>
that garment, which they weare in one season to furnish themselves with a
garment for the next.</p>
                     <p>Because their haire is their chiefe gallantrie, we will speak here a word
or two concerning it. Their youth, till seventeen years of age, leave the
shortest part of their haire hanging loose, the other they combe back to the
top of their head; where they tie it up in a knot. After that, age they
weare a net of horse-haire, which is like unto our Cawles, under which
they gather up all their haire, not suffering one haire to hang out: on the
top of this they all weare caps; the <hi>Literati</hi> square caps, the rest of the
people, round: they are all made of silk, or else of hors-haire, which by
reason of the workmanship come often to be more costly than the other.
They are alwaies to be black, unlesse it be in the win<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er, when they weare
them of felt, &amp; are always gray, or else of the naturall colour of the wooll.
At the first time any one putteth on this Cawle, it is done with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
solemnitie, as we were wont anciently, at the first putting on of the
cloake or sword. For shoes, they know no other materialls, but silk of all
sorts and colours, for the rich; and for the poore, cotton: they are differing
from ours in shape, and in the cost, which is bestowed upon them, having
many little works wrought on them with the needle. Skins are used only
for bootes, which are rarely seen there. The richer and better sort of the
people weare hose of <hi>Damaske</hi> or <hi>Sattin,</hi> or any sort of white silk; the rest
of white <hi>Cotton.</hi> They weare breeches generally, both men and women.
This is the habit of this ample Kingdome, being as large almost as all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
which hardly keepeth constant to its owne fashions, in any of its
smallest Provinces.</p>
                     <p>The women are decently habited with the same coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es, (if I may so
call them) which the men use; wearing them close about their necks. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the ordinary sort of women are very curious in dressing their heads,
adorning their haire with flowers, as well naturall as artificiall; having in
this art a competition with nature; and with the varietie of colours, the
forme and figure of them they do as happily deceive the eyes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
as the grapes of <hi>Zeuxes,</hi> did the sparrowes; or to expresse it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as the curtaine of <hi>Parrhasius</hi> deceived <hi>Zeuxes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The women of the <hi>better</hi> quality use gold and silver, the <hi>Courtesans,</hi> or
<hi>publique</hi> women are not suffered to weare them; and it is a distinction to
know them by, what they are, that they are not allowed to weare any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
on their heads (contrary to the custome of other Countries) nor
to have their houses within the walls. The rest of their under-garments
are the same both in men, and women, only their shoes are so little, that
one might reasonably doubt, whether so small feete could belong to a
humane body growen to a full stature: The reason of this is, that from
their very infancy they swathe their childrens feet, so streightning them to
hinder their growth; and not (as we say in <hi>Europe</hi>) because they are not
suffered to goe: and although it be the common opinion, that it is a great
part of beauty to have little feet, yet the more understanding <hi>Chinesses</hi> do
hold this effeminacy to be a very great folly. It tooke its originall from
one of their Queenes, who having ill-shapen feet, to mend that naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>t,
did swathe them, to bring them to a better forme: so that, what was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64464:27"/>
necessitie in her (if it may be called a necessitie, to mend such feet, as might
have served well enough without it) it came to be a gallantrie in all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
by imitation of her: so much ought <hi>Princes</hi> to avoid the making of
themselves <hi>Authors</hi> of ridiculous novelties.</p>
                     <p>The retirement of the women is very great. There is not a woman to
be seen in the streets, although in yeares; or never so blamelesse in her life;
neither are men suffered to visite them at their houses. That part of the
house where they inhabit is, as it were, a sacred place, for their sakes. It
is enough to tell any one who entereth unwillingly, <hi>That there are women
there,</hi> to make him stop presently.</p>
                     <p>The men-servants may enter thither only while they are <hi>little</hi> boyes.
Into the very chamber where they are, not so much as their kindred, are
allowed to come, unlesse they be the younger brethren of the husband, of
very small age; no not the husbands father; with so much punctualitie,
that if upon some particular occasion he would chastise his son, (for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they are married, their fathers do chastise them, if they see cause)
he retireth presently to his wives apartment, which is an inviolable <hi>Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary;</hi>
the father being not to enter thither. If the women go out to visite
their parents, they are carried in <hi>Sedans close shut;</hi> and this is the custome
of all their women, even to those of the most ordinary <hi>qualitie.</hi> If they go
on pilgrimage to any of their <hi>Idolls,</hi> and that it be necessary, that they go
part of the way on foot, they cover their faces with a vayle. If they
go by water in the Barks with their Parents and kindred (as I saw once
above 200. upon occasion of a <hi>Pilgrimage</hi>) they passe one before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without <hi>speaking</hi> a word; beleeving that the least overture that
women give to the conversation of men is a large gate opened to the
danger of their honour. This, which may be counted a harsh
<hi>Strictnesse,</hi> is turned into a pleasaunt <hi>Sweetnesse</hi> by custome, (which
maketh all things easie) as well for their repose, as for the peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of the family.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding in so large a Country as <hi>China,</hi> this custome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
equally be observed every where; so that in some parts, as I have
above mentioned, the ordinary women go abroad as among us; but
the women of quality alwayes observe that stile of retirednesse.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of their Language and Letters.</head>
                     <p>THe language which is used in <hi>China</hi> is of so great Antiquity, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
beleeve it to be one of the 72. which were at the Tower of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi>
At least it is manifest by their books, that it is more than 3700. years
in use among them. Is is various and different, because there are diverse
Kingdoms, whereof this Empire is composed at this day; and anciently
they did not belong unto this Crown, but were possessed by Barbarous
Nations, as all the Southern Provinces and some of the Northern: But at
this day the Language of <hi>China</hi> is but one only, which they call <hi>Quonhoa,</hi>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:64464:28"/>
or the language of the <hi>Mandarines;</hi> for they at the same time, and with
the same care and industrie, that they introduced their government into
other Kingdomes, brought in likewise their language: and so at this day
it runneth through the whole Country, as <hi>Latin</hi> doth through all <hi>Europe;</hi>
but more universally each Province still retaining their naturall speech. It
is a Language much limited; and as in the multitude of letters it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all others, so in scarcenesse of the nounes which it useth, it is the
least copious of any: for it hath not in all aboue 326. and of words (which
in reality are the same, but only differing in accent and aspiration) 1228.
Almost all end in vowels, and those few, which do not terminate in vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
end either in <hi>M.</hi> or <hi>N.</hi> They are all <hi>Monosyllables,</hi> all undeclined, as wel
verbes as nounes, and so accommodated to their use, that many times
the verbe serveth for a noun, and a noun for a verb, and an adverb too, if
need be. For which reason it is more easie to be learn'd than the <hi>Latine;</hi>
the Grammar only whereof taketh up a childs whole time. The brevity
of it maketh it full of aequivocal words, and for the same reason compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.
This which would be troublesome to some, is very pleasing to
the <hi>Chinesses;</hi> who are most particular lovers of brevity in speech; being
either imitatours, or imitated by the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> It is rather sweet
than harsh, and if it be spoken perfectly, (as it is for the most part, in <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi>)
is very delightfull to the ear.</p>
                     <p>To say a thing with respect, with humility, and in applause of anothers
merits, they use many excellent termes and phrases, (which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties
also of our <hi>Portugesses</hi> language.) And although it be a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
language, it is so sweet, that it exceedeth almost all others that I
know. To say among us: <hi>Take a thing,</hi> either with the whole hand, or
with some particular fingers thereof, we are forced still to repeat the verb
take; but among them it is not so; each word signifieth the verb; and
the manner too. As for example <hi>Nien</hi> to take with two fingers;
<hi>Tzo</hi> to take with all the fingers; <hi>Chuá</hi> with the whole hand
turned downwards; <hi>Toie</hi> with the hand having the fingers turned
upwards; so likewise with the verb <hi>[is]</hi> as; he <hi>is</hi> in the house, he <hi>is</hi> eating,
or <hi>is</hi> sleeping: they have a word, wherewith at once they expresse both
that he is, and, how he is. We, to say, the foot of a man, the foot of a
bird or the foot of any beast, are forced alwaies to specifie with the same
word <hi>foot</hi> but the <hi>Chinesses</hi> do it with one word: as <hi>Kio</hi> the <hi>foot</hi> of a man,
<hi>Chua</hi> the foot of a bird; <hi>Thì</hi> the foot of any beast.</p>
                     <p>Their style in their writing is very different; from their discourse, although
the words are the same: so that when one taketh the pen in hand for to
write, he had need to raise up his witts; and it would be counted a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
thing, to write as they speak ordinarily. This is the reason, that all
their pointed or accented reading, orating, disputing, and perswading, as
wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in publick as in private, is alwayes first practised and exercised with
the pen.</p>
                     <p>The letters which they use, seem to be as Ancient as the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for according to their histories it is since the Invension of them
3700. years to this present year 1640, in which I wrote this relation. I
wil be bold to say that this is one of the most admirable things in that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64464:28"/>
Kingdome: for the number of their letters being excessive, almost all
have some skill in them, at least as much as is sufficient for the exercise of
their trades; and though they are proper only to <hi>China,</hi> yet they are used
in all the neighbouring Kingdomes, every one reading them in their owne
language; as among us it is in the figures of numbers &amp; of the starres; which
are the same over all <hi>Europe;</hi> and yet every nation calleth them by different
names. They are very proper for Embassies, Bills, and Bookes. These, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
each Province have a different language, are common and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of all, as if they had been written in their owne language.</p>
                     <p>The Author of these is said to be <hi>Fohi,</hi> one of their first Kings. At the
beginning they were fewer, and more simple, resembling, in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
the thing that was expressed by them; for that which is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>Gè,</hi> and signifieth the Sun, was written with a circle, and a Diametrall
line through it. Afterwards the form was something varied, changing
the circle almost into a square, having the same line through it, and doth
still signify the Sun. This variety in making of their letters hath caused
foure kinds of them. First the <hi>Ancient,</hi> which remaineth still in their
Libraries, and is understood of all the <hi>Litterati,</hi> although it be no longer
in use, except in some titles and seales, which they put in stead of Armes.
The second is called <hi>Chincù,</hi> and is the most current, as well in manuscript,
as printed bookes. The third they call <hi>Taipie,</hi> and answereth to the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
hand used among our publick Notaries, not much in use, unlesse it be
in bills, contracts, pleadings, policies, and such like things. The fourth is
so different from the rest, as well for the Abbreviations, (which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,)
as also for the different stroakes and shape of the letters, that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
a particular study to understand them. This word <hi>Sie,</hi> which signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to give thanks, is written after three most different manners.</p>
                     <p>Their letters are in all sixty thousand, enrolled in their <hi>vocabulary,</hi>
which they call, <hi>Haipien,</hi> and may be rendred a <hi>great sea.</hi> They have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more briefe; For to read, write, compose, and understand very well,
about eight or ten thousand letters will serve the turne: and when they
meet with any letters, which they call a <hi>cold letter,</hi> they have recourse to
their <hi>vocabulary,</hi> as we do, when we meet with a <hi>Latin</hi> word that we do
not understand. From hence it is evident, that he is most learned amongst
them, that knoweth most letters; as amongst us he is the best <hi>Latinist,</hi> that
is most verst in his <hi>Calipines-Dixionary.</hi> To form all these multitude of
letters, they use only nine strokes, or touches of the pen: but because
these only would not be sufficient for so great a fabrique, they do joine
figures, or perfect and significant letters, one into another; by which
means they make other new and different ones, and of a different signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
So this line—signifieth one: crossed with another line <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                        </gap> ten,
and having another stroke at the bottome <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifying the earth, and
with another stroke at the top of it <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                        </gap> it standeth for King; adding a
stroke on the left side of it between the two first strokes <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                        </gap> it is taken
for a precious stone, and by adding certaine other lines, it is meant for a
pearle: And this last figure is every letter to have, that must signify a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
stone, or any other stone, that is of price and esteeme, although not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64464:29"/>
counted precious. So every letter which signifieth any tree must have
joyned with it the letter, which signifieth wood: and the letter that signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
mettall, must be annexed to the figure which it is put to signify, as
Iron, Copper, Steel; yet this is no infallible rule.</p>
                     <p>They have also, in the composition of their <hi>Letters,</hi> had respect to their
significations: and so that square figure, which we spake of before, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the <hi>Sunne,</hi> joyned with another very little different, standing for the
<hi>Moone,</hi> is called <hi>Min,</hi> and signifieth Brightnesse. Another which hath the
likenesse of a Portall, called <hi>Muen,</hi> signifieth a gate: there is another which
signifieth a heart, to which it hath some resemblance. Now if this letter
be placed between the two perpendicular lines, which form the letter
that standeth for a Portall, it signifieth <hi>Sadnesse</hi> and <hi>Affliction,</hi> that is, a
heart streightened and prest in a narrow doore: and every word of <hi>Sadness</hi>
must have a heart annexed to it.</p>
                     <p>They who write well, are held in great esteeme; and they make more
account of a good writing, than of a good picture. And for a set of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
letters well shapen and formed, they do not care to spend a good
summe of money: and letters from being first esteemed, have come at
length to be reverenced. They cannot endure to see a written paper lying
on the ground, but presently take it up; and in the childrens schooles there
is a place appoynted for the keeping of them; and afterwards they burne
them at certaine times, not out of religion, or superstition, as the <hi>Turks</hi> do,
but only out of the reverence they beare to <hi>Letters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their way of writing is from the top of the paper downwards to the
bottome, and beginning at the right hand of the paper proceed to the left,
as the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> and all Eastern nations do.</p>
                     <p>They formerly made use of the inner barkes of some trees in stead of
paper, as other nations have done. For a stile or pen they used certaine <hi>Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
of Iron, with which they dexterously formed their <hi>Letters.</hi> They
wrote also many things on <hi>Lamins</hi> or plates of mettall, and also on vessels
of molten mettall; of which there are yet some remaining, which are
held in no small esteeme by the owners, &amp; all that see them. But it is now
1800 years since they have had the invention of paper, which is there of so
many sorts &amp; in so great plenty, that I am perswaded, that, in this, <hi>China</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
the whole world; &amp; is exceeded by none in the goodnes thereof.
That which aboundeth most, &amp; is most used for printing, is made of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Tree, which is called in <hi>India, Bombù,</hi> and in <hi>China, Cio,</hi> the art in
making of it is like ours; but the best and whitest is made of Cotton-cloth.</p>
                     <p>In stead of pens they use pensills made of the haire of severall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
the best are of those of a <hi>Hare.</hi> They are more easie and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to write with than pens: the ordinary ones cost three, foure, or five
farthings; the best come to six pence a piece. Their <hi>standishes</hi> are made of
stone of severall formes, and are commonly handsomely wrought, and of
a small price: yet they have some of thirty crownes a piece. In these they
dissolve the inke, which is made up in little molds and dried: The best is
made of the smoake of oyle, which they gather by art: it is sold at a small
price commonly, the dearest being a crowne, or seven and six pence the
pound; but the best of all from ten to twenty crownes. The <hi>Artezans</hi>
which make it are not held for <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> so noble is this art esteemed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64464:29"/>
by them. They use sometimes red ink, especially in their <hi>Annotations</hi>
upon books: and sometimes (but very seldome) write with it. It is their
greatest care and ambition to have all their instruments of writing to be
of rich materials, neat, proper, and in good order, with the same pride
and delight, as the most accurate Captain or Souldier among us taketh in
his armes.</p>
                     <p>In printing, it seemeth that <hi>China</hi> ought to have the precedence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nations: for according to their books they have used it this 1600
years; but it is not (as I said before) like unto ours in <hi>Europe.</hi> For their
<hi>Letters</hi> are engraven in Tables of wood. The Authour of the book or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
what kind of letter he will have, either great, little, or middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sized;
or rather he giveth his manuscript to the graver; who maketh his
Tables of the same bignesse with the sheets that are given him; and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
the leaves upon the Tables with the wrong side outwards, he engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the letters as he findeth them; with much facility and exactnesse, and
without making any <hi>Errata:</hi> their writing not being on both sides the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as among us, but on one side only; and the reason, that their
books seem to be written on both sides is, because the white side is hidden
within the fold.</p>
                     <p>They print likewise with Tables of stone; with this difference, that
then the paper is made all black, and the letters remain white; because
when they print thus, they lay the ink upon the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the stone, but
in the <hi>Tables</hi> of wood, they put it only in the hollow of the engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
This last manner of printing serveth only for <hi>Epitaphs,</hi> Pictures,
Trees, Mountains, and such like things, whereof they do desire to
have the memories preserved; and they have very many prints of this
kind. The stones which serve for this use, are of a proper and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
kind; their wooden Tables are made of the best Peare-tree. So
that any work which they print (as they do in great numbers) remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
alwaies entire in the print of the <hi>Tables,</hi> to bee reprinted as often
as they please, without any new expence or trouble in setting for
the presse, as there is in our printing. Every one hath the liberty to
print what he pleaseth, without the <hi>Supervising, Censure,</hi> or <hi>Licence,</hi> of
any one; and with so small charges, that for every hundred letters
perfectly engraved in the manner abovesaid, they pay no more
than foure pence half-penny; and yet every letter consisteth of many
strokes.</p>

to examination.</head>
                     <p>THey are put to learn from their tender age. They have for beginners
certain little bookes, containing good rules and precepts of vertue,
good manners, obedience to their parents and superiors, or some such like
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64464:30"/>
matter. A few months after, they give them <hi>Classicall</hi> books; which
they get all by heart, both the <hi>Text</hi> and the <hi>Glosse,</hi> as perfect as we do our
<hi>Pater Noster.</hi> After this, commeth the Masters explanation. They say their
lesson likewise by heart, the Scholars back being turned towards the master
with the book lying open upon the table, and they use no other phrase
for saying their Lesson, but only <hi>Poixú,</hi> which signifieth, to turn their back
upon the book, and this is done, that they might not cast their eies upon
it to help themselves. They are kept to their studies with so much ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
(even the youngest of them) that they are allowed no manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
or divertisement.</p>
                     <p>Every day they write something, and their masters copy is laid
under the paper, like the black line among us: and the paper being thinne
and transparent, the letters easily appear through, which the boy that
learneth doth easily imitate, forming other letters like those, which hee
seeth under his paper; and by using this for some short time, he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
accustomed to the fashion of his Masters hand, which he imitateth
after this manner. Therefore after some time spent in this exercise, they
write one line upon the Masters copy, and another upon the blank pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
by the side of it; for, as I have said, the lines are made from the top of
the paper to the bottome, till at length, when they can well imitate the
copy, they give over writing upon it. In fine, they take very much paines
to gain a good hand in writing; for, in their examinations, where their
compositions are copied, it is sufficient to have their <hi>Grace</hi> denied, if there
be but found one ill-shapen letter, before their exercise be read; they
presuming; that no man can be learned, if he read, or write ill; although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us there be many examples to the contrary. For it is wel known, that
the excellent Doctour <hi>Navarra</hi> wrought a very ill hand, &amp; our <hi>Bartolomeo
Philippo,</hi> a singular Scholar, writ so perfect an ill hand, that to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
grief of all learned men, his most learned works were lost; although
they were many, and no doubt, full of most admirable knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there was not found any one, that was able to read them; as may
be perceived by those workes of his, that have escaped out of that perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>Chaos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next; when the <hi>Chinesses</hi> have learned a good quantity of their letters,
and have had some acquaintance with their books, they are instructed in
the rules of composition. First, they give them some disordered compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
which they are to reduce into order; then some abbreviations for
them to enlarge upon, and afterwards in due time they give them only the
point or Theme; in like manner they do, at their examinations. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
every three years the most approved compositions of those, who
have taken degrees, are put in print, others take great paines in them, and
get as many of them by heart as they are able,</p>
                     <p>They have no <hi>Universities,</hi> where they study together; but all, that are
able, take a Master into the house for their sonnes, and sometimes two, if
there be much difference between their childrens ages. This Master is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
with them without any interruption, and teacheth them not only
<hi>letters</hi> and <hi>sciences,</hi> but whatsoever concerneth <hi>Civill government, good
manners, moralitie,</hi> and the way how to carry themselves in every thing.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64464:30"/>
If they are persons of <hi>Quality,</hi> the Scholar never goeth abroad without
his Master, who serveth to instruct him in all <hi>Civilities,</hi> and good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
particularly in visits; where, as there are many <hi>Ceremonies</hi> used,
there is something of difficultie; and they might easily commit
an errour, if their Master did not help them. And without
doubt, this way is most decent for their reputation, and more
profitable for their studies, and lesse exposed to those venemous
practises and company, which are apt to teach them such customs, as
infect their minds; and spoile the <hi>Decorum</hi> of a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> and much
more in <hi>China,</hi> where, if any one have this evill fame, he cannot be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to examinations.</p>
                     <p>There are neverthelesse many Schools for children of a meaner condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
where the Masters have this good quality, that they receive no
more than they are well able to teach, that they might not go from them,
as if they had never come thither; as it falleth out too often in <hi>Europe,</hi>
where each Master endeavoureth to have many Scholars, rather for his
own gain than their advancement. For indeed a man, let him be never so
able, is but still one man; whence it commeth to passe, that some of their
Schollars know the School, but are not known of it. This inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is avoided in <hi>China:</hi> each taketh no greater charge upon him, than
he is well able to give an account of; and each Master admitteth no more
Scholars, than he can well teach. He is with them all the day long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having
himself with much gravitie; neither do they ever go out of the
School, unlesse it be at meales; and if any one of them doth live far off,
his dinner is brought to the School. Their play-daies and time of <hi>vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
are only fifteen daies at the beginning of the new year, and some few
daies in the <hi>fift</hi> and <hi>seventh</hi> moon: and as there are there no <hi>Holy-daies,</hi>
they make all the rest of the year an un-interrupted application to their
studies. So sensible are they of this truth: That it is necessary to take ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great paines to bee learned; and, that seldome any one passeth
with the reputation of a knowing man, without much labour and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie.</p>
                     <p>When they are grown up and past these rudiments, and their parents
are not able to provide a master for each in particular; some of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and neighbours joyne together, and take a master in common, who
dyets with them day by day in course, and receiveth his <hi>Salary</hi> from them
all, which is not much; but more or lesse according to the custome of the
Countries, and many amount each year to 40 or 50 Crowns; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Salary</hi> being from ten to twenty crownes: besides the presents which
they make them at certaine feasts, consisting of stockings, shoes, and such
like things. At meals (although it be in the houses of persons of the greatest
quality) they are to sit with the father of the scholar, or at least with the
scholar himselfe. Many times they stu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

others more proper for that occasion, either within or without the
City, but never farr off: and as much as they can, avoyd their owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
knowing well that the multitude of people, and the respect which is
payd to their quality at home, are capitall enemies to study: hence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to passe in other Kingdomes, that the sonnes of Lords and great men

do for the most part, prove great <hi>Ignorants:</hi> As if the greatest <hi>Nobility</hi> did

                     </p>
                     <p>There are ordinary Masters without number, for there being so many
that pretend to the degree of a <hi>Literato,</hi> and so few that attaine to it, the
greatest part are constrained to take upon them the imployment of a
schoolmaster; so that to set up a schoole the year following, they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to get scholars for that time, from the beginning of the present year,
but in great houses they commonly receive none for Masters, but such as
have taken the degree of Batchelour, who continue the course of their
studies with a designe to take their other degree.</p>
                     <p>When they have taken any degree, although it be but only of <hi>Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are then no longer under a Master, but forme a kind of
<hi>Academie,</hi> as it were, among themselves; where they meet at certaine
times every month, one of them openeth a book, and giveth a point or
Theme, upon which all of them make their <hi>Compositions,</hi> which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
compare among themselves.</p>
                     <p>Although they have no <hi>universities</hi> and particular schooles, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they have generall schooles, which are very capacious and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and most richly adorned, for the examiners, and those that are to be
examined; of which there is a wonderfull great number. These schooles
are in the Cities and Townes, but the most stately ones are in the <hi>Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
of the Provinces, where the examination of <hi>Licentiats</hi> is held. These
fabriques are of a bignesse proportionable to the multitude of people
which flock to them. The form is almost the same in all. Those of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone</hi>
are not bigge: because they admit not of above foure-score, to take
their degree; whereas in others, there are admitted from an hundred to a
hundred and fifteen, which is a great difference. The whole structure is
compassed about with a wall, having a faire and sumptuous gate towards
the South, opening into a large streete, where a numerous multitude are
gathered together. This streete or <hi>Piatza</hi> is 150. Geometricall paces
broade, each pace consisting of five foote: There are no houses in it, but
only porches and walks with seats for the captaines and souldiers, who
are there assisting all the time of the examination, and keep a strong guard.
At the first entrance, there is a great Court, where do stand the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi>
of the first post, with a Court of guard within the gate; then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
appeareth another wal with a gate, made like those of our Churches,
and openeth &amp; shuts in two leaves or pieces, when it is not convenient that
all should be opened: when you are past that gate, there appeareth a large
place, in which there is a pond of water, extending from one tide to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
over which standeth a stone bridge of perfect Architecture, which
endeth at another entrance or gate, guarded by Captaines, which suffer
none to go in or out, without expresse order from the officers. After this
gate followeth another very spacious Court, having on each side rowes
of little houses or chambers for the persons that are to be examined; pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
on the East and West side thereof. Every chamber is foure palmes
and an halfe long, (every palme is nine inches English) and three and a
halfe broade, and is in height about the stature of a man: they are covered
with Tarrasse or Playster in stead of Tyle; within each of them are two
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64464:31"/>
boards, the one fastened to sit downe on, the other moveable for a Table:
which after it hath served them to write upon, they make use of, when
time is, to eate on. There is a narrow entrie, which leadeth to them, that
admitteth but of one man a breast, and that hardly too; the doores of one
row open toward the backside of the other.</p>
                     <p>At the time of the examination; there is a souldier to assist in every one
of these little chambers, to guard and serve the person to be examined;
sitting under his little Table: They say, he hath a gagge of wood in his
mouth, that he should not speak and trouble the student. But if it be in his
power to remedie it, it is not likely, that he doth entirely complie with
his obligation.</p>
                     <p>At the end of this narrow entrie I spake of, is raised a Tower upon
foure Arches with Balusters without on all sides, within which there is a
<hi>Salone</hi> or great Hall, where do assist some officers and persons of respect,
who stay there to give account of what passeth in all the little chambers,
which they have placed in their sight. At the foure corners of this Court
are foure great Towers, with their Bell or Drum, which is sounded, as
soone as there happeneth any noveltie or disorder, to give notice thereof
to whom it doth concerne. Nigh to these Towers are other Buildings
with a large Hall, furnished with seats and Tables, and other necessaries
for the businesse that is to be performed there, which is the first examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the compositions; at which the more ordinary officers do assist, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in those seates.</p>
                     <p>Going through the Hall by the gate which looketh Northward, there
is to be seen another Court, and presently another Hall of the same form;
but the furniture thereof is more rich and costly, it serving for the <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
and more honourable officers. Then follow likewise other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partaments
and lodgings for the said persons, and for all the other officers
and examiners; every appartament hath a Hall, seats and Table<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
and eat at; a chamber with a bed, and Canopie of silke, and other
houshold-stuff proper to that end they are designed for. There is also a
walke with little gardens and low Trees. There are also joyned to these, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lesser chambers for Notaries, Secretaries, Pages, and other officers
of their families; besides these there are other chambers for the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi>
and inferiour officers, and for their ordinary servants, with Butteries,
Larders, Kitchins, and whatsoever is necessary for the accommodation
of so great a multitude; every thing being disposed and ordered even to
admiration.</p>
                     <p>Anciently the nobilitie and kindred of the King were not admitted to
any sort of office or publique charge; no, nor those of them that studied,
were allowed to come to the examinations, to take their degrees. About
20 yeares since, after many earnest solicitations made by them, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
by the contrary part, they had the priviledge granted them, to be
admitted to all examinations; and the examiners are obliged to confer
degrees on some of them, but not to many. The common people of all
sorts and all vocations are admitted, except those that are infamous, as
the servants of the <hi>Mandarines</hi> (not their houshold Servants, but those
which serve them in their Tribunalls and Courts of justice;) Sergeants,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64464:32"/>
Bayliffs, Catchpoles, Rogues, Executioners, and guardians of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
women, called <hi>Vampa.</hi> Likewise those are not admitted, against
whom lyeth any tax, or accusation of ill manners, untill there be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
given of their amendment.</p>
                     <p>They have three sorts of degrees <hi>Sieueai, Kiugin, Cinfu;</hi> and that we
might the better understand them, I might say, that after their manner
they are answerable to our <hi>Batchelour Licentiate,</hi> and <hi>Doctour,</hi> each degree
having their severall ensignes and badges of honour. Those that are only
students, and have taken no degree, have not any particular priviledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to them, but only are respected as Gentlemen, and the people ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

degrees are conferred.</head>
                     <p>THe order and manner, that the <hi>Chinesses</hi> observe in their examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of persons that take their degrees, is very curious. It is to be
supposed, that in these examinations, from the first of the simple student,
to the last of the Doctour, consisteth the businesse of the greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of this Kingdome: for on these depend the degrees and offices
both of honour and profit, the only marke, at which mortalls aime with
their chiefest attention. In a word, if there be an employment, wherein
these two are coupled (a conjunction which the old proverb hath sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
to be very difficult) certainly it is this. We will begin at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
that is what is performed by the meer and simple students.</p>
                     <p>Before the examination there is first spread abroad a report, that there
will be one, till at length it be published by <hi>Authoritie.</hi> Because the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
which are conferred, and those which pretend, are many, it is not
convenient that so great a multitude should be admitted to the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Chancellour:</hi> and to the end that both the fit and unfit should not
enter at that examination, there is an order in the Province, that those which
are to enter, should be proved first by two Antecedent examinations in
their City or Towne, after this manner. Every Judge in his Territorie
doth publish an examination, and appointeth a day for the meeting of all
the students of his Precinct. And because sometimes the place of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
universitie is not sufficient for the reception of so great a multitude,
they fill a large field with seats and Tables; and there the examination is
held. The Judge giveth the poynt upon which they are to compose.
They begin in the morning and are allowed time till night; They give in
but one composition, and when they have finished it, they consigne it to
the proper officer; who, putting them together, examineth them all along
with great diligence; and chusing out the best, causeth the name of their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64464:32"/>
composers to be written: this roll of their names is stuck up upon the
wall of his Palace; by which it cometh to be known, who they are, that
are allowed to passe to the supream examination; and this allowance they
call, <hi>Having a name in their Village.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The compositions thus allowed are carried by the Officer, in person to
the Governour of the City: and the same do all the judges of Townes,
each within his own jurisdiction; and each City in its Villages, each City
being divided into two Villages, with their particular judges, besides the
Governour of the City. And all the students of the Country, that have been
already allowed of, being assembled together, enter into the generall place
of the City; where the Governour of the City examines them again, and
giveth them a new point, after the same manner, as was given them in
the Village with this difference; that they use more care, rigour, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and admit lesse of the Intercession of friends, who are ready in all
places to pervert the truth. Of these the governour chuseth 200, and
giveth their names to the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> who putteth them the third time
upon the same examination, almost in the same manner; and chuseth out
amongst them about 20 or 25, upon whom he conferreth their degree; so
that being sifted three times most exactly, they come at length to be but
few in number. Then are given them their ensignes and priviledges, with
an advertency of their subordination, not only to the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to the <hi>Prefects;</hi> who are two in each City; and are called <hi>Hioquon;</hi> that
is, <hi>Mandarines</hi> of the sciences. Their office is to observe and spy out the
deportment of each; and to chastise those, that behave themselves amisse;
and (which is more) they may examine them a new, if they please, and as
often, as they think good.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chancellour</hi> is bound by his office to send through the Province,
and to assemble within the Cities all the Ancient <hi>Batchelours,</hi> and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them, to find whether they study; or else addict themselves to other
imployments different from their profession. He rewardeth the diligent,
and castiseth those that are idle, in this manner: when they are all gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together in the generall Palace, he giveth them a point for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
the which being ended, their papers are divided into five <hi>Decu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
or <hi>Classes;</hi> to those of the first he giveth praise and rewards; the same
or little lesse is done to those of the second; Those of the third <hi>Classe</hi> are
passed by in silence; those of the fourth he chastiseth; those of the last
<hi>Classe,</hi> he depriveth of their degrees, priviledges, and ensignes of honour,
and turneth them back to be rank'd among the common people: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse

each City, and 20 for each town; and although they have not above eight
Crowns pension a man, they stand the King, through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

which useth to be in the eighth moone; and commonly falleth out to bee

are not held to it above three daies only; and those are the ninth, the
twelfth and the fifteenth of the aforesaid month. The chief examiners
are the greatest Officers of the whole Province, besides others of that
precinct who are assistant to them: But above all, the President; who
commeth, even from court, purposely to his Province. These are the
first, that do assemble in the general Palace; and with them their Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
notaries, and other people appointed both for their Guard and
service; and likewise Physitians, for fear they might have need of them;
because, whilest this action lasteth, no person is permitted to come out, or
in, to them.</p>
                     <p>Without, there remaineth a vigilant Officer, to provide whatsoever is

because he is the common master of all the Batchelours. There
are some, which are so infallibly certain of their knowledge and abilities,
that there was one in <hi>Kiamsi,</hi> who, after the studenrs were locked up for
their examinations, made a list of those whom he conceived, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

Provinces and Universities exceed the number of 7000) make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
at nine of the clock in the morning, keeping their order, and
without any contrast; (as it often happeneth at the examination of Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
with such confusion, as is often the occasion of undecent and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
accidents, and sometimes murders, as I once saw in the City of
<hi>Sumkiam</hi> in the Province of <hi>Nankim,</hi> and in that of <hi>Kiamsi.</hi>) At their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
they are all searched, to find what they carry about them; and if
the least paper be but found about any one of them, he is presently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
And for the lesse trouble in searching of them, they are all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to wear their hair loose and hanging down, their leggs naked, and
shoes made of cord, their garment without lining, or any fold whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
with their inke-horne and pensels about their necks; (for as we have
said before, they use no other pens, but those.) As soon as they are entred,
they retire into those little chambers, we spake of before; each into one,
with his souldier to watch him, who sitteth at his feet under his little ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Then they lock up the gates, setting their guards of Souldiers; who
keep so strict and rigorous a watch, that during the examination, they do
not suffer any one to passe through that street; much lesse do they permit
any one to go out.</p>
                     <p>Then presently are the points exposed, which the President hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
written in large letters on white Tables of <hi>Charam;</hi> the which hang
publickly at the four corners of the crosse way between the little
houses; so that every one may see them from his own chamber, the
Points or Theames are seaven; four out of the four last books of their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
which are common to all; and three from every <hi>Kim,</hi> that is,
out of every part of his books of sciences; each student necessarily profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
only one of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:64464:33"/>Vpon each point the student is to write briefly, Elegantly, and sententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously;
so that every one is to make seven compositions, which are to be
written in a faire and well shap'd letter, without any Abbreviation. If
they afterwards mend or correct any thing, they are to write underneath,
in what line that Emendation is made. They make two copies of
their compositions; the one subscribed with the name and Sirname of
their Father and Grand-Father, with the years of their own age, together
with an Inscription, as seemeth good to each of them. These they seale
up with the Inscription only on the outside: presently they consign the
open copies to the officers appointed to receive them, and then go their
waies. The sealed copies are kept according to their number in a place
appointed for them; the open copies are given to certain Notaries, who
copy them out in red letters, that the composers hand might not be
known; and after that, they are given to the Examiners, who distributing
them among themselves, do, the two following daies, examine and review
them, with so much rigour, that the least errour is sufficient to exclude
the student. I shall give you a pleasant example.</p>
                     <p>Among their letters, there is one called <hi>Ma,</hi> which signifieth a horse:
this is composed of a perpendicular line crossed with three others,
and underneath hath a stroke, which endeth with a concavity like to our
letter S. In this concavity they put 4 pricks in a row, one after another.
In stead of these four pricks when they write with Abbreviation, they
put only one line. Now there was a student, who in his composition
wrote it after this last manner; and although his composition were excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
yet because he had not writ this letter after the first manner, the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner
sent him away with these words, <hi>without four leggs the horse can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
go.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When that is done; they let up, on the outward wall, a large catalogue
of the names of such, who have made any fault in their compositions,
which serveth for advice to them, to return home to their houses, which
they presently do partly out of shame, and partly out of necessity, because
they will not be suffered to enter at the following examinations.</p>
                     <p>The second time they enter again, on the twelfth day of the month,
where they are proceeded with as before, excepting that they give them
only three points, concerning such doubts and difficulties, as may occurre
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> matter of government; to understand, how they would behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in it, and how they would advise the King. Then again upon the
through examination of these second compositions many are sent away
and excluded from the third examination: to which they enter on the
fifteenth day of the month; and have only three points given them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the lawes and statutes of the Realme. When the compositions of
this last examination are received, they shut up the generall Palace for
fifteen daies, more or lesse; and during that time, by comparing and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the best, they are reduced to a small number, who do really deserve
the degree. Then they consign them to the <hi>President,</hi> who maketh the
last scruting, and ranketh them in their places and order, there being a
great difference in being of the first, or of the last; not only for their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but also to be the sooner provided of some good place or office.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64464:34"/>After this last diligence is ended, which is used about the copies of the
compositions, presently they open the originall compositions that were
sealed and laid by, that by the Inscriptions they might find out the names
of the Authours; which they write down in certain classes according to
their merits. This catalogue is exposed to the view of innumerable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who are staying without to expect it; some for their Son or Brothers
sake, some for their Father or Friend, some for their Master or Patrone; and
some only to satisfie their curiositie.</p>
                     <p>At the time when these names stand exposed, being written in very
large letters, from the top to the bottom of a long paper, two palmes and
a halfe broad, there stand ready without, just so many horses which are
to carry those that receive their degree of <hi>Licentiate;</hi> each horse being
marked with his number. of 1. 2. etc. And to every one of those servants,
who are appointed to lead the Horses, there is given a ticket, with the
name of the Graduate, and the number of that place, which belongeth
to him. Who presently runneth to seek him out (it being not easie to
find him, because they do yet stand retired) to give him notice of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
and to beg some reward of him, and so staies with him to wait
upon him, till he departeth to go to the Court.</p>
                     <p>The students having notice given them of their promotion, come all
on horse-back to the Palace-general, every one in his order; where the
<hi>Proveditor</hi> and Minister of the Kings Exchequer-chamber, standeth ready
expecting them, with the ensigns of their dignitie, as the Cap, Gown, Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
and Boots, which he solemnly putteth upon them, and when they
are thus adorned, they go presently to give thanks to the <hi>President</hi> of the
examinations: who receiveth them on foot, and treateth them, as his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals,
though he be alwaies to them in the stead of a Master: and they do
so depend on him; and bear him such extraordinary respect, that it is a
thing almost incredible to be related. Among them is so much love and
amity, as if they were really brethren; for they are called brothers of the
examination; and like such do they respect one another. After follow
diverse ceremonies, and severall banquets presented by the Officers alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
They are three in all, as I remember, and are all very sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but the third is of some profit also: for in this, there is set to every
one of them three tables; the first covered with diverse meates; the second
with hens, fowle, venison, and other flesh, which is to be all raw; the
third with dryed fruits: and all this is to be sent home to their houses,
that they might spend it there, at their own pleasure and discretion.</p>
                     <p>Assoon as these men have obtained their degree, they become present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
great, honoured, nay adored; and, I know not how, suddenly rich.
After this, they go no longer on foot, but either on hors-back or in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.
And not only the graduate, but his whole family, change their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and he beginneth to think of purchasing his neighbours houses,
and to build himself a Palace. This will yet seem more wonderfull to
him, that knoweth, that many of them come out of their countries a very
great way on foot, carrying at their backs, that habit, which they are to
wear in the City; having sometimes their hands daubed with clay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they lately were mending up their poor cottages: of which sort of
blades I have seen some come to <hi>Nankim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:64464:34"/>These solemnities being ended, the Graduates presently prepare to go
to Court, to be made <hi>Doctours;</hi> and if they will take any government up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, they are presently provided with some place or other: But if
they accept of any government, they lose their pretension of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
afterward for Doctour. Although there is none who at first doth
not attempt it; But if any one doth not succeed in it, and begin to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in years, having a mind to put himselfe presently into the world, he
accepteth of a Government, having only the title of a <hi>Licentiate,</hi> but such
very seldome come to very high preferments; although there have been
found some of them, who have had the good fortune to be advanced to
the quality of <hi>Vice-roy.</hi> For this journey to Court they have every one of
them given them 80. crownes, out of the Kings exchequer, to bear their
charges: and it is very certaine (as I have been informed by some <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>
of credit,) that the whole expences, which every <hi>Licentiate</hi> stands
the King in, from the time he taketh his degree, till he cometh to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the Court amounteth to 1000. crownes; which throughout the
whole Kingdome, (according to my account,) maketh a million and halfe
of crownes. So much doth it cost the Prince in the forming of his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and making them capeable of the Government of his crowne: so
great a reward doth he propose to them, that they might aspire to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
learned.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Licentiates,</hi> who are made every three yeare, throughout all the
Provinces, are about fifteen hundred, more or lesse; and this is no great
number in respect of those, which procure, their degree in all the generall
Palaces. In that of <hi>Cantone,</hi> which is one of the least, having not above
7500. little chambers in it, the compositions of the first day are about
96148. from whence may easily be inferred, how great the number of
the pretenders is. And now we will give a particular chapter, concerning
the supreme degree.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the degree of Doctour.</head>
                     <p>THe degree of <hi>Doctour</hi> is solemnly conferred at the Court, in the second
Moone of the yeare, which answereth to our month of March. They
proceed in it according to the same form, which was observed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>Licentiate;</hi> excepting that the ensignes of honour are different, and
the examiners of greater qualitie; they being the chiefe of the royall Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
called <hi>Hanlin,</hi> and their <hi>President</hi> is alway the <hi>Colao,</hi> the greatest
dignitie, next the King, of this Empire: although he differently exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the charge of <hi>President;</hi> for, in this Transaction, they of the royall
Colledge have a definitive vote; and the compositions being distributed
among them, after the first election, they, who are elected and approved
by them, cannot be refused or rejected by the <hi>President.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the <hi>Licentiates</hi> of the Kingdome are admitted to this examination,
as well the old ones, as the new. And anciently there was no precedent
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64464:35"/>
examination to inable them for this admittance; because it was accounted
sufficient to be a <hi>Licentiate,</hi> to have entrance at the examination of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors:</hi>
But because among their compositions there were many so ill made,
that it was time lost to read them, and did render the composers incape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
not only of the degree of <hi>Doctour,</hi> but likewise of pretending to it;
therefore about 15. years since, there was introduced another examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the receiving of them, which is in practise to this day: from
whence it happeneth, that many are not received, to their great shame and
sorrow: which is a wholesome instruction to others not to spend their
time in feasting and recreations.</p>
                     <p>In this examination are to be chosen 350. upon whom the degree of
<hi>Doctour</hi> is conferred. The ensignes of honour, excepting the Bootes, which
are the same in all, are very different from those of the <hi>Licentiates,</hi> both in
cost and ornament. They have also a girdle given them, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
weare in their places of Government, which are bestowed upon
them; but is more rich and precious, according to the offices they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to. When they have received their degree, and put on their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
of honour, they all assemble, within a Hall of the Kings Palace
prepared for that purpose, where they are examined the second time in
one only composition, the poynt being about the Government and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
which they are to be admitted to. At this examination, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times the King did use to assist in person; but now there assisteth a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lao</hi>
in his name.</p>
                     <p>The examination being ended, they passe into another Hall, where the
new <hi>Doctours</hi> do make their reverence to the King, and presently the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lai</hi>
presents to him three of them, which have obtained the first places;
then the King with his owne hand bestoweth a reward on each of them.
He to whom he giveth the first gift, being the chief of all the rest, hath a
particular name belonging to him ever after; as also, to the second and
the third: The first they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll <hi>Chuam. Yuen,</hi> the next <hi>Pham, Yuen;</hi> the third
<hi>Thoan, Hoa;</hi> and this name is of so great esteeme and reputation, that in a
few daies after the examination, there is scarce any person through out the
whole Kingdom, that doth not know them by these names; and not by
the names of their fathers and Countrie; which is a wonderfull thing in
so vast a Kingdom as that is. The honour is as great, as that of our Dukes
and Marquesses. As well for the respect, which is paid them throughout
the whole realme; as for the places of authority and trust, where they are
put to govern; being the very same, which were anciently conferred upon
those great Lords, whose authority was in another way, correspondent
to that, which now these <hi>Doctours</hi> have.</p>
                     <p>These ceremonies being accomplisht, there is yet another examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which although it be voluntarie, there are few that absent themselves
from it. A new point is given; they make their compositions; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to them there is an Election made of those, who are to be admitted
to the royall colledge. They select only 30 of the most deserving, and
of them they admit five every year; who only for being entred in so smal
a number, are alway providing with profitable places of <hi>government.</hi>
The other twenty five have particular Palaces assigned them; where they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64464:35"/>
assemble, and become as Scholars under the discipline of a <hi>Colao;</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
every day, causeth them to compose somewhat, and exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in all that belongeth to their learning, and speculative government.
This continueth til the next examinations, at which new persons enter, and
the other go forth, and according to their degrees and antiquity, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with the places of greatest importance at the court; from whence
(unlesse it be to be <hi>Presidents</hi> of the examinations, or some other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
imployment, that lasteth but a short time, and by the Kings order) they
never go out; no not to be <hi>vice-royes;</hi> which imployment is accounted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, because only those of the royal colledge are capable of the
dignity of a <hi>Colao.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the new <hi>Doctors</hi> are that year put into some employment, unlesse
there be any, that is not of competent years. That which helpeth this
multitude to imployments, is that the same year there is held a generall
visitation throughout the whole Kingdome; by which there are so many
of the old <hi>Mandarines</hi> turned out, that there are many places made void
for the new ones; and, as this degree is of high account, the visits, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulatious,
Feasts, and Presents, which are made upon this occasion, are
almost incredible. The reward for bringing the first newes, is many
times worth 200 Crownes to the Messenger, but commonly 50, assoon
as the friends and kindred of those who are named among the three first
above-mentioned, hear of their promotion, presently they erect unto them
triumphall arches in their Cities or Villages, not of wood coverd with
Canvasse or past-bord; but of pure Marble sumptuously wrought; in the
front whereof is engraved the name of the Person, for whom they were
erected; the place he hath obtained, and the year of his <hi>Doctour-ship;</hi> in a
word, the world is the same throughout. It is a vain thing to beleeve, that
he which hath not power, should be admired, heard or received with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause;
whether it be done out of zeale to the truth, or out of flattery and
interest.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Books and Sciences of the
Chinesses.</head>
                     <p>OF the Sciences of the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> we cannot speak so very distinctly and
clearly; because really, their Authours have not been so fortunate, as
<hi>Aristotle, Plato,</hi> and other Philosophers and wise men, who have methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
handled them under their several <hi>Classes,</hi> divisions, and titles: whereas
the <hi>Chinesses</hi> have written little or no thing of many of the sciences and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
arts, and of the rest, but superficially, except those which concern
good government and policie.</p>
                     <p>From the very beginning it hath been their chiefest aim, to find out
the best way of government; the first that began this, were the Kings <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi,
Xinon</hi> and <hi>Hoamsi.</hi> These three at the beginning gave themselves to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64464:36"/>
their morall and speculative Sciences, by way of mysticall, even and odd
numbers, and other ciphers and notes; by which they gave law to their
subjects: and from hand to hand, these were alway communicated to the
Kings; who were the wisemen of that time, and by this means did govern
the Kingdome; untill the <hi>Monarchie</hi> of <hi>Cheù;</hi> which began 1123. years
before the coming of our Saviour: at which time <hi>Venuam,</hi> and <hi>Checuam</hi>
his youngest Sonne, published these numbers and ancient notes, and made
a booke of them, intitled <hi>Yechim;</hi> giving likewise many morall precepts,
documents and orders to the whole Kingdome; and following the steps
of other Philosophers, which lived according to the <hi>Stoick</hi> rule: they had
alway great care of the Government and publique good; untill the time
of <hi>Confusio;</hi> who composed five bookes in order, (called by them <hi>Vehim</hi>)
which are at this day held as sacred. He made also other bookes; and of
his sentences and sayings there have been (since) also many more bookes
composed.</p>
                     <p>This Philosopher flourished about 150. yeares before the coming of
Christ; he was a man of a good nature, well inclined to vertue, prudent,
sentencious, and a lover of the publique good. He had many disciples,
which followed him; he had a great desire to reform the world (which,
even at that time, began to lose its sinceritie and veracity, changing the
ancient manner of living, and introducing moderne customes.) And so he
governed in severall Kingdomes: for when he saw, that they did not
live conformable to his precepts and counsells in one Kingdom, he went
to another; yet not uncensured by many other Philosophers of that time,
who seeing the evill course, which men tooke, retired themselves to their
villages, and becoming husbandmen, in their owne persons tilled their
grounds. Now it happened that one day <hi>Confusio,</hi> passing along, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to go through a river, whose ford he was not acquainted withall, sent
one to enquire of a man that was labouring thereabouts, who was a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
He asked the messenger, who he was; and being answered, that
he was a disciple of <hi>Confusio's,</hi> who sate in his Coach expecting his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
The Philosopher replied, let him go in a good houre: he knoweth
the way, and hath no need of a guide; signifying thereby, that he went
from Kingdome to Kingdome, endeavouring to Governe, in a time that
was not proper for Philosophers to reigne in.</p>
                     <p>Neverthelesse in after times, this man was in so great favour with the
<hi>Chinesses;</hi> and the bookes which he composed were held in so much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
as also the sayings and sentences which he left behind him; that they
do not only hold him for a Saint, and a Master and <hi>Doctour</hi> of the whole
Kingdome, and whatsoever is cited of him is esteemed as an Oracle or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
thing; but also, in all the Cities of the Kingdome, he hath publique
Temples built to his memorie, where at set times he is worshipped with
very great ceremony: and in the year of the examinations, one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
ceremonies is, that all the graduates go together to do him reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and acknowledge him for their Master.</p>
                     <p>Of those that are descended from him, he that is the neerest of kin
hath a competent revenue, and enjoyeth the title of <hi>Chuheu,</hi> which is as
much as Marquis or Duke. The Governour of the City where he was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64464:36"/>
borne, out of respect and favour to him, is alwaies one of his family: and
finally, all those of his linage, assoone as they are borne, have a particular
priviledge from the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and are respected by all, in regard of their
predecessour <hi>Confusio.</hi> This custome continueth to this day, although it
be 1800. yeares since he died.</p>
                     <p>But returning to the Bookes which he published, they are these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
The first is called <hi>Yekim,</hi> and treateth of his naturall Philosophie, and
of the generation and corruption of things; of Fate, or Judiciary Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
from these and other things, and from naturall principles; Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizing
by way of numbers, figures, and symboles, applying all to mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and good government. The second is called <hi>Xukim,</hi> containing a
Chronicle of the ancient Kings, and their good government. The third
<hi>Xikim,</hi> and is of ancient poesie, all under metaphors and poeticall figures,
concerning the naturall inclinations of mankind, and also of diverse cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.
The fourth, named <hi>Likim,</hi> treateth of rites and civill ceremonies
of the Ancients; and also of those that belong to Religion and divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
The fifth is called <hi>Chuncieu,</hi> the which treateth also of the History
of their Countrie, and containeth a collection of examples of severall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Kings, good and bad, to be imitated or avoided.</p>
                     <p>There are also foure other bookes, which were made by <hi>Confusio</hi> and
another Philosopher called <hi>Mensiù;</hi> In these nine bookes is contained all
the naturall and morall Philosophie, which the whole Kingdome studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
and out of these is taken the point, which is proposed to read, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
on, in their examinations for degrees. Upon these bookes they have
severall commentaries and glosses: But there is one of them, which by the
law of the Kingdome they are commanded to follow; nor are they allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to contradict it in their publique Acts; and hath almost the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with the text.</p>
                     <p>These nine bookes are held, as it were, sacred, and in them, and their
<hi>Glosses</hi> and commentaries consisteth the great endeavour of their studies;
getting them by heart, and endeavouring to understand the difficult pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of them; forming diverse senses upon them, whereby, to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the practise of vertue; &amp; to prescribe rules for the government of
the Kingdome, according to those wise dictates and <hi>Maximes</hi> they finde
there. And because their examinations are very strickt and rigorous, they
not being suffered to bring along with them to those examinations, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any booke, but also not so much as a fingers breadth of paper, it being
no easie thing to be very ready in all these bookes, the order is; That the
first examination of <hi>Batchelours</hi> be upon the last foure, and that of <hi>Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates</hi>
to be upon the same foure; as also upon one of the other five: for this
reason none is obliged to be very perfect in more than one of those sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which he doth professe: and upon that the point is to be given
him.</p>
                     <p>But to speak more distinctly to their learning (although in their books
it is not delivered so clearely and orderly) I say, they consider in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
three things; that is, the heavens, earth, and man; and so according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they divide their learning into three members, that is, into the science
of the heavens; the science of the earth, and the science of man; inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64464:37"/>
in the two first, all naturall knowledge, and in the third, all morall.</p>
                     <p>In the science of the heavens, they treate of the beginning of all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
things, of the Creation of the Universe, and of the Formation of man
himselfe: of universall causes, of generation and corruption; of elements
and elementary qualities, answerable to the planets; of celestiall motions
and relvolutions; of the foure seasons of the year; of the stars and planets,
of <hi>Iudiciall Astrologie,</hi> of spirits good and bad what they are; and other
like matters.</p>
                     <p>In the science of the earth, they treate of the varietie that is seen in her,
by reason of the 4. seasons of the yeare, of the productions of things, and
their differences: of fields and possessions, and their divisions in order to
<hi>Husbandrie</hi> and <hi>Agriculture:</hi> of the situation of the 4 parts of the world:
of their position; and other particulars concerning them; of the choise
and building of <hi>Coemeteries,</hi> and burying places for their dead; in which
they are very superstitious.</p>
                     <p>In the science, which treateth of man, they teach all their moralitie;
and that which belongeth to man in a sociable and politick capacitie;
who imitating the order, manner and proprietie of heaven and earth, as
the universall Parents, liveth in communitie with the observing their five
morall vertues, which are <hi>Pietie, Iustice, Prudence, Policie</hi> and <hi>Fidelitie.</hi>
They treate also of morall matters, and of the respect which they have to
the five orders of persons, into which their Common-wealth is divided;
that is, <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Sonne: Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife: King</hi> and <hi>Subjects: Elder
Brother</hi> and <hi>Younger Brother:</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> among themselves.</p>
                     <p>All their moralitie is divided into two members: The first they call
<hi>Divine Moralitie,</hi> which treateth only of ceremonies, rites and sacrifices,
which they make to heaven; earth; the planets; parts of the world; good
and bad spirits of the heaven, and earth, mountaines, rivers, tutelary spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
soules of the dead, Heroes and famous men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The second is their
<hi>Politick</hi> and <hi>civill Moralitie;</hi> This is divided into <hi>Ethiques,</hi> which order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the manners and actions of mankinde as they are considered in relation
to their owne persons: and into <hi>Oeconomie,</hi> in order to the government of
their families: and into <hi>Politiques,</hi> in relation to the Government of the
Commonwealth, the publick good, and conservation of the Kingdome.
The Government of a single person doth put him in a way to the good
Government of his familie; and the good Government of a familie to
that of the Kingdome; as for example, A father, which doth not well Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
his house, how should he governe a City or Province? and he that
knoweth not how to governe and correct himselfe, according to the duty
of his single person, how should he be able to regulate his familie? So
that they lay the first foundation of mortalitie, in the good manners and
behaviour of each particular person; from whence proceede well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
families, and publick Governments well administred.</p>
                     <p>Under the same member of the science of man, they comprehend the
<hi>Liberall</hi> and all other <hi>Arts;</hi> which belong to their persons, families and
<hi>Monarchie;</hi> which shall be the subject of the following chapter.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>GRammar,</hi> the gate of the other Sciences, if we reduce it only to the
terminations of a language, as <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> and other grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
have done, is but in little use among the <hi>Chinesses:</hi> for all their
words being <hi>Monosyllables</hi> and undeclinable, there is not much paines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to put them together in <hi>syntax:</hi> yet notwithstanding all this, there
is a great deal of difficulty in composing; the which consisteth in placing
of adverbs and certain termes, which are not significant: but if we should
enlarge the <hi>Grammar,</hi> as far as <hi>Angelus Politianus,</hi> and some other have
stretched it, it is certain, that there is great use of <hi>Grammar</hi> among them;
for their humane learning is very large and vast; and although they have
but few fables or mysteries, yet they have many Histories, Sayings, Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and <hi>Apophthegmes,</hi> which they must make use of for the ornament of
their compositions.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Logick,</hi> they have no other rules, but what are dictated to them
by the light of nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rhetorick</hi> is much in use among them, although they have no rules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to that art; but rather take it up by way of Imitation; observing
and practising what they find to be good in the compositions of other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arithmetick</hi> they have in perfection, for as much as concerneth the
four <hi>Species</hi> and kinds thereof: they have also their demonstrations, and
figures, as I have seen in their books. Of <hi>Algebra</hi> they know nothing at
all, nor do they much practise the ordinary <hi>Arithmetick.</hi> The way of
account through the whole Kingdom, and also in the neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
is with an instrument, called by the <hi>Portughesses, Gina,</hi> and of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
Suonpuon,</hi> that is, a Table of account: it is made like a small square,
divided into ten parts, with certain little rodds or wyres of brasse, upon
each of which are threaded seaven little balls or beads, about the bignesse
of those we use in our Chaplets or Rosaries: five beneath (for the
wyer is divided into two parts) which stand for <hi>vnites;</hi> two above, which
signify <hi>tens:</hi> and with this instrument, moving up and down the little
balls, they make their accounts with great facilitie and expedition.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Geometrie</hi> they have a sufficient knowledge; for although, not being
acquainted with remote Countries and Kingdomes, they have not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to distinguish their bounds; nor to assign them their proper confines:
yet they have very exactly divided their own country, of which they
have very perfect <hi>maps.</hi> Add to this; that anciently all their land was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by very exact measures: because the King had not his revenue
then, in that manner, as he hath it now, that is, that every land should
pay so much; but every one divided his land into ten equall parts, and
one of those parts, which lay nighest to the middle, they tilled and sowed,
and the profit was the Kings: and even now a daies, in buying and selling
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64464:38"/>
of land, they measure it, if there be occasion.</p>
                     <p>The measure which they use upon this occasion, as likewise to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
any other continued quantity, is in this manner. The least of all,
they call <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>fuen,</hi> and is three graines of wheat. Ten of these make the
second measure, called <hi>Huzum;</hi> ten <hi>Huzums</hi> make a <hi>Che;</hi> and ten <hi>Che's</hi>
make their greatest measure called <hi>Hucham,</hi> bigger than an <hi>Italian</hi> yard.
These measures, the which they have perfectly divided in the manner
above-said, are used by all Officers, as also by taylours, to make their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
taking measure by them, as we do in <hi>Europe</hi> with a piece of thread,
or Parchment: so likwise, the Carpenders frame a house, though never
so big, with all its pillars, beames, joyces. etc. Without so much as trying
a piece of timber, where it is to stand, only by meanes of these measures;
and having framed a house thus in severall pieces; they will on a
sudden ioyn them together and set it up, without missing in the least.</p>
                     <p>Their wayes they measure by paces, but still according to the same
measure, making a Geometricall pace to consist of 6 <hi>Che,</hi> and one <hi>Li</hi> of
300 paces; and of 100 <hi>Li</hi> one <hi>Stadium,</hi> or daies journey. So that from
North to South it appeareth that 250 <hi>Li</hi> make a <hi>degree;</hi> for we allow to
every league 15 <hi>Li;</hi> and 16 leagues to every degree.</p>
                     <p>To measure corn, rice, pulse, and such like, the greatest measure is, that
which the <hi>Portughesses</hi> call <hi>Pico,</hi> and the <hi>Chinesses Tan.</hi> This is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of smaller measures: the least is as much as a man can hold in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of his hand; ten of these measures make one <hi>Xim;</hi> (and this of rice is
the ordinary allowance of a man for a day) ten <hi>Xim</hi> make one <hi>Ten,</hi> and ten
<hi>Ten</hi> make one <hi>Tan;</hi> which cometh to weight about 100 <hi>Cattes,</hi> which
make 125 pound of <hi>Portugall-weight,</hi> 16 ounces to the pound.</p>
                     <p>The third manner of measuring, which is by weight, is divided after
the same manner. We will begin with an <hi>Hao,</hi> and it is the tenth part of
a piece of their mony, which the <hi>Portughesses</hi> call <hi>Caxà,</hi> or <hi>Li,</hi> as the
<hi>Chinesses</hi> call it: and answereth to our half <hi>Iulio</hi> or three-pence: ten <hi>Li</hi>
make one <hi>Condrin;</hi> ten <hi>Condrin</hi> one <hi>Mas;</hi> ten <hi>Mas</hi> one <hi>Tael;</hi> and 16 <hi>Tael</hi> one
<hi>Catte,</hi> which is their pound, but bigger than ours; for 16 <hi>Tael</hi> make 20 of
our pounds: 100 <hi>Catte</hi> make one <hi>Pico;</hi> or, as they call it, one <hi>Tan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In weighing they use not the Balance, but the <hi>Stillyard,</hi> or <hi>statera,</hi> as wel for
little, as great weights. For great weights, they do not use an Iron-beam,
but of wood, divided into its parts by points or marks of Brasse, or else of
silver. In weighing of gold, silver, medicines, and the like, they make use
of certain little weights, with a beam of white bone, divided by strokes
of black. They make these <hi>Stillyards</hi> very perfectly, and of severall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions;
The middle sized have three rowes of pricks, and three threads
neere the Centre in stead of a cord; the first row of pricks giveth any
weight from 3 ounces to five; the second goeth further, and weigheth to ten
ounces; the last row to 20. The larger sort of <hi>Stillyards</hi> weigh more or less;
the least sort are divided into so smal parts, that although those ten parts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which a <hi>Li</hi> of silver is divided, do not use to be divided in brasse-mony,
(for they coine no mony but of brasse) neverthelesse in the weighing of
silver they distinguish and divide them very exactly.</p>
                     <p>For the better understanding whereof, it is to be supposed, that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64464:38"/>
all the Kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> excepting the Province of <hi>Yunan,</hi> they use
no other money but of brasse; and all the silver goeth by weight, so that if
I would give a crowne, I give as much silver, as a crowne weigheth, and
so of a six-pence or three-pence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for this cause there are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie
of founders, as also mint-houses for silver: and to buy some things,
especially such as are of small value, silver of base alloy will serve the turn;
and so base, that in some Provinces, of one six-pence they make eight or
ten; and reape much benefit by it. Other things cannot be bought but
with fine silver, and so the poore silver goeth often to the fire, to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
qualified.</p>
                     <p>They are great lovers of the <hi>Mathematiques,</hi> but to speak generally, they
know very little of them; none being allowed to study them professedly,
except those, who apply themselves to this study, by the Kings speciall
order; and these are only two throughout the whole Kingdome; The one
in the Court of <hi>Pekim,</hi> and the other in that of <hi>Nankim;</hi> with a traine and
attendance of <hi>Mandarines,</hi> and the Title of the Kings <hi>Mathematicians:</hi>
These teach their art but only to their sonnes, who always succeed them;
and are but moderately knowing in their profession. Neverthelesse, they
have many ancient books of this science; not only of the course and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the stars, planets, and several other things, but also of <hi>Iudiciall Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi>
and <hi>Horoscopes,</hi> to which they are much addicted. By these books
they find out, when the <hi>Ecclipses</hi> of the sun and moone are to be; and
have maps of the stars, though not in great perfection, yet tolerably good.
They reckon a greater number of stars than we. They make the elements
to be five; that is, water, mettall, fire, wood, and earth. Over these they
assigne five predominant planets: as <hi>Mercury</hi> over the water, <hi>Venus</hi> over
mettall, <hi>Mars</hi> over fire, <hi>Iupiter</hi> over wood, and <hi>Saturn</hi> over the earth. They
are great observers of the motions of the heavens; They distinguish the
seasons of the yeare by the <hi>Aquinoxes</hi> and <hi>Solstices.</hi> They divide the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack</hi>
into 24. signes, doubling our number. They make the yeare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
of twelve moones; and 354. dayes, having six months of thirty days,
and six of 29. and when it is leap-yeare, which falleth out every three
years, it consisteth of 13 moones and 383. dayes.</p>
                     <p>Their yeare beginneth with the new moone, which is neerest to our
month of <hi>February.</hi> From the observation of the heavens and their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they proceed to the Judiciall part, referring severall events to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
of the planets, and celestiall appearances of <hi>Phenomena,</hi> which
they diligently observe: and if there fall out any new or strange appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
they presently give the King notice of it by a petition; and to this
end in both Courts there is a very high place or Tower, furnished with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
mathematicall instruments, which they call <hi>Quon Siam Thai,</hi> that is,
a place to observe the stars in.</p>
                     <p>Of that in <hi>Nankim</hi> I have already said something, when I spake of that
City. In <hi>Pekim</hi> the chiefest instruments are a spheare, like that at <hi>Nankim</hi>
with all his <hi>Circles, Aquator, Zodiack, Tropicks,</hi> &amp;c. of cast mettall,
and excellent workmanship. Another instrument of the same bignesse,
(that is, of 24. foote in circumference,) divided into severall circles, some
fixt, others moveable, a stile or <hi>Gnomon</hi> in the middle, and little holes at
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64464:39"/>
each end to take the hight of the stars, the degrees and elevation of the
<hi>Pole,</hi> &amp;c. There is moreover a celestiall Globe of brasse of the same big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
divided into its degrees, with its constellations, whereof they make
only 28. They have also a <hi>Stile</hi> of brasse very large, divided proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably,
with which they measure the shadowes of the foure seasons of the
yeare; that is, of the <hi>Aquinoxes</hi> and <hi>Solstices.</hi> There are besides, many
other moveable instruments of brasse, for severall uses, which do suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
demonstrate the curiositie of their Ancestours, and how much more
diligent and intelligent they were than the Modernes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Musick</hi> was anciently much esteemed in <hi>China,</hi> in so much that their
Philosopher <hi>Confusio,</hi> in the Countrie where he governed, one of the
chiefe things he tooke paines in, was to cause them to be taught <hi>Musick.</hi>
Now adaies the <hi>Chinesses</hi> lament and say, that the true rule thereof is lost,
and almost all the ancient books that treated of <hi>Musick:</hi> So that that <hi>Musick,</hi>
which they have at present, is not esteemed off by the <hi>Nobilitie:</hi> The
greatest use they make of it, is in their comedies. There are also particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Musicians,</hi> who are sent for to their feasts, mariages, and the birth of
their children; and of these there are some that may be endured. There
are not wanting also blind men, who go singing about the streets, and at
the doores of their houses: and as all the <hi>Chinesses</hi> do make a feast on their
birth-dayes, these blind men do keep in their memorie the punctuall time
of all the birth dayes of persons of qualitie, and know their houses well;
and at those times do never faile to go thither to sing. The <hi>Bonzi</hi> do use
<hi>Musick</hi> in their offices and mortuaries, the Tone whereof is not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
our <hi>Cantus firmus,</hi> or plainsong; though they have not formally either
plain-song or Organ-note; for they do not raise, nor fal their voice immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from a note to the next note or half-note; but mediately raise and fal
it to a <hi>third,</hi> a <hi>fift,</hi> or an <hi>eight:</hi> in which the <hi>Chinesses</hi> do much delight.</p>
                     <p>They have twelve Tones, six to rise, which they call <hi>Live,</hi> and six to
fall, which they call <hi>Liu.</hi> They have also their notes in singing like ours
of, <hi>ut, re, mi;</hi> they are five, and among them is our <hi>ut:</hi> in learning of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi>
they make no use of signes, nor of the joints of the fingers; nor in
composing do they use lines, as we do: it is therefore to be supposed, that
in their consorts, they have not a <hi>Musick</hi> formed of diverse parts: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
many do sing together, all is but <hi>unison,</hi> as is in use almost through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all <hi>Asia.</hi> Therefore their <hi>Musick</hi> is pleasing only to those of their owne
Country, but their best way of singing is, one voice only with an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Neither are they delighted with our full <hi>Musick,</hi> but very much with
a single voice.</p>
                     <p>They use <hi>keeping of time,</hi> but cannot tell how many diversities it hath,
and so in singing ancient songs, and moderne ones, upon the same ayre with
the old, they hence know the time, when they are to sing, and when they
are to stop. Concerning their instruments, they say they have seven se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
kinds of tones, besides a mans voice; and according to these they
have made their <hi>Musicall Instruments.</hi> The first is of mettall, and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
bells of all sorts, <hi>Cimballs, Sistra,</hi> &amp;c. The second of stone. They
make an Instrument of Jasper, like unto the Italian squadra, excepting that
the lowermost end is very large, and they strike or play upon it, as it hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:64464:39"/>The third is of skins: here come in our ordinary drums, and those of
the <hi>Moresco</hi> fashion, or <hi>kettle drums;</hi> which they make of severall fashions:
and some so big, that they cannot be plaid upon, unlesse they be hung up
in frames of wood. The fourth is of silke, of which they make strings
for instruments as here we make lute-strings of gutts. For stringed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
they have the vyoll almost like ours: but it hath only 3 strings,
and is the usuall instrument of the blind man. They use also the violin
with 3 strings and its bow; they have also another with one only string,
which they play on, like to our <hi>Bow vyollin.</hi> The chiefest stringed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
which they have, is of seaven strings, and is in more esteem than
the rest; and if the <hi>Musician</hi> be skil-full, it maketh tolerable <hi>Musick.</hi> The
fift is of wood. Of this kind they make certain thin pieces of board, &amp; lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them together, they play upon them all at once, like snappers or <hi>castag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets:</hi>
the <hi>Bonzi</hi> also have a particular way by themselves, of striking and
playing upon a piece of wood; and that with much <hi>keeping of time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The sixth is of those instruments which are sounded with the mouth,
as flutes, of which they have 2 or 3 sorts, &amp; so sound them very excellently.
They have also another instrument made of severall pipes, like the fashion
of our <hi>Organ,</hi> but it is but small, and to be carried in ones hand. They
sound it with their mouths; and the Harmony is excellent. Now some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
all these instruments are plaid on together, and make a pleasing
<hi>musick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Poesie</hi> hath ever been much esteemed in <hi>China;</hi> and in the time, when
there were many Kings, <hi>Feudatory</hi> to one <hi>Emperour;</hi> when they came to
do him homage (as they did every three years) they were obliged each
of them to bring with him out of his Kingdom, the Rythmes and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
which were there most current and in use, that by them he might
judge of their manners and customes, which truly are much discovered in
such compositions. In this particular, the <hi>Chinesses</hi> have a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
over all others, because they are very modest, in whatsoever they
write; and it is very rare to find a loose word in their verses: and (what is
more,) they have no letters whereby to expresse the <hi>privy parts;</hi> not are
they to be found written in any part of all their books.</p>
                     <p>They have great variety of verses, and do use a consonancie of meeter,
like to that in the <hi>Songs, Ballads, Sonets,</hi> and <hi>Madregals</hi> of <hi>Europe:</hi> and they
put also the correspondency of the Rythmes, at the end of each; and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
verses, as we do in our <hi>sonets</hi> &amp; <hi>octaves;</hi> in which they use great variety.</p>
                     <p>They compose likewise verses by the number of syllables, the which
they call <hi>words:</hi> for as in their language, all words are <hi>Monosyllables,</hi> there
cometh to be no difference betwixt a syllable and a word, which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of one only letter, which is likewise pronounced a <hi>Monosyllable.</hi> So
that all letters being thus after the same manner, the quantity of the verse
consisteth in the number of them; so that as we compose verses here of
five, seaven, or eleven syllables, so also the <hi>Chinesses</hi> make theirs of five,
seaven, or more letters: whereas among us two words, and sometimes one
may take up the whole verse: it can never fall out so in theirs; because all
their words are of one syllable and one letter. They have not verses that
answer to our latin verses, with feet, as <hi>Dactils</hi> or <hi>Spondees,</hi> &amp;c. But are all
made like our Sonets and Dities, and other verses in Rythme; in which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64464:40"/>
they use many various forms and manners of compositions. The chiefe
are eight: it will be sufficient to relate one to you, to give you some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the rest.</p>
                     <p>In this kind of <hi>Poesie</hi> the verses are to be eight in number, consisting
each of them of five letters, and the consonancy of rythme to be every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
verse, in this manner: The first may have it, or no, as they please;
but the second must rime to the fourth; The fift with the sixt; the seventh
with the eighth: The third, fift and seaventh have no consonancy of rime,
but the letters are to be correspondent to one another: as also the verses,
that do observe a consonancy, are likewise to have their letters to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond
to one another; the first with the first, the second with the second,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this correspondency consisteth not in riming, but in the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
wherefore if the first letter of the second verse signifie a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
water, fire, or whatsoever else, the first letter of the fourth verse
must likewise signifie the same thing; which is likewise observed in the
second, and in the rest of the letters, of the whole verse. This is a very
Artificiall way, but difficult.</p>
                     <p>In the conceits of their verses, and in the figures with which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
themselves, they use almost the same manner with us in <hi>Europe.</hi>
They have another kind of verse, of lesse esteeme, like ordinary rimes,
which are every where in request: but the <hi>Nobilitiá,</hi> and particularly those
of the Kings kindred and blood-royall, are much addicted unto the eighth
manner of verses above mentioned, in which they make many severall
<hi>Poesies,</hi> chiefly in commendation of their friends, of famous men, of the
dead, and of severall vertues.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Painting</hi> they have more curiositie, than perfection. They know not
how to make use either of <hi>Oyles,</hi> or <hi>Shadowing</hi> in this Art; and do therefore
paint the figures of men without any grace at all: but trees, flowers, birds,
and such like things, they paint very much to the life. But at present there
are some of them, who have been taught by us, that use <hi>Oyles,</hi> and are
come to make perfect pictures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Medicine,</hi> or <hi>Physick,</hi> is in a very good condition in <hi>China,</hi> because they
have abundance of good ancient bookes of that art, being all their owne
authours, for ours are not yet arrived thither. They do not let blood, nor
set on Cupping-Glasses; They use no sirrops, no potions, no pills; much
lesse have they the use of Cauteries, or issues, a medicine of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
They are only <hi>Herbalists,</hi> using nothing but herbes, rootes, fruits,
seeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all drie: and for a greater supply, that which they have
not in some Provinces is brought them from others: so that there are
whole Faires only of medicines; and in the Cities and Townes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
shops are very well provided, from whence they furnish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
But neither in bottles nor glasses; but of all others the Physicians
are well provided; because they never write any receipt, but give the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
themselves to the patient whom they visit, And all is done at the
same visit, therefore the Physician hath alwayes following him a boy,
carrying a Cabinet with five drawers, each of them being divided into
more than fourty little squares; and all of them furnished with medicines
ready ground and prepared.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:64464:40"/>They are very famous in judging of the Pulse: never asking the patient,
whether the paine be in his head, shoulders, or belly; only they feele the
pulse with both their hands, leaned upon a pillow, or some other such
thing, observing the motion of the pulse for a good while; and afterwards
do tell, what the patient ayleth, I do not say that they hit right, on every
thing, in all patients: nor that all Physitians are able to do it; there being
many which do not study, and know but little; but the good and learned
Physitians do seldome faile. We had a Father that was sick of a violent
stitch, in the Province of <hi>Kiamsi.</hi> The Physitian by feeling of his pulse
could tell, whether his paine did increase or diminish, and all the changes
and alterations of his disease; and I have heard severall <hi>Portughesses,</hi> which
have confirmed the same by other cases. Having felt the pulse, presently
they compose the <hi>Medicine.</hi> If it be for the King or Prince they make
foure compositions, two for them to take, and two to be kept, all of the
same medicines, and equall in number and quantity: The two are kept,
till the patient recover. For all other persons, they make two only, one
for the morning, and the other for the evening. They write upon them
in what quantity of water they are to be decocted: and how and when
they are to be taken; and many times there doth follow a wonderfull
successe.</p>
                     <p>I will relate what happened to a Father, who lay sick in prison in the
City of <hi>Nankim.</hi> At the beginning of his sicknesse they sent presently for
a Physitian, and finding no effect of his medicines, they sent for another;
&amp; because the physick of the second had no better successe, and the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
still encreased, the Christians sought out for a Physitian of more fame
and reputation; who although he was very unwilling to make a visit into
such a place, notwithstanding, at length by much intreaty he was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to visit the sick man: He felt his pulse, and performed his ordinary
<hi>ceremonies;</hi> among the which one was to lay his breast bare, which was
full of spots; for indeed he had the <hi>Meazills.</hi> Presently he compounded
three medicines, the first the patient tooke in the morning: the second an
houre after noone; (These were a kind of pills, which made him go foure
times to the stoole) at night he tooke the third. The disease still encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
the Father was brought that night to such a condition, that he became
speechlesse, and all thought he would have died; neverthelesse he held
out till the morning, when suddenly he mended so fast, that when the
Physitian came and felt his pulse, he found him to be without any fevour;
telling him, that he was cured, and that he should only have a care to eate
moderately, till he had recovered strength; which accoordingly fell out:
for in a short time the Father was perfectly well.</p>
                     <p>They forbid not their patients to drink water, so it be boyled, or else
<hi>Chà;</hi> but they will not allow them to eat, but if the patient be hungry he
may eat lightly and with great caution: if he be not hungry, they do not
much trouble themselves to perswade him to eat: for they say, when the
body is sick, the stomack doth not well perform his office, and so the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
which is then made, is malignant and contrary to health. His vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
is presently rewarded with a moderate fee; nor doth he returne, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he be sent for, leaving, by this manner, a liberty to the sick person to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64464:41"/>
change his Physitian, if he think fit, and to send for others; as many times
they do, till the third or fourth day of their sicknesse, if they see no effect
of the medicines they have taken.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Courtesies and Civilities of the
Chinesses.</head>
                     <p>AMong the <hi>Chinesses</hi> to uncover the head, or to <hi>Scrape</hi> a legge is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
any courtesie, but rather contrary to good manners; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to uncover the head: But to bow the body, or at least the head, when
one can do no more, are accounted termes of <hi>Courtesie</hi> and good manners,
And to speake first in generall; Their Courtesies are very low bowings of
themselves even to the very ground; as is the ordinary mode in their visits
and meetings: They call this <hi>Ye</hi> or <hi>Coye:</hi> Secondly they use the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
and then suddenly to fall upon their knees, and in that posture to
bow againe with their head even unto the ground: and in some cases they
rise up againe upon their legges, &amp; repeate the same <hi>Ceremony</hi> three times;
which is the least; foure the most ordinary; nine the most that can be;
and that is performed only to the King. Sometimes they shorten it, making
their first reverence standing on their legges; and presently kneeling down,
they make the three following on their knees.</p>
                     <p>The courtesie of the women is the same which is used among us; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting,
that in some cases, they also kneel; and in that posture make an
obeisance with their head to the ground three or four times, as <hi>civility</hi>
shal require.</p>
                     <p>They have for this purpose particular garments, which the common
people do not use; it is also true, that among friends they do not use
them; but never faile to do it with others: neither dare any one visit a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of quality without such a <hi>Vest,</hi> or garment: But if they meet by chance,
(not in the street, for such meetings they carefully avoyd) and both of
them have not that garment above mentioned, which they call <hi>Tai,</hi> both
the one and the other are excused from that <hi>Ceremony</hi> of the <hi>Vest:</hi> But if
one of them hath it on, the other must presently put on his; which for this
purpose is commonly carryed after him by a servant; and if by accident
he hath not brought it with him, although he should be never so much
importuned by the other, (who hath his <hi>Vest</hi> on,) to accept of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
<hi>Ceremony</hi> and <hi>Courtesie</hi> from him, he may not consent to it, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding
the <hi>Courtesie,</hi> is to sit down and converse with him.</p>
                     <p>If one go to visit another at his house, he must stay in the Hall, till the
other hath put on his <hi>Vest;</hi> But if he be a friend, he is to come presently,
(although he be not ready with his <hi>Vest</hi>) and receive his guest, and
to make much of him, and after that, he is to retire and put on his <hi>Vest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This garment of <hi>Courtesie,</hi> for such as have taken degrees, is the same
with the ensigne of honour, which they weare, in their government and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64464:41"/>
the ensigne of their office. They that are noble by bloud and descent, do
wear the ensigne and habit of <hi>Doctours,</hi> although they have never studied.
For Gentlemen and <hi>Letterati,</hi> who have not taken any degree, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
for them to wear a wide large <hi>Vest,</hi> but much differing from that
which is ordinarily worne. The Ministers and officers of the chief <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi>
as also, in all the courts of justice, those who are under the <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
use this <hi>Ceremonie;</hi> which is, to take off the badge, which they weare
upon their breast, and to put on a girdle of a small price; which they use
only some few daies in the year, when they go about, to make their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beysance.
The young people, if they have not taken a degree, use only
their ordinary habit.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>courtesie,</hi> which the common people use, is to clap their hands one
upon the other, and lift them up as high as their head. The same is used
by friends and kindred, when they treat one another freely, and without
<hi>Ceremony;</hi> and if they be equals, they both together do the same reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
once; only he is esteemed to have the advantage, that stands on the
right hand; as among us, that takes off the hat last, though both do unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Among grave people the ordinary <hi>Ceremony</hi> used in their visits, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations
and meetings, is; that, standing on their feet they make on obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
even to the ground once, without any more adoe: children to their
Fathers on certain daies, as <hi>New years day,</hi> the Fathers birth-day, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
feastivals, use the second courtesie of four bowings, standing on their
feet, and four kneelings on their knees, and they to whom it is done, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it sitting. The same <hi>Ceremony</hi> do the Scholars pay their Masters;
who receive it standing. The same do the inferiour <hi>Mandarines</hi> use to the
<hi>Magistrate;</hi> and Idolaters to the Idols, and the <hi>Mandarines</hi> to the King;
excepting that these last hold an Ivory Tablet a palm and a half long, and
four fingers broad, before their faces: finally, the King himself doth the
same in the temples, and to his mother; and when he doth it, he holdeth
the said Tablet of Ivory before his face.</p>
                     <p>The first time they see one another, and are Persons of an equall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and he that visiteth, or is visited, will shew an extraordinary affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and respect, he causeth a Carpet to be brought and spread before
them, and after the first ordinary courtesie, they performe the second knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down four times, and this they do both together. They avoid, as I
have said, all meeting abroad, as much as possibly they can; but if they
cannot decline it, they salute one another by turnes out of their Sedans,
lifting up their arms to their head, bowed in form of a bow, beginning at
least 20 paces off before they meet, still doing the same very leisurely,
whilst the encounter lasteth; If the one be inferiour to the other, and be
carried in a Sedan, he causeth it to be set down on the ground; if he be on
horseback, he alighteth and standeth on his feet; and as the other passeth
by, he maketh him a profound reverence, even unto the ground: if they
be not <hi>Mandarines,</hi> they perform the ordinary <hi>Courtesie</hi> to one another: if
they be common people, they hold up their hands, and passe along.</p>
                     <p>The servants in great houses are not to do any reverence unlesse it be
at certain times and occasions: as, when himself or his Lord or Master
cometh home from abroad, or at the beginning of the new year, &amp;c. They
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64464:42"/>
fall down on their knees, bowing their head to the ground, once, or
thrice.</p>
                     <p>The ordinary reverence, which they make before their Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
is to stand upright with their armes hanging down. Those that
belong to the <hi>Tribunals,</hi> and also the servants and serjeants of the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines,</hi>
in publick, alwaies speak to their Masters upon their knees; as also
the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> and <hi>Defendant,</hi> with their caps off.</p>
                     <p>To give or receive a thing with one hand only, is accounted little man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
among persons of the same condition, and if an inferiour doth it to
his superiour, it is an incivilitie. In a word, they are excessive in their <hi>civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>
and good manners; which seems rather more proper for divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
than civill respect. To be courteous, and outwardly well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
to do things with maturity, circumspection, gravity and eaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
they account among their chiefest vertues: all which are expressed
in this word <hi>Li:</hi> in which they comprehend also the circumstances of
time, and habit; and the <hi>Thie,</hi> with which they are performed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Thie</hi> is a bill or book, with folds within and without, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the breadth of ones hand, and a palm long, and it is of three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
fashions. The largest hath six leaves: the midling three, and the least
one: and all use them according to the custome of the Province and the
quality of the Person, that doth visite, or is visited. The <hi>Colai</hi> seldome use
other, than the small ones.</p>
                     <p>That which is used in the ordinary visits is white with a red streak on
the outside. If the visit be for to present their respects, or an invitation to
a feast, it is all of red paper: if it be to condole, or for the death of any
one, it is accommodated to the colour of mourning: if it come from one
that is in mourning, the letters are <hi>Azure,</hi> as also the streak on the outside;
the paper is white, but much differing from the ordinary paper, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used upon this occasion.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Thie</hi> containeth no more than one line of writing, which is that
in the Margin; if it be a friend, or one that would shew himself such, he
writeth the line quite out: if he be not such, he leaveth out the two first
letters, and beginneth at the third place: if he would seem grave or stately,
beside the two first he leaveth out also the fourth, and beginneth with the
the third, going on with the rest, which are never left out. The writing
importeth thus much in English <hi>Your Lordships most intimate friend, and the
perpetuall schollar of your learning .N. commeth to kisse your hands, and to do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to your Lordship.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Thie</hi> is given to the porter, who presenteth it to his Master, and
giveth him notice of the stranger, and who he is. Sometimes the visit is
received, but not the <hi>Thie;</hi> and then he that receiveth the visit, is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to returne it. But it is otherwise, when the <hi>Thie</hi> is left; for although
it be only given to the porter, because the lord is not at home, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he will not admit of a visit, yet he is obliged to return a visit to
the other. Inferiours, as Souldiers to their Captaines, the lesser <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi>
to the greater, cannot make use of a <hi>Thie,</hi> but they make another
kind of thing of the same forme, but much different in paper and style;
neither may it have a stroke on the outside, or say, that they come to visit;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64464:42"/>
but only, who they are, what office they beare, and what their businesse is;
and it is almost like a petition, which they call <hi>Pimthie,</hi> that is, a bill of
advice. Those of the greater <hi>Quality,</hi> such as are the <hi>Colai, Vice-royes</hi> and
the like, many times visit not, nor render a visit, in their own persons;
but only send a <hi>Thie</hi> from their house, or leave it at the gate as they passe
by.</p>
                     <p>They are as free of their visits, even to strangers, as we are to our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
friends: but with the same facility and libertie, that they go to visit
they will often excuse themselves, if they be visited; and it is enough to
say, they are not at home, unlesse it be to a person of some great qualitie
and respect; or that he hath often come to visit him; then they will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny him admittance. By how much the person is of a greater and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
quality, with so much the more difficulty doth he admit of visits: and
some to free themselves, &amp; to avoyd the trouble of these <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> write
upon a piece of paper in white letters, and clap it over their gate, <hi>That they
are retired to their garden house;</hi> by which means they are excused from the
molestation of these <hi>Civilities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The visit must be, (like that of the Physitian,) in the morning; for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the evening it is not esteemed to be of so much courtesie; nor must
it be a visit by the way, going upon other businesse; and if at any time they
make such a visit, they excuse themselves, saying, They will take another
time to satisfie the intention of their obligation and <hi>devoir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For ordinarie visits they have no set time; there are times neverthelesse,
wherein acquaintance, friends and kindred are obliged to pay this <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
The chiefe and principall time is the <hi>first day of the new yeare;</hi> wishing
one another an happy new yeare: at which time there is a great multitude
of sedans, horses, and people up and down the streets: for then visits are
most frequent. Many times they go not into the house, but leave a <hi>Thie,</hi>
and go their way; and if they enter, they are obliged to eat and drink, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be but a little. The second time is on the <hi>fifteenth</hi> of the same
month; But the visits are not so frequent, and the feasting more, because
it is at the ending of the <hi>fifteen</hi> days, which they call the feastivall of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thornes;</hi>
because during that time they set many of them up and down the
streets on gates, and in windowes; and some of them are very faire and
costly.</p>
                     <p>The third is the <hi>Third</hi> day of the <hi>Third moone</hi> which is in <hi>March,</hi> and is
called <hi>Cimnim.</hi> They go all then to the sepulchres, to perform there
their sacrifices and other <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> and although they bewaile their
dead, certaine it is, that the living make good cheere among themselves.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is the <hi>fift</hi> day of the <hi>fift moone,</hi> which they call <hi>Tuonù.</hi> The
people keep a festivall at that time in the streets and high-ways, and upon
the rivers; although sometimes this is forbidden, by reason of the disasters,
which often fall out upon the rivers.</p>
                     <p>The fift is upon the <hi>Seaventh</hi> day of the <hi>Seaventh moone,</hi> at what time
they begg abilitie and power of the moone; as also they do the like up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Ninth</hi> day of the <hi>Ninth moone.</hi> They visit one another and send
Presents; and every feastivall hath its Presents that are proper to it.</p>
                     <p>Beside these feastivalls, they visit upon occasion of death, of changing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64464:43"/>
their houses, of marriage, at the birth of a sonne, at the promotion to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or office, or higher dignitie, at the taking of a journy, upon the birth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day,
and especially when they enter upon any seaventh year of their age,
and in these cases they must not make an empty visit, but are always to
send some Present.</p>
                     <p>When one undertaketh a long journy, all his friends visit him, and
send him presents. But when he returneth, he is to visit and present them;
who performed those kind offices to him.</p>
                     <p>They visit likewise the sick, but only at the gate, who seldome admit of
a visit within, unlesse it be from an intimate friend.</p>
                     <p>In these visits, they are very punctuall; sons towards their father; scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
towards their Masters; inferiours toward their superiours, and the
whole Kingdome toward the King: so that on his birth-day, at the foure
quarters of the year, and at the chiefe feastivals, the <hi>vice-roy</hi> together with
all the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of the Province dispatch away an Embassadour to
court to visit the King in the name of all that Province. They which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
at the court, as well <hi>Letterati,</hi> as Captaines; on the same days go in
person to court, to do their <hi>devoirs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have severall Hals well accommodated for the receiving of visits;
the first is common to all: The visitant may enter thither and sit downe,
without giving any notice of his being there; And although he find not
the porter to usher him in, they have another farther in, which they call
the private Hall: Hitherto may their kindred and intimate friends come;
but no further; least they should go into that part of the house, which is
called <hi>Hui,</hi> and is the place where the women are; whither the serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the house are not suffered to come, unlesse they be very young. In
the outward Hall they come to receive their visitants: and after the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courtesies are performed, the master of the house with his owne
hands bringeth a chaire, and fitteth it with a cushion, and if they are many,
he bringeth a chaires, and accommodateth them for them all. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
they al of them accommodate a chaire for him. He leaveth every one
to take the place that is due to him; and if it be not, that some one of them
hath a particular respect, due to his dignity or office, the sonnes, cousins,
scholars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take place according to their age; and if they do not know
one anothers age, they ask it. The Master of the house taketh always the
lowest place. After they are seated, presently the drink called <hi>Cià</hi> is
brought in, which they also take according to the same order of prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</p>
                     <p>In some Provinces, the often presenting of this drink is esteemed the
greater honour: But in the Province of <hi>Hamcheu,</hi> if it be brought the third
time, it intimateth to the visitant, that it is time for him to take his leave. If
the visitant be a friend, and maketh any stay, presently there is a table set
with sweet-meats and fruits: nor do they ever make drie visits; which is
the custome almost of all <hi>Asia,</hi> contrary to the use of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In exercising their courtesies, (whether it be a son before his father, or
a scholar before his master,) for the most part they are more hearers, than
speakers; the young people being never forward in speaking. The termes
which they use in speaking are very honourable, and full of respect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64464:43"/>
others, and humble toward themselves: and as it is not good
manners to call any one <hi>You,</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italie,</hi> so neither is it among
them to say <hi>I.</hi> Wherefore they never use this word, but other termes
in stead of it as the Foster-child, the Scholar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the sonne, when
he speaketh to his father, nameth himselfe <hi>His youngest Sonne;</hi> although
he be the eldest, and is already married: servants to their masters
stile themselves <hi>Siaove:</hi> and the youngest of them <hi>Siaoti:</hi> he that pleadeth
at a Tribunall, stileth himselfe <hi>the delinquent;</hi> a Christian at his confession
<hi>the sinner;</hi> the women in the palace (excepting the Queenes) and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs
speaking to the King, use <hi>your majesties slave, Nupor,</hi> every one else
speaking to the King nameth himselfe <hi>vassall, Chin.</hi> If one doth not speak
of his owne person, but of such as belong to him, he is to use modest terms
and expressions, The father saith of his sonne, <hi>My young sonne.</hi> The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<hi>My young scholar,</hi> and the sonne speaking of his father, calleth him,
<hi>The father of the house;</hi> The servant of the Master, <hi>The Lord of the house.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In speaking one with another they use alwaies honourable Titles, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us <hi>Your worship, Your honour,</hi> &amp;c. but they have this quality besides,
that even to mean and inferiour people they give an honourable name, as
to an Host, <hi>Chiu, Gin, Kia, the man, Lord of the house.</hi> To a barge man, <hi>The
chiefe man of the vessell.</hi> To a mulitier, <hi>The great wand.</hi> But if they would
anger him, they call him by his ordinary name, <hi>Can Kio,</hi> that is, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
of the feet. To servants, if they be grave men, <hi>The great master of the
house.</hi> To the ministers of the courts of justice, and to them which
waite on the <hi>Mandarines, Man on horseback</hi> or <hi>Cavalier,</hi> and yet they always
go on foote. If they speak to a woman, although she be not of kin to
them, they call her <hi>Tasao,</hi> that is, sister-in-law; but sometimes it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
that he which cannot speake the language well, in stead of sister in
law, calleth her <hi>Broome,</hi> by an equivocation of the word.</p>
                     <p>In speaking also of such things, as belo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be done in certaine particular phrases: So that if he speak of his sonne, or

as they list, without any ceremony.</p>
                     <p>As they are so punctuall and excessive in the manner of their treating
and naming one another; so also are they in the diverse names which
they have, and which they take up according to their age. These are of
five sorts.</p>
                     <p>The first is the <hi>Sir-name,</hi> which they take infallibly from their Father,
and never that of the Mother, or the Mothers Father; but the Mother
takes the name of the Husband.</p>
                     <p>The second is a name which they call, <hi>The little</hi> or <hi>young name,</hi> which
the Father imposeth; when they are little ones; and it is commonly the
name of some living creature, or flower, or of some day, &amp;c. and by this
name only the Father and Mother may call them; but the servants only by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64464:44"/>
the first, second, and third, &amp;c. as hath been said.</p>
                     <p>The third is when he goeth to school; for the Master giveth him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
name, which, joyned with the <hi>Sir-name,</hi> composeth a name, by which
both his Master and Schoole-fellows call him.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, when they put on the <hi>Nett</hi> or <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>le</hi> upon their head, of
which we spake before: this is done when they are seaventeen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of age: for at that time particularly, if one marry a wife, he
taketh a new name, which they call a letter; and by this all may call him,
except the servants.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is at the going out of his youth, when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> assumeth an other
name, which they cal <hi>The great Name</hi> or <hi>Hao;</hi> by this all may cal him, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himself and his parents.</p>
                     <p>Now to return to the Hall, where we left the guests conversing; at
their departure, the Guests joyning all together make an ordinary reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Master of the house, giving him thanks for their good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment;
and he accompanieth them out to the street; where if they
came on foot, both parties make ordinary reverence to each other and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part;
if on horse-back, or in a sedan or coach, then they make three reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;
and the third <hi>Congie</hi> is made at the gate; where presently the
Master of the House goeth in, and the Guest taketh horse; for to ride or
take coach in his presence is not counted good manners. When they are
on horseback, or in the sedan, the Master of the House commeth out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and they take leave of one another, and when they are gone a few
paces off, they interchangeably send a servant with an embassie or message
<hi>(To Pai Xam)</hi> and recommendations.</p>
                     <p>When the visit is the first time made, and the Person be of quality,
commonly tis with a present, assoon as they are come in: and for the most
part in <hi>China,</hi> the ordinary and constant presents are some stuffs, ornaments
for women, things of use; as Shoes, Stockings, Handkerchieffes, <hi>Porcellane,</hi>
Inke, Pensils, and things to eat; and they do commonly choose those of the
best sort to present,</p>
                     <p>The Present, if it be of things to eat among friends, it is to be of 4. 6. 8.
or more things. With the present is sent also a <hi>Thie,</hi> or bill of visit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is written what they have sent. If he do not accept of it, it is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtesie;
neither if he take part only, and send back the rest: but he must
answer him with a <hi>Thie,</hi> giving him thanks, and excusing himself, that he
did not receive it; or if he do take part, he is to write, what he took, and
what he sent back. Among men of greater quality, and that will shew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to a Person without doing much harm to their purses, they write
first, the things which they will send, and send the <hi>Thie,</hi> before they send
the present; of which, because it ordinarily consisteth of many things, they
do not receive all; and he who is presented maketh a prick at those things
written in the <hi>Thie,</hi> which he will receive: then he, which presenteth,
buyeth only the things which the other hath pricked, and letteth alone
the rest: if he accepteth of them all, he buyeth them all and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them.</p>
                     <p>There are some Imaginarie presents, of which, he that presenteth them,
is secure, that little or nothing of them will be received; and yet they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64464:44"/>
consist of many things in number, as sometimes of thirty or fourty: and
are costly in their quality; and pieces of Damask, and other silk stuffe, silk
stockings; and many things to be eaten, as Hens, Ducks, &amp;c. These
things are many times hired, and that which is received, is paid for, the rest
are sent back to the owner, with some consideration for the loan of them.</p>
                     <p>The custome is, that he, who receiveth a Present, is to return another
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>equivalent to it. Excepting alway edible things among friends; and that
which any bringeth, when he cometh from abroad, and from Countries
where those things are particularly to be had. Neither do they remunerate
those, which they call <hi>Presents of dependencie;</hi> as from the inferiour to the
superiour; from the Master to the Scholar; nor of pretenders and suitours.</p>
                     <p>It is also the custome to give the Page or Servant, which bringeth the
Present, some mony, more or lesse, according to the quality of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
shewing great respect to him that sends it.</p>
                     <p>They of <hi>Kiamsi,</hi> as more expert in their expences, and more cunning
in the <hi>Lesina,</hi> or art of thrift, are very subtle and skilfull in this particular;
and for a Present which is worth a Crowne, they say, they are to give the
servant six pence, and proportionably in the rest.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of their Banquets.</head>
                     <p>Much time and money is consumed by the <hi>Chinesses</hi> in their <hi>Banquets,</hi>
by reason they are almost continually at them. There is no mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
departure, or arrivall, or any prosperous successe of a friend or kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which is not celebrated with a <hi>Banquet;</hi> nor any accident of disgust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
grief, for which they do not likewise make a <hi>Banquet</hi> of consolation;
nor any businesse of importance, but it is to be treated of at a Banquet,
neither without one do they begin any work, or finish any building.
They make many others upon no other motive but this, <hi>Comedamus, &amp;
bibamus, cras enim moriemur;</hi> let us eate and drink, for to morrow we shall
die.</p>
                     <p>It is very ordinary among the common people, and particularly among
officers of the same office, to have <hi>Co-fraternities</hi> which they call a
<hi>Brotherhood</hi> of the month. The <hi>Brotherhood</hi> consisteth of thirty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the number of daies therein; and in a circle they go every day
to eat at one anothers houses by turnes, making a <hi>Banquet,</hi> like that of the
sonnes of <hi>Iob.</hi> If they have not convenience to receive them in their own
house, they provide it at another mans, there being at this day many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
houses very wel furnisht for this purpose. If he wil have it at home, but
without any trouble to his <hi>Family,</hi> he appointeth, how many messes he
will have, how many dishes, and what meat; and they are brought home
to him very well drest.</p>
                     <p>Those of the North are very much different from them of the South:
for they of the South are very exact, even to the least matters in these
courtesies of <hi>Banquets,</hi> and they do esteem themselves more friendly and
courteous, than the others; as in truth they are.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:64464:45"/>In their <hi>Banquets</hi> they are more carefull to have varietie, and to have it
well drest, than for the quantitie of the meat: and feast more for conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
and to treate with one another, than to eat and drink; although they
do both the one and the other pretty well. They drink at the beginning
of the feast, and so continue it with wine and meat, without bread or rice,
till the guests say, they have had wine enough: Then presently the rice is
brought, and the glasses are set by, and there is no more drinking.</p>
                     <p>In the Northern Countries their custome is contrary to this: The ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
are but few, the Messes well furnisht, the dishes large and full:
and when the ordinary ceremonies are performed, which are usuall
through the whole Kingdome, they begin with the meat; and every one
taketh that which pleaseth him best, and as much as he can eat; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
without quenching thirst, either with wine or water: for then
they drink neither. They conclude with rice. When the dishes are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, they discourse about an houre; and then they serve in others,
only of salt meats, as Gammons of Bacon, tongues, and such like things,
which they call <hi>Guides,</hi> that is, of wine; and then they begin to drink.</p>
                     <p>To speak in generall of the whole Kingdome; they do not usually drink
wine, neither at dinner, which is in the morning five hours before noone,
nor at supper, which is about foure a cloak in the afternoone; but at night
before they go to bed, then using salt meats, as is abovesaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for this
reason their <hi>Banquets</hi> are most commonly at night; making use of the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
for their studyes and businesse; supplying this light at night with
candles, of which they have great quantitie, made of a certaine oyle,
which they harden up with a little waxe; which serveth them in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
reserving for the summer those which are made of waxe; of which
they have three sorts: The one is Bees waxe; the other is taken out of the
holes of a certain sort of Snakes, much better than the other, and much
whiter, without any art used to it. The third is taken from a tree, whose
fruit is like our filberts, and the meat very white. And though this last,
be not so good as our waxe; yet it is better than suet: it melteth very well,
and maketh very good candles.</p>
                     <p>The people of the better qualitie make <hi>Banquets</hi> of more state; for they
have houses of recreation, either in the City, or very neere it for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
adorned with many costly pictures and other curiosities. And if
the person invited be an Officer, or man of great qualitie, although the use
of <hi>Tapestrie-hanging</hi> in <hi>China</hi> is very rare, yet for the entertainment of these,
they hang their houses with them very curiously, even the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eeling and all.
The number of their Tables sheweth the greatnesse of the <hi>Banquet.</hi> One
Table for four, or one for two, is ordinary. But for persons of greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they set one Table for each; and sometimes two; one to eat at, and
the other to set the dishes on. The Tables at these <hi>Banquets</hi> have all <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,</hi>
or a peice of linnen hanging downe from the edges, but neither Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-cloath
nor Napkins, using only their <hi>Charan,</hi> a neate and polished var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
with which their Tables are covered. They lay no knives, the meat
being all carved out before it come from the kitchin; nor forke, using two
little sticks, with which they eat very dexterously. They set neither salt,
pepper, nor vineger, but yet musterd, and other sauces, of which they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64464:45"/>
have many and very good. They serve in at the same <hi>Banquet</hi> flesh and
fish; boyld and roast; fry'd meat; and meat in pottage and white-broth;
and severall other viands drest after their manner; and very good. They
use broths much; but they never serve up any without flesh or fish in it, or
a kinde of Paste, like that which the Italians call <hi>Vermicelli.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Anciently they used neither Tables nor seats, but according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the greatest part of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> they sate and eat upon the
pavement, covered with mats; and to this day, their writings and books
speaking of Tables, use for the significative letter of Table, that which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
a mat. The <hi>Giapponesses,</hi> with most of the neighbouring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
even to this day, keep their ancient custome, of sitting and eating
upon the ground: but the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> from the raign of <hi>Han,</hi> have used
seats and Tables; of which they have many beautifull ones, and of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
fashions.</p>
                     <p>In the disposition of their invitations, courtesies, and entertainments
they have much superfluitie; as well before the coming of the guests, as at
the beginning, prosecution, and conclusion of their <hi>Banquets.</hi> Before they
begin to eate, the master of the house inviteth them to fall to. About the
middle of the feast they change their little cups for greater: they force
none to drink, but modestly invite them. The times, when they most
commonly and infallibly make their banquets; are the feastivall days, both
of the year, and of each man in particular, as marriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Besides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
infinitie occasions above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>The better sort of people, when one takes a journey, or returns from
another Countrie, do make a <hi>Feast;</hi> and it falleth out many times, that on
the same day they are faine to go to seaven or eight invitations, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with their friends. Some daies before the <hi>Banquet</hi> (that is when they
have time enough) they send a <hi>Thie,</hi> by which they make their invitation,
and pray them to accept of it. If they refuse, they excuse themselves with
another <hi>Thie.</hi> But if they accept of it, they send them another <hi>Thie;</hi> which
they call the <hi>Thie of solicitation.</hi> The time of the <hi>Banquet</hi> being come,
they commonly stay, till all are met; entertaining themselves in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Hall. When all are come, they enter into the Hall of the <hi>Banquet;</hi>
and the master of the house performeth the usuall ceremonies to them all,
as well insitting, as in placing the cups and <hi>eating-sticks.</hi> The ceremonies
being ended, they all seate themselves in their order; and the master of
the house taketh care to go up and down, and invite them to eat and drink.
Their <hi>Banquets</hi> are very long, and they spend much time in discoursing;
but the ordinary custome is to have <hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>Comedies:</hi> and the Comedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are obliged to act whatsoever the Guests command them. At length
the <hi>Banquet</hi> endeth, by the importunate entreatie of the Guests; to which
he that inviteth them, still seemeth to make resistance. The day after the
feast, all the Guests send their <hi>Thie</hi> to the person that invited them; which
containeth partly the praise and commendations of the Banquet, and all
that they had there, and partly their thanks to him that gave it them.</p>

<hi>Rookes,</hi> but cannot <hi>Check</hi> the contrary <hi>King,</hi> but only, when between one
of them and the King, there is another man immediately interposed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be his own man, or an enemy. So that the <hi>King</hi> may avoyd that
<hi>Check</hi> three manner of ways: either by removing into the next place, or
by interposing another man; or else by taking away that man, that
stood betwixt him and his enemie, &amp; so, by laying himselfe open, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
                     <p>They have another grave game among them, which is as followeth.
On a <hi>Chess-board</hi> of 300. places: they play wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and a hundred black: with these, each endeavoureth to drive the others
men into the middle of the <hi>Chess board,</hi> that he might be master of the
other places: in conclusion he that hath gained himselfe most places, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the game. In this game the officers do passe their time with a great
deale of delight, and often spend a great part of the day at it; for between
those that are skilfull, one game will take up an hours time. Those that
are expert at this game, are well esteemed, though it be only upon this
account; and are therefore often called and received, as masters of this
<hi>Game,</hi> with all ceremonie.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chinesses</hi> also use the game of <hi>Dice,</hi> which have the same shape and
points, as ours, without any difference.</p>
                     <p>The common people do much use a game called by the <hi>Italians Giuoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in <hi>Europe.</hi> They play most at it in their <hi>Banquets,</hi> between two, who shall
drink; and he that loseth, gaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> for this purpose, have a drum placed without the Hall,
where they eat; and there standeth a man, who beateth on it at adventure
as many stroaks, as he thinks fit; and when he beateth on the drum, they
begin to count from the first man of the Banquet; and he at whom the
drum stoppeth, is obliged to drink. In the City of <hi>Nankim</hi> there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
game much practised among the common people. They buy a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Capons, the best they can find, or else fish or <hi>Porcellane,</hi> or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing they please; but it must be excellent in its kind to excite an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64464:46"/>
in others to win it. Then one holdeth in his hand, ten pieces of
their mony, the which have letters on the one side, and on the other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
This man offereth them to him that will throw, and he throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them ten times; and if in any of these times all the pieces light with
the same side upward, either written or not written, he gaineth the reward
that is proposed, if not, he loseth an halfe-penny.</p>
                     <p>There is not wanting in <hi>China</hi> the game of <hi>Cock-fighting,</hi> which is used
also throughout all <hi>India:</hi> they have <hi>Cocks</hi> bred up for this purpose. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they fight they fasten to each legg neare to their spurs a small ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour:
then he that keepeth the field, having made the other fly or fall, is
<hi>Conquerour,</hi> and winneth the other cock, and whatsoever was abetted on
his head. But because many times they wound one another so just at the
same time, that they both fall together, that Cock, which after he is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
pecks at the other, or croweth, is accounted <hi>victour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They combate after the same manner with <hi>Quailes;</hi> and to his purpose
they commonly breed up the <hi>Cock-Quails</hi> with great care. This <hi>Game</hi>
is particularly in request among the <hi>Kings</hi> kindred, and the <hi>Eunuches</hi> of
the Palace; in which they spend a great deale of mony. These birds do
fight very furiously and desperately.</p>
                     <p>They fight likewise with <hi>Grillo's,</hi> or <hi>Cricquets;</hi> and this sport is much
used in the Spring time. They have little houses made of clay very arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
to keep them in: when they fight them, each man pulleth out his
<hi>Cricquet,</hi> and putteth him into a Bason, or other clean vessell, and, with a
little slice, or spattle, they put them to one another, and when they are
neere enough to launce at one another, they do it with such fury, that
many times one will fetch off the others leg at the first blow. He that
conquereth, presently singeth, and winneth teh game. This game is
much used in <hi>Pekim,</hi> and particularly by the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> who spend a great
deale of money at it.</p>
                     <p>They do not permit young children, that study; to play at any game;
the bigger sort have games proper to their age, which are very like
those our youth have in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are forbidden to play at cards or dice; and if they be taken, or
accused for it, they are chastifed and condemned to a pecuniary mulct;
and some are imprisoned only for spending too much time at play. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

                     <p>IN the Kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> (as doth plainly appear by their books, and
Chronicles,) formal <hi>Marriages</hi> and indissoluble after contract, have been
in use above 2400 yeares; and in ancient time they used certain particular
Ceremonies at the celebration thereof; one of which was, giving the
hand. But these have been changed by time, some being taken away, and
many others added.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:64464:47"/>Alwaies from that time to this, there hath been among them two kinds
of <hi>Marriage;</hi> one a true one, with a matrimoniall contract for their whole
life between the two parties; and then the woman is called a <hi>wife;</hi> and
treated as such, and received with extraordinary Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>The second is rather a <hi>Concubinage</hi> permitted by their lawes, in case
they have no children by their <hi>wife;</hi> especially sonnes, but now it is grown
so common, that although some do forbear having them upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of vert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e; yet it is very ordinary among rich men, to take <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi>
although they have children. The manner is very different from the
true and legitimate <hi>Marriage;</hi> for although they contract after some
sort with the Father of the maiden: and that they treat one another as
kindred; yet in truth she is bought and sold; and many times by a Person
that hath no relation to her, but only that he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed her up for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
for there are many in <hi>China,</hi> which breed up young maidens, and
teach them Musick, and dancing, and other perquisites of womens bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
only to sell them afterwards for <hi>Concubines,</hi> at a great price. Yet
however it is not accounted a <hi>Matrimony;</hi> nor hath it the solemnitie of
<hi>Marriage</hi> belonging to it; nor any obligation of perpetuity; but the man
may put her away; and she may marrie with another; there being no law
which prohibits it, in case she be wholly withdrawn from the company
of the first.</p>
                     <p>The manner of treating them is very different They eat apart by
themselves in their own chambers: and are in subjection to the true
<hi>wife,</hi> and serve her in some things, as her Servants. The children which
they beare, do not do them reverence as to a mother, but they pay it to
the true <hi>wife,</hi> whom also they call mother. Hence it is, that if the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine</hi>
die that bore them, they are not obliged to three years mourning,
nor to deprive themselves of entrance into the examinations, nor (if they
govern,) to quit their charge; which, (as you shall hear hereafter,) is to be
done at the death of their parents. Therefore, although he be an only
sonne, he is not obliged to these duties: but only when his Fathers
lawfull <hi>wife</hi> dieth, although she be not his true mother. When the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>
dieth, the government of the estate and family falleth to the lawfull
<hi>wife,</hi> and to the children, whether they be, by her, or by the <hi>Concubine.</hi> But
when the lawfull <hi>wife</hi> dieth, it falleth to the <hi>Concubine</hi> and her children, if
she have any.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes it falleth out, that they take a <hi>Concubine,</hi> and keep her on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
till she bring them a sonne: for, if the lawfull <hi>wife</hi> will not suffer her to
stay, assoone as the child is born, they send her away, or marry her to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
&amp; the child which staieth behind, never knoweth her who bore him,
acknowledging only for his Mother his Fathers lawfull <hi>wife.</hi> It happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
also many times, that a man taketh an excessive affection to his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine,</hi>
and then all goeth amisse, but only in what belongeth to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
observance, which must not be changed. <hi>Widows</hi> may marry, if
they will; but they that are women of qualitie seldome or never do it; no
although they be young and have no children. They are to live in their
Father in laws house, and are for this reason much esteemed.</p>
                     <p>In the legitimate <hi>Marriage</hi> for the most part, they observe an equalitie
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64464:47"/>
of estate and condition; but in their <hi>Concubines,</hi> they have regard only to
their naturall endowments. They may not marry with any of their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
on their Fathers side, in no degree whatsoever, nor with any of the
same <hi>Sir-name;</hi> but they may marry with their kindred on the Mothers
side, if they be in a remote degree; but that is not so exactly observed. A
young maid will hardly marry with a widdower, which they call <hi>patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the house, and the bed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They never marry, although they be never so great friends, without a
Mediator, or one that goeth between both parties; wherefore they chuse
whom they please, there being as well men as women, who perform this
office. The <hi>Bride-groom</hi> never seeth the <hi>Bride,</hi> before he entreth the
doore to take her for his wife: there Fathers marry their sonnes ordinarilie
very young, &amp; promise them in <hi>Mariage</hi> even from little children, &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
before they are borne, which promise these punctually performe,
although their Fathers die before the time, or one of the parties fall from
his honour, or estate, &amp;c. excepting both parties voluntarily agree to break
off the contract: &amp; if by chance the sonne for some respects will not stand
to the contract made by his father, they compel him by law to perform it.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>China,</hi> before the Father die, there is no formall portion given, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to sonne or daughter; among the meaner sort of people the ordinarie
custome is, not absolutely to buy their <hi>wives,</hi> as some say, but the <hi>hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>
giveth a certain quantitie of mony to the Father of the maid, with
which to buy her clothes, and ornaments for her head, suitable to her
qualitie. This summe is alwaies of the largest for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
but the Fathers save as much out of it, as they can; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,
being to accrue to them. Hence it is, that some have said, that
the <hi>Chinesses</hi> buy their wives; there being not wanting some ground for this
beleefe: for to this day they agree with the Father of the maid for so much
money; which if it be not given them, they wil not part with their daughter.</p>
                     <p>Among the <hi>Nobility</hi> there is no talk of giving any money, but the Father
of the <hi>Bride</hi> is obliged to comply with what the stile and custome of
that Kingdome requireth, each according to their abilitie: and commonly
that which he giveth is all necessary Furniture for her apartment, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the bed; which, although all things are very cheap in that Country,
will sometimes cost fifty Crowns. He giveth her four or two maid ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
to wait upon her, and some money; and of all this more or lesse,
according to his ability. But land or possession they almost never give,
unlesse the Brides Father be very rich, or that he would match her to some
principall Person; and that only in case he have no sonnes.</p>
                     <p>After the contract is performed between their Fathers, then there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
many curtesies and compliments; as first, the <hi>Bride-groom</hi> sendeth the
<hi>Bride</hi> a present of things to eate, as flesh, wine, and fruit; Secondly, a
day is chosen for their <hi>Marriage:</hi> which, when it is resolved on by advice
of <hi>Astrologers,</hi> is celebrated with great Ceremonie. The third is, to send
to know the <hi>Brides</hi> name; and last of all, the <hi>Bride-groom</hi> sendeth the jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
to the <hi>Bride,</hi> that is, a ring and eare-pendants, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The day before the <hi>Bride</hi> is to be received; they send from the <hi>Brides</hi>
house the <hi>Houshould-stuffe</hi> and <hi>Furniture</hi> that is given with her; making a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64464:48"/>
procession with them; which is to be done about noone, that all may see it;
The men that carry it, go two and two, each of them bearing a piece of
houshold-stuff of the same kind, that the other doth, whether it be <hi>Tables,
Chaires, Chests, Curtains, Bed,</hi> or what other thing soever.</p>
                     <p>The day following, in some Provinces, the <hi>Bridegroome</hi> goeth in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
on Horse-back, with his Father and neerest kindred, to receive the <hi>Bride:</hi>
who is carried in a sedan with great pompe and state. In other Provinces,
especially towards the South, the <hi>Bride-groome</hi> sendeth the sedan toward
the evening (they have some very curious ones, made only for this purpose,
richly adorned with silk, and the doore to be locked on the outside) and a
great deale of company to waite upon her with lights set in wooden frams
like lanthornes. The mother after the <hi>Bride</hi> hath finished the usuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment,
at parting, putteth her into the sedan and locketh the doore, and
sendeth the key before to her sonne-in-laws mother; and so she departeth
along with the company, who go all before her, excepting the maid-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
which her Father giveth her, who go by her side.</p>
                     <p>When she is come to the <hi>Bride-groomes</hi> house, the mother-in-law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locketh
the sedan and taking out the <hi>Bride,</hi> delivereth her to the <hi>Bride-groome;</hi>
Then they go both together to the Chappell, or Oratorie of their
Idols, where are likewise kept the Images or names of their Predecessours.
There they make the ordinarie reverence of bowing themselves foure
times upon their knees, and presently they go forward into the inward
Hall, where their parents are sitting in Chaires, to whom they make the
same reverences; then the <hi>Bride</hi> retireth with her Mother-in-law, her way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
maids, and the woman that did negotiate the marriage, to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
apartment; where she hath a particular chamber for her selfe and
her husband; into which, as is abovesaid, no other man may enter, no not
their Father or elder brother, so that if the Father would chastise the son
for any fault, (which is ordinarie there for their Fathers to do, although
their sonnes be married) if he can get into his wives chamber he is safe, for
the Father may not enter there, nor speak with his daughter-in-law, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
on some occasions, which are dispensed with: So carefull a watch
do they keep on that <hi>precious Gemme of Honour.</hi> The <hi>Bridegroome,</hi> when he
doeth not retire, stayeth with his Father, kindred, and friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who
spend many daies together in continuall feasts and banquetting: when the
first month is over, the Bride returneth home to her Fathers house, which
they call <hi>Queinim,</hi> that is retiring to rest.</p>
                     <p>The sonnes do all equally inherit; although they be but halfe-Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and not begotten on the lawfull wife, having regard in this only to
the Father. The sisters have no more than what is given with them at
their marriage. If the Father die before he hath married his daughters,
the brothers are obliged to bestow them in marriage; and the sonnes that
are already married, (if the Father in his life time divide his estate among
them,) are bound to maintaine their sisters, till they are married.</p>
                     <p>Neverthelesse in <hi>China</hi> there are some families, especially of the <hi>Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
where the eldest sonnes do inherit the <hi>Majorasgo,</hi> or the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part of the land, if they have any that is so entaild; although they
have other brothers. And these children are called <hi>Que Cum, Chu, Hui,
Heupè, Chei, Hei.</hi>

                     <p>ALthough the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> in many things, especially those which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the government of their life, have been of the same opinion
with the <hi>Europaean</hi> Philosophers, yet they are very different from them in
that which belongeth to <hi>Death.</hi> For the others have taken little or no
care about the <hi>Sepulture</hi> of the body, whereas these esteem nothing more;
using in their life time all possible diligence to leave every thing ready and
in order for it; and their sonnes do in nothing more shew their pietie and
obedience, than by putting it in execution after their Fathers death.</p>
                     <p>It is a generall custome of the whole Kingdome, not to bury any one
barely in the earth, although it be a child of two daies old. Every one is
to have his <hi>Chest,</hi> or <hi>Coffin</hi> according to his qualitie, and abilitie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the rich men, (although the <hi>Chinesses</hi> are very thrifty, and parcimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous)
do in this exceed all extreames, seeking out wood for that purpose,
of the greatest price and esteem, that they possibly can.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eunuches</hi> are the most excessive this way, because they have no
children to inherit their wealth, giving many times 500 or 1000 Crowns
for Bords to make a <hi>Coffin,</hi> though in realitie, these are not so much worth.
For it happeneth many times, that going to a Merchant, that selleth this
commoditie, the Merchant setteth them a price, asking them five or six
hundred Crownes, but telleth them withall, that if they will have Bords
of a thousand Crownes, he hath not any at present, but that he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
some a great while, and looketh every day, when they should ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive:
and if his Lordship hath not extraordinary hast, praieth him to send
some few daies hence, and he shall be accommodated. Here, the Merchant
hath no more to do, but to change the paper, which is pasted upon those
Bords, and with it the price; and when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> returneth he findeth
bords of such price as he desireth. When the <hi>Chest</hi> is made with all sort
of exquisite ornament on the outside, as of gold, <hi>Charan,</hi> and other gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
they keep it in their house, and many times in the same chamber
where they lie, with much satisfaction and contentment. As contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
if, being in yeares, they have not already made it, they are alwayes
ill satisfied and discontented: and truly it is a great trouble and charge
to the Sons, if they have ancient Fathers, and their <hi>Funerall Chest</hi> be not
yet prepared.</p>
                     <p>This is the usuall manner of the whole Kingdome; but, because they
have taken their religion from the <hi>Pagods</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> they have also entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
some of their Ceremonies and superstitions, who are buried after
three severall manners, and that, before they die by the course of nature,
in the earth, in the water, and in the fire, (as they do to this day in <hi>Giappon</hi>)
some throwing themselves off from high places, others drowning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in rivers, with stones tied about their necks, and others, other wayes,
which we will not here treat of. The <hi>Chinesses</hi> are not so valiant to do
this, while they are living, but being dead, if they are so poor, that they
cannot make them a <hi>Coffin,</hi> they burne them, and bury their ashes. In the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64464:49"/>
Province of <hi>Sucheú</hi> they burn the bodie, and put the ashes in earthern
<hi>Iarres,</hi> close stopped; and then cast them into the rivers.</p>
                     <p>After the <hi>Chest,</hi> followeth the place of <hi>Sepulture,</hi> which every one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth
for himself and his posterity, without the wals: for within, it is not
permitted. Of these places they make great account. Some have in
them very convenient houses: they are kept lockt on the out-side, and
within are full of <hi>Cypresses,</hi> (which they usually plant there,) and other
trees, proper for that place. They are many times little worth, in respect
of the quantitie of ground they contain; but do cost them a great deal of
mony, if their <hi>Astrologer</hi> do judge them lucky places, and fortunate
for the Familie; for none do make choice of them, without his opinion.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Burying,</hi> they observe this order, to lay the chief of the Family in
the uppermost place, and the rest by his side according to their degrees.
On the topp of the <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> they place many ornaments wrought in
stone; and before them they set Stone-statues of severall <hi>Animals;</hi> and
(above all) <hi>Epitaphs;</hi> and stones graved with elegant compositions, in
praise of the deceased. The great men, especially the Eunuches use ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way of more vast expence. For they build in such places, <hi>Sumptuous
Palaces,</hi> with Halls underneath them like <hi>Coemeteries;</hi> where there are <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
fitted to receive the <hi>Coffins</hi> of the deceased. These <hi>Palaces</hi> serve them
when they go thither; and on <hi>The day of the dead;</hi> at which time the whole
Family is assembled to make their Sacrifices and Ceremonies. For the
poorer sort of people, that cannot have a peculiar place of <hi>Sepulture,</hi> there
is ordinarily, in every City, a common place of <hi>Buriall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They never faile to bury every one in the place of his <hi>Sepulture,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be never so remote from that where he dieth; which happeneth
often to the officers, who by reason they are sent to govern in severall
parts of the kingdome, do many times come to die out of their own
Country, and upon that occasion cause them to be brought home and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
there: neither doth it seem a custome voide of reason, <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi>
having used the same diligence upon that account.</p>
                     <p>At their death the first <hi>Ceremony</hi> is: that before the dying Person breathe
his last, they bring him on a mattresse, or quilt, into the outward Hall,
where he is to expire. I do not know, what is the reason of this custome;
neither is it generally used of all; for if he be a person of qualitie, they
let him alone in his bed, and assoon as he is dead, his eldest Son plucketh
off the <hi>Coife</hi> and Cap from his head, and pulling down the bed
without any order overturneth the Beds-Tester and curtaines; and
partly by tearing, and partly by breaking, pulleth every thing down,
and with it covereth the Corps. If it be a woman, the women stay, and
if it be a man, the men; presently washing the dead Body according to
their custome. When they have washed it; they wind it in a fine linnen
cloth, if he have any; or else in a piece of silk. After that, they cloathe
him in the best garment that he hath, and upon him they lay the ensignes
of his office and degree: and when he is, thus adorned: they lay him
into the Coffin, which is made of very thick boards, and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joynted. On the inside of the Coffin they bestow two weights,
which they call <hi>Manos</hi> of Bitumen; and after that one of <hi>Charan;</hi> and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64464:49"/>
then there is no danger, that any ill smell can come through it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Coffin</hi> is then brought out, and placed in the outward hall, which
is all hung with mourning. On the top of the <hi>Coffin</hi> they lay his statue
made by the life, with his ensignes of honour, just as he lieth in the <hi>Coffin.</hi>
Before it, they set a Table and a Carpet; behinde the <hi>Coffin,</hi> they hang up
certaine curtaines; behind which, the women stand. On each side of the
<hi>Coffin</hi> are his sonnes and grand-sonnes <hi>sitting</hi> on straw in very deep mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
In the first open <hi>Gallerie</hi> set about with <hi>Balansters,</hi> which is before
the hall, there stand Trumpeters on each side thereof; and at the great
gate of the Palace, on the inside, in the Court, are two drummers: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the gate next the street there is hung out a great flagge, made of pieces
of paper reaching almost to the ground, and it is a signall, that their mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is provided, and that now they admit of visitants. After that, they
advise all their friends and kindred thereof, sending them a <hi>Thie</hi> of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
wherein, with words of much affliction and humilitie, they give
them notice of their sorrow.</p>
                     <p>Then presently begin their <hi>Visits</hi> of <hi>Condoling,</hi> which are done in this
manner: When the <hi>Visitant</hi> is come into the first Court, presently he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
on his <hi>Mourning-garment,</hi> which he bringeth with him for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
The drummer beateth his drumme to give notice of his arrivall, and
while he passeth through the Court, the Trumpets sound; assoone as he
cometh into the Hall, the women behind the <hi>Curtains</hi> begin to weep and
lament. When he cometh up to the Table he layeth thereon a purse of
paper; with money in it to the value of twelve pence, or eighteen pence;
(which serveth for an <hi>Aide</hi> of the cost,) and some little perfumes: Then
upon the Carpet he maketh foure reverences, part kneeling, and part stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on his feet: When they are ended, presently the Sonnes rise up from
the place where they are, and go and place themselves on the left hand of
the <hi>Visitant,</hi> and make him as many reverences, partly kneeling, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on their feet, at which time they are to weep, or at least to make as if
they wept: When this is done, without speaking a word, they return to
their places againe: In the meane time the <hi>Visitant</hi> goeth forward, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
one of the remotest of the kindred, in slighter mourning, cometh
to receive him, and leadeth him into another roome; where assoone as
they are sate, presently there is brought in some of their drink, called <hi>Chia,</hi>
and dried fruits, or else dried sweet meats; of which for the most part they
do not eat, but taking a little, put it into their sleeve, and so take their
leave.</p>
                     <p>This courtesie is esteemed so due, that those friends, who are at hand,
may by no means omit it; and they who are farther off, if they dwell in
neighbouring Cities, come in their own person: But if they live very
farre off, they send one from home to do it in their name. This <hi>ceremonie</hi>
commonly lasteth eight or ten daies. But they who live farre off, may
come, or send to do it, at what time they please.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Visits</hi> are over, the eldest Sonne is obliged to go to all those
of the same City, that came to <hi>condole</hi> with him at his house; but he hath
no more to do, but to come to the gate; where (without) a Carpet is
spread, wheron he maketh his reverence, leaveth a <hi>Thie,</hi> and goeth his way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:64464:50"/>After this, they begin to think of the <hi>buriall,</hi> which (if they are able) is
performed with a great deale of expence; if not, they leave the <hi>Chest</hi>
standing at home, till they are better able; which is some times whole
years first. They give notice of the <hi>funerall</hi> to their friends, by sending a
<hi>Thiè</hi> to each, as at the first: Who being assembled, come presently to the
place above mentioned. First of all, are carried the <hi>Pageants,</hi> which are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
great statues of men, Horses, Elephants, Lyons, Tigers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They
are all made of painted paper, and adorned with gilding. Besides these,
are carried severall other machines, as Triumphant Chariots, Pyramids,
and such like things; every thing being set out with various works, in silke,
and flowres, and roses of the same materialls; all which is to be burnt, if
the Person be of great qualitie: For otherwise all these are but hired, and
none of them is burnt.</p>
                     <p>After these <hi>Pageants,</hi> followeth the multitude of people which come to
looke on; then come all their friends cloathed in <hi>mourning;</hi> after these, the
<hi>Bonzi,</hi> singing out their prayers, and sounding their Cymballs; after them,
come another sort of <hi>Bonzi,</hi> who weare beards, and long haire, and leading
a single life, live in communitie: These go playing upon severall musicall
Instruments. After these, follow another race of <hi>Bonzi,</hi> of a different sect;
These are shaved, and go along also saying their prayers. After these, come
the more intimate friends; after them, follow all the kinsmen; after these,
come the sonnes and grand-sonnes of the deceased Person, cloathed in a
very <hi>austere mourning,</hi> bare footed, with certaine staves in their hand, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned
like those which pilgrimes carry; so short, that they are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
above two palmes long; and so they go along hanging their heads
downe.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after these cometh the <hi>Coffin;</hi> which if it be made of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
wood, is uncovered, that it might be seen; else it is varnished over,
and richly adorned with gold and <hi>Charan.</hi> It is placed on a very large
<hi>Machine,</hi> carried sometimes by 30, 40. or 50. men, which is still the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
state, the more they are. Above it, is fastened a <hi>Baldacchin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> or
cloath of state, which covereth it all over head, having his rich Tassels and
strings hanging downe by the sides. Neere to this on both hands, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
many lights in great woodden frames, made like lanthorns; behind
the <hi>Coffin,</hi> are carried the women, crying and lamenting in sedans fast lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and covered all over with mourning, accompanied in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by their female-friends and kindred. When they are come to the
place of <hi>Sepulture,</hi> they performe severall <hi>ceremonies</hi> both before and after
the <hi>Coffin</hi> is buried: And a sumptuous banquet, (which they make for all
those that accompanyed the hearse) is none of the worst <hi>ceremonies</hi> among
them. And this is one of the occasions, wherein they make use of those
faire houses they build in those places.</p>
                     <p>When they are returned home, then followeth the time of <hi>mourning,</hi>
and the <hi>ceremonies</hi> that are then observed; which are these that follow.
The first and most universall, is to cloath themselves in the coursest and
heaviest <hi>mourning;</hi> the colour thereof is white, not only in these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
but also in <hi>Giappon, Corea,</hi> and many other neighbouring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes:
and as it seemeth to me, this white colour was not chosen at the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64464:50"/>
beginning for its one sake, but came in, as it were, by consequence: for they
themselves cannot give any reason, why their prede cessours chose it; and
on the other side they know, that it is a cheereful colour, and as such they
weare it at certain times: the reason therefore of it seemeth to me to be,
because in <hi>China</hi> they make no cloath but of Cotton, Silk, and Hemp. Of
Silk and Cotton there is no course cloath to be made, but of Hempe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there is, such as would make one afraid to see it. And because in
its naturall colour it is more unsightly and horrid, than when it is died
and coloured, they on purpose chuse to have it so: whence it being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
white, by consequence, white came to be the proper colour for
<hi>mourning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Mourning</hi> lasteth three whole years; during which time, the sons
do never sit on a chaire, but on a little fourm, or stoole, covered with <hi>Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi>
they eate not at a Table, nor lie on a Bed-stead, but the bed is laid on
the floore: they drink no wine, eate no flesh, nor use any Baths, (which
are very common among them.) They go not to Banquets, nor do they
go out of their doores, but in a Sedan close shut, and covered with
mourning. They abstain from their own wives (as they say at least:) if
there be any examinations in that time, they go not to them: they may
not hold any publick office; and if, at the time, they do actually
exercise any, their Father or Mother chance to die, although he be <hi>vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi>
or <hi>Colao,</hi> he must leave his office, and attend to bury them, and to make
their <hi>obsequies;</hi> and when the <hi>Mourning</hi> is ended, they returne to their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and offices againe, and sometimes to greater.</p>
                     <p>This time is accounted so sacred among them, that it admitteth of no
dispensation, except it be in their captaines and officers of warre. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
one of the Province of <hi>Cantone</hi> seemed more desirous of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
than to observe his Mourning, and computing his time, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to spend the rest in his journey, which he wanted to makeup his three
years, when he came to the court, and petitioned for his office, it
was promised him upon this condition, that he should returne home to
his house, and fully accomplish his time of <hi>Mourning,</hi> and then he should
come againe to court, and make his demand.</p>
                     <p>The number of three years, they say, is to give thanks to their Parents
for the three yeares of their infancie, during which time they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
more in their armes, than on their own legges. And therefore in
those three yeares, in token of reverence, they may not innovate or alter
any thing in the house from that order, which the Father kept in it.</p>
                     <p>For a wife they mourne but one year. There is a <hi>Slighter Mourning</hi> of
five months and three daies, according to the neernesse of their kindred
and relation: Friends for their friends observe only Three daies of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
They have all Mourning garments lye ready by them; there
being so many occasions to weare them.</p>
                     <p>This is the manner of their <hi>Mourning</hi> and <hi>Buriall</hi> of the
Persons of the greatest quality, which is encreased and diminished, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the condition and qualitie of the Person. At the Funeralls of
the Kings, and those of the royall Familie, the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
and that they might the better be conceived, I will set down what
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64464:51"/>
passed in the year 1614. at the <hi>Funerall</hi> of the <hi>Queen-Mother,</hi> where I my
selfe was present.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 17.</head>
                     <head type="sub">Of the Funerall of the Queen-Mother.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> died on the ninth day of the second Moon,
which is the last of our March, in the yeare 1614. presently all the
Court put on <hi>Mourning,</hi> not only the <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> but even the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
too; and especially the Kings officers and Ministers, who laying aside
the ensignes of their dignitie, (which are both of <hi>Authoritie</hi> and <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to them) do change them for others of <hi>Mourning</hi> and <hi>Sorrow:</hi> as their
<hi>Girdle</hi> (which commonly they weare very rich) into a <hi>rope</hi> of course
Hempe; and their <hi>Cap</hi> (which is of black Silk) into <hi>one</hi> made of the
course cloath for <hi>Mourning.</hi> In this manner they went foure months, till
the time of the <hi>obsequies.</hi> The common people wore only a Mourning
Cap for foure and twenty daies, with so much exactnesse, that he that
neglected it, was punished.</p>
                     <p>The second day, the King leaving the Palaces where he dwelt, passed
over to those of his deceased <hi>Mother;</hi> which, although they are within
the same wall, yet stand at some distance. They cloathed the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in white very richly; and every day till it was put into the Coffin, the
King went in Person, with all the people of his palace to visit her, and to
performe those ordinary Reverences and Compliments, used by children
to their parents, putting rich odours and spices into a perfuming pan,
which stood before her; all his women, Sons and Nephews, as also some of
the <hi>Principall Eunuches</hi> of the Palace did the like with all <hi>Solemnitie.</hi> Then
presently, by the Kings command, the garments, bed and other things
which the <hi>Queen</hi> used, were burned: judging it an unworthie thing that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they should be made use of by any Person inferiour to her in <hi>dignitie</hi>
and <hi>authority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the third day the body was put into the <hi>Coffin.</hi> The excellency of the
matter thereof may be easily imagined by what hath been already said,
that even for private persons the price of one amounteth many times to a
thousand crownes. The boards are very thick, and the <hi>Coffin</hi> very capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
There the King himselfe plac't her upon a <hi>Quilt</hi> and a Pillow, which
were there laid, strewing upon her, pearle, and precious stones to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of 70000. crownes, and placing by her side fifty pieces of cloath of
gold, and fiftie of cloath of silver, which truly would have been enough
to have maintained a gallant man all his life time. The Coffin was shut,
and the King with the rest made their accustomed reverences, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
                     <p>On the fourth day the <hi>ceremonies</hi> were continued, cloathing themselves
in a more austere and horrid Mourning, for to celebrate the Sacrifices,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64464:51"/>
which in realitie are not sacrifices, but offerings, and pure ceremonies. The
<hi>Coffin</hi> was placed in a spacious Court, as it were, upon a high Throne, and
about it stood fifteen Tables: The first, that was in the front, was for the
King; the rest for his women, <hi>Sonnes</hi> and <hi>principall Eunuches,</hi> who, after
the King, according to their order, made their offerings with perfumes
and reverences.</p>
                     <p>On the fift day, which was appointed for those who dwell without the
Palace, there was assembled all the <hi>Nobilitie</hi> and <hi>Titulados,</hi> which they
call <hi>Que, Cùm, Chu, Cheu, Heupè,</hi> who do all succeed by inheritance. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
these, followed all those that were of Affinitie and Alliance with the
King, that is, such as were married to his Daughters or Nieces. After these,
the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of the six <hi>Tribunals:</hi> And after these, came the wives of
the great Officers, who have jurisdiction over the whole Kingdome, such
as are those of the six <hi>Tribunals,</hi> each in that which appertaineth to him;
whether it be concerning the Revenue, or the <hi>Militia,</hi> or any other thing.
All these in their order performed the <hi>ceremonies</hi> abovesaid: and so there
was a period put to the first part of the <hi>ceremonies,</hi> which are used in the
Palace before the <hi>Funerall;</hi> for abroad there were many things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and severall edicts published; in which were intimated:</p>
                     <p>First, that all <hi>Mandarines,</hi> both of the <hi>Gowne</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi> should make
their appearance at the Palace the day following, to bewaile the <hi>deceased
Queen:</hi> which done, without returning to their houses, they should go
directly to their <hi>Tribunalls,</hi> there to remain and keep a fast for three daies,
without eating flesh, fish, or eggs, or drinking any wine. That done, for
the space of other three daies, they should come all to the gates of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and there in their order, one by one, should make foure accustomed
reverences, with some other externall signes of griefe, and then returne
home to their houses.</p>
                     <p>The second: that all the wives of the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> from the first to the
fourth degree, cloathed from head to foot in close <hi>mourning,</hi> should assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the same place, and for the space of three days lament in the like
manner: and that afterwards, at their owne houses, for the space of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
seaven days, they should not put on their Jewells, ornaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third; that those of the <hi>Royall Councell,</hi> called <hi>Han Lin</hi> should all
make Poems, verses, and compositions in praise of the <hi>deceased Queen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth: that they of the <hi>Quan Lo Su,</hi> that is, the Officers of the
Kings exchequer and revenue, should, with all diligence and liberalitie,
provide what ever was necessary, for the sacrifices and other expences of
the funerall.</p>
                     <p>The fifth: that all the <hi>Bonzi,</hi> and ministers of the Idols, should ring their
bells for a long time, as a signe of sorrow and griefe.</p>
                     <p>The sixth: that for thirteen daies there should be no flesh killed, or sold
in the shambles: but that all should fast, as the King did; who, for the first
three days, did eat only a little rice boyled in faire water, and the rest of the
time, pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se only.</p>
                     <p>The seaventh; there was order given to the President of the Councell
of rites and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> and to those of the chamber, that they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>mourning</hi> garments to all the Embassadours, who did then actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64464:52"/>
in the Court; and that they should be brought to the Palace and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
one day the <hi>ceremonies</hi> and compliments in like manner, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Country did.</p>
                     <p>The eighth: that all <hi>Mandarines,</hi> that had finished their government,
and all new pretenders should come for three days to the Palace, to do the
same reverences and <hi>ceremonies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ninth: that the common people, for a week together, should do
the same, morning and evening, at the Palace of the Governour of the
City.</p>
                     <p>Besides this, all the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> dispersed through the Provinces and
Cities of the Kingdome, were written to; that at the arrivall of the newes
of the <hi>Queen-Mothers</hi> decease, they should give notice thereof to all the
blood royall of the Male line, and to their wives and children; and order,
that they should make the three accustomed reverences, and other <hi>ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
on their knees; and immediately to cloath themselves in <hi>Mourning</hi> for
seaven and twenty days. This order was given to all the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of
the Kingdome, as well to those that had governd, as to those that did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
governe, as also to all <hi>Litterati,</hi> of what degree soever, as likewise to
those that had not received any degree.</p>
                     <p>To the common people there was order given, that they should weare
<hi>Mourning</hi> caps for thirteen dayes.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it was ordered, that as well in the Palaces of the <hi>Mandarines,</hi>
as in the publick Innes on the high wayes, and in small villages, where tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
are lodged at the Kings expence, no musick, either of voice or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
should be suffered. And this order was divulged by <hi>Mandarines</hi>
appointed only for this occasion. And when this order came to the
Court of <hi>Nankim,</hi> all the officers, both of the <hi>Gowne</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi> went out
to meet it as farre as the river, all in deep <hi>Mourning,</hi> even to their <hi>Umbrellas,</hi>
wherewith they keep off the sunne; and accompanied it through the City,
in an orderly procession, as farre as the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of rites and <hi>ceremonies;</hi>
where the President received the order in writing; and set it up in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
conspicuous place, and all of them did their reverence to it; after
that, he tooke the letter and opened it, and made proclamation of the order,
although there wanted nothing to the execution thereof, but that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people had not yet their <hi>Mourning</hi> caps.</p>
                     <p>These were the <hi>ceremonies,</hi> which preceded the <hi>Funerall;</hi> the which
being ended, order was given to the <hi>Mathematician Major,</hi> or chiefe Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
of the Court of <hi>Pekim,</hi> that he should make choise of a day or days,
whereon the <hi>Obsequies</hi> should be solemnized. He, after he had consulted
his art, appointed the ninth day of the sixth moone (foure months com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
after the <hi>Queens</hi> death) to be the day, whereon the corps should be
brought out of the Palace, and the fifteenth of the same moone, for the
day of the <hi>Funerall.</hi> The time being come, order was given for the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing
thereof in form following.</p>
                     <p>First; that all the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of the Court, and <hi>Magistrates</hi> of the six
<hi>Tribunals,</hi> six days before, should leave their own houses, and make their
abode at their <hi>Tribunals,</hi> and should fast for three dayes in manner above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:64464:52"/>Secondly, that the Officers of the Kings Patrimonie and Revenue
should prepare whatsoever was necessary, for that occasion; that is, great
quantitie of Candles, Perfumes, Spices, great store of <hi>Phantasticke</hi> figures,
and Images of men, Horses, Lions, Elephants, <hi>Vmbrellas</hi> of Silk, all rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set out, that they might be burnt at the place of <hi>Sepulture.</hi> It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that there were spent in this above 30000 Crowns. I make no doubt,
but so much was spent; but that it was afterwards all burnt, is hard to be
proved; It may be, fame was something extravagant in that particular.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that they of the Colledge of <hi>Han Lin</hi> should anew, make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
verses proper for the <hi>Funerall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, because the King was to accompany the Body to the <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
which is twelve miles distant from the Court, he named another
Person, who in his stead should performe all the compliments and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
<hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, order was given to all the Officers, Captaines, &amp; Souldiers, that
they should keep a Guard in the City, and at the <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> and that they
should accompanie the Body, by the way, in this manner, That at every
gate of the City, (which are nine in all) there should stand a thousand men.
That from the gate, through which the Body was to passe, to the place of
<hi>Sepulture,</hi> there should stand two rancks of Souldiers: that there should be
3000 to carry the <hi>Coffin</hi> by turnes; and 10000 horsemen to accompany it:
and for the Guard of the <hi>Royall Sepulchres,</hi> while the <hi>Obsequies</hi> lasted,
40000.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, order was given to levell the way from the Palace to the place
of <hi>Sepulture,</hi> and to raile it in on both sides, that the people might not
stop up the way. At every twenty paces, there was set a basket of
yellow earth, for to strow in the way, as the Hearse passed; as also, that
Tents, and Pavillions should be set up in certaine places: for the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those that accompanied the Body.</p>
                     <p>Seaventhly, command was given to all the officers of the revenue,
that they should provide, with all punctualitie and liberalitie, whatsoever
was necessary for the sustenance and diet of the <hi>Mandarines, Eunuchs,
Captaines, Souldiers,</hi> and all others, that by duty of their place, attended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Funerall Solemnitie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eighthly, that three daies before the <hi>Funerall,</hi> the <hi>Mourning,</hi> Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Reverences and Sacrifices should be renewed in like manner, as at
the beginning.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, and lastly it was commanded; that from the seaventh (that is,
two daies before the <hi>Funerall Solemnitie</hi> began) to the twentieth of that
Moon, no Shambles should be opened, neither flesh nor fish sold, in any
manner, nor that any noise of mirth, or Musicall instrument should be
heard any where throughout the City.</p>
                     <p>All things being set in order for the <hi>Funerall;</hi> on the seventh of the
sixth moone the King and Prince with all the officers, went to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his <hi>Ancestours,</hi> which standeth within the <hi>Royall Palaces:</hi> where,
cloathed in deep Mourning, and coming before the Image of the first
founder of his Familie, he made a low Reverence, and after offered to his
deceased Mother, whose Image was yet standing there, many Garments
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64464:53"/>
of silk, wine, and other things. Then he commanded that one of the
compositions made in her praise, should be read; after which using severall
other Reverences and Ceremonies, they all returned; and the King left
particular order, that all those Garments, Poems, and other things should
be burned.</p>
                     <p>On the eighth day, were made Sacrifices to Heaven, Earth, the Planets,
Mountaines, and Rivers, with great Solemnitie; when these were ended,
the King commanded, that the same Sacrifices should be made to the
nine Gates of the Palace, through which the Corps of the deceased
Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n was to passe; and to the Tutelar Angels of them; as also the six
Bridges of the River, which runneth through the Palace, offering in all
these places living creatures, Aromaticks, wine made with severall Spices
and ingredients, and diverse other perfumes.</p>
                     <p>The Chest or <hi>Coffin,</hi> in which the deceased Queen lay, was of the
most precious and dearest wood, that could be found in that Kingdome,
and was shut and closed up with all possible art and diligence, and clasped
on the outside with hasps of Silver, made in the forme of Dragons: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was there any Gold, or <hi>Charan,</hi> used for the Ornament thereof, that
that precious wood might be left more bare and open to the sight. It
was placed in a Triumphant Chariot very richly wrought, with its Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of silk embroidered with Gold. Moreover the Chariot was ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all over with plates of Silver, cast in the figures of Lions and Dragons,
and other works; all performed with exquisite art and diligence. About
the Hearse stood many Candles and perfuming pans.</p>
                     <p>The fifth day being come, which was appointed by the Kings <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician</hi>
for the carrying of the Corps forth of the Palace, the King with
his Women, Sonnes, and the Eunuches of the Palace, came to the place,
where the Chariot, that carried the Hearse, stood; where, after they had
renewed their lamentations for their departed Queen, they Sacrificed to
the Chariot it selfe, or to the God and Genius thereof; that the voyage
might be prosperous; and that the Body might enjoy quiet and securitie;
then Sprinkling sweet waters upon the Hearse, they made their last Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments
and Reverences.</p>
                     <p>Presently the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> (for no others enter there,) put themselves in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to draw the Chariot, the King accompanying it with all his Familie
to the last, that is, the eighth Gate of the Palace, where, with new laments,
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> and complements, he took his leave.</p>
                     <p>Then within the first gate stood ready, they that were to receive the
Corps, and in the Kings name and stead, were to accompany it, and to
make the Sacrifices and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that were to be performed at certaine
places. Then presently began the Procession, with such solemnitie, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and silence, that it caused admiration in all that beheld it. It went
no further that day, than to a Town without the walls; neer to which
there was a Tent set up very richly adorned, where the Chariot was put;
and the Tables likewise being, set, they did Sacrifice, and burned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
and Perfumes, and performed other <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and last of all they renewed their Lamentations. From this place
was dispatched an <hi>Eunuch</hi> to give the King full account, whither,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64464:53"/>
and how the Body was arrived, and of all that passed there.</p>
                     <p>The day following was begun with the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and other <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
solemnities,</hi> with which the day before was concluded; and their
journey continued with such a Multitude of people, as well of those of
the Guard neere hand, as of other people afar off, that were curious to
see, that they were not to be numbred. By reason of the Sacrifices, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi>
and stops which they made in the way, they were three daies
ere they arrived at the Mountaine, where the Kings <hi>Sepulchres</hi> were.</p>
                     <p>Assoon as they were come thither, the Hearse was removed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> from the Chariot, where it was, to another triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
which they had in readinesse for that purpose, of no lesse cost than
the former. After that, they Sacrificed to the earth, a Bull, with Spiced
wines, rich perfumes, and garments, Suplicating to the tutelary Spirit
thereof, that he would receive that Body with pitie, keep, &amp; defend it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the same time, nine <hi>Mandarines,</hi> appointed by the King himself, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the same <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and Sacrifices to all the Kings predecessours,
which were buried there: when the day was come, on which the Body
should be buried, which was the fifteenth of the sixt Moone, they made
many Sacrifices, and so put an end to the <hi>Funerall:</hi> when presently the
<hi>Mandarines</hi> posted away, to give the King account of all that had passed;
which account was alwayes given him in part from time to time by the
way. And he shewed his liberalitie to all those that had taken paines in
that worke: and to shew his care and piety, in all that which he ought, to
his Mothers memorie, presently after her death, he commanded that all
prisoners should be released, that were not committed for any enormous
crimes. He gave order also, that in the Provinces, where there was a Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
of victualls, the ordinary Tribute should be taken off; and that alms
should be given to those that were most necessitous among them.</p>
                     <p>He ordered also, that the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Gabels,</hi> to be paied at the Gates
and Custome-houses, which upon some occasions were lately imposed,
should cease: and he himself, with his own hands, made many thousand
small pieces of Silver which he lapped up in paper, according to the
custome of <hi>China,</hi> to give them in Almes for the Soule of his dead Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Truly there is nothing in <hi>China,</hi> so worthy to be imitated by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as their piety towards their Parents, and God having given to this
Nation such knowledge and inclination to vertue, it is great pittie, that
they should only want the foundation of faith. Hence we may see,
with how great fruit and profit the <hi>Gospel</hi> might be preached in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or rather by the goodnesse of the Lord, it is already preached, as
we shall declare in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>It will not be besides the purpose of this discourse, to adde briefly
something, concerning the death of King <hi>Vanli,</hi> Sonne to this Queen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid,
the which fell out towards the end of <hi>August</hi> in the year 1620.
in their seaventh moone; forbearing to mention the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which were
like to those, we even now related.</p>
                     <p>He fell sick about the end of <hi>Iune</hi> (in the same year,) of a looseness and
paine in his stomack, swelling of his feet, and other Maladies; This
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64464:54"/>
infirmity lasted two months with many various changes &amp; alterations: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, finding himselfe come to the end of his life, he called his Sonne,
the heire of the Kingdome, with his three other brothers; to whom he
made a discourse full of good advise and wholesome precepts, accusing
himselfe of too much negligence, and want of care, and then gave them
the last salute.</p>
                     <p>Then he made his last Will and Testament, the manner whereof is this.
When the Physitians do despaire of the Kings recovery, the <hi>Colai,</hi> if they
be many, as they use to be, together with the chiefe of the Eunuchs, and
the first President of the Palace, whom they call <hi>Suli Kien,</hi> go to the King,
and endeavour to draw from his owne mouth, what his last Will is, and
the summe of his Testament. After that; they go secretly to the Prince,
the heire of the Kingdome, and give him an account of all, to the end no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might be done contrary to the will of him, who is presently to take
possession of the Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>When they have understood, what both their pleasures are, they put it
into the form of a Will, and carry it to the King, to have his approbation
of it. Then they present it to a Senatour of the royall Colledge, called
<hi>Hanli Yven,</hi> to whom it belongeth to put such writings, as concerne the
King, into good form and stile.</p>
                     <p>That done, it is closed up and sealed with the Kings seale, and is kept in
the Archives of the royall Colledge, whilest the King is living. Assoone
as he is dead, it is carryed to the Tribunal of <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> to
whom it belongeth to publish it through the whole Kingdome, and to put
it punctually in execution.</p>
                     <p>The form of this Will is here faithfully copied and translated out of the
<hi>Chinesses</hi> language into ours.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>I</hi> From a child received the government of this <hi>Monarchie</hi> from the hands of my
<hi>Progenitours,</hi> and have held it fourty eight years, a very long time: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have no reason to lament, that I am now to leave it. Assoone as I was
created <hi>Emperour,</hi> I had strong inclinations to governe well, and to imitate my
<hi>Predecessours;</hi> as in truth I endeavoured to do, with all exactnesse. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
being hindred by severall infirmities for many years, I left off the care of
having the wonted sacrifices celebrated to Heaven and earth: neither did I cause
the offices and ceremonies to be performed, which are due to the memory of my
<hi>Ancestours.</hi> I seldome times sate upon the throne to consult of the affaires of the
Kingdome; I detained the petitions which were presented me, without dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. I tooke no care of nominating <hi>Magistrates,</hi> as the Kingdomes need
required; and I know, that at this present there are some wanting. I have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
nine mines of gold, and silver: I have encreased and multiplied the <hi>Gabells</hi>
and <hi>Excise:</hi> I have disturbed the publick peace with tumults of warre; whence
hath followed discord with the neighbouring princes, and great oppression and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to their people: wherefore thinking continually both night and day upon these
things, I am hardly able to suffer the grief, which my soule endureth, and which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64464:54"/>
doth now detest her former faults: finally, I began to take up better resolutions; but
I am fallen into this infirmity, the which doth still so encrease, that it maketh me
beleeve, I shall very shortly lose my life.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time I have this only hope left me, that my Sonnes and Nephews
will amend my faults by leading a better life.</p>
                        <p>You therefore the <hi>Heire</hi> of my Kingdome, seeing that you neither want inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
nor good disposition; and because you have hitherto never forborne the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of piety, obedience, and other vertues; be of good courage. The inheritance
of the Empire of <hi>China</hi> is yours. Let your principall care be well to compose your
life and manners. Apply your selfe with all study and industry to the well gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Kingdome. Love those that are good; refuse not counsell; take not
advise in evill part: that you might be able to beare the great weight of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
do your endeavour that your Sonne my Grand-child, follow his studies with
all diligence. Be kind and loving to your <hi>three Brothers:</hi> assigne them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
habitations; and provide for each of them a good revenue and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Titles.</hi> Use your utmost diligence, that all your subjects, as well noble as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,
may live in peace, and love concord. Take care speedily to make the <hi>Colai,</hi>
and other the supreame Magistrates, for I do remember, to have left two places
voyd: and above all, forget not to elect the Kings <hi>Administratours.</hi> These
things I recommend to you that you should endeavour speedily to put them in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                        <p>By all means take off the new <hi>Gabells</hi> at Bridges, the <hi>Excise</hi> of silke, stuffs,
eartherne ware, and other things, which I have lately introduced. Take care
that all causes, which are depending in the <hi>Tribunals,</hi> be dispatched with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
by some select <hi>Judges;</hi> and free the innocent. The souldiers on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of <hi>Tartary</hi> do want their pay and provisions: let them be speedily supplied
out of the <hi>royall exchequer</hi> (this last clause is said to have been added by the
Prince to his fathers Testament,) I do recommend to you the souldiers and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
which were slaine in the last warre. Honour their <hi>Mortuaries,</hi> and their
soules with new <hi>Titles;</hi> assist their families by paying their arreares.</p>
                        <p>All this I briefly ordaine, that you should put it in execution, assoone as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
you may.</p>
                        <p>As for my <hi>Funerall,</hi> cause the <hi>ceremonies</hi> of the Kingdome to be observed.
Though I had rather for my particular satisfaction, that in stead of <hi>twenty sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
months,</hi> as is the usuall custome, they should only last for so many <hi>dayes.</hi>
All the <hi>Magistrates, Vice-roys, Visitours</hi> and <hi>Captaines</hi> of warre, have
more need to assist at their governments and charges: Suffer not, that they be
called hither, upon the occasion of my funerall. It will be sufficient, that when
each hath newes of my death, he cause to be done, for three dayes in the place where
he is, that which useth to be performed at the <hi>Funerall</hi> of the Kings body. The
<hi>Pastilios,</hi> and other perfumes, wont to be presented on the like occasions, may be
brought by the inferiour officers, in the name of the great ones. But for the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi>
appointed for the government of the forts, and the <hi>Presidents</hi> of Cities
and Townes, my Will is, that in no case they should be suffered to come, as also that
the strangers, who are <hi>Tributary</hi> to this Kingdome, should be excused, I do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
that this my last Will should be published through the whole Kingdome,
that it may come to the eares of every one of my subjects.</p>
                        <p>This was his will and Testament; which accordingly was every where

published. The other ceremonies I forbeare to write, because they are

                     <p>THe <hi>Chinesses</hi> are generally little inclined to <hi>Sects;</hi> neither are there
any thing neere so many among them, as among the people of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appon.</hi>
Neverthelesse they have three, which, although they be different,
yet, that they might not erre in any, or to speake more correctly, that they
might erre the more, they joyne them altogether. Two of them are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to <hi>China,</hi> and first sprung up there: The third, which is of the Idols,
is adventitious, and came from <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first is that of the <hi>Litterati;</hi> and is more ancient among them, than
some do think, who make <hi>Confusio</hi> to be the author of it. They worship
no <hi>Pagod,</hi> or Idol, but acknowledge a <hi>Superioritie,</hi> or <hi>Deitie,</hi> who is able to
chastise and to reward. Notwithstanding they have no Churches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they worship <hi>him;</hi> nor any divine Offices which they celebrate, nor any
prayers that they rehearse; nor any <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Ministers,</hi> which officiate at
<hi>his</hi> service. Yet they speak and write in their books of this <hi>Lord</hi> very <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably,</hi>
as of a <hi>divine person;</hi> neither do they apply or attribute any unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
thing <hi>to him,</hi> as our Ancestours did to their Gods. But as they did
not perfectly and distinctly know the true God, they fell to worship three
things, which are the most renowned, powerfull and profitable in the
world, the which they call <hi>San, Cai,</hi> that is, heaven, earth, and man. There
are, in the courts of <hi>Nankim</hi> and <hi>Pekim</hi> only, very sumptuous Temples for
heaven and earth; but which do properly belong to the King alone; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he only in his owne person doth sacrifice; he being the Minister also
of the sacrifice, and in his absence, or by his order, the chiefe Magistrate
of the Tribunal of Rites.</p>
                     <p>In the Cities, there are Temples for the Tutelar spirits, to which the
<hi>Mandarines</hi> do sacrifice, as also to the spirits of the rivers, mountaines,
and of the foure parts of the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are also Temples to the honour of some men, who have been
famous Benefactours to the publick; and therein, are palced their Images.
They do the same honour to their Ancestours, untill the fourth degree
upwards.</p>
                     <p>For their soule in the next life, they neither expect, nor pray for any
thing: Neverthelesse, they ask for temporall assistance in this life,
good fortune, and to be able to imitate their good works and atchive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>They pretend by this to stirre up devotion in the people, that they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how heaven and earth are honoured, as universall <hi>Parents,</hi> they might
also honour their particular <hi>Parents:</hi> and seeing how famous men of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64464:55"/>
former ages are honoured, they might thereby endeavour to imitate
them; and seeing how their deceased <hi>Progreitours</hi> are served, they might
learne how to serve them, while living. In a word, they order every
thing, as it may conduce most to good government, to concord, peace, and
quietnesse in Familes, and to the exercise of vertue.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second Sect</hi> is that of the <hi>Tausi,</hi> proper also to <hi>China.</hi> The Authour
thereof was a Philosopher named <hi>Tausu,</hi> of whom they feign, that he was
eight years in his Mothers belly. He lived about the time of <hi>Confusio.</hi> He
hath many followers to this day, who live together in communitie: they do
not marry: they suffer the haire of their head and their beard to grwo
very long: in their habit they do not differ from others, except in some
things at the time when they officiate. In stead of a Cap, they weare a little
Crown, into which the knot only of their hai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e entreth. They place their
ultimate Happinesse in the Body, in order to obtaine a quiet and easie life;
without labour and trouble.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Sect</hi> acknowledgeth one <hi>Great God,</hi> and other lesser one, all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall.
They acknowledge <hi>Glorie</hi> and <hi>Hell:</hi> the <hi>Glorie</hi> to be conjoyned
to the body, not only in the other life, but also in this; feighning, that by
meanes of certaine exercises and meditations, one may come to make
himselfe a child, and young, and others to become <hi>Xin Sien,</hi> that is, the
fortunate ones of the earth; obtaining by this meanes whatsoever they
desire, and to be able to transferre themselves from one place to another,
although never so distant, speedily and easily; and other such like foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                     <p>They are skilfull in Musick, and have good Instruments. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
called to the Sacrifices and Funeralls, and at those of the King and
<hi>Mandarines,</hi> they are ever assistant. They Pretend to be <hi>South-Sayers,</hi> and
promise to procure raine, and to drive away devils from places that are
haunted: But are able to do nothing; and sometimes at such undertakings
they are fouly routed by the devils: in great droughts they promise
raine, and often prolong so much time in praying for it, that at length the
time of raine commeth.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Pekim,</hi> in the yeare 1622, there fell out a pleasant Accident, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
troublesome. There happened a great drought, prayers were
made, pennances and fasts were kept: but all to no end. At length cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Tausi</hi> offered themselves to procure raine without faile, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a set day and houre, the offer was accepted with great applause, joy,
and good hope of the event: then they in a great <hi>Piazza,</hi> or market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
made a theater composed of little Tables, which, as they have many
there of an equall height and breadth, they did set one upon another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at bottom with a great many, and raising it up by degrees higher,
still with fewer Tables, till at length, the Machine came to end in one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
observing an handsome propoition and reasonable height. On this
last and highest stood the chiefe of them, praying and supplicating; and
the rest went round about him, doing the same, like <hi>Baals Priests,</hi> (although
they did not wound themselves; for in that they had great regard, as those
who sought not bloud, but water.)</p>
                     <p>The people stood all round about, expecting the event: and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64464:56"/>
observing so great an Auditory, which was almost infinite, redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
their prayers, their whistlings, and ceremonies. When the day and
houre appointed was come, presently the Sky began to be overcast with
very dark cloudes, to the great joy of all, and credit of their Ministers,
who did already promise themselves the happy accomplishment of their
undertaking; expecting every moment, when the raine should fall, When
behold, of a sudden there fel a furious storm of Haile, the Stones where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were as big as Eggs, and some bigger, which did ruine, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their fields, but their Gardens, and killed diverse Persons, that could
not in time recover some Shelter.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers have writ me from thence, that they thought the end of
the world was come, so great was the confusion and noise of the Haile
that fell. The Prophets, for having procured stones in stead of water, were
all rewarded with store of Bastinadoes.</p>
                     <p>The third <hi>Sect</hi> is of the <hi>Pagods,</hi> from <hi>India,</hi> from the part of <hi>Indostan;</hi>
which Sect they call <hi>Xaca,</hi> from the Authour of it: concerning whom,
they fable; that he was conceived by his Mother <hi>Maia,</hi> only upon the
sight of a white Elephant, which she saw in her sleep; and for the more
puritie she brought him forth at one of her flancks, and then presently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
being but nineteen yeares of age. And that, iconsidering the death of
his Mother, the cause whereof he was by his Birth, he resolved to leave
the world, and to do pennance; the which he did in a Mountain called
the Snowy Mountaine, where he had fower Masters, with whom he stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
twelve yeares; so that by that time he was thirty yeares of age, he
was accomplished in the Science of the first principle. He took the name
of <hi>Xekia,</hi> or <hi>Xaca:</hi> he taught his doctrine for the space of 49 yeares; he
had many Scholars, who, after his death collected his papers, and spread
his doctrine through the greater part of Asia.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Sect</hi> entred into <hi>China</hi> in the year of our Redemption 63. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Hanmim</hi> being commanded in a dreame, (as their books report)
to send for it in. The <hi>Bonzi,</hi> who were the preachers of that <hi>Sect,</hi>
were well received of him, and at the beginning, were very powerfull,
much esteemed, and in so great number, that they say, they were three
<hi>millions.</hi> But at this day they are very few in respect of that number: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were that they trusting in their multitude, or in the Kings favour,
committed some notable disorder; or (what is more likely) by reason of
the misfortune that befell many Kings, since their coming in: and by this
meanes they are so declined, that unlesse it be in the offices and Acts of
their divine worship, there is but little account made of them among the
<hi>Chinesses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their <hi>Priests</hi> weare their head and beards shaved: their Cap is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
but the rest of their Habit is the same with that of others. They
worship idols: They hold a Reward and Punishment in the next Life:
They marry not: They live in Convents, foure or five hundred together,
or more: They have a moderate Maintenance allowed them by the King,
notwithstanding, every one is allowed to get what he can: They begge,
mutter Prayers: They sing: They have severall offices, and prayers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
fire, tempests, misfortunes, and especially for the dead: in which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64464:56"/>
Functions they use sacerdotall, or priestly garments: Their Caps are like
ours, and their sprinkling brushes without any difference at all: They eat
neyther flesh, fish, nor egges, neyther doe they drink wine.</p>
                     <p>They live inclosed; but within a very great circuite of wall, with long
streets in it in manner of a Towne; where, in every house there dwellet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
three or foure, that is, one Master and the rest Scholars: In it they have
all manner of convenience. That which the King giveth them, is divided
equally to every house. They have also a <hi>superiour,</hi> who is over them all,
and governeth them, but at large, for he only taketh notice of such cases,
as are proposed to him for the rest, every one governeth his owne house.
He distributeth the offices among them, and appointeth such as are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
strangers. When any officer arriveth at their Convent, or Temple, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
a drumme is beaten, which they keep at the gate; and then there are
about thirty obliged to come and meet him, when they have put on their
garment of <hi>Courtesie.</hi> When the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is come to the gate, they make
him a low reverence, and presently turning about they go before him,
waiting on him to the place, whether he goeth; and there they attend him,
standing on their seet in the same manner, till he go away. They are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
subject to the councell of rites, who governeth them; but in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stising
of them, when there is occasion, they are more favourable to them,
than to secular persons.</p>
                     <p>There are others of them, that live in caves, rocks, and grotts, and some
that make their particular penances in private; others that make little
narrow lodges, knocked full of nailes with their points turned inwards,
where they stand in sight of all the world, for the space of a month with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leaning: Some of them professe to eat nothing, whilest they are there,
but only to drink <hi>Cha.</hi> But those that are expert, say; that they make up
great balls of beefe, which hath been first well boyled, dried in the sunne,
and then ground to powder; and that when they give them their <hi>Cha</hi> to
drink very hot, they cast one of their balls into it, which presently dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth:
which although it be no very nourishing diet, yet it is sufficient to
sustaine them, and to colour their deceit of living without eating.</p>
                     <p>There be some who belong to no Convent, or Temple, neither are they
Sonnes of any Monastrie; neither are they admitted into them, as Guests,
but for one day only: They call them vagabonds; and among these, there
are many times found some, who are very wicked men, and do much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
especially by robberies.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding the greater part of these abovenamed <hi>Sectaries,</hi> is not
scandalous; but very patient, meek and humble; whether it be from the
habit, which humbleth them; or from the little esteeme that is made of
them, which keepeth them under.</p>
                     <p>There go abroad no ill reports of them, although they be frequently
spoken off: And to mention those which appeare in publick, in two and
twenty years, that I was there, I heard only two stories of them; and of
one of them, the cause was not certainly known. In the City of <hi>Hancheu,</hi>
there was found one morning one of them bound to a Tree, and stabbed
to death with daggers: concerning which there was an ill judgment rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
In the village of <hi>Xhanhay</hi> in the Province of <hi>Nankim,</hi> during the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64464:57"/>
time that I lived here, a <hi>Bonzo</hi> was desired by a widow woman, to come
to her house and to recite some prayers for the soule of her deceased hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
But it seemeth he chose rather to make a commeration of the living,
than the dead: The fact was known; and for a month together he was
exposed to publick shame (for they do chastise them very well) with a
great square board about his neck, whereon was written in great letters
the occasion of his penance. It is very much in 22 years to have heard
no more against them. Not but that I could say something upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion:
but it is better to be silent, than to speak of it.</p>
                     <p>Ther are also Nunnes in <hi>China,</hi> who live after the same manner: They
shave their heads; but they are not many; neither do they observe <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The end of all these <hi>Sects</hi> of the <hi>Bonzi</hi> is to do penance in this life, to
be better provided in the next. They believe the Transmigration of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi>
and that the soules departed go to hell; which, they hold, doth
containe nine severall places; and after they have passed through them all,
those of the best sort, are borne men againe, others of a middle fort, are
turned into living creatures, like unto men. But they are in the worst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that go into birds, who may not so much as hope in the next Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration
to become men; but at soonest in another after, having first gone
into some other living creature. This is the generall beliefe, not only of
the common people (in whom, these errours are radicated beyond imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation)
but also in people of better account.</p>
                     <p>But their <hi>wisest</hi> men, or to speak more truly, they that are most given to
<hi>Atheisme,</hi> forsaking this way, which they call the <hi>Exteriour,</hi> do follow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
more <hi>interiour</hi> or secret; the knowledge whereof they preserve,
with great care among themselves; placing their whole intent on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the <hi>first principle,</hi> (which is properly the doctrine of <hi>Xaca</hi>)
whom they believe to be the same, in all things; and all things to be the
same with him; without any essentiall difference; operating according to
the <hi>extrinsick Qualities</hi> of the subject; as wax is formed into severall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
the which being dissolved by liquefaction, remaine in substance the
selfe same waxe.</p>
                     <p>After this their way; they divide mankinde into ten <hi>Classes.</hi> The foure
first whereof are good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, <hi>Principiantes,</hi> or <hi>Beginners; Proficientes,</hi> or
<hi>Proficients; Provecti,</hi> or those that have <hi>Advanced; Consummati,</hi> or they
that are <hi>accomplisht.</hi> The three first do walke well, although they are but
yet in the way; but the fourth is arrived at perfection, by means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
the <hi>first principle;</hi> and by mortification of their passions; which
did disquiet them with perturbations and scruples; and do already enjoy
such an internall quiet and Peace of minde, that nothing doth give them
any remorse or trouble, for what-ever they thinke, say, or do; assuring
their consciences, that after death they are to expect neither reward nor
punishment; but that every thing shall returne to its <hi>principle,</hi> as it was at
first.</p>
                     <p>For the other six <hi>Classes</hi> of men, they make six Hels. The first and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
is of Infants, who have not yet had any experience of their passions,
nor been troubled by them; especially by covetousnesse, anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64464:57"/>
second is of them, who being placed in the government of the world,
give themselves wholly to the vanity thereof: The third is of them, who
like bruite beasts, follow their passions and disordinate appetites. The
fourth is of them, that rob, wound, assault, and slay. The fifth of them,
who suffer hunger, thirst, miserie, labours, troubles externally in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and internally in the soule. The sixt is of them, that take upon them
voluntary labours and sufferings, as the <hi>Bonzi,</hi> who do penance, fast,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> This externall life serving them only as a disposit on to the internall;
the which being obtained, the other serveth them for nought, no more
than the woodden engine, (which workmen use to shape a vault withall)
after the vault is finished.</p>
                     <p>Now these men do esteeme Hell to be no more than thus: And when
they speak of <hi>Transmigration</hi> into beasts, they say, It is to be understood
of this life: As if a man be civill, courteous, and well bred; they say he is
turned into a man; if cholerick and furious, into a Lyon; If cruell, into a
Tyger; if gluttonous, into a swine: If a thiefe, into a Bird of prey. Hence
was the originall of that handsome saying among them, <hi>Ti Yo Thien
Than Ti Yen Sin Vai.</hi> (That is,) Heaven and Hell are seated in the
heart.</p>
                     <p>These are the Three principall <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> from whence have sprung
many others that are there to be found.</p>
                     <p>They hold, that they may be made all to agree without any prejudice
to their observance. They have a text, which saith, <hi>San Chiao Ye Tao;</hi> that
is, The doctrines are three, but the reason of them is but one. For although
the worship, adoration, and exercise be different, notwithstanding
the end at which they all arrive, is the same, <hi>Cum Hiu,</hi> (that is) nothing.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Litterati</hi> of the first <hi>Sect,</hi> imitating Heaven and Earth, apply all to
the government of the Kingdome; of their families; and of their persons,
only in this life; and after that pretend to nothing. The <hi>Tausi</hi> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Sect,</hi> without any regard to their families or the government, treate
only of the body. The disciples of <hi>Xaca</hi> of the third <hi>Sect,</hi> without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the body, treate only of the spirit, internall peace, and quiet of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
Hence arose that sentence which they use, <hi>Iu Chi Que, Tau Chi
Xin, Xe Chi Sin,</hi> that is, the <hi>Litterati</hi> govern the Kingdom, the <hi>Tausi</hi> the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the <hi>Bonzi</hi> the heart.</p>
                     <p>Besides these three which are all admitted, and publikely professed in
the Kingdom; there is another which is not publike, nor permitted; but
is under a prohibition, notwithstanding it hath many followers: it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Pe Lien Kieo,</hi> and is exceedingly hated of the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> especially of
the governours; because the disciples thereof do conceale themselves, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every thing by night with much secrecy. It is commonly beleeved,
that their intent is, to exalt some of themselves to the Crowne; and it is
verily thought, that some perverse men of this profession, have already
designed it.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Chinesse</hi> of good credit did affirme to me, that there were through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>China</hi> many thousands of them; and that they had a Captaine or King,
with all his officers belonging to him: whom, such of their <hi>Sect,</hi> as live
far off, do reverence in their letters, with all respect due to such a Person;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64464:58"/>
and those that are at hand, when they have a convenience to assemble
themselves, do honour him with services, courtesies and splendour, suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to that of royall Majestie: and that all of them knew one another.</p>
                     <p>In the yeare 1622. in the Province of <hi>Xantum,</hi> which lieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that of <hi>Nankim</hi> and <hi>Pekim,</hi> there was discovered and taken
one of these that was their Captaines. And because the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darines</hi>
were resolved, not only to punish him, but all those that
followed his <hi>Sect</hi> likewise; they questioned him concerning his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;
and not being able to draw a confession from him, they gave
him severall times the rack. Which being understood by those, of the
same <hi>Sect,</hi> whether it were for love they bare him, or for fear, that he might
be constrained to confesse and discover them, they all resolved to arme
themselves, and fall upon the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> and by force of armes to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their companion: which accordingly they put in execution, with so
much suddennesse, that it was impossible for the others to resist or escape
them. They slew many of the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> and the rest were so affrighted,
that they delivered their companion,</p>
                     <p>Then having formed themselves into a Body, they began to conquer
the <hi>Province.</hi> At the beginning their number was not considerable, but
in a short time there were so many, who joyned themselves to them, part
of their own faction, and part of other vagabonds, that already they came
to be many thousands; and so going on, without finding any resistance,
they made themselves Masters of the small villages, and at lengh tooke
two walled Towns, where they fortified themselves, issuing out from
thence, to assault their enemies.</p>
                     <p>This newes gave no little trouble to the Court, the rebels being very
neer them. But at length by the diligence they used, all was remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
by reason, that numerous forces were sent out against them from <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim:</hi>
and although at the beginning, there fell out many battailes with
various successe, both on the one and other side, yet at the length they of
<hi>Pekim</hi> were Conquerours, and the rebels army defeated, and their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
taken, who called himselfe King; and kept this Title with so much
obstinacie, that being lodged at the house of a Person of quality, before
he came to the Court, he did him no Reverence at all; and being bid to
bow and do him Reverence, he answered with much disdaine, the King
doth Reverence to no man. Being come to Court, he was condemned to
die, and was accordingly beheaded; and this was the Crown which he
deserved. After that, the King quieted the rest by pardoning the greatest
part of the rebels.</p>

sicknesse, misfortunes, disgraces and other evils: and in this facultie
they have many skilfull professours, on whom they spend a great deale
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64464:59"/>
of mony without any profit at all.</p>
                     <p>Others <hi>Divine</hi> by the <hi>Physiognomie</hi> of the face; others by considering
the lines and strokes of the hand; others interpret dreames.</p>
                     <p>Whilest I dwelt in <hi>Nankim,</hi> there was a man, who went to consult one
of these about a dreame he had, which was concerning an <hi>Umbrella,</hi> or
skreen to keep off the Sunne: the professour asked him, if there were any
plea or enditement against him, in any Court of Justice: he answered,
There was: Well said the professour, then <hi>San</hi> signifieth an <hi>Umbrella,</hi> and
<hi>San</hi> also signifieth to vanish; and the interpretation of your dreame is, that
all that is against you will vanish and come to nothing. The poore man
was very well pleased, but being afterwards araigned, he received <hi>thirty
Bastinad'os</hi> well set on. The wretch being angrie at his punishment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he thought himselfe secure, went to quarrel with the professour, who
answered him, Alas, I had forgot to aske thee, Whether the <hi>Umbrella,</hi>
which thou sawest, were a new one, or an old one: it was a new one, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the foole. Then said the professour, Make account, that thy sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
do but now begin.</p>
                     <p>Others <hi>divine</hi> only by the Touch, and these are blind men. In the
yeare 1630. there came to the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Kiamsi,</hi> a blind man, well in
years: he opened shop, and was frequented by many of the <hi>Nobility:</hi> he
foretold many things, with much confidence; and a certain Gentleman of
the same City, that was of one of the foure principall families of that
place, came to me to tell me what had passed; he knew me, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
well enough, what my opinion was in that matter. He told me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular cases of things already happened; by which he was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the event, of what the other said, should yet come to passe; and
prayed me, that I would go in person, and make triall of him. I went on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to undeceive him: and coming to him, he touched my hand, and bid
me speak: when I had spoke, he began to tell, that I was married, and
that I had two sonnes, that one of them was towardly, the other wilde and
disobedient; that my wife was froward and discontented; in fine, that my
whole family was in disorder: but that when I had taken my degree, all
would be well. He is already a <hi>Graduate,</hi> answered my friend. Where, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the blind man? In another Province, answered the other. At which
the blind man withdrew, seeing, although without eyes, that he had erred
in that particular of my degree.</p>
                     <p>Besides these, whom they consult, they have in their Temples, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
kindes of lots; and a booke that explaineth them: They do very
frequently draw these lots, and they as frequently deceive them.</p>
                     <p>The observe likewise, and make <hi>Auguryes</hi> from the <hi>singing</hi> of <hi>Birds,</hi>
&amp; from the <hi>Howling</hi> of <hi>Beasts:</hi> &amp; if at their going out in the morning, they
presently meet with a man cloathed in <hi>Mourning,</hi> a <hi>Bonzi,</hi> or such like thing,
they take it for an ill <hi>Augurie:</hi> They say also, that they have familiar spirits,
which they frequently consult: But of this I have not had any knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Anciently, in time of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> there were many very skilfull in this
Art; and if we may beleeve, what <hi>Marcus Venetus</hi> relateth, they did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wonders: But at this day there is nothing certainly known of this
matter. Yet there is still a family, that have a particular pension from the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64464:59"/>
King, which is continued, by succession to their posteritie; and the name
of, <hi>Magitian</hi> or <hi>Wizard Major,</hi> and is the chiefe of that Sect, and is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
sent for to the King. I for my part believe, the devill hath more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
over them, than they have over the devill.</p>
                     <p>As for sacrifices they are very frequent in <hi>China,</hi> as well great as small
ones: and every one provideth for them what he will, or rather what he
can, according to his estate and abilitie. They sacrifice foure times a year,
to <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Sunne, Moone,</hi> and greater part of the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Starres;</hi> to
the <hi>Earth, Mountaines,</hi> and the <hi>foure parts</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> to the <hi>Sea, Rivers,
Lakes,</hi> and other things. But it seemeth that in realitie they sacrifice to
the <hi>Spirits</hi> of those things, when in common speech, they say they sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the <hi>Earth, Mountaines,</hi> &amp;c. Which may be seen in many sacrifices
they make; as in the sacrifice of the house, kitchin, ships, standards and
ensignes, when they go to war, and such like things; in which sacrifices
they speak only to the <hi>Tutelar Spirits</hi> of those things.</p>
                     <p>They sacrifice much more to the Idols, and to famous men deceased;
to whom, when they know them to be such, they cause Temples to be
built, and place in them their Images, for services they have done, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
benefits the Kingdome hath received by them.</p>
                     <p>If seemeth, that at the beginning it was, and still is meant, only for a
kinde of gratefull commemoration of them; and that properly they do
not sacrifice to them, but only bring offerings to them, and perform other
<hi>Ceremonies.</hi> But the ignorant people in time, are come to worship them as
Saints, and make praiers to them, and other such like honours.</p>
                     <p>They make likewise these kinde of offerings to their <hi>Ancestours;</hi> whose
pictures and Images, (or at least their names written) they have alwaies
present at these offerings and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> They only make mention of <hi>six,</hi>
that is, the <hi>first founder</hi> of their familie; <hi>their third</hi> and <hi>fourth Grand-father,</hi>
their <hi>great Grand-father, Grand-father</hi> and <hi>Father:</hi> And when he that is
the chiefe of the familie dyeth, they take him in, and leave out the fourth
Grand-father: So that there alwaies remaine <hi>six</hi> and no more. These
offerings and <hi>ceremonies</hi> are not properly sacrifices made to their <hi>Fathers,</hi>
for they do not believe that their <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Ancestours</hi> are all, either
Gods or Saints; but only it is a demonstration of <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
which they thinke is due to them, from whom they have received
their being.</p>
                     <p>The which they sacrifice is, some kindes of <hi>Beasts,</hi> as <hi>Goats, Hogges,</hi> and
<hi>Oxen:</hi> These are the most usuall. Of <hi>Foules</hi> the most ordinary are <hi>Cocks</hi>
and <hi>Hens.</hi> Of <hi>Fishes</hi> what they please. They also sacrifice pieces of flesh,
and most commonly the <hi>Head:</hi> They sacrifice also <hi>Rice, Pulse,</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi>
And if the King sacrifice any of these things, the <hi>Mandarines</hi> take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
large shares of them; and if the better sort of people sacrifice, such
as are the heads of families, it is divided among the kindred. The ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sort of people, after they have made their offering, which is comonly
boyled before hand, take up every thing againe, then having dressed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
according to their <hi>fancy,</hi> they make a feast with it, where it is all
eaten.</p>
                     <p>They sacrifice many other things; as <hi>Banners</hi> and <hi>Umbrellas,</hi> all of silk;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64464:60"/>
severall <hi>figures</hi> moulded in gold or silver, or else made of <hi>Orpine,</hi> or base
gold; great summes of mony made of cut paper. All these things are to
be sold, ready made, in the market places, at the shops of severall Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
and after they are sacrificed, they burn them all.</p>
                     <p>Every man offereth sacrifice without any difference, they having no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
ministers appointed for this act: neither indeed have they for
other things; as for offices (or Divine service) Burialls, to sing and offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
at them with any exactnesse.</p>
                     <p>It belongeth only to the king to sacrifice to <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Earth, Sunne,
Moone, Planets</hi> and <hi>Starres,</hi> and if any others should do it in publick, he
were guilty of a great crime. For this end they have two most famous
<hi>Temples</hi> at the <hi>two Courts:</hi> where the King sacrificeth at the <hi>foure seasons</hi> of
the year, <hi>Spring, Summer, Antumne</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> going thither himselfe in
person; and if he cannot go, he sendeth some other to officiate in his
stead.</p>
                     <p>The great <hi>Lords</hi> and those who are <hi>Titelados,</hi> sacrifice to the <hi>Mountaines,
Lakes,</hi> &amp;c. The Gentlemen and Officers to the four seasons of the year,
and particular parts of the earth, <hi>Hills,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>For the rest, as to their Idols, their houshold-gods, <hi>Genij,</hi> or <hi>Tutelar
Angells,</hi> any one sacrificeth that will, there being set times and places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for it: except at sometimes they do accomodate themselves, both
to the occasions and places; as when any one is to take a voyage by water,
he offereth sacrifice on the day, whereon he departeth; and that either in
the <hi>Barke,</hi> or on the <hi>next shore.</hi>

Chinesses.</head>
                     <p>THe knowledge and skill of <hi>Warre</hi> and <hi>Military</hi> affairs is very ancient
among the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> as appeareth by their bookes and Histories;
and it is very certaine, that they have conquered many famous King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes:
it is also commonly beleeved, that they did formerly conquer
<hi>Ceilan;</hi> and neere to that place, in the City of <hi>Nagapatam</hi> there is to be
seen, at this day, an edifice, or building, which they call <hi>The Pagod of the
Chinesses:</hi> and it is a Tradition among the people of that Countrie, that it
was built by them. Neither truly is it a worke unfit to be compared to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of that Kingdome. Neverthelesse their bookes make no mention at
all of it; but that is not a sufficient reason altogether to refute this Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for no more have they any memory left in their bookes of the ancient
Christianitie, which notwithstanding it is most certaine, was there; and
was also very much dilated and spread abroad. However it is manifest,
that they had 114. Kingdomes Tributary to them; but at this day they
have only the neighbouring Countries, which are nothing neere so many;
and even of these, some of them do deny them their tribute; and others
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64464:60"/>
have been abandoned by the <hi>Chinesses</hi> themselves, holding it better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
themselves to their own, in peace and quietnesse, than to go on stil with
warre and troubles, to conquer or maintaine other Kingdomes.</p>
                     <p>Beside the <hi>Conquests</hi> and <hi>warres</hi> made with stranger Kingdomes, they
have had warre also for many yeares in their own Countrie; so that beside
many particular books that treate thereof, they have one body of historie
consisting of ten Tomes, which only treateth of the <hi>warrs</hi> of those times,
of their <hi>Captaines,</hi> their manner of <hi>warfare, battailes, victories,</hi> and other
things: wherein are many notable things to be read, which do clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
that they have formerly been a <hi>valiant</hi> and <hi>warlike</hi> nation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there are but few such at this time. The occasions how they came
thus to grow lesse, were very great, as I shall shew hereafter.</p>
                     <p>At this day, that which they have of <hi>warlike</hi> in the Kingdome, is only
the <hi>multitude,</hi> which is very great; for besides the <hi>Souldiery,</hi> which they
have in the frontiers of <hi>Tartarie,</hi> and in the <hi>Armados</hi> and fleets, which are
at the mouths of the great rivers, which runne into the Sea, every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and in that every City and Village of the Kingdome, hath a proper
<hi>militia</hi> of their own, which is paid by them, and commanded by their
own Captaines: and in case that any Province hath need of men, they
make use of the <hi>Souldierie</hi> of their own Cities and Townes; which by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the <hi>vice-roy</hi> is easily brought to one <hi>Rendevous.</hi> And if there be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for them on the frontiers, or any other place of the Kingdome,
presently by order from the King, or his councell of <hi>warre,</hi> they rayse the
<hi>Souldiers</hi> of one or more Provinces, according to the Present necessitie,
and the possibilitie of the Province; all of them not being able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the same number of Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>Souldiers</hi> are alwayes in readinesse, and if one of them be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or die, there are presently enow in the same Town, though it be
never so little, who make suite for the employment; and so the place is
presently supplied.</p>
                     <p>In the City of <hi>Nankim</hi> they say, there are 40000 <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and in that
of <hi>Pekim 80000.</hi> and throughout the whole Kingdome (as Father <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoeus
Riccius</hi> affirmeth, who lived in <hi>China</hi> many yeares, and had very
good Knowledge thereof) above a million: and Father <hi>Iohn Rodriguez,</hi>
who went very much up and down <hi>China,</hi> and had opportunitie to see the
principall places thereof, and was very curious, saith; that he found by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
search in their books, that in the body of the Kingdome, with all
the Cities and Villages thereof, there are 594000 <hi>Souldiers;</hi> and on the
great wals, which confine on <hi>Tartarie 682888.</hi> and yet he did not put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this number the <hi>Souldiers</hi> of the <hi>Armado</hi> that guardeth the coast. Nor
wil this number seem so excessive, if we consider, that <hi>China</hi> alone, beside
that it is much more populous, is as big as <hi>Spain, France, Italie, Germanie,</hi>
the <hi>Low-Countries, great Brittain,</hi> and all the <hi>Islands</hi> belonging to it.</p>
                     <p>In all this multitude; if we speak of them, who guard the <hi>Frontiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
there is no doubt but there is found some valour and courage; and they
have sometimes gallantly repulsed the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and in the yeare 1596, when
the <hi>Giapponesses,</hi> after they had passed through all the Kingdome of <hi>Corea,</hi>
without finding any resistance, would have entred <hi>China,</hi> which they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64464:61"/>
came on purpose to conquer, the <hi>Chinesses</hi> repulsed them in such manner,
that after the losse of many men, they were faine to put up their pipes, and
returne home without doing any thing: so likewise the <hi>Souldiers</hi> of the
<hi>Armado</hi> have made some assaults, wherein they have been <hi>victorious.</hi> But
if we speake of them, who live in the Cities and Villages throughout the
Kingdome, they are but of small courage and valour: but you must not
conceive, that they are only <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and have no other profession, for
they are Inhabitants and natives of the same places; and are <hi>Taylors, Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers</hi>
&amp;c. They are alwaies ready to march at the Kings command, and
leaving their houses, go to the warre, whensoever there is occasion, They
are moreover obliged, to appear at the musters and traynings for three
months in the <hi>Spring,</hi> and three in the <hi>Autumne;</hi> the which are held in the
great Cities every day infallibly, where only a <hi>Tertia</hi> or third part of them
do muster; but in Villages they do all make their appearance every day.</p>
                     <p>The manner which they hold in this <hi>Militia,</hi> is thus. All the <hi>Souldiery,</hi>
whether of Foot or Horse, are drawn up into a Body, and if any be found
missing, there is an other put in his place; and in that place and degree,
into which they are once admitted, they <hi>almost ever</hi> remaine, or are but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
advanced, I said, <hi>almost alwayes,</hi> because on the Frontires, if any <hi>Souldier</hi>
perform any notable exploit, they sometimes make him a <hi>Captain,</hi> and
he is advanced to his degrees without being examined: but this is a thing
which falleth out very rarely.</p>
                     <p>For to make <hi>Captaines, Lieutenants,</hi> and <hi>Corporals,</hi> &amp;c. there are exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
and in them two degrees are conferred; which (to make them be
the better understood) we will call <hi>Licentiats in arms,</hi> and <hi>Doctours in
arms.</hi> The first examination is held in the chief Cities of the Provinces,
whither all pretenders do resort, (and in the same vniversity or generall
Palace, where the students are examined;) and there they are to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
giving them for a point, or <hi>Theme,</hi> certaine doubts in matters of
war, to which they answer with their pen, making thereon discourses
and compositions. The speculative triall being ended, they come to the
practick.</p>
                     <p>They must shoote nine arrowes, standing still upon their feet, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nine on horse-back, against a great Target, whilest the horse is in his
speed; and of those who behave themselves best, both in the triall of
shooting, and in that of composing, some are chosen, on whom the first
degree is conferred; which hath also its ensignes and ornaments. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
degree is conferred at Court in the same year; where all those who
have obtained the first degree, do assemble themselves; and the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is held in the same manner as before; only there are more doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
matters of warre proposed, than before. Their ensignes are the
same with those of the <hi>Doctours in learning;</hi> which is to be understood in
the Cities, while the Kingdom is in peace; for in warre, or publique acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
where they assist as <hi>Souldiers,</hi> they have their particular ensignes and
ornaments of <hi>Captaines.</hi> The graduates are employed the same yeare, in the
office of Captaines; and so are advanced by degrees, til they come, it may
be, to be <hi>Captaines General,</hi> although there be no war. They who remaine
only with the first degree, are employed in the lesser, and more ordinary
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64464:61"/>
charges of the warr; but they are alwayes to be in somthing of command.</p>
                     <p>As for their <hi>Armes,</hi> I say first; that the use of <hi>Powder</hi> is very ancient in
<hi>China:</hi> and in fire-works, wherein they are excellently skilfull, they spend
more powder in a year, than in their <hi>Armies,</hi> at this time, in five. Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
it seemeth, they used it more in the warr. For even to this day, there
are to be seen on the gates of the City of <hi>Nankim,</hi> on both sides of the
town, great Brasse <hi>Bombards,</hi> or <hi>Cannon,</hi> which though they be but short
yet are very well made; from whence it may be concluded, that they have
formerly been in use. But now they know not how to make use of them,
and keep them only for ostentation. Neverthelesse they make some use
of <hi>Morter pieces,</hi> or <hi>Spingards;</hi> but they have but few, and those ill-made.
They have also <hi>Dagges</hi> two palms long, of Musket-bore; they do stock
three, and sometimes fower of these together, and shoot them off all at
once. In their ships of warr, they carry Guns, but they are very small
ones, neither do they know, how to levell them at a mark. But now, since
the <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>China</hi> have made many fire-armes in <hi>Machao,</hi> by meanes of
the <hi>Portughesses; Muskets</hi> began to come into <hi>China:</hi> but the <hi>Armes</hi> which
they commonly serve with, are, <hi>Bowes</hi> and <hi>Arrowes, Lances, Scimitars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the yeare 1621 the City of <hi>Macao</hi> sent, for a present, to the King three
great pieces of <hi>Cannon,</hi> with their <hi>Cannoniers</hi> belonging to them, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the use of them; which accordingly they did in <hi>Pekim,</hi> to
the great affrightment of many <hi>Mandarines:</hi> who would needs be present
to see them discharged. At which time, there fell out an unhappie acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
which was, that one of the Guns violently recoyling killed one <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tughese,</hi>
and three or fower <hi>Chinesses,</hi> besides many more that were Scared.
These <hi>Guns</hi> were highlie esteemed, and carried to the <hi>Frontiers</hi> against the
<hi>Tartars;</hi> who not knowing of this new invention, and coming on, many
together in a close Body, received such a slaughter from an Iron piece,
that they were not only put to flight at that time, but went on ever after
with more caution.</p>
                     <p>For defensive <hi>Armes,</hi> they use round <hi>Bucklers, Caskes</hi> or <hi>Head-pieces,</hi> and
certaine plates of Iron three fingers broad, laid one upon another, of
which they make Back and Brest-pieces; they are but of little proof, and
are made only against arrowes.</p>
                     <p>In a word both their <hi>Armes</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> are but little worth at this
time. The occasions thereof are many; the <hi>First</hi> is the great ease and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
in which they have lived these many yeares, since the Kingdome
hath been free from warr. The <hi>Second</hi> is, the great account they make of
learning, and the little esteem they have of <hi>Armes;</hi> so that the least magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
will dare to baffle a <hi>Captaine</hi> of <hi>Armes,</hi> let him be never so great.
The <hi>Third</hi> is their manner of electing <hi>Captaines</hi> by way of examination, as
we have said, being all raw <hi>Souldiers,</hi> that understand nothing in matters of
<hi>warr.</hi> The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, because all <hi>Souldiers,</hi> are either couragious by nature,
or Spurred on to <hi>Gallantrie</hi> by the example of those <hi>Noble</hi> Persons, who
lead them; or else they are animated by the discipline, their Captaines do
bring them up in. But the <hi>Souldiers</hi> of <hi>China</hi> want all these occasions. For
commonly their courage is but little; their <hi>Nobilitie</hi> lesse; their <hi>Education</hi>
least of all; for they will <hi>bastinado</hi> a <hi>Souldier</hi> for any fault, as if he were a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64464:62"/>
child that went to schoole. The <hi>fifth,</hi> because in their <hi>Armies,</hi> over all the
<hi>Captaines,</hi> and also the <hi>Generall</hi> himselfe, there goeth a <hi>Generalissimo,</hi> who
is alwaies a man of the long robe: This man marcheth alwaies in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the maine <hi>Battalia,</hi> and from the place of <hi>Battaile</hi> is many times a
daies journy off; so that he is too remote to give orders, and to runne away,
in any case of danger, he is most ready. The <hi>sixth</hi> is, that in their <hi>Councells</hi> of
<hi>warre</hi> (of which they have two; one in the Court of <hi>Nankim;</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in that of <hi>Pekim;</hi> and each hath a <hi>President,</hi> two <hi>Collateralls,</hi> and eight
or nine <hi>Colleagues</hi>) there is not one <hi>Souldier,</hi> or <hi>Captaine</hi> among them, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that hath ever seen the <hi>warres;</hi> and yet for all that, the whole <hi>Militia</hi> of
the Kingdome is ordered by them, especially by the Councell of <hi>Pekim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Only there might be answered to what hath been said, that the <hi>Chinesses</hi>
do use training, and exercises of <hi>warre,</hi> for three months in the <hi>Spring,</hi> and
three in the <hi>Autumne</hi> every year: which cannot be done without some
profit, exercising themselves in shooting arrowes at a marke, and shooting
also very well. But in truth this exercise of theirs is the most rediculous
thing in the world: For dividing their men into squadrons, part feign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be enemies, and part <hi>Chinesses,</hi> (as among us in <hi>Portugall,</hi> the
boyes divide themselves into <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi>) one part cometh, as
it were, a farre off to warre with the other; then they send out spies, and
send away messengers to the <hi>Mandarines</hi> (who are sitting not farre of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a <hi>Canopie,</hi> or <hi>Pavilion</hi> of silke) giving them notice, that they are in such
a place, and the enemie in such a place; then the <hi>Chinesses</hi> send out a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
against them, who encountring knock their <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Lances</hi> one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the others, just as plaiers do upon a stage; and this, or very little
more is all they do.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the warre which the Tartars made
upon China.</head>
                     <p>WHen <hi>Humun</hi> the first founder of the royall family that governeth
at present, drove the <hi>Tartar</hi> out of the Kingdome, who had kept
all <hi>China</hi> under his subjection ninetie years, he not only re-gained his own
Kingdome, but entred likewise into those of the others and conquered
those Kingdomes, that lay neerest him towards the <hi>North,</hi> obliging them
to pay him tribute: neither did he let them remaine in the manner of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
but the same <hi>Humun</hi> divided them into 160. families or States; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them diverse dignities and offices. These States grew so great, that
they divided themselves into three Kingdomes; one towards the <hi>West;</hi>
another toward the <hi>North,</hi> and the third toward the <hi>East.</hi> The two first
presently with-drew themselves from their obedience to the <hi>Chinesses;</hi>
only he of the <hi>East</hi> remaining their friend, treating with them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
his obligations.</p>
                     <p>This continued for many years; till the <hi>Chinesses</hi> seeing that <hi>Easterne</hi>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:64464:62"/>
Kingdome to encrease much, whether it were for reason of state, or for
some other particular respect, they resolved to fall upon it, and to
bring them under, so that the <hi>Tartars</hi> forced by desperation, resolved at
once to invade upon them; this is the usuall effect of <hi>Extortion</hi> and <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and where the Prince would have more from the people, than they are
able to give. Whence <hi>Theopompus</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> when his
wife told him, that because he had eased his people of many taxes, he
would leave his soone a poorer Kingdome, than he had received from his
Father, answered, <hi>Relinquo, sed diuturnius.</hi> That is, I shall, leave him a
more lasting Kingdome. The <hi>Tartars</hi> therefore secretly levied Souldiers,
and on a sudden fell upon a fort in the Province of <hi>Leaotum,</hi> and tooke it;
making afterwards many in-roads to their profit, and to the great damage
of the <hi>Chinesses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> of the <hi>West</hi> and of the <hi>North,</hi> whether it were out of love
to their Country, or out of intrest, which is more probable, raised also an
Army, and came in to the Succour of their <hi>Easterne</hi> Countrimen; and by
little and little grew so numerous, that in the yeare 1618 two very great
<hi>Armies,</hi> one <hi>Chinesse,</hi> and the other <hi>Tartar,</hi> came to a field-battaile; in
which the <hi>Chinesses</hi> were vanished and put to flight, with a very great loss
of men. And that it might the better be understood, how the state
of things were then, I will set down here a memorial or petition, which the
<hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Councell of warre</hi> gave the King concerning this businesse;
which I translated at that time, and sent it into <hi>Europe</hi> for news, and now I
have found it here printed, and it saith thus.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>A memoriall, or petition, presented by the president
of the Councell of Warre to the King.</head>
                        <p>IN <hi>this six and fourtieth year of your Reign, in the sixth Moone, (which was the
yeare 1618 in the month of</hi> August) <hi>the</hi> President of the Councell of Warre
<hi>presenteth you with this</hi> Memoriall, <hi>as to our Lord and King, upon occasion
that the</hi> Tartars <hi>are entred within the walls toward the</hi> North, <hi>in which he
humbly petitioneth you, that you would attend this businesse, and presently open
your Treasures, and assist this Warre with men and ammunition. For the truth
is, that in this month I have received intelligence from the</hi> Captaines, <hi>that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
in the Province of the walls toward the</hi> North; <hi>wherein they give me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that in all parts of that Province there were proclamations published, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they did declare, that the</hi> Tartars <hi>were gathered together to Conquer this
world of</hi> China; <hi>and gave me intelligence of the day appointed for the</hi> Battaile;
<hi>the which accordingly was fought at that time, with a great strength and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of people: and entring within the wals, they have taken some of our men,
to Sacrifice them: and the day before the battaile they did Sacrifice them with
great acclamations to their King; and have already proclaimed him King of</hi>
Pekim. <hi>They bring with them many hundred thousands of Souldiers; and each
heareth about him severall sorts of</hi> Armes. <hi>Our men, who met to encounter
and suppresse them, were two</hi> Captaines-Generall, <hi>ninety six ordinary</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
<hi>and</hi> 300000 men at armes. <hi>They joyned battaile, and in the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
they killed thirty eight of our Captaines, amongst whom was one of our</hi>
Generals: <hi>the others are slaine without number: they took also some thousands
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64464:63"/>
of prisoners; and in the retreat, by reason of the confusion and disorder, there
were killed by them above a thousand of our men. The people of the Cities are
fled, as also those of the other Townes. Whereupon, the same day they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
masters of three Cities. Upon the reciept of this newes we assembled the</hi>
Councell, <hi>the</hi> Colao, <hi>and other</hi> Mandarines <hi>of this Court, that in so weighty a
businesse wee might finde some good expedient: And in truth it seemeth to us,
that heaven doth favour the enemy, who otherwise could not have been able to
have made such a slaughter of our people in one day, and to have taken three Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and so it seemeth heaven is angry with us. As also the</hi> Prodigies, <hi>which
we have lately all seen, do demonstrate no lesse, In the Province of</hi> Pekim <hi>the
last yeare it</hi> raigned not at all; <hi>and the people went about like men halfe dead:
and in the Province of</hi> Xankim, <hi>there was so great a</hi> dearth <hi>and</hi> famine, <hi>that
the people did eat one another: and into</hi> Nankim <hi>came an infinite multitude of</hi>
Mice; <hi>neither was it discovered, whence that</hi> plague <hi>came. In the royall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,
of five parts the</hi> fire <hi>burnt downe two, and the</hi> wind <hi>overthrew five To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
of this City: we saw</hi> two Sunnes <hi>together, and the one did</hi> Ecclipse <hi>the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
These are all things of evill</hi> Prognostication: <hi>but above all, we saw a
man enter into the royall Palaces with resolution to kill the Prince; which he had
done, had he not been hindred</hi> (This fell out when the King would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
his second sonne heire of the Kingdome; who was growne very
powerfull by the favour and art of the Eunuches; and, at that time, there
came in a man to have killed the eldest sonne; but he was hindred by his
feare, and the women, who helped the Prince.) <hi>And the worst is; that, a</hi>
Mandarine <hi>having spoken something high, shewing therein his fidelitie to you,
our Lord, but for his</hi> Loyaltie <hi>you made him a</hi> Traitour, <hi>and commanded he should
be put in prison, and although we made great means to free him, by declaring his
innocency, yet you never gave eare unto us.</hi> (This imprisonment was, when the
King shewed his eldest sonne to the Mandarines in the royall hall, whom
they would have had declared heire of the Kingdome, &amp; the King would
not: and one of them tooke the boldnesse to speake, and to plead for the
true Prince, and was therefore committed prisoner by the King.)</p>
                        <p>Many times the <hi>Mandarines</hi> presented <hi>Memorialls;</hi> wherein they did relate
the miserable condition of the people, desiring that their <hi>Taxes</hi> might be lessoned,
a thing worthy of much consideration; but neither did you make any account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
We the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of this court have severall times petitioned, that you
would come out, and give <hi>Audience</hi> in publick, as your <hi>Predecessours</hi> hetherto
have done; that the government might be conformable to that of heaven, as it is
most fitting: you answered us sometimes, that you were not well; other times, that
the weather was cold and rough, and that we should meet another day: we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till <hi>Spring</hi> time, then till the beginning of <hi>Summer,</hi> that you would performe
what you had promised; but you not only gave no answer to the <hi>second Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>
but you commanded it to be burnt: and in this manner you live retired in the
Palace, without making any account of what importeth you most. For this reason
are the calamities so great; and we persecuted with <hi>warres. Peace</hi> is wanting;
and, as it seemeth, it will be wanting; for we are come to see <hi>rivers of blood</hi>
running downe: and above all, in the third <hi>moone</hi> last past, there came some
from the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi> to tell us, that there had appeared there a man cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in yellow, with a green cap on his head, and in his hand a fan of feathers, who
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64464:63"/>
spake thus, <hi>Vanli (that is the name of the King)</hi> doth not governe, though he
hath raigned long: he sleepeth alwaies: the Kingdome is ready to be lost, the
people will die of hunger; the <hi>Captaines</hi> will be slaine and pierced through with
lances: and when he had said this, he vanished. The <hi>Mandarines</hi> were amazed.
The <hi>Vice-roy</hi> used great diligence to know who this man was: but could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
finde him out, seeing therefore the <hi>calamites, famine, warre,</hi> and other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills,
which the Kingdome now suffereth, we plainly perceive, that it was a
<hi>prognostication</hi> of these things. Wherefore we are againe returned to require
you, speedily to open your treasures of mony; that fresh leavies of men may be made,
and some remedy put to so great evills.</p>
                        <p>This is the <hi>Memoriall,</hi> which was presented in the year 1618 since when,
the <hi>Tartars</hi> have continued every summer (for in the winter, by reason of
the great cold, nothing can be done) to make considerable inroads; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are commonly gainers, to the great losse of the <hi>Chinesses.</hi> So that
the year 1622, two principall <hi>Madarines</hi> of the fort of <hi>Quamsi,</hi> where; as
being the chiefe fortresse of that Province, the <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> maketh his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
(whether it were, that they were discontented, or had hopes to
better their condition by it) made a secret agreement with the <hi>Tartars</hi> to
deliver the fortresse into their hands; which accordingly they did; for the
<hi>Tartars</hi> falling on upon that side, which was assigned them, assoone as ever
they began the assault, they easily tooke it, by the Treason, which the others
had plotted, and put to flight all them, who knew nothing of the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
who, together with the <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> escaped to <hi>Xamhai,</hi> the last fortresse
(as it were) of that Province, and the first of the Province of <hi>Pekim;</hi> the
key and strength of the whole Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>Assoone as the newes of this last route came to Court, both the King
and his <hi>Grandees</hi> were in great disorder, and deliberated to change his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode,
and to remove to the Court of <hi>Nankim,</hi> as farthest off from danger;
and it had accordingly been put in execution, if a principall <hi>Mandarine</hi> (for
there is alwayes found some one or other, who taketh care of the publick
good) had not presented a <hi>Memoriall</hi> to the King, wherein he demonstrated
to him, that this alteration would be the best and readiest way to destroy
the whole Kingdome, or the greater part at least, by dispoyling of all
strength, the Court and Province of <hi>Pekim,</hi> that was so neere the other
Province, which was now ready to be lost.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Memoriall</hi> took effect; and by it the the designe of flying and
seeking a new habitation, was broken off; it being formerly resolved,
that <hi>Nankim</hi> should be fortified. There was therefore a proclamation sent
out, which under great penalties, did prohibite any to go out of the Court,
not only <hi>Mandarines</hi> and people of qualitie, but even the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
also. Vpon this the people began to bee quieted, especially seeing,
that the Citie was strengthened with new <hi>Garrisons, Guards, Watches,</hi> and
a rigorous strictnesse at the gate. The chiefest care was to fortifie the passe
at <hi>Xam Hai Quàn,</hi> which, as I said above, is on the very frontire of the
Province of <hi>Leaotum,</hi> which was already lost, and on the entrance of the
Province of <hi>Pekim,</hi> and by reason the place, streightened on both sides
with very high mountaines, is impregnable: they sent thither great store
of <hi>Ammunition,</hi> and fresh <hi>Souldiers</hi> in so great number, that it was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64464:64"/>
that at that post only they had 80000 men of Warre. The King also
sent new <hi>Captaines</hi> with ample power; which would have been of greater
effect, if he could have given it them over the <hi>Tartars,</hi> to conduct them
that way: who seeing it was not possible to make their entrance at that
place, both because it was so easie to defend, as also that it was well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with men, began to wheele off to the <hi>East</hi> side thereof, through part
of <hi>Corea,</hi> giving off their designe of going toward <hi>Pekim;</hi> which if they
had done with so powerfull and victorous an <hi>Army,</hi> they had put that
Court into a greater feare and danger, than ever yet they had experience
of. The <hi>Chinesses</hi> met them not far from the Court, where there began so
furious a <hi>Battaile,</hi> that many men lost their lives both of the one and the
other side; yet at the last the <hi>Chinesses</hi> had the victorie: <hi>so great endeavour
will men use to defend their own home.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A little while after this fight arrived at the Court of <hi>Pekim</hi> a <hi>Portughess</hi>
named <hi>Gonsalvo Texera,</hi> who was sent thither with an <hi>Embassie</hi> and a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from the City of <hi>Macao;</hi> who seeing the insolency of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and
the feare of the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> and judging that by it they might do service to
the Crown of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and a kindnesse to themselves, in what the King
of <hi>China</hi> might do for them, offered to the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> in the name of the
City of <hi>Macao,</hi> some <hi>Portughesses</hi> to assist them against the <hi>Tartars.</hi> The
profer was kindly accepted of, and a <hi>Memoriall</hi> was presented to the
King, who presently returned a favourable answer. The <hi>Councell of Warre</hi>
dispatched a Father of our company to <hi>Macao,</hi> (who was already gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with the <hi>Embassadours</hi> to negotiate this assistance) with severall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to the officers of <hi>Cantone,</hi> to expedite the businesse as much as they
could, with all liberalitie, and provision, and convenience for the men that
were desired of them.</p>
                        <p>Foure hundred men were put in order, that is 200 Souldiers, of which
many were <hi>Portughesses,</hi> some whereof were borne in <hi>Portugall,</hi> and some
there: but the most of them were people of that Countrie, who although
they were <hi>Chinesses,</hi> borne in <hi>Macao,</hi> yet were bred up among the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghesses</hi>
after their manner, and were good Souldiers, and shot well in
<hi>Guns.</hi> To each Souldier was given a youth to serve him, who was
bought with the Kings money, and so large pay for themselves, that
with it the <hi>Souldiers</hi> clothed themselves richly, and provided themselves
with armes, and were after all that left very rich too.</p>
                        <p>These <hi>Souldiers</hi> set out from <hi>Macao</hi> with two Captaines, one whereof
was named <hi>Pietro Corderio,</hi> the other <hi>Antonio Rodriquez del capoo,</hi> with
their <hi>Alfieres</hi> and other <hi>Officers.</hi> When they were come to <hi>Cantone,</hi> they
mustered themselves with so much gallantrie, and with such salutes of
their <hi>Musquetrie,</hi> that the <hi>Chinesses</hi> were astonished.</p>
                        <p>There they were furnished with boates to passe up the river, with all
convenience, through the whole Province, being presented by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
when they came to any of their Cities and Villages, sending re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
for them all, of <hi>Hens, Beefe, Fruit, Wine, Rice.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>They passed over the Mountaines which divide the Province of
<hi>Cantone</hi> from that of <hi>Kiamsi</hi> (and is lesse than a daies journey from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
River) all on horse-back, even to the meanest of their servants. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senty,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64464:64"/>
upon the other side of the Mountaine, they were imbarqued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and going down the River, they crossed after the same manner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the Province of <hi>Kiamsie,</hi> till they came to the <hi>Metropolis</hi> thereof,
where I lived at that time, and had under my direction a good number
of Christians, there they stayed only to see the City, and to be wel looked
on by them. They were invited by many of the noble men, that they
might looke upon the Fashion of their habit, and other things which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
strange to them; they treated them with all manner of <hi>Courtesie,</hi> and
commended and admired all, except the Slashing and pinking of their
cloathes, not being able to conceive, why, when a piece of stuffe is whole
and new men should cut it in severall places for ornament. But, when
they had seen this City, these men returned, without any other effect, but
the expense and great losse of the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> occasioned by the <hi>Tartars</hi>
in severall encounters, because they were deprived of this succour.</p>
                        <p>The occasion of their returne was, that the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> who traffique in
<hi>Cantone</hi> with the <hi>Portughesses,</hi> and are their Correspondents for their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
from which they draw a vast profit, began to perceive that by this
entrance and the good successe thereof, of which they made no doubt at
all, it would be an easie thing for the <hi>Portughesses</hi> to obtaine licence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Kingdome, and to do their businesse, and sell their Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
themselves, and by this meanes they should come to lose their
gaines: therefore, before the <hi>Portughesses</hi> set out, they used all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to hinder their going, presenting many papers against it, and at
last, the Magistrate answering, that he could do no lesse, having already
parted with the money, and distributed among the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> not only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie,
but very high and advantagious pay, they offered, at their owne
charges, to re-imburse the whole money to the King. But seeing that this
way neither they could obtaine their ends, it is reported, that they sent
to Court that money, which they would have given, and presenting it to
the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> prevailed so, that those very men, who had proposed the
<hi>Portugesses</hi> to the King, as an important succour, did againe present a
memoriall, wherein they expressed, that there was now no need of them;
The King answered, (and I my selfe saw the Royal answer,) It is not long
since that ye did propose to us, that these men should enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and assist us against the <hi>Tartars:</hi> now ye say, they are not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
When ye propose any thing, it were good you considered of it better,
howbeit, if they are not necessary, let them returne.</p>
                        <p>In this manner did that expedition of the <hi>Portughesses</hi> come to an end,
without any profit at all to the Kingdome, but much to the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that they had an opportunitie to see a good part of <hi>China.</hi> The <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
have ever since continued the warre after the same manner, and do
continue it to this day; and have forced the Kingdome of <hi>Corea</hi> to pay
them tribute, as they payed to <hi>China;</hi> although they stil pay to the <hi>Chinesses</hi>
as much as they did formerly.</p>

guilty of high treason, and under so great penalites for any that hid them,
that it was to cost him no lesse than his life, and in effect he caused four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<hi>Litterati</hi> to be burned together with their books which they had hid.</p>
                     <p>This persecusion lasted the space of fourty years, at what time they
began to renew their ancient <hi>Chronicles,</hi> by meanes of certaine books
and fragments that had escaped, some of them being buried under ground,
and others immured in the middle of walls, and after many yeares and a
diligent search, they set on foot againe the more principall matters; yet
there were many things wanting, and especially concerning the first
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of this <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However it is certainly known, that their first <hi>Government</hi> was by way
of <hi>Families;</hi> every one governing his own, as anciently the <hi>Patriarks</hi> did.
The second was <hi>Monarchicall,</hi> but it is not certaine how it began: neither
have they any thing certaine concerning the originall of it. They do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a notable errour in the time of their <hi>Chronologies:</hi> for the <hi>Emperour Yao,</hi>
from whose time they do begin to give credit to their Histories, even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the most favourable computation, from the creation of the
world to <hi>Noah,</hi> they make to be twelve yeares before the floud; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
although there be an errour of the time in the Historie of this <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi>
and those that follow, it is certaine, that the matters related, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
coherent with their successions.</p>
                     <p>Now this <hi>Emperour Yao,</hi> without having any regard to the naturall and
lawful succession of his sonne, left the <hi>Empire</hi> to <hi>Xun</hi> his Sonne-in-law, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because he discovered in him parts and qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lities worthie of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Xun</hi> likewise for the same respect gave the <hi>Empire</hi> to <hi>Yù,</hi> who
was no kin to him. These three <hi>Emperours</hi> are much esteemed by the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>
for holy men: concerning whom they relate many things. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there is no doubt, but that they were <hi>Philosophers,</hi> well inclined to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vertues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:64464:65"/>
They do attribute much merit to the last of these three, for the <hi>Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting</hi>
of the <hi>waters</hi> (as they call it:) which was done by him through the
Kingdom, which in that time did abound in lakes and moarish places, and
therefore in many parts could not be tilled. This King going in person,
and commanding large trenches to be made, (wherein many years were
spent) he gave vent to that multitude of waters, and by that meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
a great deale of ground which was of great profit for tillage.
There are some in <hi>Europe</hi> who believe that these <hi>waters</hi> were the reliques
of the <hi>floud.</hi> The <hi>Chinesses,</hi> although they make a large mention of these
<hi>waters</hi> in their books, of the draining of them, and of the benefit which
accrued thereby to the Kingdom, do not say any thing of any occasion or
originall of them.</p>
                     <p>After these three <hi>Emperours</hi> abovenamed, the <hi>Empire</hi> was ever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
by succession; but not in the same <hi>family;</hi> for there were many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Lords, who although they were subject to the Emperour, yet,
sometimes for particular respects, and otherwhile under pretence of evill
<hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> made <hi>warres, confederacies</hi> and <hi>disorders,</hi> with
which they either disturbed and troubled the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or divided it, or
else usurped it all to themselves; So that although it lasted in some fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
many years, as in that of <hi>Tham</hi> for 400. years, and in some other <hi>fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
little lesse, yet the <hi>Monarchy</hi> from the beginning, to this present day,
hath been changed into two and twenty severall <hi>Families.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lords of particular states continued in <hi>China</hi> 2000 years, till in
the year of our redemption 1206, the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who then possessed another
Country, began to make themselves Masters of <hi>China;</hi> and advanced so
farre by degrees, till at length they brought it all under their subjection,
reigning there as absolute, till the year 1368. At what time, <hi>Hum Vu,</hi> the
founder of the family, which reigneth at presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, seeing the strength of the
<hi>Tartars</hi> to be diminished, and their <hi>Tyranny</hi> encreased, and the people so
wearied therewith that they were well disposed to shake off the yoake,
and set themselves at libertie; gathered together an army with such
good successe, that he not only discomfited the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and drove them
out of the Kingdom, but entred also into their Country, and conquered
a good part thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kingdome</hi> being thus re-establisht in its naturall estate, <hi>Hum Vu</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himselfe become absolute <hi>Lord</hi> thereof, set on foot an admirable kinde
of <hi>Government,</hi> differing in part from that of all other <hi>Monarchies;</hi> yet it is
such a one, as hath now been conserved almost 300 years, with so much
subjection, communication and dependance from its head, that so great
an <hi>Empire,</hi> seemeth to be but, as it were, one well governed convent. This
<hi>King</hi> in the first place conferred many favours and graces upon all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
Liberalitie being that, which doth most demonstrate a royall minde:
he created new officers, yet retained he some of the former ones, as we
shall relate in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>chiefe</hi> and <hi>principall Captaines</hi> he assigned large revenues, to the
<hi>second</hi> a very competent maintenance, and to those of the <hi>third</hi> sort, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
He tooke away all the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> of vassals and subjects,
without leaving one: he prohibited by a rigorous law, that none of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64464:66"/>
                        <hi>Royall family,</hi> neither in peace nor warre, nor in any case, might beare office
in the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> either <hi>civil, criminall,</hi> or <hi>military;</hi> neither might they
be suffered to enter into the <hi>examinations,</hi> to receive their degree (the
which last prohibition, as I have formerly said, hath been lately taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in part.) He placed the whole <hi>Government</hi> in the <hi>Litterati,</hi> who are
created such by way of concurrence, (as hath been declared, when I spake
of the examinations) without any dependance at all on the Magistrates, or
the King himselfe, but only by the merit of their learning, good parts, and
vertues. He did not annull those ancient lawes, which concerned good
<hi>Government,</hi> and hindred not his intent; which was only to perpetuate the
<hi>Monarchy</hi> in his <hi>Posteritie.</hi> But he made many new ones, and modelled
the Common-wealth and the <hi>Government</hi> into that form, wherein it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
at present; although in so many years, and in so vast a <hi>Monarchie,</hi> it
hath not been possible, but that it should receive some alteration, though
not in any essentiall part thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>King</hi> is called by diverse names. For the better understanding
whereof, you must know that there are <hi>thirteen things</hi> remarkable at his
<hi>Coronation.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> is the changing of the account of years, beginning
their supputation a new from the entrance of the new Kings reigne; and
this not only in their ordinary discourse, but in all letters, dispatches, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visoes,
writings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>second,</hi> that there is coyned new mony, with
the letters of his name, although the former continueth current also. The
<hi>third</hi> is, That he Crowneth his true wife, making her as it were, <hi>Empresse.</hi>
The <hi>fourth</hi> is, That he giveth the name of <hi>Queen</hi> to six <hi>Concubines.</hi> The
<hi>fifth</hi> is, That there are great sacrifices made to <hi>Heaven,</hi> to the <hi>Earth,</hi> to the
<hi>Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>sixt,</hi> That there are great store of Almes given to the
poore. The <hi>seaventh,</hi> That all prisoners are set at libertie, whose freedom is
not prejudiciall to a <hi>third</hi> party. The <hi>eighth,</hi> That there are sumptuous ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
made for the Magistrates. The <hi>ninth,</hi> That all the women are to depart
out of the Palace, that have been <hi>Concubines</hi> to the former King. The
<hi>tenth,</hi> The Palaces, which are foure in number, wherein the other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
lived, are furnished againe with new women, pickt &amp; chosen through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole realme: in time of which search there are many marriages
made, every one endeavouring to deliver his daughter from that subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The <hi>eleventh,</hi> The <hi>Nobilitie</hi> of the <hi>bloud royall</hi> do send deputies (not
every one, but all those of one City) to render obedience to the King,
and to acknowledge him for such: In like manner also do the <hi>Tituladoes,</hi>
which cannot do it in their owne persons. The <hi>twelfth</hi> is, That all Officers,
from <hi>Vice-royes</hi> to the meanest Judges of Townes, go in person to <hi>Court,</hi> to
render the same obedience, on the behalfe of their Provinces, Cities, and
Townes. Lastly the Kings name is changed, as is used among us at the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of the <hi>Pope;</hi> and this is that name, which is written in all publick
acts, on moneyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is a name of a particular, but royall person, as
that of this Kings Grandfather was, <hi>Vam Lie;</hi> of his father, <hi>Thai Cham;</hi> of
his Brother who raigned first, <hi>Thien Khi;</hi> and of this King, <hi>Teum Chim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have moreover three names, which signifie a King: The <hi>first</hi> is
<hi>Kiun,</hi> and by this they use to call forreigne Kings: The <hi>second</hi> is <hi>Vam,</hi> and
by this name they call the Infantoes, or Kings children; joyning them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64464:66"/>
                        <hi>Kiun Vam,</hi> they make a name, by which their King may be called.
But the principall name is <hi>Ho Am Ti,</hi> that is, <hi>Emperour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Palace, the Women, Eunuchs, and other domesticks thereof call
him <hi>Chu,</hi> that is, Lord. They call him also <hi>Thien Zu,</hi> which is to say,
<hi>Sonne of Heaven;</hi> not because they believe him to be such, but because
they hold, that <hi>Empire</hi> is a gift of heaven; as also to render the respect,
which is due to the royall person, more sacred: and in realitie, the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
which they use towards him, seemeth more befitting a Divine, than
humane person; and the manner how they behave themselves at this day
in his presence, is more proper for a Church, than a prophane Palace.</p>
                     <p>I said at this day, because in former times it was not so. For then the
Kings of <hi>China</hi> lived according to the fashion of the greatest part of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes of the world: They went abroad, conversed, hunted; and
there was one of them so greedy of this recreation, that, whereby he might
have the opportunity of spending whole months together in hunting
without returning to Court, and attending upon the affaires of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
did substitute one of his Sonnes in his place. The <hi>Emperours</hi> did vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
in person the whole Kingdome, at what time there happened that sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which is so famous in <hi>China,</hi> and which deserveth likewise to be known
in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> going this progresse, in a certaine way met with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of men, who were leading certaine prisoners. He caused the coach
to stop, and enquired what the matter was; which as soone as he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
he fell a weeping. They who accompanied him began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him, and one of them said unto him, Sir, <hi>It is not possible, but that in a
Common-wealth there must be chastisements; it cannot be avoyded; so have
the former Kings, your predecessours, commanded it to be; so have the laws
ordained it; so doth the government of the state require it.</hi> The King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>I weepe not to see these men prisoners, nor to see them chastised: I know
very well, that without rewards the good are not encouraged, and without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement
the wicked are not restrained, and that chastisement is as necessary to
the government of a Kingdome, as bread is for the nourishment and sustenance
thereof. But I weepe, because my time is not so happy, as that of old was, when the
vertues of the Princes were such, that they served as a bridle to the people, and
their example was sufficient to restraine the whole Kingdome without any other
chastisement.</hi> This was a <hi>Heathen,</hi> who spake thus: and who seeth not
how much reason we have to envy these <hi>Heathens,</hi> who, although they
are exceeded by us in the knowledge of things belonging to <hi>faith,</hi> do yet
oftentimes surpasse us in the practise of <hi>morall vertues?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>According as I have said, the ancient Kings did personally attend the
<hi>Government,</hi> giving audience very easily and very frequently to all their
subjects. In the time of King <hi>Tham</hi> there was a <hi>Colao,</hi> who having been
his Master, was very powerfull with him, who, to preserve himselfe in his
grace and favour, studied more to speak what should please the King, than
to tell him the truth for the good of his state: a most abominable thing.
But the <hi>Chinesses</hi> seeing his honour was great, and the Kings favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him very extraordinary, did dissemble it all; notwithstanding they
forbore not to speak of it among themselves, and to taxe the flattery of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64464:67"/>
the <hi>Colao,</hi> One day certaine Captaines of the guard discoursing among
themselves in the Palace concerning this point, one of them, being a little
warmed with the discourse, secretly withdrawing himselfe out of the
company, went into the hall, where the King then was, &amp; kneeled downe
upon his knees before him, the King asking, what he would have? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
<hi>Leave to cut off the head of a flattering subject.</hi> And <hi>who is that,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the King? <hi>Such a one, that stands there,</hi> answered the other. The King
being angry, said, <hi>Against my Master dare you propose this, and in my presene?
Let them take him away and cut off his head.</hi> When they began to lay hands
upon him, he caught hold of a wooden balanster, and as there were many
pulling of him, and he holding with a great deale of strength, the balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
broke. By that time the Kings anger was over; and he commanded
they should let him go, and gave order, that the balanster should be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and that they should not make a new one, that it might remaine a
witnesse of the fact, and the <hi>Memoriall</hi> of a subject, that was not afraid to
advise his King, what he ought to do.</p>
                     <p>Such was the facility, with which, not only the Officers, but any one
whosoever of the people, might have admission to the King, so that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the first gate of the Palace, there was always a Bell, a Drumme, and a
Table overlaid with a white varnish, as it were, playstered over; upon
this, he that would not speak to the King in person, wrote what his request
was, which was presently carried to the King: But whosoever would
speak with him, rang the Bell, or beat the Drumme, and presently they
were brought in, and had audience.</p>
                     <p>The Drumme remaines even to this day; but as it seemeth to me, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in memory of the times past, than for any use of the present: for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
twenty two years time, I do not remember, that it was ever beaten
above once: and he that did it, was presently paid his pension in ready
<hi>Bastinadoes;</hi> for having disquieted the King, who was about halfe a league
off. After this hard penance, he was heard, and allowed, not to see or
speak to the King, but according to the custome now in use, in a petition.
So that the Kings are now become so retired, and removed from the sight
of the people, and as it were, so idolized, and mewed up in their Palaces,
that they give them occasion to think in other Countries, that the King of
<hi>China</hi> never suffereth himselfe to be seen, and that he is always shut up in
a glasse, and only sheweth one foot, and such like things.</p>
                     <p>He who first put himselfe in this manner of living, was <hi>Vam Lie,</hi> the
Grandfather of him that reigneth at present; he had some occasion to do
it, because he was so fat, that it put him to great paine and trouble, to carry
himselfe in publick, with that <hi>Gravitie</hi> and <hi>Majestie,</hi> that is proper to a
King; and therefore he did exempt himselfe wholly from this trouble.
He gave no <hi>Audience;</hi> he went not to the sacrifices; he went not out in
publick: neverthelesse he was a person of great prudence and judgement
in managing the government: He was much esteemed of the <hi>Mandarines,</hi>
though he made little account of them. He used to say many times, when
any one was troublesome by replying often with their memorialls or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
in which kinde the <hi>Chinesses</hi> are very importunate, <hi>I was a King,
and governed before this fellow was borne, and yet he will undertake to teach me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:64464:67"/>
His sonne, who succeeded him, changed also the former fashion, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
they that followed, going out indeed in publick, but so moderately,
that it is only sometimes in the month to hold a <hi>Royal Audience,</hi> and foure
times a yeare they go out of the <hi>Palace,</hi> and out of the City, to Sacrifice
at the foure seasons of the yeare, to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and to the <hi>Earth,</hi> in a <hi>Temple</hi>
built for this purpose without the walls of the City.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Temple</hi> is truly <hi>Royall,</hi> as well in the greatnesse thereof, as in the
exquisitenesse of the workmanship: the figure of it is round, with three
rowes of pillars one above another, for it stands as it were on a Hill or
Mount compassed about with those pillars. The wall of the <hi>Temple</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
at the top of the third row; there are foure paire of staires by
which they ascend to it, placed towards the foure windes, all of white
marble and very well wrought.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Nankim</hi> is a very perfect and compleat piece of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,
it hath five Isles sustained by pillars of wood, which have no
painting or ornament upon them, except on their <hi>Pedestalls,</hi> that it may
bee seen that each is made of one entire piece of wood. Truly they are
the goodliest trees, the biggest, highest, most uniform and equall (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they are very many) that can be imagined. And as for my part, I
confesse it is one of the remarkable things I have seen in <hi>China;</hi> and that
one shall hardly find in all the rest of the world, so many trees of that
beauty aud uniformitie. The <hi>Seeling</hi> is all guilded, and although it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
200 yeares since it was done, and that it be farre remote from the
eye of the King, (the Sacrifices not being made therein, which are wont
to be performed only at the Court, where the King resideth) yet it doth
to this day keep its splendour. In the middle thereof are raised two
Thrones made of the most precious marbles, on one of them the King used
to sit when he came thither to sacrifice: the other was left empty for the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> to whome the Sacrifice was offered. The gates are all adorned
with plates of Copper, enriched with severall works and embossments,
all gilt: without the <hi>Temple</hi> are many Alters, with the statues of the <hi>Sunne,
Moon, Planets, Spirits, Mountaines, Rivers</hi> &amp;c. Round about the <hi>Temple</hi> are
severall cells. They say that anciently they were Baths, where the King
and the Ministers that were to Sacrifice, did wash themselves. The Grove,
which standeth on the rest of the plaine, consisteth of severall trees, but
the greatest part are Pines: not so much as a Twigge of them may be cut
off under most grevious penalties. The wal that encompasseth it is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with glazed Tiles, some of yellow colour, others of green. The circuit
thereof is twelve miles.</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Temple,</hi> as I said, the King cometh, and when he cometh
forth, the wayes are Barracado'ed, leaving only free that part through
which the King is to passe: who bringeth with him so many <hi>Eunuches,</hi>
who encomepasse him, so many Officers that accompanie him, and so
many Souldiers that guard him, that it is altogether impossible for him
to be seen, especially being carried in a Sedan.</p>
                     <p>These are the only occasions, wherein the King either appeareth
or goeth abroad. All the rest of his time he staieth at home in his <hi>Palace,</hi>
like a King of Bees, without either seeing or being seen. Many are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64464:68"/>
that this is not to live like a King, but like a criminall Person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to perpetuall imprisonment. How ever, it seemeth to me a great
matter, that a man, without being seen, by his power only should be the
most reverenced, the most obeyed and feared, of all the Kings in the
world. And as for the prison, if we will call his <hi>Palace</hi> so, it is very large
and pleasant for to give him delight, besides that he hath the libertie to go
out whensoever he pleaseth, &amp; his habitations therein are so commodious,
and full of all manner of entertainment, of pleasure and recreation, that he
hath no need to seek abroad wherewith to content himself.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>Palaces,</hi> laying every thing together that is contained in them, I
think are the best that are to be found in the world. Those of <hi>Nankim,</hi>
which are the biggest, containe about five miles in circuit. Those of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim,</hi>
are somewhat lesse, but much the better. These are not all one <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi>
but many, at a good distance one from the other. That of the <hi>King.</hi>
That of the <hi>Queen.</hi> That of the <hi>Prince.</hi> That of the <hi>Younger Sonnes.</hi> That of
his <hi>Daughters who are married.</hi> That of the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third Queens.</hi> For the
<hi>Concubines</hi> there are foure, at the foure corners, and are from them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the <hi>Palaces</hi> of the <hi>Ladies.</hi> There are also some <hi>Palaces</hi> for the old and
Penitent women, which they call <hi>Lemcum,</hi> that is, the cold <hi>Palaces.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
there are colledges for the <hi>Eunuches,</hi> for the <hi>Litterati, Priests, singing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Comedians</hi> &amp;c. and almost infinite habitations for so many Offices
as there are there within, and for that multitude of people that are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
there, who are at the least 17000 persons.</p>
                     <p>The structure of the <hi>Palaces</hi> is very exact, having many things in it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of ours, as <hi>Arches, Balansters, Columnes</hi> and, such like, of
Marble excellently wrought, with severall little workes and curious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richments,
as also embossements, or figures in <hi>relieve,</hi> so well raised and
standing out, that they seem to hang in the aire. That which is wrought
in wood, is all varnished over with their <hi>Charan,</hi> painted and guilded ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
exquisitely.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Halls</hi> and Roomes, although they are not, as it is here reported,
one of Gold, another of Silver, another of precious stones, neither do
they use any hangings; yet the hand of the Architect, and the pensil of
the painter doth supply all other ornaments. The Base Courts are very
neat and spacious. There are also many pleasant Gardens, and a River
which runneth among the <hi>Palaces,</hi> and yeeldeth them much delight with
his windings and turnings. There are many artificiall mounts with very
rare Beasts and Birds, many Gardens made with exquisite diligence, and
all manner of curiositie. There was a certaine King among them, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discontented at the spoile which the winter made in the beauty of the
trees, depriving them both of leaves and flowers, commanded that
many artificiall ones should be made, with great labour and expence, and
little satisfaction of the Magistrates, who did much blame him.</p>
                     <p>The whole fabrique is encompassed with two walls that have foure
gates opening to the foure windes, <hi>East, West, North,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> and this
last is the chiefest, and maketh a beautifull and sightly <hi>facciata</hi> or aspect
to the <hi>Palaces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At every gate there stand every night five Elephants (which are not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64464:68"/>
bred in that Countrie, but come from other parts) with their Souldiers
belonging to them, and the whole wall round about is guarded with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                     <p>Within the said Gates, there is a Court able to containe 30000 Persons;
and there standeth alwaies a Guard of 30000 men.</p>
                     <p>At the uper end of this Court there are five Gates, which lead into a
very large <hi>Hal</hi> of the <hi>Palace;</hi> in the midst whereof is placed a <hi>Royal Throne,</hi>
which standeth empty, and is called, <hi>The Throne of courtesies,</hi> because all
they, who go out, do make their reverence to it, as you shall hear anone.</p>
                     <p>As for the Women, there is only one of them, which is the Kings true
wife, and hath the name of <hi>Hoam Heu,</hi> which signifieth <hi>Empresse;</hi> and is
acknowledged for such, having her seate behind that of the Kings. There
are also other six Women, who have the title of Queens, and are also
much respected. In the Palaces of <hi>Nankim,</hi> which because they are emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are more easie to be seen, there is a <hi>Royall Throne</hi> raised upon severall
steps, and a cloth of state over it, with two Royall seates, one for the
King, and the other for the Queen. And lower behind that, there stand
six, three on the one side, and three on the other, for the six Queens. The
King hath thirty Women more; who are all much honoured and respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>The other Ladies of the <hi>Palace,</hi> who as they say, are about 3000 in
number, have their Appartments in the foure Palaces above-said, and are
beautifull Damsels, sought out on purpose through the whole Kingdome.
To these the King goeth, when he pleaseth, and to which of them liketh
him best.</p>
                     <p>The present King hath the reputation to be chaste, and they use to say
of him, <hi>Puycu Cum,</hi> that is, <hi>he goeth not to the Palaces.</hi> There have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
other Kings, like to him in this, who are much commended in their
histories; as on the contrary, others who are much blamed; such was one
of them, whose beastial appetite, not being able to determine to what <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi>
or to what part of it he should go, used in this irresolution to suffer
himself to be lead and guided by beasts, that is, he had a little chariot
drawn with Goates, in which he rid to the <hi>Palaces,</hi> and wheresoever they
entred, or stopped, thither he went in.</p>
                     <p>Another, to save himself the labour of going to the <hi>Palaces,</hi> caused
Pictures to be drawn of every Ladie, and according as he fancied each
Picture, he sent for the originall to be brought to him; leaving the
beauty of each of them in the power of the Painter, she being still made
the fayrest, whom he favoured most, or from whom he received the
best Present.</p>
                     <p>But concerning the Kings children; if the Empresse and true wife of the
King, hath a sonne, at what time soever he be borne, he taketh place of the
rest: but if shee have none, the first sonne of any of his women whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
taketh place; although the King desire, that another should have the
precedency. So it happened to <hi>Vamlie,</hi> who although he had none by
his lawful wife, the <hi>Empresse;</hi> yet had two sonnes, one by a waiting maid,
which was the eldest, and another younger sonne by one of the Queenes
his <hi>Concubines;</hi> which sonne he loved very much; and by reason of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64464:69"/>
particular affection he bore him, would by all means leave him the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
saying, That by reason he had no Sonne by his lawfull wife, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
was not due by right to any of the rest, but that it belonged to him,
to elect which of them he pleased: and because the elder was the Sonne
of a servant, he chose rather to leave the Kingdome to the other; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
the Officers of the Court did very stoutly oppose him, saying,
That since he had had commerce with that servant, she was enobled by a
superiour law, and that her sonne, being the eldest, he ought not to lose the
rights and priviledge of his birth. There happened upon this a <hi>Tragedy,</hi>
with severall acts of discontent. For the King persisted to carry on his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and the Officers in resisting him: whereupon many lost their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
the King taking them away; others left theirs of their owne accord,
and having laid downe the ensignes of their dignity, hung them up at the
gate of the <hi>Palace,</hi> and departed to their own houses, despising at once the
honour, profit, dignity and revenue of their places, only for the defence
of reason, and of the laws and customs of the Kingdom. A courage wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be imitated, in divine affaires at least, if not in all secular causes. At
length the King, being no longer able to contrast, was forced, besides his
wont, to hold a <hi>Royall Audience,</hi> and taking his eldest sonne, now as Prince,
placed him next behinde him, and shewing him to the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
unto them the care of the publick peace, and quiet without
doores, assuring them, that within the Palace all was quiet, and that <hi>Thai
Cham,</hi> that was the name of the present Prince, should succeed him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fayle in the Kingdom, as in effect it fell out. So prevalent is reason,
and the constancy of Counsellours even against the most powerful Kings.</p>
                     <p>Among the Domesticks of the <hi>Palace,</hi> the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> make the greatest
number. In the year 1626. there were reckoned to be 12000. of them,
and for the most part their number is very little greater; or lesse. They
are all distributed into their <hi>Palaces, Colledges, Classes, Tribunals,</hi> and <hi>Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations:</hi>
So that within the Royall <hi>Palace,</hi> there are as many <hi>Tribunals,</hi> to
decide causes, as there are without; not to speak of the women, who have
their justice apart; there being among them some, who are appointed to
governe and judge the rest, and to decide their differences; as also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
and punish them: and this, no more than is necessary.</p>
                     <p>The first and principall <hi>Colledge</hi> of the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> is called, <hi>Su Li Kien;</hi> and
consisteth of the great <hi>Secretaria</hi> of purity; of the chancery within the
<hi>Palace,</hi> and of many Assistants, who are always advanced in the same <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
according to their examinations and trialls. These always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Kings person; and when he goeth abroad, have the place next his
body. These may enter without being called; and, the manner of the
Kings governing, being by way of petitions, and rescripts, every thing
passeth through their hands.</p>
                     <p>Next followeth the <hi>Colledge,</hi> which they call, <hi>Thum Cham Su,</hi> which is,
as it were, a <hi>Soveraigne Tribunall</hi> of justice, over all the <hi>Eunuchs.</hi> This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
their persons to be arrested, this condemneth and causeth them to be
punished; and not only the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> but also other persons of great <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
in matters of high concernment are remitted to them; and it is the
most <hi>rigorous Tribunal</hi> of justice of all those in <hi>China.</hi> The <hi>President</hi> is also
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64464:69"/>
                        <hi>Captaine</hi> of the Kings guard, which consisteth of 9000. men, 6000. foot,
and 3000. horse. In time of warre he entreth into the <hi>Councell of warre,</hi>
where he is allowed the highest place.</p>
                     <p>There are also other <hi>Colledges</hi> and <hi>Tribunals;</hi> as those of severall <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries,</hi>
the <hi>Treasurie</hi> of <hi>Iewells,</hi> of rich <hi>Moveables,</hi> of <hi>Habits,</hi> of <hi>Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>There is also a <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Iudiciall Astrologers,</hi> who observe the stars,
and the motion of the Heavens, who together with the chiefe <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician,</hi>
who is always a <hi>Mandarine</hi> abroad, do make the <hi>Almanacke</hi> for the
year following.</p>
                     <p>There is a <hi>Colledge</hi> of particular <hi>Priests,</hi> called <hi>Laon Su,</hi> (for the <hi>Bonzi</hi>
are not admitted, neither may they enter into the Kings Palaces) these
have the charge of the Divine service, the Chappells, Offices, and Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the dead <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are also <hi>Colledges</hi> of <hi>Musitians, Comedians</hi> or
<hi>Players, Painters, Gold-smiths,</hi> every one performing his office requisite to
a well ordered Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>Without the <hi>Palace</hi> many are prefects of the publick works, of the
guards which keep watch every night without the <hi>Palaces,</hi> of the
Kings sepultures, of the Gabells and Impositions, and other such employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by which they grow very rich: and by reason they have no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
(though they are most of them married,) they make great expenses:
they have sumptuous Country-houses without the City, and within, <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
full of all delights, richly furnished, &amp; a stately traine of Servants. Their
sepulchres are the most costly, they have the strongest perswasion of the
<hi>Transmigration of Soules,</hi> and, that they might be well provided when they
take their next new forme, are the most devoutest worshippers of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eunuchs</hi> are exempted from all those Courtesies &amp; complements,
which others are obliged to pay the <hi>Mandarines;</hi> as, lighting off their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or coming out of their chaires when they meet them. In the Court
they are not permitted to have many servants after them, nor to weare ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rich apparell, and but few are allowed to be carried in a sedan, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all of them are suffered to ride on horse-back.</p>
                     <p>When in the <hi>Palace</hi> there is not an <hi>Eunuch</hi> that is the Kings <hi>favourite,</hi>
the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> which live without the <hi>Palace</hi> are wont to make great Court
to the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> lend them their faire and commodious houses, and
endeavour by all observance to gaine their good will. But if it happen,
that the King have an <hi>Eunuch</hi> to his <hi>favourite,</hi> as sometimes it falleth out,
presently they grow insolent, the governments are conferred upon them,
and then they get the upper hand.</p>
                     <p>The last King had an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who arrived to all that grace and favour
with him, that can be imagined: this fellow governed with so great inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> that he apprehended, chastised, and put to death, even
Persons of the greatest <hi>Qualitie.</hi> To touch him, though but in imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was an excesse of <hi>Treason.</hi> And though the <hi>Chinesses</hi> are very free and
bold inspeaking the truth, even to the King himselfe, yet none durst speak
against him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prince,</hi> who is now King, undertooke the businesse; who only told
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64464:70"/>
the King his father, that his subjects Persons of worth and quality were
ill used. This was sufficient to banish the <hi>Eunuch</hi> out of the Palace, who
at length miserably ended his dayes. For as soone as the King was dead,
he poysoned himselfe; and at the same time put a period to his favour and
his life; but not to the peoples hatred, who as soone as he was dead, drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him about the streets, and tore him to pieces: All his goods were
confiscate to the King: they amounted to a great value, for there was scarce
any body who had not formerly presented him, and many had given him
very rich presents. Among other things there were found two chests full
of Pearle only; it was said, he had robbed the Kings Treasury of them.
The sumptuous works, which were either begun or ended through the
whole Kingdom, in honour of him, as Temples to place his statue in
(which they call <hi>Temples of the living,</hi> and use to erect them to eminent
persons, who have deserved well of the King and Kingdome) <hi>Palaces, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphall
Arches,</hi> and such like fabriques, were all cast down to the ground,
leaving no other memory of them, than a comedy, which was presently
made of him, and is yet acted to this day, concerning his disgrace and
driving out of the <hi>Palace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now because some of these <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> are many times dismissed, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
away, others grow old, and many die, from time to time there are
young ones chosen in, to be put in their places: upon this account there
comes almost infinite of these <hi>Eunuchs</hi> to the Court, who are made such
by their parents; either for the profit which they make by it, because they
are always bought of them for a price, or else for the advantage they may
receive by them, when they come to preferment in the Palace, or for those
other conveniences, which are certaine and assured to persons of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p>At every election, there are chosen about 3000 of them; at what time
they principally consider in their choise, their age, good shape and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
their speech and gracefull pronunciation, but above all, that they
wholly want that, which they pretend to have lost, and that they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
<hi>castrated;</hi> and moreover, every fourth year they are visited, least
any thing should grow out againe, which hath not been well taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                     <p>When the election is done, the rest are sent away from the Court, and
those that are chosen, are destributed to those lodgings, occupations and
offices, to which they are to apply themselves. This is done almost, as it
were by destiny, for without observing of them any more than a few days,
some are put to study, and go to the Colledges of the greatest credit,
honour and profit, others are chosen for Priests, others for Singers, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medians,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And others for the kitchin, and such like meane and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
occupations.</p>
                     <p>This is that which passeth in the <hi>Palace</hi> within the gates in what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth
to the Kings person and service. That which passeth without
doores is also very particular, and with so much exactnesse, that it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all <hi>Hyperbole:</hi> and although the kingdome be so vast and large, yet it
is not sufficient to hide one guilty person, that would make his escape.
The very trees seem to be afraid to cover him with their shade. If a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64464:70"/>
of qualitie be to be apprehended, they send the Ministers of justice to
him; who have no more to do, but to throw the cord or chaine at his
feet; the which he himselfe taketh up, and putteth about his neck, as if it
were a chaine of Gold; and the very name of these is sufficient to strike a
terrour in any.</p>
                     <p>In the City of <hi>Sucheu</hi> in the Province of <hi>Nankim,</hi> there lived a <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi>
a grave Person, who had passed through most of the greatest Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Kingdome, with great satisfaction and good liking of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
it was in the time of that powerfull <hi>Euneuch,</hi> of whom we spake even
now, this man had intelligence that these Ministers of justice would
be sent to him, he stayed not their coming, but made a banquet to his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and friends, toward the end thereof going out, as if it had been upon
some other occasion, he cast himselfe out of a Balcone into a fish Pond,
where he drowned himselfe. His Guests seeing him stay so long, went
out to looke him, and found upon a Table a paper having these words
written with his own hand, <hi>Turning towards the Palace, I performe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
due to my King, whom I have alwayes endeavoured to serve with reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
becoming a faithfull subject: and it is not reasonable, that I should suffer
from the hand of an</hi> Eunuch <hi>affronts worthy a base and criminall Person.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There needs no more than two letters sent from the King, and put in
any place, to make it remaine, as it were, inchanted: so that, if they want
any thing in the Palace, as <hi>Chà, Fruit.</hi> &amp;c. it is sufficient to send to the
Countrie, where those things are they desire, to give them notice only, and
to set up those two letters, <hi>Xim Chi,</hi> that is, <hi>the will of the King,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
every thing is made ready, and none dare stir so much as a leafe of
it. The same thing hapneth when there is any extraordinarie businesse
to be done, which carrieth some difficultie with it; for it is sufficient to
set up the two letters above-said, and all opposition is levelled, as it fell
out when the King gave the houses of an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who was a prisoner, to
the Fathers of our company, for a burying place, by clapping the said let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
upon them.</p>
                     <p>In all the Cities of the Kingdome every moneth, on the first day of the
moone the Magistrates assemble themselves at the tribunall of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
before a Throne, where are placed the <hi>Royall Ensignes;</hi> and there
they do reverence to them in the same manner, as they would do to the
King himselfe, if he were present. They doe the like also on his birth day.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of every yeare each Province sendeth an Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
to visit the King; and as often as they write letters to him, they
do not send them by way of the post, but a principall <hi>Mandarine</hi> goeth
to carry them. But their memorialls, or petitions they send by the Post.
Every three yeeres, all the great <hi>Mandarines</hi> of the Kingdome, go to do
homage to the King.</p>
                     <p>None may enter into the <hi>Royall Palaces,</hi> no not into the first gate, if he
be clothed in Mourning, neither do they go to make their reverence in an
ordinarie habit; but in that extraordinarie one appointed for <hi>Courtesies,</hi> and
the Magistrates are to put on a red garment.</p>
                     <p>None, of what condition soever, may passe before the gates of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
on horse-back, nor in a Sedan, nor in any other manner, except on
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64464:71"/>
foot, no not if they be women; and by how much the <hi>Qualitie</hi> of the
Person is the greater, so much the further off is he to light, and go a-foot.</p>
                     <p>All the Officers and Persons of <hi>Qualitie,</hi> who come to the Court, are
presently obliged either in the morning early, if they come, or late at
night, if they go out, to go to <hi>Kun Chao,</hi> that is, the Court of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as is
above-said, and before the <hi>Royall Throne,</hi> which is placed in a Hall, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the King be not there, who at that houre is for the most part in
bed, and when all that came in that morning, are assembled, (there being
no morning that there is not a good number of them) the Master of the
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> commeth, and with a loud voice declareth the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
which every one ought to performe, and they all in the same manner put
them in execution: and if by misfortune any one committeth an errour or
doth any gesture not reverently enough, it belongeth to the Master of the
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> to give the King notice thereof by a memoriall, as in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
doth the Person that is culpable, accusing himselfe, and requiring
some penance for it: but this is done purely out of <hi>Ceremony,</hi> the king ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
taking any heed to it.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Embassadours</hi> are obliged likewise to the same <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> when
they enter into the Court, or go out thereof: they use to be lodged in one
of the <hi>Palaces,</hi> which are within a spacious circuit of wal, neere to the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Palace,</hi> and are alwayes kept in a readinesse for that purpose, where
they are royally treated, and at great expence; but they may not go out of
that circuit, and if they would have any thing out of the City, it is
brought to them into that place: they neither see nor speak to the King;
but only the <hi>Councell of Rites</hi> by the Kings order treateth with them, and
dispatched them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Portughesses,</hi> those two severall times they were sent thither from
the City of <hi>Macao,</hi> were not only treated with extraordinary magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and liberalitie; but had also that particular priviledge to lodge out
of that place: and the first of them that were sent, saw King <hi>Thienkhie,</hi>
the brother of him who now reigneth, he was very young, and out of
curiositie to see men of a strange Nation, he caused them to come to the
<hi>Palace,</hi> and although it was at a good distance, yet he saw them, and was
plainly seen by them.</p>
                     <p>Every one in the Kings presence speaketh to him on his knees, if he be
in the <hi>Royall Hall</hi> with the Magistrates, he goeth away before they rise
up, if he be sick and they come to visit him, they speak to him in the same
manner, and before they rise off their knees a Curtaine is drawn before
him, or else he turneth himselfe on the other side. When they speak to
him, they hold in their hands before their mouth a Tablet of Ivory a
palm and a half long, and three or foure inches broad: it is an ancient <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi>
for in old time, when they spake in a more familiar manner to the
King, out of reverence they held something between, to keep their breath
from coming to the Kings face, and also when they discoursed with
him of many businesses, they carried the heads of them written thereon,
that they might not forget them. But now that they speake to the King
at such a distance, and not so long, this <hi>Ceremonie</hi> might be excused,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64464:71"/>

                     <p>The Kings <hi>Garments</hi> differ not in fashion from those of the rest, but in
the stuffe, which is very rich, and in certaine Dragons which are woven
and embroydered in them, and no other Persons may weare them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the King, and those that are of kin to him; as the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Bloud,</hi>
and particularly the women, and the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> of the Kings family, but with
some distinction. The colour is yellow, not but that other colours may
be worne in the Palace, for they weare light colours of all sorts, but yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
is so proper to the King, and to all that he wears, that none else may
use it.</p>

                     <head type="sub">How the Kings of China are Married.</head>
                     <p>AT that time, when there were several Kings and Lords in <hi>China,</hi> they
tooke one anothers daughters for <hi>Wives,</hi> as they do in <hi>Europe.</hi> But
they being at an end, and the <hi>Monarchy</hi> reduced under one only Lord, and
he being never to take a wife out of the Kingdom, it is necessary, that he
marry a daughter of one of his subjects. Persons of <hi>Quality</hi> will not give
him their daughters; for he being to see them, whether he likes them or
no, and they being to be turned off, if they please him not, no person of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Quality</hi> will shew his daughter, because she may be refused, after she
is seen; especially by reason that the sight and triall of them is to passe
further then to what is seen in the outward frontispiece. They do not,
nor may not marry with their kindred, though in never so remote a degree:
and therefore there is sought through the whole Kingdom a Damsell of
twelve or fourteen years of age, of a perfect beauty, of good naturall parts,
and well inclined to those vertues, which are required in a <hi>Queen,</hi> in the
same manner, as in ancient times the <hi>Shunamite</hi> was sought out for <hi>David,</hi>
and <hi>Esther</hi> for <hi>Ahassuerus:</hi> and this is done without exception of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
whence for the most part the <hi>Queen</hi> is the daughter of some <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they have found out such a one, as they looked for, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
her to two ancient Matrons, who see that which all may not see; and
if they finde no displeasing marke, or deformity about her body, they
make her runne to put her in a sweat, that they may examine, whether
there be any unpleasing smell from it: when these Matrons are satisfied
with the diligence they have used, she is brought to Court, with a great
traine of women and men servants, and with an equipage becoming a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who from hence forward doth appertaine to the King: to whom she
is presented in his Palace, who after he hath ended his complements, he
giveth her to the Prince for a wife: and this is afterwards the true <hi>Queen:</hi>
Within the Palace, they appoynt to waite on her vertuous women, of
prudence, and understanding, that they may instruct her, as well in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as in complements, and the stile of the Palace, endeavouring to breed
her in such manner, that she may deserve the name of a <hi>Queen,</hi> whom they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64464:72"/>
commonly call <hi>Que Mu,</hi> that is, Mother of the Kingdom: And as their
Histories relate, there have been many of these of great worth and merit.
They are very commonly devoute and charitable; and many of them have
been prudent and vertuous.</p>
                     <p>Such was one of them, who being the daughter of a Mason, after she
came to be <hi>Queen,</hi> she kept always by her an Iron Trewell; and when the
Prince her Sonne, upon any occasion, behaved himselfe more haughtily
than became him, she sent to shew him that Instrument, with which his
Grandfather used to lay stones for his living; by which means, she redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to his <hi>Devoir.</hi> In old times when Kings took it in good part to
be reproved for their errours, King <hi>Yù</hi> had a <hi>Colao,</hi> who at the Royall
Audience would tel him his faults without any indulgence: One day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King had given more cause, or that the excesse was on the <hi>Colaos</hi>
part, the Audience being ended, the King returned into the Palace very
much offended, saying, He would cut off the head of that impertinent fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
The <hi>Queen</hi> asked him the cause of his displeasure: the King answered,
There is an unmannerly Clown, that never ceaseth to tel me of my faults,
and that publickly, I am resolved to send one to take off his head. The
<hi>Queen</hi> tooke no notice of it, but retired to her Appartment, and put on a
particular garment proper only for feastivalls, and visits, and in this habit
she came to the King, who wondring at it, asked her the cause of this <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty.</hi>
The <hi>Queen</hi> answered, Sir, I come to wish your Majesty much joy:
Of what, replied the King. That you have a subject, said she, that feareth
not to tell you your faults, to your face, seeing that a subjects confidence,
in speaking fo boldly, must needs be founded upon the opinion he hath of
the vertue and greatnesse of his Princes minde. that can endure to hear
him. There have been many other like to this <hi>Queen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The kindred of the Maiden are presently exalted to honours and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments:
The family is already accounted, rich and honourable; and
by how much more the <hi>Queen</hi> gaineth favour within, they without are
so much the more advanced.</p>
                     <p>The rest of the Kings Sonnes are ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ried after the same manner: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they do not use so much diligence, and caution in finding out the bride,
but for the most part she is sought for, and found in the Court it selfe. But
the manner of marrying the daughters is very different. There are twelve
young men sought out of the age of 17 or 18 years, the lustiest and the
handsomest they can finde; these are brought into the Palace to a place,
where the Princesse may see them, and not be seen; and when she hath
well considered them, she selecteth two of them: These are presented to
the King, who chuseth which of them he liketh best, to be his Sonne-in-low.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vamlie,</hi> the Grandfather of the present King, upon the like occasion,
seeing one of the two young men presented to him, very well cloathed,
and the other, though neat, yet poorly habited, asked him, what was the
reason, he was not so well cloathed as the other. The youth answered,
Sir, my father is poore, and cannot afford it me. Then replied the King, I
will have you that are the poorest for my Sonne-in-law: and being thus
chosen, he did afterward carry himselfe worthy of commendations. And
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64464:72"/>
truly a youth ought not to be ashamed of his povertie, nor a King for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
chosen a poore man. The rest are sent home againe, but are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Noble</hi> ever after, for having had the honour to be admitted to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                     <p>Presently two <hi>Mandarines</hi> of the most considerable in the Court, are
appoynted for Tutours unto these <hi>Fum Ma,</hi> so they call the Kings Sonne-in-laws;
to instruct them in learning, manners, and Courtly behaviour
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is obliged every day to make the foure ordinary reverences upon
his knees to his wife, till she hath brought him a child, assoone as she is
delivered, this obligation ceaseth, although there are still a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
constraints, and inconveniences upon them, which is the reason, that
no man of <hi>Qualitie</hi> will be the Kings Sonne-in-law. For this reason the
usuall custome of chusing twelve is now left off, and if the King do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
invite any person of <hi>Qualitie,</hi> or <hi>Litterato</hi> of reputation, to be his
Sonne-in-law, (as it hath sometimes fallen out) he excuseth himselfe with
all the skill and friends he hath, for if the <hi>Princesse</hi> take a dislike against
her husband (as it often happeneth) she gives him affliction enough for
all his life.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Nobilitie of China.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Nobilitie</hi> of <hi>China</hi> at this day is much changed from what it was
anciently, when, by reason there were many Kings and Soveraigne
Lords, they matched into one anothers families, and the Kings themselves,
made many noble men, whom they used to employ, as also their neerest
kinsmen, in charges and governments of the greatest importance, and by
this means their families continued on foot for many years. At this day
the most of the <hi>Nobilitie</hi> have been raised by their learning, to the highest
honours, from a low condition, many of them having been the Sonnes of
<hi>Artizans</hi> and <hi>Handicrafts-men,</hi> as also, for want of learning, their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
decline and grow againe into povertie, so that it is rare thing to see a
family last to the fift generation: for as the first beginners, being forced
by necessitie, and stirred up by a desire to advance themselves, study and
take paines to obtaine their degrees, and consequently Governments and
other Preheminences; So the rest, who follow, and are borne rich, and
bred up in delights, and wantonnesse, suffer themselves to be carried away
with the pleasures of living high, and the vices which accompany it, study
little, and spend much, so that in a short time, they finde themselves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the first condition of their Ancestours. Notwithstanding, there
is some shadow and resemblance left of the ancient <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> and it may
be reduced to five orders, not mentioning those common people, who are
of no account.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>first Nobilitie</hi> is of the <hi>King, Prince,</hi> the <hi>Kings Children,</hi> and the
<hi>Royall family,</hi> which is preserved in this manner. The <hi>Prince</hi> succeedeth
his father in manner above-said.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:64464:73"/>
To his <hi>Younger Sonnes</hi> the King assigneth a habitation, out of the Court,
in such a Province or City as shall seem best to him, with <hi>Palaces,</hi> Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Servants suitable to his high qualitie; and lands and revenues,
which he purchaseth for him in the same place; as also a competent pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of the Kings exchequer.</p>
                     <p>He that dwelt in the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi> where I lived, for sometime,
had, as I was informed, 360000 Crownes <hi>per annum,</hi> and the title of a King
conferied on him; and all the Officers of the Province were obliged to pay
him respect suitable to his Title: whence every first and fifteenth day of
the Moone they went to do him reverence in like manner, as is done at
Court to the King; there being nothing wanting to him to make him an
absolute King, but only Authority and Jurisdiction; of which he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all, neither over the people, nor in the government; the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
all that to himselfe; neither hath he libertie to go out of the City
and Territorie, where he hath his residence.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eldest Sonne</hi> succeedeth his Father in his estate and goods; the rest
marry and make severall Families, which stil grow lesser, although they
be great; and the King giveth them an allowance competent for them;
and as they are removed still to a further degree from the Kings bloud,
so likewise their pension diminisheth, till it cometh to fourescore Crowns
a yeare, and there it stoppeth; there being none so remote from the <hi>Royall
Stemme,</hi> that hath not, at the least, this Revenue. Yet neverthelesse, all
this is to be understood only, if those that are descended from him, have
certaine conditions, that are required of them; for if these be wanting,
they have nothing given them at all.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>First condition</hi> is, that they be Males; for if they be <hi>Females,</hi> there
is no account made of them, and the Father marrieth them to whom, and
when he will; but not to Princes of the bloud; (neither may the Sonnes
marry, but with Women of other Families) and he is to marry them at his
own expences.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second condition</hi> is, that the Sonne be <hi>lawfully begotten</hi> on the true
wife; not only bastards being excluded, but also the Sonnes of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines,
if they have any.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is, that assoon as his Sonne is borne, he do give a memorial
to the King, to give him a name, which is to be registred in the roll.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, that having attained the age of 14 yeares, he give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
memoriall to the King, praying him to give order, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
halfe his pension, which he after receiveth every year at set times.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fifth,</hi> that when he cometh to age to be married, there be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
memoriall given to the King, wherein is required leave for him to
marry, and then he receiveth the whole pension which is assigned him.</p>
                     <p>These are the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Bloud,</hi> descended from the King by a right
<hi>male line.</hi> These are not to live in the two Courts of <hi>Pekim</hi> and <hi>Nankim,</hi>
nor in all the Provinces indifferently, but only in some certaine places;
and are so numerous, that they are beleeved to amount to 60000, and
are all maintained by the King. But they have this advantage, that
they may help themselves by their industrie, in buying and selling, and
playing the Merchants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:64464:73"/>
For the government of them; and to present their memorialls to the
King; to decide their controvesies; and to punish them, if there be cause,
they have a particular <hi>Mandarine,</hi> that is proper to them. But if they have
any suits with others, who are not of the bloud Royall, such causes are
under the cognizance of the ordinary justice, who may reprove them, but
hath not the power to punish them; but if any of them commit any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
disorder, he giveth notice thereof to the King, who for such occasions
hath a Castle in the Province of <hi>Kiamsi,</hi> encompassed with a very high
wall, whither he confineth them during life.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second Order</hi> of <hi>Nobilitie</hi> is of the <hi>Titulati,</hi> or Noblemen that have
Titles conferred upon them: who notwithstanding are but the shadow of
what they were in former times. These are divided into foure orders.
The <hi>First</hi> they call <hi>Quecum,</hi> a new Title, and are only foure Families,
who were raised by the King <hi>Humvu,</hi> and are descended from foure vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Captaines, who served the said King against the <hi>Tartars.</hi> They are,
as it were, Dukes and Captaines-Generall of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and do assist in
that <hi>Qualitie,</hi> at certaine military actions of great importance, when they
are done in the Cities where they inhabit; but they never go to the war.
The <hi>Second</hi> are <hi>Heus.</hi> The <hi>Third Pe.</hi> The <hi>Fourth Chi Ho Ei,</hi> all ancient
Titles. They have Offices in the <hi>Militia,</hi> and a competent revenue, and
all of them succeed their Fathers in their power, authority, and command.
They give place to many Officers of the <hi>Litterati:</hi> but, at an assembly in
the Royall Hall, they precede all of them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third Order</hi> containeth all them, who either have or doe admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
in the Government of the Kingdome, whether they be officers of
of warre, as <hi>Generalls</hi> or <hi>Captaines,</hi> or of the <hi>Politick</hi> and <hi>Civill Government;</hi>
whether they be supream, such as are the <hi>Colai,</hi> or inferiour Ministers, as
well the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of other Cities, as those of the Court, even to those
of the smallest Burghs and Villages: neither are they excluded from this
order, who neither Govern, nor have governed, but are in Election to be
received into the Government; such are all <hi>Graduates,</hi> as <hi>Doctours, Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates</hi>
and <hi>Batchelours.</hi> In a word, this order consisteth of <hi>Litterati.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> is of <hi>Students,</hi> who, although they have never taken any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
yet only for being <hi>Students,</hi> and that they are in a way to obtain
them, are put into the rank of the <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> and treated as such, although
they have no priviledge or authoritie.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> is of those Persons, whom they call <hi>Netti,</hi> or cleanly men,
who live either of their Rents or Merchandize: and when their wealth is
much, their honour is not little: and although without learning their
power and credit is not so great as among us; yet they are much respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the people.</p>

                     <p>THe principall Government of <hi>China,</hi> which embraceth the state of
the whole <hi>Monarchie</hi> is divided into <hi>six Councels,</hi> called by them <hi>Pú.</hi>
These do not only governe in the two Courts where they do reside,
but from these, as from the first movers, the rest of the government de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth:
and to these persons, causes, and matters, according as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
unto each, all is subordinate, with an incredible dependance and
obedience.</p>
                     <p>Every one of these <hi>Councels</hi> hath its <hi>President,</hi> whom they call <hi>Cham
Xu,</hi> with two Assistants, one of the left hand, who is the first, called <hi>Co Xi
Lam;</hi> the other of the Right, named <hi>Geu Xi Lam.</hi> These are the chiefest
and most profitable offices of the whole Kingdom, except the <hi>Colai,</hi> of
whom we will speak hereaster: so that when a <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of any Province,
even of the most principall, after he hath given good Testimonie of his
abilitie, is to be preferred, he holdeth himself well provided for, not
only if he be made <hi>President</hi> of one of these <hi>Councels,</hi> but also if he come
to be one of the <hi>Assessours</hi> or <hi>Assistants,</hi> either of the left hand, or the
right.</p>
                     <p>Besides these, who are the chiefest of the <hi>Councell,</hi> there are ten others
of the same <hi>Tribunall,</hi> almost all equall in dignitie, who are distributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
severall offices and employments. To these are added other great
and lesser officers, as <hi>Notaries, Scribes, Secretaries, Ministers, Captaines</hi> of
<hi>Iustice,</hi> and many others, who are not usuall among us in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>First</hi> and <hi>chiefest Councell,</hi> which is of the greatest authoritie and
profit, is the <hi>Councell of State,</hi> called <hi>Si Pu.</hi> To them it belongeth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Mandates of the whole Kingdome, concerning Officers, to
change and promote them: for after any one hath been once provided of
an Office, he alwaies riseth by degrees to greater employments: nor are
they ever excluded from the Governmen, tunlesse it be for some notable
fault committed either by themselves, or by such as appertaine to them,
as their Sons, neere kindred, and the like. To this <hi>Tribunall</hi> also belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the power to restore againe any that is turned out of his office: as, if
a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> by some accident, lose his office, they can easily put him
in again: and upon this account they have very many, and very great
bribes given them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is the <hi>Councell of Warre,</hi> called <hi>Pim Pú.</hi> This also, as well

hath not so great command, nor bringeth so much profit, is notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
more considerable, because the <hi>Mandarines</hi> thereof are of the <hi>Royall

                     <p>The <hi>second</hi> is called <hi>Quan Lo Su,</hi> and is as it were, <hi>High Steward</hi> of the
Kings houshold, to whose charge it belongeth to provide the diet, for the
<hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Queen,</hi> the <hi>Ladies,</hi> the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> and to have the laying out of the
whole expence of the <hi>Palace;</hi> to pay the <hi>Salaries</hi> to the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi>
and to all those that come thither upon publick businesse; to Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
which come from other Countries, and other such like Persons. It
hath a <hi>President, two Assessors,</hi> and <hi>seaven Counsellours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> is <hi>Thai Po Cu Sù,</hi> and is, as it were, <hi>Chiefe Master of the horse</hi> to
the King, and they have not only the charge of all Horses for the Kings
service, but of all that belong to the Posts, and generally of all others,
which belong to the publick service of the Kingdom. It hath a <hi>President,</hi>
and <hi>seaven Counsellours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is, as it were, <hi>Master of the Ceremonies and complements of the
Court.</hi> It belongeth to them to assist at all the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the publick
Actions of the King, at feastivalls, and other times and occasions which
present themselves, and also at the daily <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which are performed
in the <hi>Palace,</hi> by those that come in, or out, as is abovesaid. It hath a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,
two Assessors,</hi> and <hi>seaven Counsellours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>fift</hi> is of <hi>Rites</hi> in more particular matters, and in that it is different
from the first, but it hath the same forme with its <hi>Assessors.</hi> It taketh care
of the sacrifices, of the Royall sepulchres, of Mountaines, Groves, and all
that belong to them, as Singers, Instruments, living creatures for sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, <hi>China</hi> hath another <hi>Tribunall,</hi> which hath only charge of the
<hi>Memorialls,</hi> which are presented to the King, and is, as it were, a <hi>Chancery</hi>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:64464:75"/>
of Requests; so that such petitions, as are not approved of by them, are
never given the King. This <hi>Tribunall</hi> was the occasion, in the time of the
persecution of the Christians 1616, that when we would have given an
account of the law, which we preached, and of the things which were
imputed to us, our <hi>Memoriall</hi> could never passe, it being still rejected by
them.</p>
                     <p>There are other three in the same form, with severall charges &amp; offices,
Beside the abovesaid <hi>Tribunalls,</hi> there are two more, one called <hi>Quoli,</hi> the
other <hi>Tauli:</hi> these, although they have their eye upon severall Provinces,
each upon those matters which appertaine to them; neverthelesse their
proper occupation and principall office is, to take notice of the errours and
disorders of the Kingdom, and to advertise the King of his own fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
if he hath any, as also of the faults of the <hi>Mandarines</hi> and their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
and as it was never hard for any to tell the faults of others, yet
these have a particular Talent in it, and doe it with great liberty, though
many times with little Justice.</p>
                     <p>Their manner is to frame a <hi>Memoriall,</hi> and present it to the King (for
those of these two <hi>Tribunalls</hi> do not passe through the Chancery of <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls</hi>)
and then presently, (as they call it, <hi>Fà 'C Heo</hi> that is,) to transscribe
it, and so to send a copy of it to the Notaries, whereof there are many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined
for this worke. These write many copies of it, which are sent by
the next posts, from the Court to be dispersed through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
and by this means it is presently known every where, by whom,
and against whom, this <hi>Memoriall</hi> is presented, &amp; the misdeeds contained
therein, of what qualitie soever they be. Assoone as this <hi>Memorial,</hi> which
they call <hi>Puen,</hi> is published, presently the Magistrate, or other person, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom it is framed, is obliged to do <hi>two things,</hi> whether it be with,
or against his will, (which is more ordinary.) The <hi>first</hi> is, that he give in
a <hi>Memorial,</hi> not in his own defence, (for to excuse himself were to shew
little humility,) but he must say therein, that the <hi>Tauli</hi> hath great reason;
that he hath committed a great errour, and is in fault, and doth deserve to
have a penance laid upon him, and that with all subjection, he will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to any punishment, that shall be imposed. The <hi>second</hi> is, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
retire himselfe, and leave the <hi>Tribunal,</hi> and so all Acts of Justice are
suspended, so that he neither giveth audience, nor endeth any suite, untill
the King have answered his petition, and declared his pleasure thereon;
the which is sometimes in his favour, and then he continueth his office;
and sometimes against him, more or lesse, according to the quality of his
fault. There is no doubt, if this way were executed with reason and good
conscience, but that it would be much in favour of Justice, and the good
Government of the Common-wealth; as on the contrary side, it is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
gate to many causelesse troubles and disgraces. It falleth out many
times, that a <hi>Mandarine</hi> in performing his office, and acquitting himselfe
of the duty of his place, doth make himselfe many enemies. Some one of
these, if he be a person that hath interest with any that is an Officer of
those <hi>two Tribunals,</hi> as kinsman, friend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he giveth account of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to
the Court, the <hi>Memoriall</hi> flyeth abroad, and God help the poore <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</hi>
When they are lesser <hi>Mandarines,</hi> as <hi>Iudges, Assistants to Governours,</hi>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:64464:75"/>
or <hi>Mandarines in Armes;</hi> at one blow, they lay him flat on the ground. If
they be great <hi>Mandarines,</hi> there is more difficulty: but if they know, how
to finde a hole in their coates, and the <hi>Tauli</hi> and <hi>Quoli</hi> get him in their
clawes, they never give them over, till they have un-horsed them, so that
the King himselfe is hardly able to save them.</p>
                     <p>The like accident happened to that Tyrant <hi>Xin,</hi> who in the year 1626
(being <hi>Xi cam</hi> in <hi>Nankim</hi>) raised a persecution against the Christians, and
caused the fathers to be benished, as shall be related in its proper place.
He arrived afterwards to the dignity of a <hi>Colao;</hi> and caused foure ensignes
to be hanged out at the 4 corners of his <hi>Palace,</hi> (I was then present in the
same City that is in <hi>Hamcheu</hi>) and made other demonstrations of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
joy. But whether it were, that the Lord would chastise him for
the persecutions he raised against his elect, or whether he deserved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for any other particular crimes according to humane laws, or for
both together, assoone as his orders were come, and before he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to go to Court, there was so ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ible a <hi>Memoriall</hi> put in against him,
that a <hi>Christian Mandarine</hi> told me, it would not be possible for him to
hold up his head: and so he was presently glad to take in his <hi>Standard,</hi>
and depart with ordinary <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> He was notwithstanding a politike
crafty man, and had purchased with his mony in the <hi>Palace,</hi> the good will
both of the <hi>Ladies</hi> and the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> who are not wont to sell their favours
at a low rate. These did not only cause a <hi>Memoriall</hi> to be dispatched in
his favour, but used means for him to be sent for to Court. At length he
went, but after a few months there was another <hi>Memoriall</hi> given in against
him, and after that severall others, to the number of twenty seven; and
the crimes laid to his charge were such, that the King could not help him,
so that he was forced to quit his Government, and retire to his house.</p>
                     <p>Beside these <hi>two Tribunals,</hi> there is another which is superiour to all the
rest, and is the supreame dignity of the Kingdom; to which none do ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive,
but those of the <hi>Royall Colledge,</hi> called <hi>Han Lin,</hi> after they have Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
a long time, and given such testimony of their <hi>abilitie</hi> and <hi>integritie,</hi>
that never any <hi>Memoriall</hi> was given in against them. They are called by
the name of <hi>Colao,</hi> they are commonly but <hi>foure,</hi> and may never exceed
the number of <hi>six.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The old King (Grandfather to him that reigneth at present) never made
but one of them at a time; saying, That more were superfluous. These
have no particular office, but have an eye over the Government of the
whole Kingdome. We may not unfitly call them the <hi>supreame Presidents</hi>
of all the <hi>Counsells,</hi> and of the whole Government, although they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
present at them, but assist the King at all dispatches of affaires; and now
that the King doth not use to be present there himselfe, they alwayes assist
in the Palace, to receive and answer all businesse, and the <hi>Memorialls,</hi>
which are every day given in. These report them to the King, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
the last sentence upon them. These <hi>Colai</hi> are very much respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and at set times they do them reverence as to their
superiours, in a publick Hall. The <hi>Colai</hi> stand up, and all the Officers of
the Court passe before them in their order; and when they come right
over against them, they turne towards them, and make them a profound
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64464:76"/>
Reverence to the very ground. They call this <hi>Ceremony Quo Tham,</hi> that is,
To passe the Hall. Their ensignes, or badges of honour, are different from
those of the rest, and their girdle, which they call <hi>Yù Xe,</hi> is richly set with
precious stones. They only are allowed to weare it, and it is given them
by the King, as in <hi>Europe</hi> Kings doe use to give <hi>Collars</hi> of their orders to
their knights. And when they are sick, it is only to these, that the King
sendeth to visit them with <hi>Regaloes</hi> and dainties from the <hi>Palace,</hi> and they
do sufficiently gratifie the <hi>Eunuch</hi> that brings them, for the least they
give him is fifty crownes, which is more in that Country, than 200
here.</p>
                     <p>Beside these supreame and generall Governours at the Court, who do
not only govern that, but the whole Kingdom also, there are likewise par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and ordinary Governours and Judges of every City, and these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the same manner of Government as well in the Cities and Townes
of the other Provinces, as also in those of <hi>Pekim</hi> and <hi>Nankim,</hi> where the
two Courts are, as shall be related hereafter.</p>

Provinces.</head>
                     <p>WE have formerly spoken of the universall Government of the
whole Kingdome, which resideth in the two <hi>Courts,</hi> it followth
now, that we should speak of the particular Government of the <hi>Provinces,</hi>
every one whereof is a large Kingdom. This Government resideth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> or chiefe City of each <hi>Province.</hi> In each of these
there are <hi>five Tribunalls,</hi> that have a generall command over the whole
<hi>Province,</hi> and distinct offices among themselves. Of these five, two are
supreame, to which all others, both of the Cities and Townes, are subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate:
But they among themselves are not subjected one to the other,
but are immediatly subbordinate to the King and the <hi>Royall Tribunalls.</hi>
These consist of one <hi>President,</hi> or Iudge, without any Assistant or Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
although they have many other Officers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these two is the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of the <hi>Province,</hi> whom they call
<hi>Tut Ham,</hi> or <hi>Kiun Muen.</hi> He hath power over all the Magistrates, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the <hi>Province.</hi> He Governeth for three years, and hath constant
Posts, that come &amp; go from the Court at set times, being to give account
of whatsoever passeth in the <hi>Province.</hi> He is received into the City in
great pompe and state. When he is ready to depart the Court, many of the
Officers of his <hi>Tribunal</hi> go thither, to receive him, others meet him a
good part of the way, where from City to City he is honourably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
both by horse and foot: And three miles before he cometh to the
City, where he is to reside, there go out certaine Captaines with 3000
Souldiers to receive him, after these follow the Magistrates, and after
them an innumerable company of people.</p>

                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:64464:76"/>
The <hi>Second Office,</hi> which is also absolute, is called <hi>Cha Iven,</hi> we have
no Office in <hi>Europe,</hi> that is answerable to it: he is, as it were, <hi>Visitour</hi> of
the <hi>Province.</hi> It lasteth only a yeare, it is of great rigour and much feared.
He hath authority to take <hi>Cognizans</hi> of all causes both <hi>Criminall</hi> and civill;
of the <hi>Militia;</hi> of the <hi>Kings Patrimonie;</hi> in a word, of all. He visiteth,
enquireth, and informeth himself of all, even to the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> himself: the
inferiour <hi>Mandarines</hi> and Judges he may punish, or turne them out of their
places. Concerning the greater <hi>Mandarines,</hi> if there be cause, he is to give
in <hi>Memorialls,</hi> and they are from thence forward suspended from the
function of their Offices, till the Kings answer come from Court.</p>
                     <p>To him it belongeth to cause the sentences of Death, given through
the whole <hi>Province,</hi> to be put in execution, in order to which he assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the day and the City, whither all those that are condemned, shall be
brought to him: and there he is presented with a List of their names; then
taking his pensill, he marketh six or seaven of them, (for if he prick more
they count him cruell) these are presently carried to execution, and the
rest returned to the prisons whence they came. It belongeth also to him
to visit the Wals, Castles, and publick places &amp;c. He setteth forth with a
great traine and pomp, having banners carried before him and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
of Rigour and Majestie. This is usually every year.</p>
                     <p>There is another extraordinarie Officer of the same name. He is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from time to time at the Queens request: he hath great power and
authoritie, but it is only in favour of Piety and Mercy: he visiteth all
the Prisons of the Province, and freeth all such as are imprisoned for
light faults, and that have no prosecutours, and all those miserable wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that have no meanes to free themselves: he taketh into protection
such causes as have been rejected, and parties that could obtaine no favour:
he revoketh such sentences, as have been unjustly given: he maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
Protectour of the poore, and in a word, his whole authoritie is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about works of mercy.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third Office</hi> is the <hi>Treasurer,</hi> who is superintendent of the Kings
Patrimonie through the whole <hi>Province.</hi> He is subordinate to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of the Patrimonie at Court. He hath <hi>two Assistants,</hi> one of the right
hand, and the other of the left: each of these have their house and <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
within the circuit of the <hi>Treasurers Place.</hi> He hath under him 26 lesser
<hi>Mandarines,</hi> that have severall charges and employments, besides other
Officers great and small, of which sort there are very many belonging to
this <hi>Tribunall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To him it belongeth to overlooke the customes, excise, and other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
appertaining to the King, of what kind soever: to regulate all weights
and measures, all suites, controversies, punishments and sentences apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the Kings Patrimonie, or at least to remit them to what <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
he pleaseth: to pay the ordinarie salaries, to all Magistrates, to the
Kings kindred, to the Captaines and Souldiers: to provide all expences
for the examinations: to furnish and give the badges of honour to all
Graduates: to lay out money for the publick workes, as Bridges, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
<hi>Palaces</hi> of the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> Ships for the Navy &amp;c. In a
word, he is superintendent of whatsoever is spent or received of the Kings
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64464:77"/>
Revenue immediatly from the Governours, Iudges and <hi>Tauli,</hi> each for
his own precinct; and though the summe be never so small, they must
alwayes be paid in fine Silver, which is afterwards melted by the <hi>Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi>
into <hi>Ingots,</hi> weighing fifty Crownes a piece, with the Kings stamp and
the Founders name upon them, that in case any of them be falsified, they
might know whom to accuse; and in this forme they are returned into the
Kings Exchequer.</p>
                     <p>The Revenue of the <hi>Province</hi> is divided into three parts: one whereof
is put into the Treasure of the City, for extraordinary expenses; the other
into the Coffers of the <hi>Treasurer,</hi> for to defray ordinarie expences. This
<hi>Treasurie,</hi> beside that the doores and locks are made as secure as can be, yet
it is guarded every night by a constant watch of Souldiers. The third is
sent publickely to Court, but with a strong Guard.</p>
                     <p>This Silver is put into round pieces of wood, sawed through in the
middle and hollowed within, and joyned together with Iron hoops and
both ends closed fast with plates of Iron. Within every one of these
pieces of wood is conveighed as much Silver as two men are able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
The revenue of the whole Kingdome (according to the supputation
of Father <hi>Matteo Riccius,</hi> who lived many yeares in <hi>China,</hi> as appeareth
by his book printed in the year 1621) is said to amount to an hundred and
fifty <hi>Millions</hi> of <hi>Crownes.</hi> Father <hi>Iohn Rodriquez,</hi> who also travailed much
about <hi>China,</hi> and was very curious to know the affaires of this Kingdome,
in a writing which he left behind him concerning the foure notable
things of <hi>China,</hi> faith; That it doth amount but to fifty five <hi>Millions,</hi> To
make them both agree, my opinion is, that the whole Revenue is a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Millions, as <hi>Father Riccius</hi> said; &amp; that which is brought to
Court is but fifty five, as Father <hi>Rodriquez</hi> would have it; the rest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
as hath been said, in the <hi>Provinces.</hi> As I have not made any dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
enquiry concerning this matter, so I will forbeare to add any thing
to the Testimonie of these grave <hi>Personages.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourth Tribunal</hi> is called <hi>Gan Cha Sci,</hi> and is, as it were, a <hi>Tribunal
Criminal;</hi> it hath <hi>Assessours, Councellours,</hi> and <hi>Tauli.</hi> And, as every <hi>Province</hi>
is divided into Shires, and Precincts, according to the number of the
Cities thereof, it belongeth to these <hi>Tauli</hi> to visit them, and to do justice
in the several places assigned them; punishing Malefactours, and exercising
their jurisdiction, which extendeth it selfe even to the Souldierie, and the
affaires of the Sea, if the Province be maritime.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fifth Tribunall</hi> is over learning and letters, to examine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
degrees, and the like, and is particularly set over all them that have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the degree of <hi>Batcheller;</hi> but <hi>Doctors</hi> are exempt from their <hi>Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
There is a <hi>Chancellour</hi> over the whole <hi>Province,</hi> who, at set times, visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
all the Cities and Townes, holding examinations, and informing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of every ones behaviour; and according as he findeth it, he reproveth,
chastiseth, and sometimes depriveth them of their degree, but leaving
them alwayes the libertie, as I have said, of returning, (if they please,) to a
new examination.</p>
                     <p>There are moreover in every City two, whom they call <hi>Mandarines</hi> of
the <hi>Sciences, Hioquan;</hi> who belong to the same <hi>Tribunall;</hi> but their <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi>
doth not extend it self further than to the <hi>Batchelers</hi> of the same
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64464:77"/>
City, and the territorie thereof. And although they have not the power
to conferre a degree, or to take it away, but only to punish them; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it is they that give them the most trouble, by reason, that living al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in the same City, they often call them before them, examine them,
&amp;c. They are, as it were, Prefects of the Classes.</p>
                     <p>All these offices whereof I have spoken, have authoritie over the whole
<hi>Province,</hi> and over all the Cities, Villages and Townes thereof.</p>
                     <p>But the Cities have moreover their particular Government, as among
us in <hi>Europe.</hi> In every City there are foure principall <hi>Mandarines,</hi> one
whereof is President, whom they call <hi>Chi Fu,</hi> and is, as it were, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the City: the rest are Collateralls, they are called <hi>Thum Chi,
Thum Phuon; Chiu Quon.</hi> Every one of these holdeth his <hi>Tribunal</hi> apart,
and hath greater and lesser officers belonging to him.</p>
                     <p>Beside these, every City hath nineteen lesser Magistrates employed
in severall Offices subordinate to the principall. Two whereof have a
<hi>President</hi> and foure <hi>Councellours,</hi> the nine others have only one <hi>President</hi>
and an <hi>Assistant,</hi> and the other eight have only one <hi>President,</hi> but they have
all of them their Officers, Ministers, and a convenient number of Servants
belonging to their Courts.</p>
                     <p>The Villages have a Judge and three Councellours. The Judge is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Chi Hien.</hi> The First Councellour <hi>Hum Chim.</hi> The Second <hi>Chu Phn.</hi>
The Third <hi>Tun Su.</hi> They have each of them their <hi>Palaces</hi> and <hi>Tribunals</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
as also their subordinate Officers, Notaries and others. The Judge
may give sentence of death, but cannot put it in execution.</p>
                     <p>Besides these <hi>Mandarines,</hi> which reside in the Cities and Villages, there
are others who have not the power either to Chastise or condemn, but
only to make their report, and are, as it were, <hi>Referendaries.</hi> There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of them in Castles, if they be great, and farre from any City or Village:
these are made ordinarily out of the inferiour Notaries of <hi>Tribunals,</hi> for
out of the great ones are commonly made the Councellours to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of Villages.</p>
                     <p>But it must be observed, that both the greater and the lesser officers
have not so much authoritie, as ours in <hi>Europe.</hi> Besides, every Hamlet
(whereof there are almost Infinite in <hi>China,</hi> no labourer, or husbandman
dwelling either in City or Village, but in the Fields) hath a Head or Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing-man
called <hi>Licham.</hi> The houses are divided by tens, like Tithings
or <hi>Decuries,</hi> with a Head or Tithing-man belonging to each, by which
meanes the Government becometh more easie, and the contribution
which is exacted, more certaine.</p>

of the Mandarines.</head>
                     <p>ALl Officers, who either have, or have had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, have their Ensigns,
by which they are distinguished, not only from the people, but from
others, as well <hi>Litterati,</hi> as Noblemen of another rank. These consist
in five things, that is, the <hi>Cap,</hi> the <hi>Habit,</hi> the <hi>Girdle,</hi> the <hi>Boots,</hi> and the <hi>Gown.</hi>
The <hi>Cap</hi> is of black Silk, lined with a certaine stiffe &amp; strong Stuffe. They
all of them have it made after the same fashion, only in the <hi>Caps</hi> of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lai</hi>
there is some difference, it is called in the <hi>Chinesse</hi> language <hi>Xamao.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Habit,</hi> (for so they call it, and we have nothing in <hi>Europe</hi> that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
to it,) is a square piece, which they wear on their breast, richly
embroydered round about, in the middle wherof is the device of their
Office and dignitie; and, as those are diverse, accordingly their devices
are different. It is called <hi>Phizu.</hi> The <hi>Magistrates</hi> of letters have an <hi>Eagle,</hi>
a <hi>Hearn,</hi> a <hi>Bird of the Sunne,</hi> or such like: the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of armes, have a
<hi>Panther,</hi> a <hi>Tiger,</hi> and <hi>Unicorns a Lym</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Girdle,</hi> which is not made to Gird them withall, for it is so wide, that
they are fain to fasten it at the sides, to keep it from falling, is called <hi>Quon
Thai;</hi> it is foure fingers broad, and divided into little squares; it is fastened
before (if the <hi>Girdle</hi> be rich) with large Buckles of Gold or Silver: some
weare them nine inches broad. There are nine sorts of Buckels, that is, of
<hi>Bufalo,</hi> of <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> horne, of <hi>Ivory,</hi> of <hi>Tortoise-shell,</hi> of <hi>Lignum Aquilae,</hi> of
<hi>Calambu,</hi> of Silver, Gold, and precious stones. Every one may not wear
them indifferently according to their Fancies, but suitable to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the Office which he beareth. The last <hi>Girdle,</hi> which is of a
precious stone, called <hi>Yu Xe,</hi> is given by the King himselfe to the <hi>Colai,</hi>
when they enter into their Office, nor is any other suffered to weare it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Boots,</hi> (which they call <hi>Hive,</hi>) are not ordinarie, but of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
particular make. They are all black, and turned down.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vest,</hi> or <hi>Gowne,</hi> is worne over their ordinary habit, and is in all, of
the same fashion. It is large, loose, and very becoming. The colour is at
their own choise, but for the most part it is modest: but on Feastivall
daies it is Crimson.</p>
                     <p>These are the Ensignes of the Magistrates, when ever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in publick: for at home they leave them off, and wear only the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
habit of the <hi>Litterati:</hi> and in the same manner they go among their
friends to Banquets, and places of recreation, especially in hot weather.
Their externall Ensignes, when they go abroad, are the Sedan, or Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
inlaid with Ivory, and richly gilded, all open, without any cover at
top, to the end they may be the better seen. There are some of them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by two men, others by foure, others by six, and some by eight, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the qualitie of the <hi>Mandarine.</hi> When there are six or eight
men, only foure do carry the Sedan, the others go by on each side, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64464:78"/>
take their turnes. The traine which followeth after them is more or lesse
according to the dignitie of the <hi>Magistrate:</hi> those of the greatest <hi>Qualitie</hi>
cause two men to march before them at a great distance, with a round
staffe in the hands of each, of something more than a mans length, only
for terrour (for the king only may strike with a round staffe) and all the
way they go, they make a cry. Then follow two men bearing two Tab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
silvered over, whereon is written in great letters the Title of his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
then come foure or six more, trayling after them cudgells made of
a great tree called <hi>Bambu,</hi> wherewith they are wont in those Countries to
give the <hi>Bastinado</hi> to Delinquents; then follow others with chaines in their
hands, and other instruments of Torture. A little before the Sedan there
marcheth one with an <hi>Umbrella,</hi> or Sun-skreen, and sometimes two; they
are made of silke, and are as bigge as three of ours. Close by the Sedan on
one side, is carried a great gilded fanne, so bigge that a man is hardly able
to beare it, with which the Sun is kept off from him, for the <hi>Umbrellas</hi> serve
only for shew and <hi>Parade.</hi> Immediatly before the Sedan is carried the
Kings seale in a gilded Coffer, placed upon a <hi>Machine,</hi> (like to that which
we use in our Countries, to carry the Images, and Reliques of Saints
upon in procession) under a cloath of state borne up with foure small
pillars. This is carried by two men. Behind the Sedan follow the Pages,
and other people, both on horse and foot.</p>
                     <p>When he goeth through the street, if there be any thing unseemly at
the windowes, as cloathes hanged out a drying, or such like things, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
they are taken in: if they meet with any Beers, or Hearses, such as
the dead are carried to buriall withall, they overturne them to the ground:
people of Qualitie turne downe some other street to avoyd meeting of
them: they that are on horse-back alight: they that are carried in chaires
are set downe, &amp; the people set themselves in ranke on both sides the way.
If it be a great <hi>Mandarine,</hi> the multitude that stand looking upon him, keep
a profound silence. In the meane while he sitteth in his chaire with so
much gravity and composure of body, that he doth not so much as move
his eyes: for to but looke on one side or other would in them be esteemed
a notable fault.</p>
                     <p>When they make their first entrie into any City or Towne, besides the
traine which is appoynted to accompany them, all the way they go, and
the Souldiers which guard them, through the Townes and Cities where
they passe, and the Officers of their owne <hi>Tribunal,</hi> who go many daies
journyes off to receive them, and the Souldiers of his owne Government,
who go out many miles to meet them, and all the inferiour <hi>Mandarines,</hi>
who go out of the City to congratulate them; at the gates of the Towne
or City, stand all the old men of that place in great number, with their
reverend white beards, who on their knees bid him welcome in the name
of the people.</p>
                     <p>The Mothers and wives of the Officers, as their Sonnes or Husbands
are preferred and advanced to higher offices and dignities, are appointed
by the King certaine honourable distinctions in their habit, as also Titles,
whereby they are called; such as are among us, your Honour, and your
Excellency; not, that they are the same, but that they have some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
more or lesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:64464:79"/>
When any one of the most Eminent Officers die, the King sendeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
post a <hi>Mandarine</hi> of the Court to solemnize his funeralls, and this
not only to the confines of the Kingdom, but even out of it, as to the
Island of <hi>Hainam,</hi> as it happened in the year 1617 at what time I spake with
him who was sent hether by the King, only for that purpose.</p>
                     <p>The King also, after his death, bestoweth the office of a <hi>Mandarine</hi>
upon his Sonne, or Nephew: and if the deceased person be a <hi>Colao,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
the like honour upon all his Sonnes or Nephewes, who, if they
give a good Testimony of their abilitie in their Government, are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
yet higher, and come to be Governours of Cityes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Palaces</hi> where they inhabit are large, convenient, and stately, their
<hi>Tribunals,</hi> where they do Justice, are magnificently adorned, and attended
by great store of Officers. In the City of <hi>Nankim,</hi> beside many others,
there are five <hi>Tribunals,</hi> foure of the foure windes, for so they call them,
and they are accordingly placed in the City toward the <hi>North,</hi> toward the
<hi>South,</hi> &amp;c. The fift is in the middle of the City: yet are they inferiour
<hi>Tribunals,</hi> for every one hath a <hi>President</hi> and two <hi>Collaterals,</hi> and the
<hi>President</hi> is no more than a <hi>Doctour,</hi> and the two <hi>Collaterals</hi> are either
simple <hi>Batchelers,</hi> or else raised from the office of Notarie. It is true that
in small and ordinary causes, these are the hands and feet of the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines,</hi>
being faithfull and diligent executers of whatsoever they command
them. There are in every one of these <hi>Tribunals</hi> more than 300 men, who
serve them, as Notaries, Clerks, and Serjeants, some to apprehend men,
others to whip them, others to carry letters and writings, and such other
Commissions; but they do not serve all at one time, but take their turnes
in order.</p>
                     <p>Now that I have treated of the small <hi>Tribunals,</hi> I will speak of a great
one, which is that of the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of <hi>Cantone,</hi> which, for some causes, I
had occasion to observe very distinctly, as also many others. The <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
wherein the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> doth Justice, is joyned to the <hi>Palace,</hi> where he
hath his residence.</p>
                     <p>There is first a great square Court, which looketh toward the South,
without having any gate in the wall right before it, but only two at the
two sides thereof. At the foure Corners of this Court there are foure ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high Masts, on the top of each is displayed a white banner, whereon
are written two letters so bigge, that they almost take up the whole
flagge. The letters are <hi>Kiun Muen,</hi> that is, <hi>Vice-roy.</hi> Within, round about
the Court, are Chambers for the Notaries, for great and lesser Officers,
and many small <hi>Mandarines,</hi> who are to be alwayes ready at the <hi>Vice-roys</hi>
beck. In the middle of the Court is a Theater of stone, with steps to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to it. There stand drums, flutes fifes and Corners of Brasse: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Vice-King</hi> giveth audience, all these instruments are sounded with
certain pauses or Intervalls. They are sounded three times for some space,
and at the end of each, there are three <hi>Bombards,</hi> or old fashion'd Cannon,
discharged; at the third and last time the gates are opened, &amp; all they, who
have any businesse with him, are permitted to enter into the first Court.</p>
                     <p>On the North side whereof, which answereth to the front, where there
is no Gate, there is, a great <hi>Portal,</hi> which leadeth into another quadrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64464:79"/>
Court, which is longer than it is broad. This <hi>Portall</hi> hath three gates
in it, after the fashion of our churches: that in the middle is the biggest,
the other two are lesser: each of these gates openeth upon an entry, which
is raised three or foure palmes from the ground, and is seaven or eight
palmes broad, but that in the middle is larger. At each entry stand two
ranks of Souldiers with their armes in their hands: through the middle of
whom those that have businesse are to passe, entring at the left gate,
and coming out at the right; for at the middle gate, none either go in, or
come out, but the <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> and they that visit or accompany him. At the
end of this Court is the place of the <hi>Vice-roy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> which hath neither Hall, nor
Gallery, but is a kind of building, that participateth of both. It is like a
Hall for its forme, and like a Gallery, in that it hath no doore, but lyes all
open. In it standeth a small Table covered with a Carpet of silke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
lyeth the Kings seale, with red and black inke by it, and stones for
to grind it small, and pensills for to write withall; but above all, there is
the Case of the <hi>Cheu Cu,</hi> that is, Little Tallies of wood, each of which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
<hi>five lashes:</hi> so that when the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> throweth downe two of them,
in the languages of Justice, it signifieth <hi>Ten lashes;</hi> if he throweth downe
six, Thirty, and so of the rest. Neere unto the seat of the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> on each
hand stand twelve Captaines richly cloathed, with their <hi>Morions</hi> on their
heads, and their Scimitars by their sides. Behinde, stand two Pages with
fannes in their hands to make winde, in case the weather be hot; but in
winter they do not use them. All <hi>Tribunals</hi> are not of this forme; although
there are many things common to them all, and the rest is proportionable
to the dignity of the <hi>Mandarines</hi> who hold them.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the prisons, sentences and punishments
of the Chinesses.</head>
                     <p>THeir prisons for Malefactours are more commodious and spacious
than ours. They are all, throughout the Kingdom, of the same forme,
with very little difference; so that by treating of one, we shall give a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of them all. They are for the most part either joyned, or not
farre distant from the <hi>Palaces</hi> and <hi>Tribunals</hi> of the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> to which
they belong. They have no grates towards the street; but within the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
gate there is a narrow entry, which leadeth to a second gate, within
which is a Court, which is alwaies bigger or lesser according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
and concourse of the prison. Then followeth a third gate, where the
lodgings of the keepers and warders are, who are commonly three; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that is another gate, which openeth into a great square Court, a long
the foure sides whereof are the chambers of the prisoners, which have no
walls towards the Court, but in stead thereof, Columnes of wood placed
so neere together, that they rather seeme to be grates. The doores are not
made of board, but of grates of the same wood, so that all is open to the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64464:80"/>
ayre: these Lodges or Chambers, are the Prisons of the ordinary Prisoners.
At the end of one of these rowes of chambers, standeth the secret, or
close Prison, for such as are committed for crimes of a higher nature.
This they call <hi>Chum Kien,</hi> that is, the heavy Prison: so that having passed
through the common Prison, there are other grates made in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as the first, within which are the close Prisons, where the most crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Persons are, who are alwayes kept locked up: the other Prisons are
opened every day, and the Prisoners have liberty to go from one cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to another, and to converse together in the Base-Courts.</p>
                     <p>Every evening there is a view taken of the Prisoners, causing them all,
for this purpose, to come into the outward Court, and one of the warders
with a rol in his hand calleth them over one by one: each man as he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
goeth into his prison, where he is locked up for that night.</p>
                     <p>Those of the close Prison, although they go not out of it, (which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
only to those, who have no money, for if they have wherewithall to
fee the Gaolers, they go out when they wil, and are lodged where they
please.) Yet are they all day at libertie in their Prison: but at night they
are secured in this manner, They sleep at night upon planks, at the lower
end whereof, where their feet lie, there is a great piece of Timber laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart,
which hath store of holes in it, wherein their feet are put, and so
locked up: on their hands they put manacles: on the side of each are
two Iron rings fastened into the Boards, through which is passed an Iron-Chaine
of a good bignesse, and is carried over their brests from the right
side to the left, so that if this Chaine be streightned a little (which is at the
courtesie of the Keepers) the poor Prisoner is not able to turne himself, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not only his hands and feet, but his whole body bound. This is the
caution which they use for the night.</p>
                     <p>In the middle of the Court where the aforesaid chambers are, there is,
as it were, a little corps d'e gard, where there are foure who keep watch
by turnes. If there happen any noise, or stir, in the Prisons, or any thing
which giveth suspicion, although it be only the going out of the light,
which is to bee kept burning all night long, presently they give notice
thereof to the Gaolers, who immediately come in hast to take care
of it.</p>
                     <p>They are visited every moneth by one of those <hi>Mandarines,</hi> who have the
care of the Prisons commited to them. Assoon as he hath taken his seate
in the outward Court, he causeth to be brought before him all those who
have been condemned to die. Those wretches present themselves before
him with their haire hanging down and uncombed, a sickly countenance,
their head hanging on one side, &amp; almost falling off; but assoon as they are
remanded to the prison, and have lost the sight of the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> they
begin to skip, and are as sound as a fish. The reason of this dissimulation is,
because if the <hi>Mandarine</hi> find them fat and in good liking, he causeth
them to be bastinadoed, which they call <hi>Tá Foiti,</hi> that is, <hi>to fall upon the
fat ones;</hi> saying, that they keep them there, to do penance, to grow leane
and die, and not to make good cheere. The other Prisoners also are
brought before him one by one, and the <hi>Mandarine</hi> enquireth of the
Gaolers, how they behave themselves, and accordingly he dispenseth
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64464:80"/>
his <hi>Bastinadoes,</hi> to those that are troublesome, unquiet and <hi>Gamesters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After that, he visiteth the chambers of the Prisoners, where he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them to have no manner of conveniencie, if he find either, Seats, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Beds, or such like things, he causeth them presently to be taken away;
for they will not have their Prisons to be as ours are, for the securing
only of their Persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also to punish their bodies.</p>
                     <p>They who are committed to prison, are not only subject to the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,
but also to many contributions and paiments. The <hi>Mandarines</hi>
have a tablet done over with a white varnish, whereon is written the name
and crime of the person apprehended, this is given to the officer, who
having received it, carrieth him away presently to Prison, and maketh him
pay for his journey, which fee they call <hi>Tablet-money.</hi> When he entreth
the second gate, commeth the Notarie Generall of the Prisoners, who is
commonly one of them himself: he hath his Seate and Table (which
is only that whereon the Prisoners eat) he asketh him his name and the
cause of his imprisonment, which he presently enrolleth in the book of
Prisoners, making him pay for the honour which he receiveth in having
his name entred. Next after that, he is delivered to the Gaolers and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers
of the severall chambers, or to some one of them, and if the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are many, they begin to distribute them to one another: if it be one
man only, they bid him go to the chambers of the North, or of the South
&amp;c. and presently the overseer of that is to be paid his fee. Assoon as he
is come to his quarter, there cometh to him another little scribe, whose
office is only to take his name, and to write it in the particular Table of
that warde, which alwaies hangeth up there; and here he is to pay ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fee for this writing. After that cometh another, who is the sweeper
of the Prison, and telleth him, Sir, Cleanlinesse is very necessary here, this
place is to be swept and kept cleane; your fire to be made &amp;c. all which
cannot be done without opening the purse. In the mean while cometh
one of the Prisoners with a pair of Iron Manacles, the streightest he can
find, which he putteth on upon him: about halfe an houre after he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
again with another wider paire, and telleth him, Brother, I know those
Manacles are very streight and painfull, I wil therefore change them for
these wider, if you wil pay me for the courtesie; &amp; if he hath no money to
give him, he taketh his Cap, or else some part of his cloaths. These are
the small charges, with which the poor Prisoners purse is drained.</p>
                     <p>Then follow the Gaolers; who being to receive a greater fee, allow
him longer time: for two daies after his imprisonment they let him alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to see what he will give of his own accord, and if in that time he present
them not with something, for every night after, till they are satisfied they
give him trouble and torment enough. This payment is not limited, but
is at the discretion of the Gaolers, who endeavour to draw from every
one as much as they can, that is, a great summe from those who are rich,
lesse from the poor, and from those that have nothing, they take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>This duty is no sooner satisfied, but the last Rights must be paid, that
is for the sacrifices of the Idol, or <hi>Pagod</hi> of the Prison, for in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them there is a Chappel or two, where every month the Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64464:81"/>
offer Sacrifice on the first and fifteenth day of the Moon; which
consisteth commonly of a Cock, a piece of Pork, two Fishes, Bread,
Fruit, and other things. These they seeth a little in water, and the Cock
is to be boyled no more than that he may be made to stand upright upon
a Table which is placed before the <hi>Pagod,</hi> where the other things are set
in handsome order about him, and after it hath stood there an houre, they
come and take it away, and dresse the Fish and Flesh anew, seasoning it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, and then they make a <hi>Banquet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The new Prisoners must contribute to furnish this expence; they, who
are admitted after this Sacrifice, till the next, which is fifteen daies after,
furnisheth the expences of the next Sacrifice; and they that come after
that, of the next, and then they are freed from paying.</p>
                     <p>These Chappels dedicated to the Idols, do not only serve the Prisoners
to make their Sacrifices there, but also for other more common uses; that
is, for the Prisoners to make their vows, to draw lots, although many
times with an unfortunate event, for having libertie and a happie delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
promised them by the lot, they receive afterward at the <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
Bastinadoes</hi> and torments.</p>
                     <p>I was one day present when a poor heathen drew his lot, kneeling
on his knees with much devotion, and because he could not read, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
another to instruct him out of the little book, which is kept for that
purpose in the Chappels: having drawn his lot, saith this poor man, well,
what have I got? Shall I be tormented at the <hi>Tribunall?</hi> The other reading
over the leafe cryed out, Be of good courage, all is well, you have a good
lot. Shall I not have the <hi>Rack</hi> given me, replyed the poor wretch? Which
was a kind of torment which he was much afraid of. Fear not, answered
the Interpreter, you shall have no harme. That very morning this poor
<hi>Gentile</hi> was brought to his Tryall, who in truth was innocent, the fact,
for which he was committed, being done by his brother, who had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
stollen goods into his house, and knowing that he was discovered,
fled away; and so this poor wretch was apprehended in his stead, When
he was examined, the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> not satisfied with his answers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
he should have the <hi>Rack</hi> given him. He being loath to be carried
away, made what resistance he could, so that they were fain to drag him
by main force, and being a strong sturdy young man, defended himselfe
with so much courage and violence, that ten or twelve men were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to rule him, but tumbling up and downe from one side to another, and
catching hold of whatsoever he came neer, he hit by chance against the
<hi>Mandarines</hi> Table, and overturn'd it to the ground with all that was upon
it, by which accident he did so anger the Judge, and enrage the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants
against him, that when they had seised him, they gave him the <hi>Rack</hi>
in so cruel a manner, that they were faine to send him back to Prison up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other mens Shoulders, having his heel-bones out of joynt. The next
day, when his pain was something mitigated, and he more capable of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I went to visit him, much compassionating his sufferings, he related to
me all particulars of the storie, and I began to touch upon that point of
the lots and their interpretation, saying unto him, what hath your <hi>Idol</hi>
done for you: <hi>The Devil,</hi> said he, <hi>take the Idol and his lots, for they are all such
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64464:81"/>
as he is;</hi> and some other words, which are not proper to be related here.</p>
                     <p>The Prisoners do passe the summer well enough, but in winter, as the
cold is very great, and the sustenance of many very little, they must needs
suffer much: and although the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> for the good of the poor Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
do often commute Corporal punishments into <hi>Pecuniary Mulcts;</hi> yet
when this is done, there is not enough for all. Thieves, when they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
are generally abandoned of their friends and kindred; neither is there
any, who will own them, and so, many of them perish miserably. I have
often seen six or seaven dead bodies thrown out at a time.</p>
                     <p>They have anotable <hi>Superstition</hi> concerning the dead, which is, that
they will not suffer the Body when it is dead, to be carried out at that
Gate whereat it entred when it was living. And to take away this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
in the outward Court, whereof we have spoken, there is a little
doore, or hole in the wall, where they are thrown out; if it be a person of
qualitie, there is alwayes leave obtained for him to go out of Prison before
he dieth, that he might not have his Carcasse thrown out at that hole, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
it the most shamefull disgrace that can befall them. Hence one
of the most horrible imprecations and curses that is used in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is, <hi>La Laoti,</hi> that is, <hi>maist thou be dragd through the hole of a Prison.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prisons,</hi> having no grate on the outside of them, they, who would
visit or speak with any Prisoner, must of necessitie enter into the Prison;
and there is this inviolable custome among them, that none is to visit a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
without bringing him something to eate, more or lesse according to
his ability, and if by accident he bringeth nothing, he maketh his
excuse for having, broken a custome so generally received. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
some will ask me how I came to be so expert in these poynts? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I must answer him in a word, that though this knowledge be not much
worth, yet it cost me very deare.</p>
                     <p>Their trialls differ very little from ours, but only that the delaies and
the replies are not so many: every thing is done by way of <hi>Petitions</hi> or
<hi>Memorialls,</hi> and in these every one is allowed to say what he can for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
There are some who get their living only by drawing up such wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
as these for Prisoners; but we do not admit them to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Baptism, unlesse they leave this employment: for they tel so many
lies in them, that the <hi>Mandarines</hi> had need of a great deal of experience, and
discretion to find out any truth amongst so many falshoods: but somtimes,
when they are taken in them, they are well paid for them in <hi>Bastinadoes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of <hi>Nankim,</hi> who was a great friend to our Fathers, and,
though a heathen, was well affected to the Christian religion, and well
acquainted with the doctrine of it, told me one day this story, As I was
giving audience, said he, at my <hi>Tribunal,</hi> and hearing of causes, there was
one, who among others, presented me a <hi>Memoriall,</hi> I tooke it and read it,
and found it full of nothing but revilings and Slanders against the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Christian Chinesses</hi> of that City, speaking sufficiently
ill of both. I asked him then, Do you understand this law, and do you
know this people? Yes Sir, answered he, It is an upstart, perverse,
strange law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Speaking yet more evill of it than he had written in his
<hi>Memoriall.</hi> I presently put my hand to my <hi>Tallies,</hi> and flung out six, the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64464:82"/>
Officers presently gave him thirty <hi>Bastinadoes</hi> (and those which are given
at these <hi>Tribunals,</hi> are commonly well set on) assoone as he had gotten up
upon his legges, and had a little composed himselfe, I told him, that I
saw his petition was not well enough digested for a businesse of so great
moment, and bid him go and consider better of it, and more diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
himselfe, and to come and give me an account of it; but from that
day to this I never heard more of him.</p>
                     <p>The petition is presented by the party, or by some other in his name,
after this manner. The Court, before the <hi>Tribunall,</hi> is commonly full of
people that have suites there, but there is an entry in the middle of them,
which leadeth directly to the <hi>Mandarines</hi> seat that is alwaies kept empty,
and free to passe through. He that hath a petition to present, when his
time cometh, kneeleth on his knees in that passage, having his petition in
his hand lifted up as high as his head. Then the <hi>Mandarine</hi> sendeth one
to take it, and if he hath any question to aske him, he asketh it; then if he
accepteth the petition, he foldeth it, and layeth it on the Table; if not, he
presently throweth it away; and if he judgeth the petition to be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
he appoynteth a certaine number of <hi>Bastinadoes,</hi> to be bestowed on
the petitioner, as hath been already said: and many times for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but because the Judge is in ill humour, although he that presenteth the
petition is not the party whom it doth concerne. I saw the like case hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to a <hi>Bonzo,</hi> (for they also are subject to the secular power) for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason, but that the <hi>Mandarine</hi> was peevish.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bonzo</hi> used the ordinary <hi>Ceremony</hi> with his petition: his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
was, that the <hi>Mandarine</hi> presently turned towards the Table, and
cast downe two Tallies of wood, which was no sooner done, but present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there were two men, that tooke the <hi>Bonzo,</hi> one by the head, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the heeles, and throwing him downe to the ground, stripped
downe his drawers to his very feete, and bestowed ten Bastinadoes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, with so much dexteritie, that the businesse was done before any
was aware of it.</p>
                     <p>Their condemnations are for the most part pecuniary, and sometimes,
though seldome, they are sent into banishment, or to the Gallies, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
something equivalent to it. For to speak the truth, they have not that
punishment, but one very like it, that is, they are put to worke on the rivers,
in the Kings ships and vessels, they tugge at the oare, and do other services,
being bound two together in one chaine.</p>
                     <p>They only are condemned to death, (which is commonly executed by
hanging, strangling, or cutting off the head,) who falsifie the Kings mony,
or commit murder: if there be many guilty of the same crime, one man
only is executed, the rest have other punishments inflicted on them: but
robbers by the high-waies are all to die, if the fact be sufficiently proved.
Lesser theeves for the first fault, if the theft be of small value, are <hi>Bastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed,</hi>
and imprisoned for a certaine time. If they be taken a second time,
they have the same punishment with some advantage; or else they have
these two letters <hi>Za Tao</hi> imprinted on the outside of their arme, both
which do signifie <hi>Thiefe.</hi> These two letters are neatly carved on a piece
of wood, and being rubbed over with inke, they do make the impression
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64464:82"/>
of them on their flesh, and then with another piece of wood, wherein
are foure needles conveniently placed, they do prick holes in that part of
their flesh which is coloured with inke, and when the bloud cometh, they
rub it with their hands, to give entrance to the inke; and by that means
the impression remaineth for ever. Adulterers are severely punished, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not with death, and besides other chastisements they are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
loaden with <hi>Bastinadoes.</hi> The women also taken in the same fault, if
they have been formerly of honest repute, are whipt or <hi>Bastinadoed,</hi> with
their drawers or <hi>Calzones</hi> pulled downe to their heeles, to make them the
more ashamed, and sometimes also they are whipt in the publick streets:
but, if they have formerly lost both their shame and their honour, they
beat them only upon their <hi>Calzones.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They do many times die of the <hi>Bastinadoes</hi> they receive, especially if
the delinquent deserve death, and they have a minde to dispatch him; for
it is impossible a man should live, after he hath received seventy or eighty
<hi>Bastinadoes,</hi> especially as they are laid on, when it is before a great <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
In the year 1617 there was in the City of <hi>Nankim</hi> a kinde of <hi>Confra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie,</hi>
or society of fifty men, called by them <hi>Thien Cam.</hi> These accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to an agreement made among themselves, did alwaies assist one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
an injury resented by one, was vindicated by all, and by this meanes
they committed a thousand insolencies: at length they were almost all
apprehended, &amp; distributed to the severall prisons of the City; where there
are at least fourteen or fifteen: at their very first entrance, they put about
the neck of each a <hi>Kian Hao</hi> (of which we will speak hereafter) so heavie,
that it was impossible for him that bore it, to stirre out of his place; and
when any of them was to be brought out, he was forced to have two men
to help him to carry it. They were brought to a triall before the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the City, who caused them to receive threescore and ten blowes a
man, whereof they all dyed.</p>
                     <p>For ordinary crimes they inflict a certain punishment, that is not in use
among us in <hi>Portugall;</hi> they call it <hi>Kian Hao</hi> It is a great thick board, foure
or five Palmes square, with a hole cut in the middle of it about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a mans neck. This they fasten about their necks, and to it are hung
two scrolls of paper of a hands breadth, wherein are written his fault, and
the cause of his punishment; they serve also to shew that the board hath
not been opened: and so with these great boards about their necks, these
poore wretches are brought out every day, and exposed to shame in the
publick streets, for fifteen, twenty, or thirty days, according as they are
adjudged by their sentence, whose greatest rigour is, that during all that
time these boards are not taken off their necks, neither night nor day. And
all this must be understood to be done after they have received their
<hi>Bastinadoes,</hi> which are never wanting, there being no condemnation in
<hi>China,</hi> (unlesse it be pecuniary,) without this previous disposition: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it necessary to make mention of it in their condemnation, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alwaies understood to be their first dish, and as a necessary, though
accessary circumstance; and then followeth their sentence, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
verb. And the truth is, that, as the <hi>Giapponesses</hi> are wont to say,
they cannot Governe without the <hi>Catana,</hi> that is, the Scimitar or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64464:83"/>
Sword; so it may be said of the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> that without <hi>Bambu,</hi> that is, the
cudgell or <hi>Baston,</hi> with which they use to beat men, it is not possible they
should be ruled. For the better understanding of this, I will briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the use of it.</p>
                     <p>In every <hi>Tribunall</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> when the <hi>Mandarine</hi> giveth audience, there
stand neere unto his Table ten or twelve men on both sides thereof, with
long <hi>Cudgells</hi> in their hands, rested upon the ground (and sometimes for
the greater terrour, they will place fourty men about them, as they did,
when the fathers were brought before them for their Religion.) These
<hi>Cudgells</hi> are seaven palms long, being at the bottom about a hands
breadth in circumference, tapering still towards the top, where they are
small and slender, that they might more commodiously be used with both
hands. They are made of <hi>Bambu,</hi> which hath some resemblance to <hi>Cane,</hi>
in that it is knotty and hollow within, but is different in this, that it is a
massie, strong, heavie, hard wood.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, on the Table of the <hi>Mandarine</hi> standeth that case of woodden
<hi>Tallies,</hi> whereof we have spoken, and every Tally importeth five blowes;
wherefore when the <hi>Mandarine</hi> would have any one <hi>Bastinadoed,</hi> he
throweth downe as many <hi>Tallies,</hi> as make up the number of the blowes
he would have given. Every one of the <hi>Upi</hi> (as the <hi>Portughesses</hi> call them
who carry the <hi>Bastons</hi>) is ready to take his <hi>Tally,</hi> others to sieze the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and to lay him on the ground. Assoone as his breeches are pulled
downe, presently one of the <hi>Upi</hi> layeth five <hi>Bastinadoes</hi> upon his naked
flesh, according to the import of his <hi>Tally,</hi> and withdraweth himselfe.
Then cometh another, and layeth on other five, and so it is alwayes done
by a fresh hand, till he hath received the number assigned him: when the
<hi>Mandarine</hi> throweth the <hi>Tallies</hi> out of the case, he is not to give any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it, neither must he be asked, but his commands are presently put
in execution, and only in some smaller offences the patient may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
with his money, that the blowes be not altogether so fierce and
cruell.</p>
                     <p>This is to be understood, when the <hi>Mandarine</hi> sitteth on his <hi>Tribunal,</hi>
for in no other place he maketh use of those <hi>Tallies,</hi> although he be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
waited on with those <hi>Cudgells;</hi> and by reason the use of them is so
frequent, they alwayes accompany the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who maketh use of
them in any place, and upon any occasion. It were a sufficient cause if any
one that met him on horse-back did not alight, or that he crossed his way,
which because it is a slight fault, is chastised only with five or ten blowes.
And the <hi>Mandarine</hi> hath this power, not only in the Townes and Cities
of his owne <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> but also in any place whatsoever, though it be
not properly under his <hi>Authority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I left the City of <hi>Nankim,</hi> (the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Province of
<hi>Kiamsi,</hi> where we have a Church, a house, and a good number of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,)
there came thither a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who was Judge of one of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Townes, and passed through our street, which is one of the most
frequented of that City. There was, in a remote corner thereof, a fortune-teller,
one of those, who used to sell good fortunes to the people, sitting
in his chaire, with his Table, books, and other things before him. The
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64464:83"/>
                        <hi>Mandarine</hi> passed once up, and another time downe the street, and the
<hi>Suon Mim</hi> (for so they call these <hi>Diviners</hi>) never moved himselfe off his
chaire, either the first or the second time. After a few houres the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
had occasion to passe through the same street againe, and coming to
a little <hi>Piazza,</hi> in a corner whereof this unhappy fortune-teller had his
seat, the <hi>Mandarine</hi> called out to him, saying, you make no difference of men,
neither do you doe your Courtesie to the Kings <hi>Mandarines:</hi> take him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and give him what he deserveth; presently in the street, before his
owne seat, they gave him ten <hi>Bastinadoes.</hi> Go your waies now said the
<hi>Mandarine,</hi> and learn manners, and study better that art of yours, since you
have not been able to foresee this good fortune, that hath befallen you:
with so much facility do they bestow their <hi>Bastinadoes;</hi> neither do men
make any account of them, although they alwaies pay them in ready coyn;
all do give them, all receive them, and all have felt them, neither doth it
seeme strange to any one, nor doth any hold himselfe aggrieved for them.
In the same manner do Lords and Masters chastise their servants, except
only, that for the most part they do not take downe their breeches. The
like do Schoole-Masters use in their Schooles to their Scholars, of what
quality soever they be; beating them on the buttocks with their breeches
on, and laying them not upon the ground, but upon a forme. The same
also do they use to little children, for they have neither whips nor disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines,
but rather abhorre them; wondring how we can chastise our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with a whip, which they apprehend to be a very cruell thing; and
the children themselves, because the whip smarteth more, and tis struck
upon their naked skin, do rather choose the <hi>Bambu.</hi> And that you might
want nothing, there are in <hi>China</hi> certain persons, who do buy these <hi>Basti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes</hi>
at the <hi>Tribunals;</hi> or (to speak more correctly,) do sell the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of them in stead of others. But this is only in some slight causes, for
in others they neither may nor will. But when the cause is such that this
may be done, he agreeth with the party for so much a <hi>Bastinado,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
before the <hi>Mandarine</hi> in the place of the delinquent, and receiveth
them for him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rack</hi> is used also in certain necessary cases. I do not know that
they have above two kindes of it. That of the feet, and that of the hands.
For the feet they use an instrument called <hi>Kia Quen,</hi> it consisteth of three
pieces of wood put in one Traverse, that in the middle is fixt, the other
two are moveable, between these their feet are put, where they are squee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
and prest, till the heele-bone run into the foot: for the hands they use
also certain small pieces of wood between their fingers, they call them
<hi>Tean Zu,</hi> then they straiten them very hard, and seale them round about
with paper, and so they have them for some space of time.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of some particular things, which do
facilitate and rectifie the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in China.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>First</hi> is, that the King doth bear the charges of his Officers, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
them with all manner of expences, by this meanes, taking
from them all occasions, which might, through their necessities either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
them to severall Persons, or runne them much into debt, obliging
them by the same meanes more strictly to observe the lawes, and to walk
more directly in the paths of justice.</p>
                     <p>After that a <hi>Doctour,</hi> or <hi>Licentiate,</hi> or any other hath an employment
bestowed upon him at Court, and departeth thence to go to his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
all the expences of his person, Servants and Familie, as well in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
by water as by land, including the hire of Boats, Carts, Horses,
Porters, and other things, are all defrayed by the King.</p>
                     <p>Throughout their whole journey they never lodge at Innes, but in all
the Townes and Cities, there are <hi>Palaces</hi> appointed for to entertain them,
where all things fitting are provided for them. They alwayes send a man
before as an harbenger, so that by that time they arrive, all things are in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for their reception. And if it fall out, as sometimes it doth, that they
cannot reach to a good Town, there are in certain places, houses built for
this purpose by the King, which they call <hi>Yeli,</hi> where every thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for them. The worst is, that because it is all at the Kings charges it
is done more profusely and lavishly than is requisite: as for example,
when the <hi>Mandarine</hi> hath occasion for ten horses to carry his familie, they
require fifteen or twenty; and there is likewise provision made for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
through the whole journey, and the greatest part of them receive this
in money.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth the matter stop here, but goeth yet further. There being
some, who have not so much care of their credit and reputation, as of
their purse; and when they are to have so many dishes, and so many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
sorts of meat, according to the Kings appointment, they give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the provision should be lesse and receive the rest in money, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
there are but few who dare be guilty of such basenesse.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth the King only furnish the expence of their persons, but
that also, which is requisite to sustaine the honour and dignitie of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as, men on horse back, and on foot to accompany them from Town to
Town through all places where they are to passe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, that in the places where their Governments are, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth
them <hi>Palaces</hi> for their habitation, in case they have none of their
own, as also rich Furniture and moveables, and all manner of Servants
within doors, and without doors even to the pages, who are never so few,
but that he alloweth eight or ten of them to a Judge of the smallest
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64464:84"/>
Town; yet they do not waite all at one time, unlesse it be when the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darine</hi>
giveth a particular command for it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is, that the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> in treating with the subjects, are very
warie and circumspect, never discoursing nor treating in secret with any,
but alwayes publickly, so that every one may be witnesse to what they
say. Their <hi>Palaces</hi> are alwayes kept shut within &amp; without. After they have
given audience (which they do constantly every day, &amp; many times both
morning and evening, for there is alwayes someting to do) they retire, and
the <hi>Palace</hi> is shut within, for the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> and without, for the Officers.
And although the gates are opened as often as he hath a mind to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
yet it is never done secretly, but one beateth a drumme within, to
whom another answereth without, and presently the Officers and other
people, who are to accompany him, come together; assoon as they are all
assembled, the gates of the <hi>Palace</hi> are opened, &amp; the <hi>Mandarine</hi> cometh out.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, that no person of their house, whether they be Sonnes,
Cousins, or Servants that dwell with them, may go out to visit, converse,
or treat of any businesse, for fear least they should receive any bribe or
present. The <hi>Pourveyour,</hi> or <hi>Caterour,</hi> dwelleth without, and is of the same
<hi>Tribunall,</hi> as well as the rest of the Officers, and hath every day given him
in writing, what he is to buy. And because it is not convenient that the
gates of the <hi>Palace</hi> should be opened upon every small occasion, they have
all turning wheeles, by which they receive in, and send out, whatsoever
there is occasion for.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> is, that they govern only three years in one place, by which
meanes they are prevented from establishing themselves too strongly,
and from contracting any streight alliances or friendships. None govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in his own Countrie, except the Captains, who are presumed, when
there is occasion, will defend and preserve their own Countrie, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
affections and endeavours than strangers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> it, that among the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> there is a great subordination
of some to others. The inferiours with all reverence and obedience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
their <hi>Superiours,</hi> and also visit them courteously, and at certain set
times do make them presents.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> is, that there is a strict watch kept over the Government.
For besides the <hi>Tauli</hi> and <hi>Quoli,</hi> whose office it is to inform themselves
of whatsoever passeth, and accordingly to give advice thereof to the King,
every Province hath a <hi>Visitour,</hi> not for many years, but a new one every
year, to the end he might do his Office more exactly, and that he might
either chastise, or give notice to the King of such as do not comply with
their duty, according to their obligation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eighth</hi> is, that every three years there is a general visitation held up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of the Kingdome, partly by meanes of the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Visitours,</hi> and partly by private inquisition, and it is held the
same year, wherein, from all parts of the Kingdome, the <hi>Mandarines</hi> go
to render obedience to the King in <hi>Pekim,</hi> and so the execution of this
review is done at the Court it self by chastising some, abasing others, and
taking their offices away. The principall causes for which they are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are these following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:64464:85"/>
                        <hi>First</hi> if they sell justice, by receiving bribes, these lose their Offices,
and are sent home to their houses.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, if they be rigorous and cruell, punishing men beyond all
humanitie, these lose both their Office and honour, and are put into the
ranck of the common people.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is, if they be negligent or carelesse in their government, they
lose their Office, but retain still the Ensignes of their dignitie.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, if they be hastie and precipitate, and not deliberate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in giving their judgment, these are abased to lower Offices, as from
a Governour to a Judge, and the like.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> is, if they be too young, and their Actions light and <hi>Iuvenile,</hi>
these are likewise degraded, and employed in lower charges.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>sixt,</hi> if they be old, and have not strength to undergo the paines
requisite in their audiences, and other services of the King, they give them
their <hi>Quietus est,</hi> and send them to take their ease at their own houses. And
although this be not a fault, but only a failing of nature, yet it is the worst
of all, because they, not being able to remedie the incommodities of their
old age, this defect stil encreaseth upon them by time, and they are by
consequence made uncapable of returne to their Offices.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seaventh</hi> is, if they be carelesse in the conduct and government of
their house and Familie; whither it be that, where they actually dwell, or
that which is in their own Country, which is governed also by their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to which both their servants, kindred and sonnes, do yeeld an exact
obedience (which is not hard for them to obtain, by reason of their great
authoritie) these likewise lose their Office.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ninth</hi> thing, which much facilitateth good government, is, that
the Kings will hear the <hi>Mandarines</hi> speak, although it be in a businesse
that is displeasing to them; and the <hi>Mandarines</hi> will freely speak to them,
although it be with some hazard to themselves; so that both the one and
the other are much to be admired, In the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> their liberty in advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
And in the Kings, their facility in hearing, In the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> their
zeale to justice and good government, And in the Kings, their sinceritie
and desire to settle and establish it. They have many examples of this
in their Historie, and I am willing to set down two or three of them.</p>
                     <p>From a certain <hi>Province,</hi> there was sent unto the King, a damsell of a
rare beautie, and incomparable features. Now his predecessour had been
formerly intrigued and engaged in the like occasion, &amp; very great damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
had resulted thereby unto the Kingdome (for such like persons are
seldome causes of much good) and the same inconveniences were feared
at present. A <hi>Colao</hi> undertook the businesse, and resolved to speak to the
King about it: he was admitted, and spake with so much efficacy and
perswasion that the King told him, that assoon as she was brought to the
<hi>Palace, she should be dismised and sent away.</hi> Sir, replyed the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> your
Majesty would do well to command her to be sent away suddenly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly,
for if she once enter into your house, and that you have seen her,
and heard her speak, your hands will tremble, for women have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to enchaunt without witch-craft: neither will I go out at one gate of
the <hi>Palace,</hi> till she be first sent away at another. The which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put in execution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:64464:85"/>
There was a King so taken with the love of Birds, that he caused the
most curious and beautifull Birds to be sought for through the woods of
the whole Kingdome: and as the Kings will is like the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> in
giving motion to the hands of his subjects, this search was put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with great labour and oppression of the people, especially of one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
where this chase was continually made by many, insomuch that the
husbandmen could not attend their <hi>Ploughing</hi> and <hi>Sowing:</hi> so that by this
meanes they came to suffer great want. It happened that a <hi>Mandarine</hi>
passed through that <hi>Province,</hi> as he came from another, who had more
zeale and compassion for them, than they who governed there. Assoon as
he was come to Court he presented a <hi>Memoriall</hi> to the King, wherein he
did so lively set forth the small importance of that chase, and the great
trouble and disturbance which it caused to the people, that the King,
not only bounded his curiosity, and commanded they should desist from
taking any more Birds; but also gave libertie to those, which were already
taken, commanding the doors of the <hi>Aviaries</hi> and <hi>Cages</hi> to be set open,
that they might fly away.</p>
                     <p>In the City of <hi>Pekim,</hi> in the <hi>Palace</hi> of one of the Kings daughters,
whom they call <hi>Cum Chu,</hi> there was one of her Servants, who was very
insolent, having committed many high crimes, and one among the rest,
which deserved death: the <hi>Mandarines</hi> much desired to apprehend him,
but in the Palace they could not, and he never went abroad, but when he
wayted on his <hi>Princesse.</hi> At length there was a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who resolved to
take him by any meanes he could, and to this effect, when the <hi>Princesse</hi>
went next abroad, he with his men set himself before the coaches, and
made them stop, and then presently laid hands on that man, and carried
him away. The <hi>Princesse,</hi> resenting the afront that was done her, returned
presently to the <hi>Palace</hi> full of indignation, and was so transported with
colar, that she would not stay till the King came back from the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
where he then was, but went thither her self in person to complain,
The <hi>Mandarine</hi> was presently sent for, who had put himself in a readiness,
well imagining he should be called: he presenteth himself before the
King, who sharply reproved him. He answered him, Sir, I have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that which <hi>your Majestie commandeth, &amp; the law ordaineth.</hi> But you
ought, replyed the King, to have sought some other time and opportunity.
I have sought it long enough, answered the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> but I should never
have found it. At least, replyed the King, ask my daughter pardon, and bow
your head. Where there is no fault, answered the other, there is
no need of pardon, neither will I ask pardon for having discharged my
Office. Then the King commanded two <hi>Mandarines,</hi> that by force they
should bow his head down to the ground: but he by strength kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
up so stiff, that it was not possible for them to do it; so that the King
was constrained to send him away. A few daies after the King gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that he should have a better Office bestowed upon him, being much
satisfied with his integrity. I forbear to relate many like cases, which
I might bring in confirmation of this.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tenth</hi> is the strickt watch and ward, which is kept in the Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ies,
Townes and Villages; in every street there is placed a man, and if it be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64464:86"/>
long, two or more; who are appointed to take care of any disorders that
may arise there. In every street likewise there is a kinde of prison cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Lemphù,</hi> that is, <hi>the cold shop,</hi> where upon a sudden occasion they
may imprison a delinquent, untill notice be given thereof to some Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eleventh</hi> is, that every night infallibly all the gates of the City are
shut up as we have already said. The streets also are shut up with grates
made for that purpose: But the streets are not alwaies shut up, nor in
all parts of the City, but only in some, and that upon some certain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and occurrences.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Twelfth</hi> is, that persons of honour and authority do beare great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
one to another, and it would be accounted a great disgrace for any
of them to quarrell with another openly. Hence it happeneth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
many times they have occasion of disgust and hatred, yet out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
they alwaies observe their <hi>Decorum;</hi> neither do they, upon this
account, avoyd any meetings that they might not come together.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Thirteenth</hi> is, that none do beare armes except the Souldiers, and
they only at their musters, or when they do accompany the <hi>Mandarines.</hi>
The common people, who contrariwise do easily quarrell one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
do make use only of their <hi>fists,</hi> and he that catcheth the other first
by the haire gaineth the battell; nay, if they have any thing in their hands,
that might draw bloud, as a staffe, a piece of wood or iron, or such like
thing, presently they lay it downe, and go to it with their <hi>fists.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourteenth</hi> is, that the whores and curtezans, who are many times
the causes of great disorders, do lodge without the walls, neither is any
of them suffered to dwell within. They have no particular houses, but
many of them live together with a man, who hath the care and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them, and is obliged to give an account of any disorder that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
out in their lodgings.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fifteenth</hi> is, that they forbid all commerce with strangers within
the Kingdom, least they might infect them with new customes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and disturbe their ancient way of government, which is a law, that
was in part observed also by the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> upon the very same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
Yet they have never prohibited <hi>Embassadours</hi> from other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and accordingly many are received, who are sent from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Kings: only they lay this obligation upon them, that when they
are arrived at the first City of the Kingdom, they are to stay there, where
the Magistrates do treate them with all honour and respect, and presently
give the King advice of their arrivall, who sendeth them leave to come to
the Court, without which licence, they are not permitted to go forward.
When they are come to Court, they are lodged in a particular <hi>Palace,</hi>
whence they may not go out, but in the manner we have above related.</p>
                     <p>Above all, they have their certain laws, statutes, and ordinances, by
which both they and their Kingdom are governed. These are of two sorts,
The first consisteth in ancient rites, customes and ceremonies, common
to the whole Kingdom, and are contained in five <hi>Bookes,</hi> and are esteemed
to be, as it were Sacred. Of the second sort are the laws of the Kingdom,
according to which, Justice is administred in particular cases, both civill
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64464:86"/>
and criminall, concerning all that is to be observed in the execution of
them. These are likewise very ancient, and are all founded upon those
five <hi>Cardinall vertues,</hi> so much esteemed by their <hi>Ancestours,</hi> and which
are at this day held in great veneration among them, that is, <hi>Gin, Y, Li,
Chi, Sin: Pietie, Iustice, Policie, Prudence</hi> and <hi>Fidelitie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gin,</hi> say they, signifieth <hi>Pietie, Humanitie, Charitie, Reverence, Love</hi> and
<hi>Compassion.</hi> Which they expliane after this manner, To esteeme ones selfe
lesse than others, To be affable, To succour those that are afflicted, To help
those that are in necessitie, To have a tender and compassionate heart, To
beare good will to all men, and, To use all this more particularly toward
their parents, sustaining them while they are in health, and taking care to
have them cured while they are sick, serving them while they live, and
honouring them with funerall obsequies, when they are dead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Y,</hi> according to their exposition, is <hi>Iustice, Equalitie, Integritie, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention
in things reasonable and just.</hi> In this manner the Judge is to give
every man his owne. The rich man, To take heed he be not proud of his
wealth, and, To give some part of it to the poore, To worship heaven, To
respect the earth, Not to be contentious, Not to be obstinate, To yeeld to
what is just and conformable to reason.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Li,</hi> they say, is <hi>Policie, Courtesie,</hi> to honour and reverence others as is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
which consisteth, In the mutuall respect one man is to beare another,
In the mature consideration &amp; circumspection, which is to be used in the
ordering of their affaires, In the modestie of their outward deportment,
In obedience to the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> In being affable to young men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectfull
to old men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chi,</hi> signifieth <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> the which they place, In reading of
bookes, In learning of Sciences, In being perfect in the liberall arts, To be
learned in matters of Antiquitie, To be well versed in the knowledge of
moderne affaires, To observe well what is past, thereby to better regulate
the present and future occasions, To discerne right from wrong.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sin,</hi> they say, is <hi>Fidelitie</hi> and <hi>Veritie.</hi> It consisteth in a sincere heart and
a reall intention, To do only that which is good, To imitate what is just, To
make their works and words agree, and that which is hidden within, to
that which appeareth outwardly.</p>
                     <p>According to this distribution of their doctrine, they reduce the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
to five orders of persons, correlative to one another in what
concerneth the observance and duty of each, that is, the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
Father</hi> and <hi>Sonne, Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife, Elder Brothers</hi> and <hi>Younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
and <hi>Friends one to another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>King</hi> is to observe toward his <hi>Subjects, Vigilancie, Love</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie,</hi>
and the <hi>Subjects</hi> toward the <hi>King, Loyalty, Reverence,</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi>
The <hi>Father</hi> toward his <hi>Children, Love</hi> and <hi>Compassion. They</hi> toward their
<hi>Father, Obedience</hi> and <hi>Pietie.</hi> The <hi>Husband</hi> toward the <hi>Wife, Love</hi> and <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
She</hi> toward her <hi>Husband, Fidelitie, Respect,</hi> and <hi>Complacency.</hi> The
<hi>Elder Brothers</hi> toward the <hi>Younger, Love</hi> and <hi>Instruction.</hi> The <hi>Younger</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>Elder,</hi> that is, to all their brothers that are elder than they, <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
and <hi>Respect. Friends</hi> toward one another <hi>Fidelitie, Truth</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:64464:87"/>
This is the manner of living, which they observed in ancient times, and
in the golden age: when their lawes were few, and they that gave <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to them many, being all founded upon the light and principalls of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as is yet to be seen in their books, expressed almost in the same
termes they are in ours: when men took no pleasure in governing, but
retired from the Court, and left their government, if they saw the people
were not profited by their authoritie and example, or that Kings did not
moderate themselves by their admonitions; and so withdrew themselves
to their owne possessions, which they tilled with their owne hands, as I
have already touched in another place.</p>
                     <p>But after that <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Avarice</hi> prevailed over <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Interest</hi> had blinded <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Generositie,</hi> this manner of living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to decay, and lawes to encrease: the new <hi>Princes</hi> changing some,
moderating others, and adding many, especially <hi>Humvù,</hi> the first of this
familie which raigneth at present, who finding the Kingdome, by having
been some years under the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> to have changed many
of their ancient customes, for those of strangers, wholly altered the form
of government, and reduced the Kingdom, which was formerly divided
among many <hi>Princes,</hi> into fifteen <hi>Provinces</hi> and one <hi>Sole Monarch:</hi> whence
he was constrained to make new lawes, having notwithstanding alwaies
regard unto the ancient ones.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the <hi>Chinesse</hi> have their Commandements, and in some <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi>
they print them very well, and stick them up on the posts of their
doores towards the street; I believe they are not very ancient, and have
some correspondence with our Decalogue, as <hi>Not to kill, Not to steale,
Not to lie, To Honour their Father and Mother,</hi> &amp;c. And in this point of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
their Parents,</hi> we have much to learne of the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> as also all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nations, who, in my judgement, are all exceeded in this, by <hi>China.</hi>
Many excellent ancient things about <hi>Honouring their Parents,</hi> are to this
day growne out of use, not in their speaking and writing, but in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of them, wherein they are now too negligent. But there are others,
which although anciently they were better ordered, yet are to this day in
force and vigour enough, and are exactly observed from the <hi>King</hi> even to
the meanest <hi>Plebeian,</hi> not only in sustaining their <hi>Parents,</hi> making much of
them, and having a speciall care of them, and so much the greater, by how
much the elder they are, but by respecting of them also with an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reverence and submission, and this, what degree, age, and condition
soever their children are in.</p>
                     <p>The King himselfe, on certain daies of the year, visiteth his <hi>Mother,</hi> who
is seated on a Throne, and, foure times on his feet, and foure times on his
knees, he maketh her a profound reverence, bowing his head even to the
ground. The same custome is also observed through the greatest part of
the Kingdom, and if by chance any one be negligent, or deficient in this
duty, toward his <hi>Parents,</hi> they complaine to the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> who punish
such offenders very severely.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the respect lesse, which they beare their <hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Tutours.</hi>
And if <hi>Alexander</hi> could say, that we owe more to our <hi>Masters,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
us, than to our <hi>Parents</hi> who beget us, it seemeth to me, that in <hi>China</hi>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:64464:87"/>
only this duty is understood, and discharged as it ought to be: for besides
the respect, which, during their whole life, they professe to their <hi>Masters,</hi>
they are never wanting at certain times to make them presents; and when
they are advanced to degrees and offices, they conferre on their <hi>Masters</hi>
very considerable benefits and favours.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Old men</hi> also in this Kingdom have their place and advantage, the
<hi>Chinesses</hi> honouring them no lesse than they were anciently esteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they meet together, although there be some of the company,
who are of greater <hi>Nobilitie</hi> (if they have not a dignitie or office; for these
alwaies keep their place,) the <hi>Old men</hi> have the precedence, and the young
men upon all occasions pay them great respect. The Magistrates do them
honour publickly, especially, when they are not only <hi>Old</hi> in years,
but also in vertue and good life, having lived without scandall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
and particularly, if they have never been cited into any Court,
not accused of any crime, which among them is taken for a <hi>Testimony</hi> of
very great probitie and goodnesse: hence came their proverb, which saith
<hi>Xin Pu Kien, Quonzieu Xita Pao,</hi> that is, <hi>The man who hath never seen a

                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> Have spoken briefly of the Kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> the people, their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
and manners, as well as I have been able, in regard I am at this
present out of the Country, and deprived of the use of their books, out of
which I might have taken many things of worth and curiositie. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64464:88"/>
that at this time I cannot say all that is to be said of any thing, it will
not be amisse, to say something of all, and therefore I will now speak of
the other nations, who live among them.</p>
                     <p>In describing the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Cantone,</hi> I said that the Island of <hi>Haynam,</hi>
which is very great, and wholly appertaineth unto <hi>China,</hi> is divided into
two parts: the first, which is neerest to the continent, is, on the North part
thereof, inhabited by <hi>Chinesses,</hi> and governed by them: the other, which
lieth toward the <hi>South,</hi> upon the confines of <hi>Chochin, China,</hi> is inhabited
by a barbarous people, who have their particular language, and their laws
and customes different, without medling at all with the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> unlesse it
be in some things of commerce.</p>
                     <p>I said also, that between the <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Chincheo, Cantone,</hi> and <hi>Kiamsi,</hi>
there are certain Mountaines which unite them, as in <hi>Catalogna</hi> the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of <hi>Monferrat</hi> do unite that Province to the Kingdome of <hi>Arragon;</hi>
and how within those Mountaines there was a small Kingdome, which
was likewise Governed by it selfe, not admitting any thing from the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
except Physicians, Medicines, and some little traffique.</p>
                     <p>Beside these in the Province of <hi>Yunnan,</hi> which is very large, lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>South,</hi> in the latitude of 24 degrees, there is a great Countrie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by a particular people, who use another language and other cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.
They have a little King called by the <hi>Chinesses, Thu Quon,</hi> a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darine</hi>
of earth, they pay tribute to the King of <hi>China,</hi> they use traffique, and
live in peace.</p>
                     <p>The same things hath been said of the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Que, Ciheu,</hi> where,
in the confines thereof, there is a people, who have their particular heads,
and Governours, without any other dependance on the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> than
the Investiture of the Title, by which they are called.</p>
                     <p>There are moreover in <hi>China, Moors</hi> in great abundance, not in all the
Provinces, nor in every City, but yet in the more principall. They speak
the language of the Countrie, and know nothing of their own tongue, a
few words only excepted. They are acquainted also with many things of
the holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Nankim</hi> I found one, who was born and bred in that Citie, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
to me <hi>David, Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> as distinctly as I could do
my self. In their <hi>Physiognomie,</hi> nose,, eyes, beard and face, they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
like the <hi>Chinesses.</hi> They are Merchants, Physicians &amp;c. They
have Offices in the <hi>Tribunals:</hi> they study and are admitted to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and come many times to be <hi>Mandarines,</hi> but not of the great ones:
for the most part they stop at the degree of <hi>Licentiate.</hi> Commonly where
they live, there are Beef-Shambles, because they eat no Pork, therefore
wheresoever they are, they kill and sell Beef; and it seemeth to me to be
the greatest advantage the Country ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h by them; for where they are not,
there is Seldome any of that flesh to be sould. They have their publick
<hi>Mosches</hi> allowed them by the King, They follow their own religion, but
not very exactly. They, who arrive at the degree of <hi>Litterato,</hi> or to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of some Office, do not much care to be advanced higher.</p>
                     <p>They preserve their Nation entire, by marrying with one another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
sometimes they take <hi>Chinesse</hi> Women for their Wives; but they
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64464:88"/>
never give their Daughters in marriage to the Sonnes of <hi>Chinesses.</hi> The
reason is, because in <hi>China</hi> the wife followeth the husband, she is brought
to her husbands-Fathers house, there she liveth and followeth his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
therefore when a <hi>Gentile</hi> is brought to the house of a <hi>Moor,</hi> she becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a <hi>Moor,</hi> and a <hi>Moorish</hi> Woman being brought to the house of a <hi>Gentile,</hi>
must infallibly become a <hi>Gentile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chinesses</hi> despise them as being strangers, and call them <hi>Hociteu
Hoci Hoci.</hi> The letters, with which they write their name, hath no other
signification, but only proper to expresse that people, neverthelesse they
are very angry and grieved, when they are called by it. The name by
which they call themselves is <hi>Kia Muen,</hi> that is, <hi>the gate of Instructions.</hi> If
they be despised of the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> they no lesse despise them, because they
worship Idols, and are <hi>Gentiles:</hi> and thus the one is not behind hand with
the other. In the City of <hi>Nankim</hi> they have, as it were a mount of <hi>Pietie,</hi>
or <hi>Lombard,</hi> with which they help only those of their Nation, but not
those, who are Prisoners for their misdeeds and wickednesse.</p>
                     <p>They came into <hi>China</hi> about 700 years since being called from <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questan,</hi>
by the King of that time, to aid him against a rebellion that was
then in the Kingdome, wherein they had so good successe, that they who
were willing to remain there, were allowed to enjoy the same priviledge
with the natives of the Country; since which time they have so multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that at this time there are many thousands of them. Afterwards in the
warre which King <hi>Hum</hi> had with the <hi>Tartars</hi> about 300 yeares since,
they took his part and came in, to his assistance; at which time the King
gaining the victorie they grew into greater esteem and were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to take part in the government of the Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>We have already spoken of the entrie which is made into <hi>China,</hi> every
three and every five years, with an <hi>Embassie</hi> and presents to the King; and
though they are all <hi>Moores,</hi> yet they are of severall Countries and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and very rarely any of them remain in <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are likewise <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> although at this time no great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them: but when, or how they came thither I am not able to say.
Anciently there was greater store of them, but they have been diminished
by little and little, many of them turning <hi>Moors.</hi> There live more of them
in the Province of <hi>Honan,</hi> in the capitall City thereof, called <hi>Cai Fum Fu,</hi>
than in any other place. They have there a <hi>Synagogue,</hi> well built and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
in the fashion of a great Chappel, and set out with curtaines. They
say they have there a very ancient Hebrew Bible. Father <hi>Iulius Alenes,</hi>
one of our company, was among them for some time: they shewed him
their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> but would not draw their curtaines and let him see the
Bible. Father <hi>Matthaens Riccius</hi> affirmeth, that according to the relation
which the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves made to him thereof in <hi>Pekim,</hi> it was not at
all differing from ours. They have no knowledge at all of <hi>Christ,</hi> so that
it seemeth, they were entred into <hi>China</hi> before he came into the World;
or at least, if they have ever heard of him, the memorie of it is quite lost:
and therefore it would be of great consequence to see their <hi>Bible:</hi> for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they have not corrupted it, as our Jews have done, to obscure the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of our <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:64464:89"/>
These, as they are in no great number, so it is not probable they should
long preserve themselves. They who at the Court had some discourse
with our Fathers, did much lament that they had lost themselves for
want of the <hi>Hebrew Tongue,</hi> and by the little knowledge they had of their
law, and said, that after some time they should all become either <hi>Moores</hi> or
<hi>Gentiles:</hi> that the ruler of their Synagogue at that time was a decrepit old
man, and his sonne, who was to succeed him in his Office, young and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the things of their law, and that indeed there were very few among
them, who were zealous observers of it.</p>
                     <p>Moreover these <hi>Iews</hi> did seem to be much troubled and weary of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> laid upon some ceremonies of their law, which
is a sign they have no great affection for it: as, their not eating of Swines
flesh, their not touching a beast, which hath been killed by the hand of a
Gentile, but especially the circumcising their Infants on the eighth day;
which their wives and <hi>Chinesse</hi> kindred tell them, is a <hi>cruell and barbarous
thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At this time we have, in that City of <hi>Cai Funifú</hi> a house and Church;
and (when I left that Kingdome) a good number of Christians, which
daily encreased, not without hope also, that some good may be done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those Jews, who being so ready to change their religion, will more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
embrace the true one, which hath more conformitie to theirs, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other.</p>

                     <p>IT hath alwayes been a well grounded opinion, that the <hi>Christian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
hath been very anciently planted in <hi>China, Paulus Venetus</hi> making
a relation of that Countrie (from whence it is certain that he went many
daies journey into the Countrie of the <hi>Tartars</hi>) assureth us, that in that
time there were a great number of <hi>Christians in China,</hi> who had very sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Churches, and named the Cities where they lived. He wrot this
with very much truth; for of all that which he mentioneth, there are yet
remaining many houses, and in other places the ruines of them, as a <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi>
of it.</p>
                     <p>To this may be added the <hi>Testimonie</hi> of other grave Authours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we read, that the preaching of the <hi>Gospell</hi> penetrated as farre as <hi>China,</hi>
by the <hi>Ministrie</hi> of the <hi>Apostle St. Thomas</hi> and his <hi>Disciples.</hi> Among other
writings, out of which this may be drawn, the <hi>Chalde</hi> books concerning
the <hi>Indian Christianitie</hi> cultivated by the meanes of the said Apostle, are of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64464:89"/>
no small moment, the which it is certain, are to this day preserved and
kept in the <hi>Arch-Bishoprick</hi> of <hi>Granganour,</hi> or <hi>Della Serra,</hi> (that is of the
Mountaines) as it is vulgarly called; translated out of that language by
order of the Arch-bishop thereof <hi>Franciscus Ros,</hi> by the pains and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of one of our fathers, who was very skilfull in that tongue. The trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is in Latin, but that it may be more generally understood, we will
turne what is cited out of it, into the vulgar.</p>
                     <p>One of these books is a Breviary, which, in one of the lessons belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the second nocturnall, hath these words.</p>
                     <p>By the means of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> the errours of the Idolatry of the Indians were
dissipated. By the meanes of <hi>St. Thomas</hi> the <hi>Chinesses</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians</hi>
were converted to the truth. By the meanes of <hi>St. Thomas</hi> they obtained the
vertue of <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Adoption of Sonnes.</hi> By the meanes of <hi>St Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
they believed in the <hi>Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost.</hi> By the meanes of
<hi>St. Thomas</hi> they kept that faith, which they had promised to God. By the

By the meanes of <hi>St. Thomas</hi> the Kingdome of Heaven flew and entred

<hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> there is a <hi>Canon</hi> of the Patriark <hi>Theodotius,</hi>
which hath these words;</p>
                     <p>In like manner also the Bishops of the great Province, such as are for the most

                     <p>After the arrivall of the <hi>Portugheses</hi> into <hi>Cocchine,</hi> the governour of the

of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>China:</hi> as did also <hi>Don Giuseppe,</hi> who died at Rome.
These were the <hi>Ancient Titles</hi> of that Church; and being taken al toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are strong arguments, that the Christian Religion did formerly flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These were the powerfull motives, that did engage us, after our arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
thither, with much care and fervour to trace the ruines and footsteps
of that <hi>Ancient Christianitie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Histories of that Kingdome, which we have very diligently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used,
we found no mention thereof, to our great admiration, knowing
well, how curious and diligent Inquisitours the <hi>Chinesses</hi> are in the affaires
of their owne Countrie, that they might eternize the memory of them. It
is true, we had information, that there were some in those parts, who did
reverence the <hi>Crosse</hi> and made the signe of it over their meat, without
knowing the reason why they did it. When I was in the capitall City of
<hi>Kiamsi,</hi> I was informed by a <hi>Christian,</hi> that in the little Towne of <hi>Tamo,
Xan,</hi> which was not farre off, there were some, who when they went out
of doores, did make the signe of the <hi>Crosse</hi> upon their forehead, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked the reason of that custome, they answered only, that they had
learnt it of their <hi>Ancestours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Court of <hi>Pekim,</hi> some of our fathers being one day to visit a Jew,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64464:90"/>
he discoursed more particularly to them concerning this matter, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to them the places and families, who did practise this signing with
the <hi>Crosse.</hi> We sent a brother of our society thither, with this informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but with all the diligence he could use, he was not able to discover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing of what he sought for, whether it were that they had a suspicion
of him, or that really this custom, or those families were extinct. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Jew did still affirme, That there were anciently many
of these, who did reverence the <hi>Crosse,</hi> particularly in the Northern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and that having gained a great reputation by their skill in learning
and armes, they did cause the <hi>Chinesses</hi> to have a great suspicion of them,
so that thinking themselves no longer safe, they dispersed themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
severall places: others who remained behind, dissembled the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they had professed: others became, either Moores or Jewes, and by
this means they came to be extinguished. This, as the Jew said, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
50 years before, and it is now about 30 years since he made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p>During these thirtie years, we have gone about all <hi>China,</hi> and founded
Churches in severall of the biggest Towns, planting the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi>
and using all diligence to discover this truth, without having been able to
obtain our purpose in the least. It is true, we sound a small Bell, such as
is used at Masse, with Greeke letters round about it, and a <hi>Crosse</hi> very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
graved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this may have been brought in lately from other parts,
upon some occasion, such as fall out often in that Countrie: as it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
probable, that book of Esops Fables in latin did, bound up after our
manner, which I saw in the Province of <hi>Nankim.</hi> We then, considering on
one side the great scarcitie of evident signes for the proving a thing of so
great importance, &amp; which was Authorized by so many pens and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
reasons, it was no marvell, if we were in doubt, and perplexitie: and
on the other side holding the thing for infallible, as really it is, we made
use of some other waies, to finde out other reasons and motives, why we
thus failed of all manifest signes, different from what the <hi>Iew</hi> had told us,
discoursing with our selves in this manner.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Tartars</hi> conquered <hi>China</hi> there were many <hi>Christians,</hi> who
had sumptuous Churches, being much favoured by them, as appeareth by
the relation of <hi>Paulus Venetus.</hi> Afterward when <hi>Humvù</hi> endeavoured to

part with the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> and lent them their assistance for the gaining of
the Kingdom, and of the victory which they obtained, in acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof they were allowed to remaine in <hi>China,</hi> with libertie of
their Religion and of their <hi>Mosches.</hi> The <hi>Christians</hi> inclined to the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
and they being overcome in that warre, the <hi>Christians</hi> also were deprived
of their <hi>Estates,</hi> and some being slain, others changing their Religion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
flying and hiding themselves in secret places, in a short time, all signe
and memory of our Religion perished, so that it was not possible for us
to discover any thing, with all the diligence we used to that purpose.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, we remained very disconsolate in the midst of so great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
when it pleased <hi>The only fountaine of light to draw us out of this obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
with a most clear Testimony, that the Gospel had flourished there many ages

graved on the Sepulchre of the Apostle S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the Towne of <hi>Melia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por,</hi>
and as they were anciently painted in <hi>Europe,</hi> of which there are some
yet to be seen at this day.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Crosse</hi> is encompassed, as it were, with certain clouds, and at the
foot thereof were three Traverse lines, each consisting of three great let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being all such as are commonly used in <hi>China,</hi> very fairly graven:
with the same sort of letters is engraven the whole <hi>Superficies</hi> of the stone,
as also the thicknesse thereof, the which notwithstanding differeth from
the rest, in that some of the letters graven thereon, are forraine, neither
were they knowne here at the first finding of it.</p>
                     <p>Scarcely had the <hi>Chinesses</hi> discovered and cleansed this notable piece of
Antiquitie, when excited by the fervour of their naturall curiosity, they
ranne to the Governour to give him notice of it, who being much joyed
at this newes, presently came to see it, and caused it to be placed upon a
faire Pedestall; under a small Arch, sustained by pillars at each end thereof,
and open at the sides, that it might be both defended from the injuries of
the weather, and also feast the eyes of such as are true Lovers of venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Antiquity. He caused it also to be set within the circuit of a Temple
belonging to the <hi>Bonzi,</hi> not farre from the place where it was taken up.</p>
                     <p>There was a wonderfull concourse of people to see this stone, partly
for the Antiquity thereof, and partly for the novelty of the strange Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
which was to be seen thereon: and as the knowledge of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is at this day very much spread abroad in <hi>China,</hi> a <hi>Gentile,</hi> who was a
great friend unto a grave Christian <hi>Mandarine</hi> named <hi>Leo,</hi> being present
there, presently understood the mystery of that writing, and believing, it
would be very acceptable to his friend, sent him a copy thereof, although
he was distant above a month and a halfes voyage, the <hi>Mandarine</hi> dwelling
in the City of <hi>Ham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

reason of the former persecution, whereof we shall speak in its proper

for no lesse was contained in this writing, as we shall shew anon.</p>
                     <p>Three years after in the year 1628 some of our fathers went into that
Province in the company of a <hi>Christian Mandarine,</hi> who had occasion to
go thither. They founded a Church and house in the capitall City there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
for the service of our good God, that he, who was pleased to discover
so precious a memoriall of the possession taken in that Country by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
law, would also facilitate the restitution thereof in the same place. It
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64464:91"/>
was my good fortune to be one of the first, and I esteemed it a happy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode,
in that I had the opportunity to see the stone; and being arrived I
took no thought for any thing else. I saw it and read it, and went often to
read, behold, and consider it at leisure, and above all, I did much admire,
that being so ancient, it should be so entire, and have the letters so plainly
and neatly graven.</p>
                     <p>On the thicknes of the sides thereof, it hath many <hi>Chinesse</hi> letters, which
containe many names of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> of that time. There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
many other letters, which were not then knowne, for they are neither
Hebrew nor Greek:<note place="margin">See the Syriack inscription ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by Kirkes in his Prodrom: Copt cap. 3. pag. 73.</note> and (for as much as I now understand) they containe
the same names, that if peradventure some strangers, might not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the letters of the Countrie, they might perhaps be better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with those of a forraigne extraction.</p>
                     <p>Passing by <hi>Cocchine</hi> I came to <hi>Cranganor,</hi> where is the <hi>Residence</hi> of the
<hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Costa,</hi> to consult about these letters with father <hi>Antoni Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandes</hi>
one of our societie, who is very skilfull in the books and writings
of those ancient Christians converted by S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> He told me the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

spirituall speaking of time past, he is without beginning, and of time to come he
is without end, and alwaies in the same perfection. He tooke nothing, and with
it he made all. He is a principall, consisting of <hi>Trinitie</hi> and <hi>Unitie,</hi> yet without
any reall principle. The Lord <hi>Olooyu.</hi> He made the foure parts of the world in
figure of a <hi>Crosse.</hi> He moved the <hi>Chaos</hi> and made the two principles. There
was an alteration made in the <hi>Abysse,</hi> and heaven and earth appeared. Nature
at the beginning was pure, and exempt from disordinate passions, and the heart
was cleane, without the unrulinesse of the appetites.</p>

with words the mischiefe he had plotted, perverted the innocence of the first man.
From this principle sprang 365 <hi>Sects,</hi> which by reason they were so many did
one drive away the other, and of all of them was made a net, wherein the world
was caught. Some chose the creatures and appropriated <hi>Divinity</hi> to them: others
were plunged in that errour of thinking that all is nothing, and ends in nothing.

His Ministers made use of the <hi>Holy Crosse,</hi> they made their abode no
more in one place than in another, that they might illuminate the whole world.
The world being thus reduced unto Union, men did walke after their example,
and (thus) did they open the way of life and glory.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>V.</hi> They suffered their beard to grow, and did shew by this means, that they
were like other men in their externall part. They out their haire, even to the roots,
upon the top of their head, and by this they shewed, that they had no internall
wordly affections. They kept no servants, the Noble and the common men were
with them the same thing. They tooke no riches from men. They gave to the
poore that which they had. They fasted and watched to bring the flesh into subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the spirit. Seaven times a day they offered sacrifices of praise, by which they
helped the living and the dead. Every seaventh day they did offer. They purified
their hearts to receive the holy innocence. The true law hath no name that doth
well suite with it, and that is able to explaine the excellency thereof; therefore
because it wanteth another name, we will call it <hi>The law of Brightnesse.</hi> The law,
if it be not holy, cannot be called great: and if holinesse be not answerable to that
which the law teacheth, it may not have that name. But in this law the holinesse
correspondeth to the law, and the law to the holinesse.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>VI.</hi> If there be not Kingly Persons to favour it, the law cannot well be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
if they receive not the law, they cannot grow truly great. When they and
the law do agree, presently the world is enlightened. By this means, at the time,
when a King named <hi>Tai Zum Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> Hoam</hi> did governe with famous prudence
and sanctitie, there came from Iudea a man of high vertue, by name <hi>Olopuen,</hi>
who being guided by the clouds brought the true doctrine. And in the year <hi>Chin
Quom Kieufu</hi> he arrived at the Court. The King commanded the <hi>Colao
Fam Kizulin,</hi> that he should go and meet him as farre as the West, and that he
should treate him as his guest with all manner of kindnesse. He caused this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
to be translated in his palace, and seeing the law to be true, he powerfully
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64464:92"/>
commanded it should be divulged through the Kingdome, and presently after,
he sent forth a royall patent, which contained that which followeth.</p>
                        <p>The true law hath no determinate name. The Ministers thereof go about in
every part to teach it unto the world, having no other aim, but to be profitable
to those that live in it. In the Kingdome of <hi>Tachin,</hi> this <hi>Olopuen,</hi> being a
man of great vertue, hath brought from so remote a Countrie Doctrines and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and is come to place them in our Kingdome. Having well examined
that which he proposeth, we find it to be very excellent, and without any
outward noise, and that it hath its principall Foundation even from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World: his doctrine is brief, neither doth he found his truth in
superficiall appearances; it bringeth with it the salvation and benefit of men:
wherefore I have thought it convenient, that it should be published through
our Empire.</p>
                        <p>He commanded the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of this Court of <hi>Nimfam,</hi> that they
should build there a great Church, with 21 Ministers weakening by that
meanes the Monarchie of <hi>Cheu Olao Fu,</hi> head of the sect of <hi>Tauzu:</hi> which
was carried in a black Chariot toward the West: so, the great <hi>Tam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enlightened together with <hi>Tao,</hi> the Holy Gospel came into <hi>China</hi> and
a little while after, the King commanded, that <hi>Olopuen</hi> his Picture should
be painted on the wals of the Temple, where it shineth, and his memorie
will alwayes shine in the World.</p>
                        <p>VII According to the records of the Empires of <hi>Ham</hi> and <hi>Guei</hi> the
Kingdome of <hi>Tachin</hi> bordereth Southward upon the red Sea, and North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
on the Mountaines of Pearls, Westward on the Forest <hi>Delle Fule
Per Li Santi,</hi> Eastward on the Countrie of <hi>Cham Fum,</hi> and the dead water.
The Countrie produceth a Lake Asphaltitis of fire, Balsome, Pearles and
Carbuncles: it hath no robbers, but all live in joyfull peace. The Gospel
only is allowed in that Kingdome: and honours are conferred only on
those that are vertuous. Their houses are great, and all is illustrious by their
order and good customes.</p>
                        <p>VIII The great Emperour <hi>Caozum,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Taizum,</hi> continued
with good <hi>decorum</hi> the intention of his Grand Father, enlarging and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the works of his Father. For he commanded, that in all his Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Churches should be built, and honours conferred on <hi>Olopuen,</hi> bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him the Title of Bishop of the great law; by which law he gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Kingdome of <hi>China</hi> in great peace, and the Churches filled the
whole countrie with the prosperitie of preaching.</p>
                        <p>IX In the year <hi>Xim Lie</hi> the <hi>Bonzi</hi> of the Sect of the <hi>Pagods</hi> using their
wonted violence, did blaspheme this new and holy law, in this place of
<hi>Tum Cheu:</hi> and in the year <hi>Sien Tien,</hi> some particular Persons in <hi>Sigan,</hi>
with laughter and disparagement did mock at it.</p>
                        <p>X Then one of the chief of the Priests, called John, and another of
great vertue, named <hi>Kie Lie,</hi> with some others of their Countrie, Priests
of great same, being disingaged from the things of the world, began to
take up again that excellent net, and to continue the thred, which was
now broken. King <hi>Hi venzum Chi Tao</hi> commanded five little Kings to
come in person to the happie house, and to set up Altars. Then in the year
<hi>Tien Pao,</hi> the pillar of the law, which had been cast down for a while began
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64464:92"/>
to grow great: King <hi>Taciam Kium</hi> gave command to <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>lie Sic</hi> that the
Pictures of five Kings his ancestours should be placed in the Churches,
with a hundred Presents to honour the solemnitie. Although the great
beards of the Dragon, were afarre off, yet could they lay hands on their
Bowes and their Swords. The brightnesse which floweth from these
Pictures, maketh seem, as if the Kings themselves were present. In
the third year of <hi>Tien Pao,</hi> the Priest <hi>Kieh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </hi> was in <hi>India,</hi> who guided by
the starres came to <hi>China,</hi> &amp; beholding the Sunne, came to the Emperour,
who commanded that <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and other <hi>Priests</hi> should be joyned
unto him, to exercise Holy works in <hi>Kim Kim,</hi> a place within the palace.
Then were hung up in Tables in the Churches the Kings letters richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned,
by publique order, with red and blew colours, and the Kings
pen filled the emptines: it mounted on high, and transcended the Sun;
his favours and donatives may be compared to the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of the South; and the abundance of his benefits is equall to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the eastern Sea Reason is not to be rejected; there is nothing which
the Saints cannot do; and their deeds are worthy of memorie. For this
cause king <hi>Sozun Ven Mim</hi> commanded, that Churches should be built in
this <hi>Limvu,</hi> and in five Cities. He was of an excellent nature, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Gate to the common prosperitie of the Kingdome, by which
meanes the affaires of the Empire began to flourish again.</p>
                        <p>XI King <hi>Taizum Venvu</hi> caused happie times to return again; doing things
without labour and trouble: alwayes at the feast of the nativitie of Christ
he sent Heavenly perfumes to the Royall Churches, to honour the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of this holy law. Truly, heaven giveth beautie and profit to the
world, and liberally produceth all things. This King imitated heaven, and
therefore he knew how to sustaine and nourish his subjects.</p>
                        <p>XII King <hi>Kien Chum Xim Xin Venvu</hi> used eight wayes of government
for to reward the good and chastise the wicked, and nine wayes to renew
the estate of the Gospel. Let us pray to God for him, without being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of it. He was a man of much vertue; humble, and desirous of
peace; and ready to forgive his neighbour, and to assist all men with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
These are the steps of our holy law: to cause the winds and the
raines to retire at their seasons: that the world should live in peace, men
be well governed, and affaires well established; that the living should
prosper, and the dead be in happinesse; all this proceeds from our Faith.</p>
                        <p>XIII The King gave many honourable Titles in his Court to the
Priest <hi>Y Su,</hi> a great Preacher of the Law, and also a garment of a red colour,
because he was peaceable, and took delight in doing good to all. He came
from afarre off into <hi>China,</hi> from the Country of <hi>Vam Xe Chi Chim.</hi> His
vertue surpassed our three famous Families; he enlarged the other sciences
perfectly. He served the King in the Palace, and afterward had his name
in the Royall book. The little King of <hi>Fuen Yam,</hi> who had the Title of
<hi>Chum Xulim,</hi> and called himself <hi>Cozuy,</hi> served at first in the warres of
these parts of <hi>Sofam.</hi> King <hi>Sozum</hi> commanded <hi>Y Su</hi> that he should assist
<hi>Cozuy</hi> very much above all the rest: neither did he for this change his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
custome; being the Nailes and Teeth of the Common-Wealth;
the Eyes and Eares of the Army. He knew well how to distribute his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64464:93"/>
he was not sparing in any thing: he offered a precious Gift, called
<hi>Poli,</hi> to the Church of this place of <hi>Lintiguen:</hi> he gave Golden Carpets
to that of <hi>Cie Ki.</hi> He repaired the old Churches, and established the
house of the law, adorning the chambers and galleries thereof, making
them shine like flying lights; he laid out his whole strength upon works of
charitie: every year he assembled the Priests of the foure Churches, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them with a good heart, and making them honourable entertainment
for the space of fifty daies; he sed the hungrie, cloathed the naked, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the sick, and buried the dead.</p>
                        <p>XIIII In the time of <hi>Ta So,</hi> with all his parsimonie, there was not such
goodnesse, as this to be seen: but in the time of this law we see such men,
who do such good works as these. For this reason have I graved this
Stone, that thereby they might be published.</p>
                        <p>I say then; that the true God had no beginning, but being pure and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
was alwayes after the same manner: he was the first <hi>Artificer</hi> of the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
he uncovered the earth, and elevated the Heaven. One of the three
Persons made himself man for our eternall salvation: he ascended like the
Sunne on high, and defeated darknesse: in every thing he did discover
the profound <hi>Truth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>XV The illustrious King, being really the first of the first, making
use of a fit time, put a stop to mens invention: the heaven was dilated, and
the earth extended. Most bright is our law: the which, when <hi>Tam</hi> came
to the Kingdome, and propagated the doctrine, and builded Churches,
was as a <hi>Barque,</hi> both for the living and the dead, and gave rest to the
whole world.</p>
                        <p>XVI <hi>Caozum</hi> following the example of his Grand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>Father, built new
Churches. The beautifull Temples of peace filled the whole earth.
The true law was illustrated; he gave a title of honour to the <hi>Bishop;</hi> and
men enjoyed repose.</p>
                        <p>XVII The wise King <hi>Hi Vin Zum</hi> followed the right way; the royal
Tables were illustrious; the Kingly letters shone therein. The Pictures of
the Kings gave light on high, and all the people did reverence them; and
all men had joy and gladnesse.</p>
                        <p>XVIII When <hi>So Zum</hi> reigned, he came in person to the Church. The
<hi>Holy Sunne</hi> did shine, and the bright cloudes swept away the darknesse of
the night: Prosperitie was united to the Royall family; misfortunes cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
the heat of dissentions was abated: he quieted the rumours, and he
renewed our Empire.</p>
                        <p>XIX King <hi>Taizun</hi> was obedient; in vertue equall to heaven and earth:
he gave life unto the people, and advancement to their affaires: he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
works of charitie; he offered perfumes to the Church. The <hi>Sunne</hi>
and <hi>Moone</hi> were united in his person.</p>
                        <p>XX When King <hi>Kien Chum</hi> reigned, he did illustrate famous vertue;
and with his armes restored peace to the foure seas: and with his learning
he pacified 10000 confines. As a torch he did enlighten the secrets of men,
he saw all things as in a glasse: He received the Barbarians, who all took
rules from him.</p>
                        <p>XXI The law is great and perfect, and extendeth it selfe to all things,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64464:93"/>
desiring to frame a name for it, I cannot but call it, <hi>The Divine Law.</hi> Kings
know best to dispose their affaires, I, who am a subject, can only cause
them to be recited on this rich stone, for to magnifie our great felicitie.</p>
                        <p>XXII In the Empire of great <hi>Tam,</hi> the second year of <hi>Kien Chum,</hi> the
seventh day of the Month of Autumne, was this stone erected. <hi>Nin Ciu</hi>

to the interpreter, this is an ancient fable of that Kingdom, which relateth,
That one of their Kings rid through the ayre mounted upon that beast,
which his subjects, who accompanied him, had laden with their armes,
but they which came after plucked off the beard of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and took
some of the armes; that these might remain by them as a memoriall of
that Prince, whom they did fancy to be present with them in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.
This fable might haply take its Orginall from the custome which
their Kings have, of embroydering <hi>Dragons</hi> on their garments, and other
things, which belong to them. <hi>The third year of Tien Pao</hi> &amp;c. falleth out,
according to our account, to be the year 745. <hi>Sozun Ven Mim,</hi> reigned in

                        <p>XIX <hi>The Sunne and Moone</hi> &amp;c. Signifieth, that all obeyed that King.</p>
                        <p>XXII <hi>Kien Chum,</hi> was the year 782. In the other <hi>Paragraphs</hi> whereon
we have made no <hi>Annotations,</hi> there is nothing of obscuritie to require it:</p>
                        <p>It appeareth then evidently, by the testimony of this venerable Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
that the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> was planted in <hi>China</hi> by the means above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
in the year of <hi>Christ 636,</hi> neverthelesse, it is not to be imagined, that it
was not formerly brought thither by the preaching of the Apostles, who
as the holy Scripture saith, did disperse themselves through the whole
earth: but, as it happened in severall other Countries, that after it had
once been propagated there by them, it came in time to be extinguished,
and was againe renued by the industry of others; so it fell out in <hi>India,</hi>
where S. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle had once preached the Gospel; but all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
thereof being lost, about the year 800. a rich <hi>Armenian Christian,</hi>
called <hi>Thomas</hi> the <hi>Canaanite</hi> restored the ancient Religion in the Citie of
<hi>Mogo Doven,</hi> or <hi>Patana,</hi> repairing the Churches, which had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
built by that holy Apostle; and erecting others. And upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the likenesse of their names, many have mistaken them to be all
built by the first <hi>Thomas.</hi> The same thing may probably have happened
in <hi>China,</hi> where the Gospel being received, presently after it, began to be
published to the world; and being afterward extinguished, it was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
again a second time, whereof this inscription maketh mention;
and lastly a third time, whereof we purpose to treat in the second part.
It seemeth necessarie thus to state the matter, that we may not derogate
from the Testimonie of those grave Authours, whom I have formerly
cited, how <hi>St. Thomas the Apostle</hi> did preach in <hi>China,</hi> and converted it
to the true Religion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="165" facs="tcp:64464:94"/>
The time wherein the memorie of the Holy Apostles preaching was
lost, was not much different both in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>China;</hi> for by severall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
it appeareth, that <hi>Thomas</hi> the <hi>Cananite</hi> renewed it in <hi>India</hi> in the
eighth Century after Christ; and by this stone it is manifest, that it was in
the seventh Centurie after Christ, when it was preached in <hi>China:</hi> and
therefore without much difficultie it may be Concluded, that this was not
the first establishment of the Christian Religion there; but rather a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment
of it.</p>

conquest thereof, together with his hereditary spirit; which his sonnes and

this place; and it is now about fifty years that they have kept it with
many labours, travels, persecutions, imprisonments, <hi>Bastinadoes,</hi> and in a

the standard of the Christian faith is set up in the Kingdomes of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
and by means whereof (together with the grace of God,) so many
men have been converted unto Christianitie, as you shall finde in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

                     <p>After my returne into <hi>Europe,</hi> and that my intention of seeking Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
for this vine-yard was once divulged, presently there were so many
pretenders, who made suit to me to be received, that there is scarce a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of our society, from whence I have not received many letters from
severall of the fathers, wherein they did not only offer themselves, but
made it their most earnest request, that I would accept of them, to serve as
Souldiers in this enterprise; as if the trouble and paines they were to suffer
in these long and dangerous voyages, and the persecutions they are so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to undergo in this exercise, were to this undertaking, as the prickles
are to Roses, whereof S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, That they are <hi>Amatoria quaedam il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectamenta.</hi>
And in the Province of <hi>Portugall,</hi> as being most conveniently
scituated for this voyage, only out of the two Colledges of <hi>Conimbra</hi> and
<hi>Ebora,</hi> I had a list of 90 persons, all so ready and desirous to labour in this
<hi>Mission,</hi> that many of them, not being content to declare their desires by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64464:96"/>
ordinary words written with pen and inke, have sent me very long letters
concerning their holy pretention, all written and signed with thier owne
blood, witnessing in this manner, that they had a holy courage, that could
despise the threats of Martyrdom; offering cheerfully to the Lord that
little blood, as a Testimony of the great desire they had to shed it all for
his sake.</p>
                     <p>Who now can doubt, whether these be not the marvellous effects of
that spirit and zeale which <hi>Franciscus Xaverius</hi> communicated to them, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioning
inwardly in the breast of each of them; that which a little while
since he did outwardly in that great Champion <hi>Marcellus Spinellus,</hi> by
sending him to <hi>Giappon,</hi> where he crowned that glorious enterprise with
his blood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sancian</hi> is one of those many Islands, which, on that side, give a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Kingdom of <hi>China:</hi> it is a high mountain covered with trees,
and though very pleasant, yet un-inhabited. When the <hi>Portughesses</hi> first
began their trade with <hi>China,</hi> this Island served them for a Port, and there
they built houses with straw, like huts, which served them only for the
time of their Negotiation, &amp; whilest they expected their merchandise; but
as soone as that came, they abandoned that habitation, and presently setting
saile, returned into <hi>India.</hi> Foure and fiftie miles from thence, more within
the Kingdom, there is another Island named <hi>Gau Xan,</hi> and by the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghesses
Macao,</hi> it is but small, and so full of rocks, that it is very easie to be
defended, and very opportune for the rendevous of <hi>Pyrats</hi> and robbers; as
indeed it was at that time, when many of them having got together in that
place, did much infest all the Islands thereabouts. The <hi>Chinesses</hi> were in
consultation how they might remedy that mischiefe, but whether it was
that they wanted courage to undertake it, or that they chose rather to
have it done without running any danger themselves, and at other mens
cost, knowing well the valour of the <hi>Portughesses,</hi> they set them upon the
enterprise, promising them, that if they could drive out the <hi>Pyrats,</hi> it should
be granted to them for an habitation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Portughesses</hi> accepted of the condition with much pleasure and
contentment: and though they were but few and much inferiour in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to the <hi>Pyrats,</hi> neverthelesse being more skilfull in military affaires, they
put themselves in order, and set upon them with so much courage, that
without the losse of one man on their owne party, though with great
slaughter of the enemie, they presently became Masters, both of the field
and Island. They began presently upon this to build, every one taking
that place and ground which seemed good to him: But that which cost
nothing at first, came after to be sold very deare, and at so high a rate at
this present, that it would hardly be beleeved, how much the least piece
of ground to build on in that City would cost. For, trade beginning to
faile every where in <hi>India,</hi> doth here encrease still every day, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
are growne so rich, that the covetousnesse of the Hollanders
have made them have a great longing to it, and did once attempt to
take it.</p>
                     <p>In the moneth of <hi>Iune 1622.</hi> Fourteen saile of Hollanders came into
that Port, with so much resolution and assurance to take that City, that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64464:96"/>
they had already divided (in their thoughts) the principall parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
among themselves, and many Captaines and old Souldiers came along
in this Fleet, only out of hopes to have their former services paid them
here, and to settle themselves in a condition of ease and plenty after all the
hardships they had endured. They landed 700 men on Midsomer Eve, 300
of them staid upon the shore to guard the Cannon, the other 400 having
drawn up themselves into a squadron, went to the Hill of our <hi>Lady della
Guida,</hi> marching towards the Citie with so great order and cheerfulnesse,
as if they had the victorie already in their hands.</p>
                     <p>They were no sooner discovered from the Mountain of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> but they
were received with two or three salutes from the cannon on that side, so
well levelled, that beginning to abate of their fury, they left the direct
way toward the Citie, and turned on the left hand toward the Mountain
of our <hi>Ladie del buon porto:</hi> and because there was a Garrison there, they
kept off about twice Musket-shot, and fortified themselves on the sides of
the Hill where <hi>St. Maries Church</hi> stands. But the <hi>Portughesses</hi> discharged
upon them so seasonably, and with so much valour and courage, that they
put them to flight, and made them run down the hill toward the Sea,
where the other Souldiers stood by the ships. They fled in so
much disorder and confusion, that although there were above
300. there to guard their Artillerie, who did succour them with
fresh Men, and encourage them to face about, yet all was in vain,
and so both the one and the other forced to runne into the water up to the
chin, to get into their boates: and these scaped well; for many went over
head and eares; and a barque by reason of the confusion and disorder of
those that got into her, sunk down right, and above 400 men were drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
The number of the wounded, is not known; but it is conjectured, they
could not be few: for whilest they embarqued, our Muskettiers, who
stood upon a hill just over them, played continually upon them. Of the
<hi>Portugheses</hi> there were slain only three or four, and some Servants. <hi>The
Hollanders</hi> being ill satisfied with this entertainment, presently set saile, and
durst never since hazard themselves upon the like enterprise.</p>
                     <p>This was the cause of fortifying the Town of <hi>Macao,</hi> with a wall round
about it, having six <hi>Bulwarks:</hi> that of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> which serveth as a cittaddell,
standing higher than the Town, having fifteen pieces of Cannon, a Court
of Guard, and a Castellan belonging to it. That of the Port, having four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
piece of cannon, among which are six great ones, that carry each of
them a ball of 50 pound weight, and another Court of Guard. The third
Bulwark is that of our <hi>Ladie del buon porto,</hi> with eight piece of cannon.
The fourth, that of <hi>St. Francis</hi> toward the Mountain, with other eight piece
of Cannon. The fift is, that of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> with five piece of Cannon. The
sixt is, that of <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> with three piece of Cannon. And because the
Mountain of our <hi>Ladie della Guida</hi> commandeth both the Bulwark of <hi>St.
Paul</hi> and the Citie, it was fortified in the year 1637 in the same manner as
the Rock of <hi>Charil</hi> is: it hath ten great brasse Cannon.</p>
                     <p>The Citie is not great, there are in it about 900 or 1000 <hi>Portughesses,</hi>
who are all rich, and live very splendidly: there are many <hi>Chiness</hi>
Christians, who are cloathed, and live after the <hi>Portughesse</hi> fashion; there
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64464:97"/>
are also <hi>Chineses</hi> who are <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and are cloathed, and live after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion

last sort, as also the Shop-keepers and Retailers &amp;c. and are in all about
5 or 6000.</p>
                     <p>There resideth also in the same Citie an Auditor, who is sent thither by
the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and is superintendent of the traffique and commerce
of that Isle. The trade with <hi>Giappon</hi> (not to speak of that of <hi>Manila,</hi> which
is worth very much) yeeldeth the King every year, for his rights and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
at ten <hi>per cent.</hi> many thousands of Crownes <hi>per annum.</hi> In the
year 1635 it was worth to him 14000 <hi>Taus,</hi> which are better than Crowns.</p>
                     <p>The Citie spendeth every year, one year with another, in their Artillerie,
Gunpowder, and the charges of their walls, and other things belonging
to their Militia, (as appeareth by the books of publique accounts) above
40000 Crownes.</p>
                     <p>The rights and customes of the Faire of <hi>Cantone,</hi> at 6 and 7 <hi>per cent.</hi>
importeth about 40 or 50000 Crowns. The Navigation to <hi>Giappon</hi> with
the Present which is sent to the King, and other Presents to the <hi>Toni</hi> of that
Island, costeth between twenty and five and twenty thousand Crownes.
Their house of <hi>Mercy</hi> standeth them every year in 8 or 9 thousand
Crownes. They mantain two Hospitals, three parish Churches, five Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
foure of Men and one of Women, besides the continuall Almes,
which they distribute to the poor Christians of those Countries; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to them of <hi>China:</hi> and although the ordinarie Almes, which
the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> alloweth them from <hi>Goa</hi> hath not been paid these 19
years, yet are they wel relieved by the liberalitie of the Citizens of <hi>Macao.</hi> I
doubt not but the Lord doth favour this Citie for their many Almesdeeds,
and for the great care they take about the Service and Worship of God.</p>
                     <p>Finally, this Citie of <hi>Macao</hi> is a continuall Seminarie, wherein are educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and brought up many of those Labourers, who cultivate not only <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
and <hi>Giappon,</hi> but also all other Christianities of the Neighbouring
Kingdomes. It is also a Sanctuarie and place of Refuge, where, in times of
troubles and persecutions, they may all shelter themselves, as it were in
another <hi>Moab,</hi> being upon all occasions, <hi>Refugium à Facie Vastatoris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One of the Convents of this Citie is a Colledge belonging to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie.
There are commonly between threescore and fourescore persons
in it, more or lesse, according to the number of the persons they receive,
or send away. For all <hi>Missions</hi> being furnished out of them, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
must needs be very uncertain. There are in that Colledge two Lectures
in Divinitie; one of Cases of Conscience; one course of superiour studies;
two classes of Latin; one schoole for children, so numerous, that the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
forme thereof containeth above 90 children of the <hi>Portugheses,</hi> and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of that Countrie.</p>
                     <p>Out of this House, (which at the beginning was very small, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
there very few,) first came the Souldiers of this enterprise.
Father <hi>Alexander Valignan</hi> of happy memorie, who was then Visitour,
resolved to send some of the Fathers into <hi>China</hi> to endevour to convert that
vast Kingdome to the faith of Christ; when presently the first difficulties
began at the Colledge it selfe, a manifest prognostication of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64464:97"/>
many that should happen in the prog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>esse of the work, and execution of
the undertaking. For to some of the Fathers, by reason of the knowledge
and experience they had of the Kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> this enterprise see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
not only difficult, but also rash and unadvised, wherefore they advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Visitour not to set his mind upon it. But our Lord, who bringeth
wonderfull things to passe from weak and troublesome beginnings,
would have this design put in execution.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Michael Roggiero</hi> was the first, who was named to take paines in
this conquest; he was followed by the Fathers <hi>Franciscus Passius, Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
de Almeida Duarte, Matthaeus Riccius,</hi> and others, who came after and
helped on the work, and like the foundation-stones of that building, sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the first weight thereof and greater difficulties, labours and troubles,
than any <hi>Missions</hi> of our societie had ever felt. For the difficulties in new
<hi>Missions</hi> into Kingdomes so remote and different, from our <hi>Europe</hi> in
language, custome, conversation, diet &amp;c. are not ordinarie; neither
can they be few. But those in the <hi>Mission</hi> of <hi>China</hi> do far exceed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The language seemeth more difficult than any in the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all of <hi>Monosyllables,</hi> curt and aequivocall: and in this difficulty the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were without any Master to teach them, without any interpreter to
explain what was said to them; so that they neither understood others, nor
others them; but by force of diligence and unwearied paines they went
on conquering and gaining ground: and although they never arrived at
any perfection in the language, or good accent in pronouncing it; yet
they discovered the mysteries of that tongue, and set them down in so plain
a forme, that they made it much more easie for those who came after
them. To this may be added the painfull study of their letters, which of
it selfe alone is a businesse of incredible labour, they being so many and
so various and in this <hi>Mission,</hi> (contrarie to what is done in others) the
Fathers do study them all with so much diligence, that they have not only
learned to write, and to read their books very perfectly, but do also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
others themselves, and have of late published many to the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of <hi>Christianity:</hi> and in truth, the <hi>Fathers</hi> in <hi>China</hi> do justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this praise, that that language being so hard, and they having the
letters too to be studied which are not very easie, yet they do speak that
language much better, than any others do those, of their <hi>Missions;</hi> for
of themselves they are able to catechise, preach, treate, and converse with
the greatest <hi>Mandarines</hi> of the Kingdome, and to speak to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
if there were occasion, without making use of any ones tongue, but
their own; their endeavours in this particular being extraordinarie, and
such, as are not used in other parts: and our Lord by his singular provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
doth sweeten this labour, and season those difficulties they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
for his sake with much joy and consolation. Moreover, there is to be a
generall change throughout their whole bodies; in their beard and their
haire, which they must suffer to grow very longe; in the fashion of their
cloathes, in their manner of conversation, in their customes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
and all other things; which are as different, as they are remote
from ours.</p>
                     <p>Besides all these ordinarie difficulties, (which are found more or lesse,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64464:98"/>
in all <hi>Missions</hi>) it is not to be beleeved, how sharp a warre the devil hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
up against this; endeavouring by the strength of difficulties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
to make us desist from the enterprise: and it went so farre, that
Father <hi>Valignan</hi> the Visitour, considering the great obstructions we found
every where, the extraordinarie difficultie there was to enter, and the
great trouble there was to stay there, how little good we could do there,
and yet how much we suffered; resolved to call back the Fathers to <hi>Maca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi>
to employ them in some other <hi>Missions</hi> of lesse danger and trouble, and
where a greater profit of Soules might be made. But the Lord, who had
otherwise ordained it for the good of his elect, would not suffer the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
to come away, and leave the work begun in that Kingdome, where
it was to have so advantageous a progresse.</p>

                     <p>THe Fathers did still persevere in the Resolution they had taken to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and settle themselves in <hi>China;</hi> and accordingly three times the

and grief, which is easily imaginable they had, to find almost every
spark of hope extinguished by such extraordinarie difficulties, as they
found, and by that great aversion, the <hi>Chinesses</hi> had to admit of
strangers.</p>
                     <p>I have been told, that about that time, Father <hi>Valignan</hi> looking one day
out of a window of the Colledge of <hi>Macao</hi> toward the Continent, the
good old man cried out with a loud voice, and the most intimate
affection of his heart, speaking to <hi>China; Ah Rock, Rock, when wilt thou open,
Rock?</hi> But (as there is no councell against God, who seeth and knoweth
the times and moments of his divine Resolutions,) when the entrance see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
more shut up than ever, and more encompassed with difficulties, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so many attempts and endeavours had been frustrated, nay, after they
had been sharply reproved by the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of <hi>Cantone,</hi> and by publick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
been sent back to <hi>Macao;</hi> then did the Lord our God open the gate by
such meanes as were not to be imagined.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers had not been full seven daies returned to <hi>Macao,</hi> wholly
despairing of the businesse, when there arrived a messenger from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Cantone,</hi> named <hi>Chi Fu,</hi> bringing letters from the <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he invited the Fathers to <hi>Xaokim,</hi> the Capitall Citie of <hi>Cantone,</hi> where
the same <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of the Provinces of <hi>Cantone</hi> and <hi>Quansi,</hi> had his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
offering them there a place for their Church and House.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers entred into <hi>Xaokim</hi> in <hi>September 1583.</hi> with no little joy to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64464:98"/>
see themselves established in a moment, where, before with all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
they could never so much as set their foot. They built a house
and Church, and gave a beginning to their intention, by translating the ten
Commandements, as well as they could, into the <hi>Chinesse</hi> language; and
setting forth, how necessary the observance of them was. The worth of
these new guests was more admired in the City, for their good works
and holinesse of life, than for their words, not being able yet to speak
that language sufficiently; but almost continuall troubles and persecutions
were never wanting to them. The covering of their house was so loaden
with stones by the insolence of the people from a neighbouring Tower,
that they were in great danger of their lives: and, because a servant of the
house laid hold of a little boy, and threatned to complaine of him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
an accusation was set on foot against the Fathers, that they had mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used
the <hi>Sonne</hi> of a <hi>Citizen:</hi> but in the end they were cleared by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the fact: soone after, other calumnies were raised against them,
particularly against Father <hi>Raggiero,</hi> whom they accused of <hi>Adultery;</hi> but
his innocence was soone cleared, it being proved, that he was at that time
mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> than two months journy from the place, where that crime was said
to be committed. Then did the people of <hi>Xaokim</hi> begin to throwing of
stones againe, with which they did so ruine and batter the house, that the
Fathers missed very little of being killed: all this while did their condition
seeme like unto a tempestuous sea. But amongst so great tribulations and
dangers, the Lord was pleased to send them some daies of peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie;
and among so many thorns they gathered some roses, and some
fruit of their labours: which was the reason that their sufferings did not
seeme so grievous to them, neither did they undergo them without joy
and delight, hoping to make a greater progresse, when the desired calme
should happen. Neither were the Fathers wanting (particularly Father
<hi>Mattheus Riccius,</hi>) by their knowledge in <hi>Mathematiques,</hi> and principally
by a description of the world in a new <hi>Mappe,</hi> to give reputation to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of <hi>Europe;</hi> and to make acquaintance and friendship with persons of
qualitie; when behold, by the coming of a new <hi>Vice-roy</hi> there was so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
a storme raised, that notwithstanding all the diligence and addresses
which were made, not only by the Fathers, but also by their friends, it was
impossible to finde any remedy, or to put a stop to the sentence, which that
<hi>Vice-roy</hi> fulminated against the Fathers; which was, That they should all
immediatly returne to <hi>Macao,</hi> without giving them any time of stay there,
or suffering them to go into any other Country; but that they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
depart, and should be brought precisely to <hi>Macao.</hi> They were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to yeeld obedience, and so leaving some things belonging to the house
in the hands of their friends, and carrying other things along with them,
after they had made a short prayer unto God, recommending unto him
that little flock, which they were forced to leave among Wolves without
a shepherd, and after they had exhorted the Christians to continue sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
in the faith, wherein they had been seven years instructed, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
downe the current of the river; both the Christians, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
there, as also the Fathers, who tooke their leave, weeping very
much, &amp; recommending each other to the divine Province and Protection.</p>

                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:64464:99"/>
When they were arrived at the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Canton,</hi> the Admirall of
the <hi>Chinesse</hi> Navie, or <hi>Haitao,</hi> who was to conduct them to <hi>Macao,</hi> was
not to be found: where, while they stayed to expect him, they wrote to
the Visitour in <hi>Macao,</hi> that after two or three daies they were to be banished
by order of the <hi>Vice-roy:</hi> but they had hardly passed a day there, when they
espied a boate coming toward them with all speed, sent from the <hi>Vice-roy,</hi>
to invite them back againe to <hi>Xaokim.</hi> It seemed to them, that they were
returned from death to life by the unexpected invitation; although they
understood well enough, that they were called backe to undergo new
troubles, no lesse than the former. When they were returned to the <hi>Vice-roy</hi>
at <hi>Xaokim,</hi> he would have paid the charges the Fathers had been at in
building their Church and house, which by no means they would suffer
him to do; and (after severall contrasts) they obtained leave of him to
dwell in another City belonging to his Government, called <hi>Xaocheu.</hi> With
this permission the Fathers departed from <hi>Xaokim</hi> on the 15th. day of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
1589.</hi> and being after a few daies arrived at <hi>Xaocheu,</hi> they had enough
to do to avoyd the lodgings, which were offered them in a <hi>Monasterie</hi> of
<hi>Bonzi.</hi> At length by Gods assistance they were admitted into the City,
and were well lookt upon by the <hi>Magistrates;</hi> they built a house and
Church, and began to preach the Gospel with their whole endeavours.
Notwithstanding that, they were ever accompanied with persecutions,
contrasts and calumnies; and in truth, it is hardly to be beleeved, how
many of these they did undergo. I did once reckon them up to satisfie my
curiositie: counting those which are related in the History of Father <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaultius,</hi>
and others which are not set downe there, till the persecution of
<hi>Nankim,</hi> I found them in all to be fifty foure, the greatest part were at the
beginning, and in the Province of <hi>Canton,</hi> which as it is a passage to the
rest, may be called the <hi>Promontory of Torments;</hi> so that as oft as we shall
have occasion to mention it, there will alwaies recurre some new troubles
and tempests.</p>
                     <p>Our servants were many times taken and <hi>Bastinadoed</hi> for no other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but that they had defended themselves against assaults of the insolent
people; and one time also brother <hi>Sebastan Fernandes,</hi> who went out to
defend those innocents with reasons and prayers, was put to publique
shame. But the persecution was worse, which brother <hi>Francis Martines</hi>
suffered through a vaine suspicion they had, that he had attempted to raise
a rebellion in <hi>China,</hi> and that he was a Magician: upon which occasion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had been many times beaten and tormented, and after a tedious
and noysome imprisonment, and in the end, after his last punishment by
an unmercifull beating, being brought back into the prison, he died, a death
so much the more glorious, by how much it was supported by an unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
patience, and for so holy an occasion, as the procuring the salvation
of that people was. After that, brother <hi>Francis Mendez,</hi> going to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis</hi>
of <hi>Canton</hi> upon occasion of businesse, and to help a servant of ours,
who was kept there in prison, suffered very much: for being come into
the prison, the <hi>Gaoler</hi> presently clapt Manacles upon him, and suspecting
him to be a Priest, pulled off his cap, and searched whether his crowne was
shaven or no: and finding no signe of any thing he could lay hold on,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64464:99"/>
only because he was a <hi>Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him not to go out of the prison, till there were bestowed many uruell Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinadoes
on him. Likewise two Fathers going from <hi>Canton</hi> further up
into <hi>China,</hi> that is, Father <hi>Iulius Alexis,</hi> and another Father, were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and after very great sufferings set at libertie.</p>
                     <p>The Christian Religion began to make some progresse at our Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Xaocheu;</hi> and in another place neere unto it, named <hi>Namhim,</hi>
whither Father <hi>Matthaeus Riccius</hi> was gone, and had reduced some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
to the sheepfold of Christ. But the businesse was so full of difficulties
and dangers, that brother <hi>Sebastian Fernandes,</hi> (although a <hi>Chinesse</hi> by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(but brought up in <hi>Macao</hi> by his Parents who were <hi>Christians;</hi>) and
who entred into our societie after he was growne a man, and a rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
and served therein many years, even to his death, with great paines
to himselfe and a great example to all that Christianitie,) told the Father,
we should do well to go to <hi>Giappon;</hi> seeing the Lord did favour that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
with so great a conversion, and so many Baptismes, and spend our lives
there where we might receive abundant fruit of our labours. But the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who had a more lively faith, and a hope better grounded, seemed to
have answered him by the spirit of prophesie, that which afterwards came
to passe, giving him hopes of more copious fruit, such as we find at this
day: And even at that time also, within foure years, wherein he had cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
that vine-yard, in spight of those great Tribulations, he made a
good harvest of many <hi>Christians;</hi> who many times do prove the best in
times of trouble and persecution: and there were some of them very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,
with some of which I have since spoken and conversed, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to me, to be like <hi>Christians</hi> of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Time; and by degrees
there were many more also converted.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while about the year 1594 two persons of this House de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to a better life; for if the people of this Province are not good, the
temper of the aire is much worse. Till this time, the Fathers had gone in
the same garbe they entred in, with their beards and the crowne of their
heads shaven, and their haire cut short, as we weare it here in <hi>Europe;</hi> and
there also the <hi>Bonzi,</hi> or Priests of their Idols, who in that kingdome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the custome of others, are in very mean esteem. But now they
were better acquainted with the state of things there, it seemed to them
to be more advantageous for the credit of our religion, as also for the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
thereof, that they should take a habit different from the <hi>Bonzi:</hi> and
that seeing they were inwardly unlike them, that they should no longer
outwardly resemble them; especially, seeing that first outward form was a
great impediment to hinder them from treating with <hi>Decorum</hi> and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity,
with Officers and men of qualitie, who without the vesture of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
and habit of a <hi>Letterato,</hi> do by no means admit any one to familiar
conversation with them. So that leaving their former garbe and habit,
they took the other of <hi>Letterati,</hi> with a great applause of the Christians
and their friends; as also of the <hi>Magistrates;</hi> and because they had taken
no degree in their learning, they were accounted and esteemed, (as they
are also at this day,) for <hi>Letterati</hi> of <hi>Europe;</hi> besides many other good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and effects which it produced.</p>

                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:64464:100"/>
In May the year following, Father <hi>Matthaeus Riccius,</hi> went to <hi>Nankim,</hi>
in the companie of a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who was a grave Person and his friend,
who went thither with commission to be General in the warre against the
<hi>Giapponeses</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Corea;</hi> he wanted not troubles by the way,
especially in a dangerous shipwrack which he suffered, the barque being
overturned, and the Father falling into the water over head and eares, not
having any skill in swimming, nor any hope of life. But the Lord assisted
him with his paternal providence: for without knowing how it came, there
he found a rope of the Barque in his hand, by which he was pulled up: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
he lost his companion, who being carried away by the force
and violence of the water, was never more seen.</p>
                     <p>At length he arrived at <hi>Nankim;</hi> but the houre of that famous Citie
was not yet come. Wherefore although some friends there did desire to
favour him; yet one, with whom he had contracted in <hi>Cantone,</hi>
and whose favour he did now endeavour to gain, was not only
wanting to him in what he requested, but was so far changed from
what he was, that he put the Father in great danger; and was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he was disgracefully sent out of the Citie; and all this upon no
other account, but lest it should be said, that he was the occasion of the
Fathers coming thither, contrarie to the lawes of <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Father departed from <hi>Nankim,</hi> and went into the Province of <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amsi,</hi>
which lieth between that of <hi>Namkim</hi> and that of <hi>Cantone,</hi> he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the Capitall Citie thereof, named <hi>Nanchum,</hi> and treated very
kindly by the most considerable people there; and especially by a great
Lord, named <hi>Kien Gam Vam,</hi> who was the Kings neer kinsman. He was
also very courteously used by the <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> with no ordinarie demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of kindnesse; which was none of the least occasions that a residence
was founded in this City; then, Father <hi>Riccius</hi> using all diligence to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
leave to set up a House there, the Lord provided him of a companion,
named <hi>Iacobus Socirus,</hi> sent from <hi>Macao</hi> very opportunely to reside
there; and then presently they purchased some few small houses
in this City; but not without the usuall resistance and contradiction of
the neighbourhood, as also from other parts; which in processe of time
did so encrease, that this House may well compare with that of <hi>Xaocheu</hi>
for persecutions: for if the people of that City are bad, truly, they of this
City are not very good. The Fathers were sometimes molested by the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terati;</hi>
otherwhiles by the <hi>Nobilitie;</hi> of which sort there are many still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding
in this City: they were troubled also by the people; and sometimes
by the Christians themselves. For there is never wanting a Judas to raise
persecution among the good disciples. Neverthelesse, it pleased God to
make that House, and Christianity there to flourish, and to bring into them
many persons of qualitie; and particularly that neer Kinsman of the King,
with his whole House and Familie; who by his holy life and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
did much edifie that Church. And though he had no children, while
he was a Gentile, yet it pleased the Lord to send him many, after he was
become a Christian. There were also many other Families converted,
which, although they were inferiour to his in bloud, yet did they not
come much behind him in Christian Pietie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:64464:100"/>
After that Father <hi>Riccius</hi> had a companion, to whose care he might
leave that House recommended, he began to undertake afresh the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
of <hi>Nankim:</hi> and he had a good opportunitie offered him by a <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
of qualitie, and his friend, who took him along in his company. By
this meanes he returned again to that City in the year 1598. and although
at the beginning, by reason of the warre, which the <hi>Giapponesses</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Kingdome of <hi>Corea,</hi> threatning also that of <hi>China,</hi> he
found great difficultie to be admitted (for these two alwayes go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
yet at length it was facilitated by the good success of <hi>Corea,</hi> and the
friendship of some persons of Qualitie, and of the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> himself; the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
providence alwayes opening that way, which he knew was most
secure.</p>

entred into Pekim.</head>
                     <p>FAther <hi>Matthaeus Riccius</hi> never ceased to endeavour a finall establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church in that Kingdome; which did wholly depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the entrance of the Fathers into the Royall City of <hi>Pekim,</hi> where the
King and chief Court do reside: and so after he had assayed diverse
meanes, at length he resolved to go thither in the company of the same
<hi>Mandarine</hi> his friend, who had brought him to <hi>Nankim;</hi> and so he took no
house at that time in <hi>Nankim.</hi> He departed then along with Father <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
Cataneus</hi> his companion, and two <hi>Chinesses</hi> who were Brethren, taking
their way by water; which was above a moneths voyage, although the
<hi>Mandarine</hi> got thither in a shorter time by land.</p>
                     <p>But at length being arrived at <hi>Pekim,</hi> without any hinderance or distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
the first thing they did, was to go waite upon their friend, who had
caused them to come thither, and was arrived there before them. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them with all kindnesse and civilitie, and endeavoured to favour
and assist them in every thing, &amp; especially in recommending them to the
acquaintance of an <hi>Eunuch</hi> his friend. The Fathers had brought with them
some curiosities of <hi>Europe,</hi> to make a Present of them to the King, to wit,
Two excellent Pictures Painted on Linnen cloath, the one of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
the other of the <hi>B. Virgin;</hi> an <hi>Harpsicon,</hi> an instrument which had never
been heard; a striking Clock, a thing which had never been seen there
before; and some triangular glasses, with all which the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was well
pleased: but not finding that gain from the Fathers, which he expected,
and which was the only thing he lookt after, he excused himself, that he
could not present them to the King, by reason of the troubles of the war,
which the <hi>Giapponeses</hi> made upon <hi>Corea,</hi> and which were every day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in <hi>China;</hi> saying; that it was not a fitting time to speak to the King
about strangers affaires. Of the same opinion also was that <hi>Mandarine</hi> their
friend, who being to returne to <hi>Nankim,</hi> where he had a Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon him, would willingly have carried the Fathers back again
with him. But it seemed better to them, that the Hopes which they had
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64464:101"/>
conceived, should not be so soon lost; nor so much labour and expence be
cast away in vain: wherefore they remained in <hi>Pekim</hi> above a moneth
after the departure of the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> using all endeavours, and seeking
out all wayes possible, to see if they could compasse their intention. But
all their diligence was in vain; for the <hi>Mandarine</hi> being once gone, all the
rest withdraw themselves; so that there was not one of the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of
the Court, that would admit them so much as to a Visite.</p>
                     <p>The difficulties then being so great, and they finding no way to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them, the Fathers were forced to returne into that Country, where
they were more known, and had been better received; and so they came
back to <hi>Nankim,</hi> but not with so much ease, as they thought they should
have done. For the Winter overtaking them in their voyage, and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
being frozen up, they were forced to winter by the way.</p>
                     <p>But Father <hi>Matthaeus Riccius,</hi> being loath to lose any opportunitie, left
his companions in the Barque, and took his way by land, avoyding by this
meanes the trouble and hinderance of the Wintering, but not the cold of
the journey, which was so excessive, that many times it hindred him from
going forward. But at length having overcome all difficulties, he arrived
at the Citie of <hi>Sucheu,</hi> which without all contradiction, is the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and delightfull City of all <hi>China;</hi> so that they have a proverbe which
saith, That the City of <hi>Sucheu</hi> &amp; <hi>Hancheu,</hi> is that upon earth, which the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of the blessed, is in heaven. It is scituated in a pleasant River of
fresh Water, just as Venice is in the Sea: it hath the greatest traffique of all
the Kingdome; the Merchandize from <hi>Macao</hi> being first brought thither,
from whence they are afterwards dispersed to all other parts.</p>
                     <p>Here the Father found <hi>Quitaizo,</hi> his ancient friend, in the Province of
<hi>Canton,</hi> by whom he was received with all manner of kindnesse and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and was also by him introduced and brought into credit with the
whole City. And being the Sonne of a principall <hi>Mandarine,</hi> he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was a
great help to him in gaining the friendship of severall <hi>Mandarines</hi> of great
authoritie; for which and other good turnes he did us in <hi>Canton</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, and especially in <hi>Nankim,</hi> he deserveth no small commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and acknowledgment. The Father gave him a triangular glasse, which
by his friend was taken for so precious a Jewel, that he tipt both the ends
of it with Gold, and made a Case of Silver to put it in; and after sold it
for above 500. Crownes. This honest man much desired, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would settle himself in that Citie, and found a House there, where he
might assist and promote him with more convenience; proposing many
difficulties which would hinder the residence of the Fathers at <hi>Nankim.</hi>
Neverthelesse, having weighed things better, and taking that resolution,
which was most suitable to their occasions, they went both of them to
<hi>Nankim,</hi> in the year 1599. where they found the state of affaires much
altered from what it was the time before.</p>
                     <p>The Citie did now enjoy a profound peace and tranquillity, the <hi>Giap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneses</hi>
being beaten back into their own Countrie. The <hi>Mandarine</hi> their
friend was very glad of their coming, and did them many singular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
as did also many others, both Magistrates, and other grave men
and persons of account in that City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> particularly a <hi>Coli,</hi> which is a kind of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64464:101"/>
                        <hi>Censor</hi> or <hi>Syndic-royall,</hi> named <hi>Choxelim:</hi> wherefore the Father, not only
by their consent, but also by their perswasion, resolved to settle a residence,
and found a House in that Noble City, which is the second of the whole
Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>While the Father made his abode there, he gave great proofe
of himself and of the Sciences of <hi>Europe;</hi> particularly of the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.</hi>
He made a new Mappe of the World, with the explanation thereof
in the <hi>Chinesse</hi> language and characters; which gained great reputation,
not only to the authour, but also to <hi>Europe;</hi> seeing there such a multitude
of Noble Kingdomes and Cities: so that the same <hi>Quitaizo,</hi> and others,
with very <hi>Solemn Ceremonies,</hi> made themselves Disciples to Father <hi>Ricci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
Neither was the authoritie lesse which the Father gained by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Disputes, which he held concerning matters of Religion, wherein, to
the admiration of all the Councels, he ever had the Victorie: so that
the Fathers came to such a height of reputation, that they were celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by many <hi>Letterati</hi> in <hi>Epigrams</hi> and <hi>Elogies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the meane time the companions of Father <hi>Riccius</hi> arrived, after they
had wintered by the way, and endured many labours and hardships. But
when they found the Father, in that City, where a little before he was
not only not received, but also driven out with ignominie and shame, now
to have such credit and applause, and so many friends who favoured him,
they forgot all their former sufferings, and gave most hearty thanks to the
Lord our God for that present prosperitie. Not long after, they began to
think of buying an House: for, that wherein they lived, was only
hired. Many were offered to them, but such for the most part as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
for them; among which there was one that was very large
and capacious, but haunted with <hi>Divells</hi> and <hi>Phantasmes,</hi> so that none
durst dwell in it. This inconvenience useth commonly to be advantageous
to us; for wee not fearing these spirits, which vanish at the first on-sett, doe
commonly purchase such houses at a very low rate; and so it happened
to Father <hi>Riccius:</hi> wherefore after the bargain and sale was concluded, the
Fathers came over a while to dwell in that house, where they lived very
quietly without receiving any disturbance or inconvenience from those
spirits.</p>
                     <p>Assoon as the Fathers had their House and Church, there were not
wanting those who did frequent it. The first who was baptized in this
City, was an old man of seventy years of age, he was a <hi>Noble man,</hi> and
had the office of <hi>Chinoci,</hi> whereof we spake, when we treated of that <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
which descendeth by way of blood. Presently his sonne followed
him, who was already a <hi>Letterato;</hi> and was afterward made a great <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darine;</hi>
and also his whole Familie, his Grand-Sonnes and Daughters &amp;c.
I knew them many yeares afterwards, when they had made great progress
in Vertue and Christian Pietie, and are therefore worthy of Eternall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
with many particular cases, whereof we shall make mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
This Familie was followed by others, the number of Christians
still encreasing, as also their zeale to good works; especially after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
whereof we will speak anon. So that it may be said to be the
best <hi>Christianitie</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> although the most persecuted and molested.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:64464:102"/>
The affaires of <hi>Nankim</hi> succeeding thus prosperously, and these good
beginnings shewing that that House would not only continue, but also be
enlarged and advanced, Father <hi>Riccius</hi> sent one of his companions, F. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus
Cataneus</hi> to <hi>Macao,</hi> partly to give an account to the superiours of
what had passed, partly to get some curio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ities of <hi>Europe</hi> to make Presents
of; and partly to seek out some new companions to labour in that plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
harvest.</p>
                     <p>The Father arrived at <hi>Macao</hi> with these glad tidings, which were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with that joy which was fitting; and shortly after, having procured
some Presents for the King, and a fresh recruit of other Fathers,
he returned to <hi>Nankim,</hi> where Father <hi>Riccius</hi> stayd for him: who having
his whole desires set upon <hi>Pekim,</hi> after he had received the Presents, and
a fresh supply of companions, deferred no longer to begin his second voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
for <hi>Pekim;</hi> having not only the opinions, but also the propitious assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of some principall <hi>Mandarines,</hi> in his favour.</p>
                     <p>It was the sixteenth day of May, in the year 1600. when the Fathers
<hi>Matthaeus Riccius,</hi> and <hi>Didacus Pantoia,</hi> and brother <hi>Sebastian Fernandes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
the second time for the Court, in the same manner as before, by
water, having accommodation given them in a barque belonging to an
Eunuch; who the more he conversed with the Fathers, had still the more
affection for them.</p>
                     <p>Having passed the Province of <hi>Nankim,</hi> and being come into that of
<hi>Xantum,</hi> in the City where the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of that Province doth reside, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Riccius</hi> was received with extraordinary respect by that <hi>Vice-roy.</hi> He
was visited in the barque, presented, and very much made off. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall,
or petition, which he intended to present to the King, was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for him, and put into a better form; and last of all, he had many letters
of recommendation given him to the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of <hi>Pekim.</hi> This <hi>Vice-roy</hi>
had had some knowledge of Father <hi>Riccius</hi> by means of a son of his,
who had very frequently and familiarly conversed with the Father at
<hi>Nenkim,</hi> and had heard from him many things concerning our Religion.</p>
                     <p>Their voyage continued very prosperous, without any considerable
obstruction, untill they came to a City, where there was an <hi>Eunuch</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Mathan,</hi> who was Collectour of the Kings customs and rights, and
of many wrongs also, which he did to most passengers, and was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a wicked cruell man. He was very often visited by the Eunuch, in
whose company the Fathers travelled, with his hands laden with Presents,
but could never be admitted, because his gifts were not proportionable to
the greedinesse of that <hi>Harpye.</hi> And because the time grew neere, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
if he came not to Court, he should be in great danger, not only of his
goods, but of his life also; he resolved to betray the Fathers, to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
And to that purpose informed the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> that those strangers car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Presents for the King, which he had seen; adding withall, that they
might possibly have other things of greater price, out of which <hi>Mathan</hi>
might make a great advantage to himselfe. Upon this occasion the Fathers
runne a great hazzard, not only to lose what they had, but also to be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
being left in the hands of that covetous, cruell wretch. For the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch
<hi>Mathan,</hi> although at the beginning he shewed himselfe something
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64464:102"/>
courteous, yet it was not long, ere it was manifest, what intentions he had
towards them. First he desired only to see the Presents which they car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ied,
and accordingly the Fathers shewed them him with all courtesie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect:
after that, he would needs take the charge upon him of presenting
them to the King: Another time he carried them to his Palace, after that
the King had answered to his <hi>Memoriall,</hi> that he should write him word,
what those things were which came to be presented to him. Last of all,
<hi>Mathan</hi> came with above 200 men armed, who were just so many theeves,
and he their Captaine; and without any termes of respect, or courtesie,
but with a furious countenance, ransack'd all their goods, and in a great
rage laid by whatsoever pleased him. When he saw any thing that had not
been showen him before, he would cry out, as if he had been robbed; but
especially he made most horrible exclamations, when he had found a <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix,</hi>
saying, That they were to make use of it in their enchantments and
conjurations, wherewith they purposed to kill the King. To which the
Father answered with all modesty, declaring to him the <hi>Sacred mystery,</hi>
which was represented by that Image: But the <hi>Eunuch</hi> not admitting of
any reason at all, cryed out, That such deceivers as they ought to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
punished. In conclusion, having taken whatsoever liked him, he
made an inventary of all, together with the Presents that were for the King,
and sent them all, along with the Fathers into the Fort, where they had a
continuall guard upon them. The Fathers were much dejected by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
fearing to lose in one moment all that they had thitherto gained
with so much sweat.</p>
                     <p>Yet did they not lose the confidence, which they had in Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
whereof they had so frequent experience: and therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves deprived of all humane help, they wholly cast themselves
into the armes of the divine providence, and with prayers and mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
did by a holy violence wrestle with the divine mercy, that he would
vouchafe to turne his eyes toward the salvation of so many soules, that
had been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, the which, as it
seemed probable to them, wholly depended upon the successe of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.
They sent a servant to the City with letters to another <hi>Eunuch,</hi>
wherein they desired his favour to procure them leave to present those
things to the King, beleeving, that because it was a businesse, wherein he
might gaine favour and esteeme from the King, the <hi>Eunuch</hi> would very
willingly undertake it. But whether it were for feare of <hi>Mathan,</hi> or that
he were already pre-possessed by him, the answer was, to mis-use the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
both with words, and with blowes.</p>
                     <p>They sought yet another expedient to endeavour to get out of that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
They writ to a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who had shewed himselfe very friendly
to them, before they fell into this tribulation, and had really favoured
them upon severall occasions: But he also seeing the letter, was afraid to
accept of it; neither would he returne any answer; neverthelesse he told
our servant, that the Fathers were in as dangerous a condition as might be:
for the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was resolved to present a <hi>Memoriall</hi> to the King against
them, wherein he would declare, that they did designe to take away the
Kings life by witchcraft, as also many other things in their prejudice, to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64464:103"/>
discredit them, and colour his owne imposture; wherefore his opinion
was, that they should endeavour by any means possible, to make their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape,
and to get back againe to <hi>Canton;</hi> and that they should esteeme it a
great gaine to lose all they had, so they might escape that death, which
hung over them, while they were in the hands of that cruell <hi>Eunuch.</hi>
And if they were not either able, or willing, to put this in execution, at
least they should endeavour to get a <hi>Memoriall</hi> presented to the King, by
the means of some <hi>Mandarine</hi> at Court, who was their friend.</p>
                     <p>You may well imagine, in what condition the Fathers were at this mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
and how apprehensive they were of the danger they were in: yet
would they not accept of the first counsell, lest, being innocent, they
might make themselves guilty by their flight; esteeming it a lesse misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
to suffer for righteousnes sake, than to give occasion to those who
knew them not, to believe those things probable, which the <hi>Eunuch</hi> layd
to their charge. But the second counsell seemed more reasonable unto
them, and therefore they presently dispatched toward the Court Brother
<hi>Sebastian Fernandes</hi> with letters to their friends, to give them an account
of the condition they were in: But as in such cases, there are few friends
to be found, so there was none there, who would give them any assistance,
wherefore the brother returned without having done any thing. Then did
the Fathers well perceive, that there was now no longer any remedy left
them in their owne industrie, in their friends, and in humane counsells;
neither would they try any other means, but submitting themselves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the will of God, did cheerfully expect what issue the Lord would
be pleased to send them of their businesse.</p>
                     <p>Six months had the Fathers remained in that imprisonment, expecting
the assistance of the Lord, by whom only they could be succoured. When
beyond all thought of theirs, and without their knowledge, there cometh
a decree from the King, wherein they are called to Court, with their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
They say, the King himselfe one day, without being put in minde
of it by any body, calling to his remembrance the <hi>Eunuchs Memoriall,</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
where that Bell was, which range of it selfe; and which, as they tell
me, is brought me by a stranger? To which the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who always wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
upon him, answered, That it was not yet come to Court, because his
Majesty had not given order for it to come. Whereupon the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
gave order for it, and <hi>Mathan</hi> was forced against his will to send the
Fathers with their Present, and the rest of their goods. They began then
to take heart againe, and forgetting all their former troubles, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
set out upon their journy; and because they could not do it by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by reason the river was frozen up, they tooke their way by land, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
from the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> at the Kings expence, whatsoever they had
need of, both for their owne persons, as also for the carriage of their
goods.</p>

settle there.</head>
                     <p>THe Fathers entred into <hi>Pekim</hi> on the fourth day of January 1601.
where they were well received, and entertained in a Palace, which
an <hi>Eunuch</hi> had lent them for that purpose. They made ready their Present,
and the day following with a great traine and <hi>Parade,</hi> the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> carried
it into the Palace, and presented it to the King; who made great account
of every thing. He did highly prize the pictures of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and of the
<hi>Blessed Virgin;</hi> he much admired the <hi>Harpsicon;</hi> and presently gave order,
that some of the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> should learne to play upon it. When he came
to the Clock, which was a piece of much skill and workmanship, and an
invention altogether unknowne to the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> because he knew it struck
the houres of its owne accord, and that at present it was not in order, not so
much as to be shewed, he commanded that the Fathers should presently
come into the Palace, and set it a going. So they were called in haste, and
admitted within the second wall (for within the third and fourth, none
may enter, unlesse it be the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> and the Souldiers of the night-guard,)
where by the Kings order given to one of the chiefe <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> the Fathers
were received and entertained with all magnificence and courtesie.</p>
                     <p>They stayed there three daies, partly fitting the Clock to serve for the
present; (for afterwards for the greater state there was a Tower of wood
made for it of much cost and workmanship,) partly in teaching foure <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs</hi>
how to set and order it; and partly in satisfying such demands, as
were made them concerning <hi>Europe,</hi> what kinde of Countrie it was, what
Kingdoms, what people, what customes it had, and a thousand other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities,
which were all afterwards by the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> related to the King,
who was much delighted therewith, seeming to be very much satisfied
with every thing: he much desired to see the Fathers, but because he would
not change the ancient stile and custome of the Kingdom, according to
which the King is never to be seen by any stranger, he caused their
pictures to be drawne at length, contenting himselfe, to see only the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of those men, of whom he himselfe might not be seen.</p>
                     <p>All things succeeded prosperously, by reason of the great satisfaction,
which all they of the Palace received from the Fathers; and especially
by reason of the contentment the King tooke in every thing; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
with which he received the Presents; so that now all seemed to be
secure, and that there was nothing more to feare. But there being no secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or calme, that is long lasting in this world, the Fathers quickly found
themselves in new troubles; the occasion whereof was a <hi>Mandarine</hi> of the
<hi>Tribunal Lipu,</hi> to whom it belonged by vertue of his office, to have had
the Present brought to him, and by his means, to have had it presented to
the King, he being to assist at all Embassies, and Presents, that are offered
to his Majestie. He therefore taking it ill, that the Fathers, who knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64464:104"/>
of this, had made use of the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> to carry their Present to the
King, contrary to the ordinary stile of the Court, and without making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mention of those Officers, presently fell upon the weakest part, and
commanded the Fathers to be apprehended, and put into the <hi>House of
strangers,</hi> in a more discourteous manner than was usuall. The Officers
and Sergeants having used more insolence in the apprehending them, than
perhaps they were commanded to doe. Upon this occasion they were
brought before the <hi>Tribunal,</hi> and examined in publick, although by their
answers their cause was sufficiently justified, and the passion of the Judge
something moderated.</p>
                     <p>They had not been above three daies, when they were sent for thence
to the palace, to perform the ordinary <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in the Court of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
whereof we have spoken in the first part. The very same day they
were againe examined by the publick Notaries, by order of the same Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
concerning many other things. The poynt they most insisted on,
was; to what end they were come into <hi>China:</hi> what their intentions were,
and what they did pretend by the Present which they had given the King?
The Fathers judged it necessary to answer cleerly and in forme; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
told them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That they came to preach the law of the true God, who
was sole Lord and Governour of heaven and earth. And that they had
brought that Present to the King, not that they did pretend any thing by
it, either office, dignitie, or recompence, but as a Testimony of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
they ought him, having been inhabitants, for so many years, of that
Kingdom; and that all they did desire, was to have leave to live and die
in that Court, or in any other part of the Kingdom, which the King should
thinke fit, as they had already lived there many years.</p>
                     <p>The Notaries having drawne up this answer, carried it to the <hi>President,</hi>
who having seen and considered it, drew up his <hi>Memoriall</hi> thereupon to the
King, partly in favour of the Fathers, and partly against them. But the
King being well affected towards them, because there was something in it
against the Fathers, gave no answer to it; which is there the same thing
as to reject it: But the Fathers understood by the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> that the King
was much troubled, when he knew, they were kept as prisoners in the
<hi>House</hi> of <hi>Strangers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mandarine</hi> seeing there was no answer given to his petition, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
judged the King was inclined to favour the strangers, wherefore he
thought it fit to change his stile towards them, using them with all cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
and kindenes, and commanded they should be better provided for in
every thing, than the rest of the strangers, who were kept there. And
contrary to the law and custome of that restraint, he gave them libertie to
go into the City about their affaires, and to visit their friends. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
he presented a second <hi>Memoriall</hi> to the King concerning the Fathers,
wherein he did not only say nothing against them, but positively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
their persons, and their good behaviour, and manner of life: only
there was this evill in it, that he besought him to send them away from
<hi>Pekim,</hi> because it was against his lawes, that strangers should inhabit in the
Court. But because the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> who had care of the Clock, were afraid
of the absence of the Fathers, because the ordering of it depended on their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64464:104"/>
directions, and the King also had a desire they should stay, this second
<hi>Memoriall</hi> likewise received no answer.</p>
                     <p>In the meane while the Fathers, having libertie to go abroad when they
pleased, frequently Visited the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> made new friends, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with those of the Councel of Rites, called <hi>Lipu,</hi> before whom their
businesse was, that they would be pleased in their Memorialls, to signifie
that they thought it fit that the Fathers should be permitted to reside in
<hi>Pekim;</hi> telling them, that they might plainly perceive, that the king refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to give an answer to them, because he was willing they should stay
there. But they still obstinately opposed that point; and accordingly in
their third, and many other <hi>Memorials,</hi> which they presented concerning
the Fathers, although in the whole or at least the greater part they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to favour them; yet in that, which concerned their stay at Court,
they were alwayes excluded; but in the like manner the kings answer was
alwayes suspended, there never comming any decree from him, eyther
for or against them.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers perceiving this long delay, and whence it came, desired
in the meane time to be freed from that restraint, which is imposed upon
all strangers; wherefore they obtained by meanes of certain <hi>Mandarines,</hi>
who were their friends, the favour to be discharged from that place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the King should returne his answer unto the fore-said <hi>Memorials,</hi> and
to have leave to hire a House for themselves. This was a new thing and
wholy different from the Stile of <hi>China,</hi> and therefore so difficult that it
was accounted impossible to be done without a particular order from the
King. But when God would have it so, all things are easily brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
and so this licence was obtained, rather as a thing granted from
Heaven, than acquired by humane industrie on earth. The Fathers then
had ful leave to go out of that walled place: they hired a House, and began
to live in it, as if they had been natives of that Countrie,</p>
                     <p>The Fathers then seeing themselves in that condition which was much
better than what they could hitherto obtain, presently endeavoured with
all their might to get their settlement at the Court secured, that none
might be able to trouble them any more upon that account; understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
very well, how much the securitie of their other houses depended
upon their personall residence at that Court. Neverthelesse with all the
diligence that they themselves, and severall <hi>Mandarines</hi> their friends,
could use, they were never able to obtain a decree for it: it is true, they
were assured by the <hi>Eunuches,</hi> that the King had said, that they might dwel
securely at the Court, and that they should by no meanes think of returning
to the Southern Provinces; for if they did, he should be displeased at it.</p>
                     <p>This answer was very sufficient, and being authorized with the Kings
name, served instead of a decree absolutely to secure their habitation
there: another favour also being added to this, by which it was more
confirmed, and that was the appointing by the Kings own order, to have
a competent pension allowed the Fathers out of his exchequer, for the
maintenance of themselves, and four Servants, which allowance they
were to receive quarterly. By these favours, and the friendship of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches</hi>
of the Palace, and of some principall <hi>Mandarines,</hi> their habitation
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64464:105"/>
was not only secured, but brought into such credit, that their friends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
dailie, and the people flocked continually to our House, some to
see strangers, some to heare something concerning our <hi>Sciences,</hi> and some
to understand the truth of our holy Law: and this was that which was
most pleasing to the Fathers, and most profitable to the <hi>Chinesses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among the Principall <hi>Mandarines,</hi> who at this beginning contracted
friendship with the Fathers, there was one, who was named <hi>Ligo Zun.</hi>
He was a Native of the City of <hi>Hamcheu,</hi> a man of great Talents and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuitie,
and was known to be such through the whole Kingdome; at
the examinations for the degree of <hi>Doctour,</hi> where in that degree is given
to about 300, he obtained the fifth place, which is a very great reputation
among them. He was extreamly curious, and being assisted by his own
naturall ingenuitie, and the friendship of Father <hi>Matthaeus Riccius,</hi> he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
many curiosities in the <hi>Mathematiques.</hi> He translated severall of the
Fathers Books into the <hi>Chinesses</hi> language; and whilest he was yet a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi>
he put our Catechisme into an excellent Stile. It is reported of him,
that when he was Composing of it, seeing the powerful reasons which
were brought in that Book to prove the Sanctitie of our Religion, that
although he did not believe them to be true, he cryed out, <hi>what an excellent
piece is this</hi> and <hi>how accurately Composed!</hi> But in time he began to penitrate
better into them, and at length acknowledging them to be true, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to become a <hi>Christian:</hi> but his desire not being capable to be put in
effect at that time in his own person, by reason of that inconvenience of
his having many Wives (which in <hi>China</hi> is the ordinarie hindrance and
obstruction in men of that <hi>Qualitie</hi>) neverthelesse he would have his
whole Familie Baptized; and he himself, after he had setled and jousted
his affaires, as was requisite for that purpose, was Christened also, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Leo;</hi> and is the same who is so frequently mentioned in the yearly
Letters, for his Pietie and zeal, and for being one of the Supporters and
Pillars of that Christianitie, carrying himself in such manner, that by his
example and perswasion he gained many persons of Qualitie to our holy
faith; among which number a grave person, named <hi>Michael,</hi> was one,
who is also often mentioned in the letters; and of whom we shall speak,
when it commeth to his turne.</p>
                     <p>When he was now become a <hi>Christian;</hi> he governed in severall places
of the Kingdome, but alwayes with that observance, which was due to
the Religion he professed. Among other honourable employments, he
had the Office of <hi>Tauli</hi> (which is a place of great honour and profit)
in the Citie of <hi>Caoye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> in the Province of <hi>Nankim,</hi> he found in the Palace
there, a Chappel full of Idols, which the curiosity, or devotion of his
predecessours, had preserved and adorned with extraordinarie care and
and cost. The devout <hi>Leo</hi> judging it not convenient to have such ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in the House where he dwelt, commanded his Servants, to throw
down those Idols from the Alters where they stood, and to hew them to
pieces with Hatchets, and after that they were given to the Cook, to
consume them in the fire with all their Gold about them. The officers
of his Tribunall, as Secretaries, Sergeants, and others were astonished at
it, and looking one upon another, said, sure our <hi>Caoye,</hi> (for so they call
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64464:105"/>
their <hi>Mandarine) is out of his witts;</hi> not understanding that indeed he had
shewed this more in that particular, than in any other.</p>
                     <p>After he had served his King many years, he thought good to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that he might more fervently &amp; devoutly serve the King of heaven.
He went therefore to his house in the City of <hi>Hamcheu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> where he dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himselfe with his whole heart to the affairs of his salvation. He built
a new Church and House for the Fathers, which was very requisite in so
vast and populous a City, although we had then another there at the
same time. This stood so neer his owne House, that it gave him a continual
occasion to converse very frequently with the Fathers; which was his only
delight. And that he might wholly employ himself in the Service of that
new Christianity, he gave himselfe to Translate our Books; which is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way to introduce the understanding of our Sciences, and with them
the knowledge of our holy Faith. To this end he requested to have one of
the Fathers alwayes with him, who might give himselfe wholly to that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
There was assigned him accordingly, Father <hi>Franciscus Furtado,</hi>
by whose assistance he composed those books <hi>de Coelo,</hi> and Printed them at
his own charges, with the great applause of all <hi>China.</hi> He undertook after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to have set out a <hi>Logick,</hi> which he had finished and reviewed, &amp; was
ready for the presse, when the Lord was pleased to give him the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of his pious zeal, by calling him to a better life, after he had received
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and testified much resentment of the Mercy of God, and
many hopeful signs of his owne salvation.</p>
                     <p>Returning now to the Fathers, whom we left at Court; there, where
their Affairs prospered every day more and more, the Lord being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to comfort them, by letting them see the fruit of their labours, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the esteem of our Holy Faith every day more than other among
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> many continually turning <hi>Christians,</hi> and the reputation of
the Idols growing every day lesse and lesse, by reason of the many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
which the professours of their Sects, held with the Fathers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were not only vanquished, but even confounded by the Truth.</p>

at Xaocheu.</head>
                     <p>VVHilest our affaires at Court prospered, and the Fathers used their
utmost endeavours to settle their abode there, in the meane time
the Fathers, who resided in the houses of the other Provinces, omitted
no opportunitie to promote the preaching of the holy Gospel, and had
very good fruit of their labour: neither did the enemy of mankind cease
to shew how much he resented, to have so many soules taken out of his
clutches; neyther was he slow to invent new disturbances and troubles.</p>
                     <p>The House which we had in the Province of <hi>Canton,</hi> in the City of
<hi>Xaocheu,</hi> increased every day in the number of new <hi>Christians,</hi> and in the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64464:106"/>
remarkable conversions of many considerable personages; among whom
were three <hi>Mandarines,</hi> in the manner of their behaviour, with examples
of vertue far surpassing the carriage of <hi>Neophytes,</hi> or new Converts. In fine,
there was a great Gate opened to the Gospel, but in like manner to many
adversaries also.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Nicolaus Longobardus</hi> was employed in this conversion; and
when he endeavoured with the greatest fervour and zeale to drive all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
out of the Houses of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> behold there cometh one into
his House, brought upon mens Shoulders in a long procession; who,
with a great deale of noise and stirre, demand Almes for the Fabrique
of a Temple, that was to be built for it. Every one seeth the danger
of that demand, but Christian valour exposing it self to all events, did va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly
repulse that charge: and although the noise was great, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
importunate, and their out-cries reaching even to heaven, yet the
Lord not permitting them to do any other violence, they went their
wayes without getting any thing of him.</p>
                     <p>In the Villages, the <hi>Letteratie</hi> were stark mad against the Christians. In
the Citie the report was every where divulged, that in their journey to
<hi>Pekim,</hi> the Fathers, who went toward the Court, were apprehended and
imprisoned by the <hi>Eunuch Mathan,</hi> out of whose hands, if ever they
went alive, it would be after a very severe chastisement. And as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
makes his advantage of every thing, there was added to this another
worse report, by reason on the Scene was laid neerer hand; which was, That
our Fathers were banished out of the Citie of <hi>Xaokim,</hi> and that all they
who had turned <hi>Christians,</hi> were apprehended and chastised. It is not to
be beleeved how much this newes disturbed the people, and troubled
the Fathers; and so much the more, by reason this prattle had some foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of truth. But as truth doth still prevaile in the end, so this tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
lasted not very long; but seemed rather to give place to new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which were prepared against us.</p>
                     <p>There happened to be a great drought that year, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had
many times offered Prayers and Sacrifices unto their <hi>Pagods,</hi> but all was
to no effect: and not knowing what to do more, they consulted with an
old woman, who was a <hi>Pythonisse,</hi> asking her the reason, why it did not
raine, and why the <hi>Pagods</hi> did not give an ear to their just prayers in that
common necessitie. She answered, because there are many, who burn the
Ribs of <hi>Con Him</hi> (which is the name of a Female Idoll,) meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that they who turned <hi>Christians</hi> did burn the <hi>Idols</hi> which formerly
they worshipped in their Houses: with this answer of the old woman, as
if she had been an oracle, it is not to be beleeved, into what fury and
madnesse the <hi>Gentiles</hi> fell: so that if they did not set fire on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
Houses, it was only for feare of the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> but they swore
to kill the Father, if ever he came againe.</p>
                     <p>In the Citie the <hi>Bonzi</hi> not being able any longer to endure, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the rage which they had conceived against the Fathers, nor to see
the smoke of the Idols, which were burnt every day by those who were
converted, conspiring with many more of the people, resolved to put an
end once for all to this businesse, they framed a divellish Petition, wherein
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64464:106"/>
they touched such poynts, that were able to put fear into any Magistrate
whatsoever; and so much the more, because some of those things, which
they said there were true, at least in part, and could not be denied; as that
they were strangers; that they perswaded people to live after their way,
and to observe their law; that they assembled congregations, which is a
dangerous thing in <hi>China,</hi> for feare of Insurrections. To these they added
many other things, in confirmation of their opinion. The <hi>Memoriall</hi> was
presented to the Officers, neither was it received with an ill will. But the
Lord, who alway assisteth his servants, and with his divine Providence
helpeth them out of their greatest straits, kept a strong winde in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to dissipate these clowds.</p>
                     <p>This was a grave <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who exercised the office of <hi>Tauli</hi> in that
City, who undertooke our defence; and with a speech which he made to

                        </gap>y and honesty of the
Fathers, of their good manner of life and conversation, and of the security
which was in them, quieted and appeased this tempest. Of so great power
upon all occasions is the authority of one who governeth: and in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
wherein, according to their manner of Government, one would
have thought, that this <hi>Tauli,</hi> should have been our greatest adversary, it
pleased the Lord by his means so farre to quiet all disturbances, that they
made no small advantage, even of these temptations.</p>
                     <p>Their affaires continued thus, between tempests and calmes; which
latter commonly were of the shorter continuance: and to conclude the
History of this House, I will only relate two notable passages concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
                     <p>About this time the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did infest <hi>India,</hi> and were come as farre
as <hi>China</hi> with a designe to gaine a Port in that Kingdom, and particularly
to take, if they could, the City of <hi>Macao<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> as they did afterwards attempt to
do, according as I have already related. Upon this occasion that City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to fortifie it selfe, as afterward it did, and although the designe did
not take effect at that time, yet those beginnings and preparations of warre
were sufficient to make the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> (who are timorous and suspicious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by nature) to beleeve that the <hi>Portughesses</hi> had some designe on foot
against them. This suspicion was encreased by the coming of Father
<hi>Lazarus Catanaeus</hi> out of <hi>China</hi> to <hi>Macao</hi> at the same time. He was a man
somewhat corpulent by nature, and of a tall stature, and of a bold and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mind or aspect, and was now become more venerable by reason of his
long beard; so that to any one who was not acquainted with him, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
fitter to carry a Pike than a Breviary. The <hi>Chinesses</hi> were perswaded
that this Father had a designe, to make himselfe Master of their Kingdom,
and that the <hi>Portughesses</hi> had chosen him for their Captain in that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise;
partly in consideration of his person, and partly for the knowledge
he had of the waies in that Country, by reason he had been in both the
Courts; adding with all, that there would arrive very shortly two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to their assistance, one from <hi>India</hi> of <hi>Portughesses,</hi> the other from <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appon</hi>
of <hi>Giapponesses,</hi> who are their deadly enemies: and that the Fathers,
who were the companions of Father <hi>Lazarus,</hi> were gone before into the
Kingdom, partly as spies, and partly to stirre up the people to take part
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64464:107"/>
with their designes. A malicious but ridiculous invention of the Devil,
as if 4 or 5 poore religious men, with a handfull of <hi>Christians,</hi> had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to conquer so powerfull a Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>This rumour began by little and little, till at length, (as is usuall in such
cases) it grew so strong in the beliefe of the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> that as many of them
as dwelt in <hi>Macao<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> either Merchants or Inhabitants, fled all away to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
Whereupon they of the Province of <hi>Canton</hi> gave themselves for half
lost, and being filled with frights and terrours, they made no question but
the businesse was very certain. The newes had already arrived to the <hi>Vice-roys</hi>
eares, who in hast made great levies both for sea and land. In the
principall City of the Province, all the Houses were caused to be pulled
downe, which were built along the wall on the outside, which were very
many, and the poore people received an excessive losse by it. The gates
which opened towards <hi>Macao</hi> were walled up with lime and stone, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the walls were placed Sentinells to keep watch both night and day. A
proclamation was published, which under very great penalties did prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
all manner of commerce with <hi>Macao,</hi> and that no stranger whatsoever
should be admitted, and in particular not Father <hi>Catanaeus,</hi> who was he,
that was to make himselfe King. In this manner was the <hi>Metropolis</hi> infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with a military heat, while the neighbouring Cities were ready to
die for feare.</p>
                     <p>Who would ever have doubted, that a fire so unfortunately begun,
should not have reached as farre as our Residence of <hi>Xaocheu,</hi> a City of the
same Province, and not very farre from the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and should not
there have burnt up whatsoever it found in it, together with all our other
Houses in that Kingdom? They rushed suddenly into the House with such
a fury as you may easily believe them to be in upon such occasion: they
made a very strickt search, and turned every thing upside downe, to see if
they could finde any armes, and having not found what they sought for,
having imagined to finde a <hi>Magazine</hi> or Armory there, the tumult began
to cease, and the people went out of the House: neverthelesse they set
guards upon us for their greater securitie; and from this time that fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be extinguished.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vice-roy</hi> had already given order to the Captain Generall of that
Province, whom they call <hi>Tum Pim,</hi> that with all the strength of the
Country he should fall upon <hi>Macao,</hi> and that he should sack and destroy it.
But he, like a prudent man, would not put himselfe upon an enterprise of
so much hazzard and danger (for the <hi>Portughesses</hi> would not have suffered
themselves to have been so easily destroyed, as they shewed afterwards
against the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> a people of another manner of valour than the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>)
before he had received better and more certain information. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he sent spies to <hi>Macao,</hi> who went up and downe the City very freely;
for by reason they had no suspicion of any thing, all passages were free and
open. When the spies had remained in all libertie in <hi>Macao,</hi> as long as they
though fit, they returned with certain intelligence, that there was not any
preparation for warre in <hi>Macao,</hi> no levies of Souldiers, nor any signe of
that newes, which had been spread abroad; but all was in peace &amp; quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
save only that the City was divided into two factions, by reason of
some particular quarrels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:64464:107"/>
Upon this intelligence he did forbeare to put the <hi>Vice-roys</hi> orders in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
and in the mean time things began to be better cleared, and the
truth to appeare. The Citizens of <hi>Canton</hi> did open their gates, and their
feares began to blow over and every thing to settle in a great deale of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes,
which was much promoted by the coming of that <hi>Mandarine,</hi> of
whom we have formerly made mention, that he did appease another tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
against the Fathers in the City of <hi>Xaocheu.</hi> He had been at the Court,
and was returned from thence, upon the occasion of his being promoted
to an Office. He, upon the acquaintance he had formerly had with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and especially by reason of the new friendship he had contracted
with the Fathers at <hi>Pekim,</hi> with whom he had had a very great familiarity,
absolutely setled all those distempers there for that time; for this Province
is like a Turbulent sea, for there, stormes are never wanting, one still suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
another, untill they had utterly ruined our House at <hi>Xaocheu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was the year of our Lord 1613, when the people of this City, after
many contrasts, (whether it were that their sinnes did render them unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of those mercies the Lord would have conferred on them, or that the
Lord was pleased by this means to provide the Fathers a more quiet and
secure abode) conspired in that violent manner against the Fathers, that
the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> (not being able to resist the fury of the <hi>Litterati,</hi> the <hi>Bonzi,</hi>
and the common people, who with one accord cryed our against the
strangers,) did banish them by a publick sentence pronounced against
them, which notwithstanding had thus much of good in it to them, that
the banishment was not out of the Kingdom, as they did very much feare
it would be, but seemed rather a confinement to detain them in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>They pillaged our house, and committed other such insolences, as are
usuall upon the like sentences, and with such persons. They placed over
the doore in signe of their victory a stone with a long inscription on it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Fathers, and our holy faith. But when things began to close,
the <hi>Christians</hi> procured one night to have it peckt over with an iron toole,
and so defaced it, that it was never after to be read.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers departed from that City with great contentment of the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> and a greater resentment of the <hi>Christians</hi> who wept all downe
right: and going up the river towards the North, they arrived in a few
daies at <hi>Mount Muilin,</hi> where the Source and Head of that river riseth. At
the foot thereof lyeth the City of <hi>Namhium,</hi> which terminateth that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
Here the Lord was pleased, that their Barque should rest, like that
of <hi>Noah</hi> on the Mountaines of <hi>Armenia.</hi> And without asking any leave,
or desiring the favour of any <hi>Mandarines,</hi> only putting their trust in the
Lord, they hired a house in that City, (where it was not hard for them to
find one for their turne) without the molestation or prohibition of any
one whatsoever; for when the Lord will have a thing come to passe, all
is easie, even without pains and industry. There they lived with that little
which they had saved out of their shipwrack at <hi>Xaocheu,</hi> and drest up a
Chappell in their house: and as the report of the arrivall of these strangers
began to raise their curiosity, so the concourse of the people, and their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits
to them did open a doore to the preaching of the Gospell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:64464:108"/>
So that Father <hi>Gasper Ferrera,</hi> who had been with them in the late
troubles, presently began to baptize some of them. And the year follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,
as I passed by that place, to go to <hi>Nankim,</hi> there was, although not
a numerous, yet a good and well instructed <hi>Christianitie,</hi> who enjoyed all
peace and quietnesse, untill the year 1616, when the persecution at <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi>
began.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the progress of the Christian religion at the two
residencies of Nancham and Nankim, and of
the death of Father Mattheus Riccius.</head>
                     <p>THe Fathers <hi>Emmanuel Dias,</hi> and <hi>Ioannes Soerius</hi> laboured with very
good fruit in the residence of <hi>Nancham,</hi> which is the principall City
of the Province of <hi>Kiamsi:</hi> and although the greatest part of the <hi>Christians</hi>
were but of the common people, yet there were some also of the <hi>Nobilitie,</hi>
and of the <hi>Kings kindred,</hi> who were baptized, and carried themselves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
exemplarily to the edification of all the rest. I have since known some
of them, who did very much benefit that <hi>Christianitie</hi> by the good pattern
and example of their lives; and when I departed from <hi>China, Don Pedro</hi> was
then living, who is so often mentioned in the yearly letters, for having
carried himselfe like a good <hi>Christian</hi> upon all occasions, and even in the
torments which he sustained with great constancy; his house many times
affording a Sanctuary to the Fathers, and a Church to the <hi>Christians,</hi> who
went commonly thether during their troubles, and persecutions, which
were not wanting there; neither did they faile to produce that fruit, which
they are wont to do in new <hi>Christianities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There dwell in this City many of the Kings kindred, who for the most
part are very insolent; partly by reason of the authority of their blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
partly by reason of the idle and easie life they lead. These did often give
the fathers much trouble, and one time were resolved to surprize the
house, where they lived, and to turne them out of the City, and had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
so farre in it, that there is no doubt, but that they had put their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in execution, had not the Governour of the City been changed; who
having ended his time resigned his place to another, who although he was
new in that Office, yet was not new in the acquaintance of the Fathers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Litterati</hi> (who when they have only taken their first degree of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelour,</hi>
are another sort of troublesome people) had undertaken to oppose
the <hi>Christian</hi> religion, and to persecute the Preachers thereof; as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
they did many times, but once in particular, many of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
together to pluck up this evill weede, as they called it, by the roots,
framed a <hi>Memoriall,</hi> wherein they named some of the Fathers by their
names, and affirmed that they were <hi>Traytours</hi> to the King, and that upon
this designe they had dispersed themselves into five severall Provinces.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64464:108"/>
that they kept a constant correspondence one with another; that they
went up and down the Rivers to rob and assassinate the people; that they
taught men not to reverence the Images of their ancestors, and not to
worship the <hi>Pagods,</hi> but brake and burned them; that they seduced the
ignorant people, and taught them to worship a <hi>Moor</hi> (for so in that Province
they call the <hi>Europaeans</hi>) saying, that he was the true God; that they made
assemblies and meetings, and hindred people from following their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
that they had almost perverted the whole Citie; and though at the
beginning there were but a few of their Sect, yet now they were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to 20000. In fine, they said many other things, which sounded so
ill, that there was none who doubted but that they would be sufficient
wholly to extirpate the <hi>Fathers;</hi> beside their adversaries were many, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in one Body, and <hi>Litterati</hi> too, who knew very well how to use their
pen, and are commonly the better heard for that reason.</p>
                     <p>They presented their <hi>Memoriall</hi> to the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> who received it, and
cited the <hi>Fathers</hi> to their <hi>Tribunal;</hi> where they were examined about
their life and manners, and concerning the doctrine, which they preached.
They gave an account of themselves, and were also very well heard.
They brought along with them the <hi>Catechism</hi> which they taught, printed
in the <hi>Chinesse</hi> Language, and presented it to the <hi>Mandarines</hi> in stead of a
<hi>Memoriall.</hi> This was so well looked upon, that they, not only admired
therein the foundation and principle of all vertues, but also greatly
praised the precepts of the <hi>Ten Commandments.</hi> In fine, the businesse went
so well, and so contrary to what their adversaries did hope and expect,
and so much in favour of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that the <hi>Law of God</hi> was publickly
commended and approved by the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> themselves; and the abode
of the Fathers in that City confirmed by a publique sentence, and drawn
up in writing, which till that time could never be obtained; and the <hi>Crosse</hi>
of <hi>Christ</hi> triumphed in spite of all the Devils in Hell; and from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they that were Christians already, enjoyed all the liberty they
could desire, and they that had a mind to turne Christians, could do it
without any caution or secrecie: and truly there were many of them that
proved examples of great edification; and though I do purposely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to mention them for brevities sake, yet I will relate one belonging to
the same residence, because it was told me by the same <hi>Christian</hi> himself,
a little before my departure for <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was standing one day, in the <hi>Church</hi> which we have in this City,
when I saw a man come in thither to say his prayers, and not knowing
him, I stayed till he came out, and then I asked him, who he was: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>Father,</hi> I am a Christian, and was born in this City, but am by
profession a Merchant in <hi>Nankim,</hi> and at certain times I come hither to see
my Parents, &amp; then I come to <hi>Church</hi> according to my dutie. I asked him;
who did Baptize him? He answered me, Father <hi>Iohn della Rocca:</hi> And it
was, said he, in this manner; I had been sickly many yeares, and had spent all
my poor fortune upon the Physitians without receiving any help from
them, my friends used to visit me, and among them two <hi>Christians,</hi> who
one day being moved with compassion towards me, told me that I should
do well to turn <hi>Christian,</hi> and it might be, that the Lord would grant me
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64464:109"/>
my health. I answered them, If your God would restore me my health, I am
content to turn <hi>Christian.</hi> They went presently to the <hi>Father</hi> to ask him
for a little Holy water, to give me to drink, hoping that it would have a
good effect. But the <hi>Father</hi> answered them, If he have a desire to turn
<hi>Christian,</hi> let him do it, and our Lord will send him health, if it be his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and if he do not, yet at least let him take care of the health of his
Soule, which is more necessary than that of the body. As for miracles, the
Lord doth them only when he pleaseth; and if upon this occasion he
should not do a <hi>Miracle,</hi> then would that <hi>Gentile</hi> despise and undervalue
our religion. They returned to me sufficiently disconsolate, but I was
much more dejected when I heard that answer. About two days after,
the same two <hi>Christians</hi> being with me, there came in another called <hi>Peter,</hi>
with whom I was also acquainted; and he was a very zealous and fervent
<hi>Christian.</hi> They told him what had happened to them with the <hi>Father;</hi> but
he replyed, What need have we of the Father for this matter? I have holy
water my self at home; let us give him some of it, and I hope our Lord
will grant him his health. He went presently home, and fetched a little
of it; they gave it me, and I drank it; and not long after I perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
and that which many medicines were not able to do in so many
years, the <hi>Holy water</hi> did in a very short time. I went presently to <hi>Church,</hi>
to render thanks to the Lord for that great mercy he had shewed me; and
after I had been well <hi>Catechised</hi> and instructed in the principall matters of
our <hi>Holy Faith, I was Baptized.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have made choise of this example in particular, because it was rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to me by the person himself, to whom it happened, although there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wanted many others of the like kind, wherewith the Lord doth favour
that <hi>Church,</hi> strengthen the <hi>Christians,</hi> and comfort the Preachers
thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Residence of <hi>Nankim</hi> did this while enjoy a perfect peace and
tranquilitie; and the Fathers gained a great deale of credit and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and were much esteemed by severall of the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> who did
greatly favour them. The number and devotion of the Faithfull encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
every day; and for the greater help thereof there was founded a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> with those effects and fruits, which are usually
obtained by her.</p>
                     <p>Diverse persons of very considerable qualitie did present themselves
to receive <hi>Holy Baptism,</hi> among whom <hi>Kui Tai Zo</hi> was one; who indeed
was worthy of all praise, for the great paines he took in this Citie to assist
the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and for the many advantages he gained them by his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
This man, notwithstanding that he was our intimate friend, did still
persist in his <hi>Heathenisme,</hi> and although he commended our <hi>Holy Law,</hi>
and approved the Truth and Certainty thereof, yet he thought it very
troublesome to observe; a conceit which doth usually with-hold very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from the undertaking of it. But at length having overcome himself and
all other difficulties, he was Baptized, and called <hi>Ignatius,</hi> making his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and publick profession so resolute and devoutly, that he did much
comfort the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and encourage the rest of the Faithfull: neither was
he content only to recite it, but gave it in writing as a pledg of his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64464:109"/>
resolution, the which for the publick edification I have thought fit
to insert in this place, and it saith thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Kui Ignatius</hi> born in the second Moon of the year called <hi>Ciea,</hi> (which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the month of <hi>March,</hi> in the year 1549) in the Citie of <hi>Ciancieu,</hi> of the
Countrie of <hi>Sucieu,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Nankim,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Yamin</hi>
(for so they call the Kingdome of <hi>China</hi>) I being drawn by a profound conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and moved by a most sencible sorrow for my sinnes, do desire to ask par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of almightie God, that he might give me the saving water of <hi>Baptism</hi> for to
cancell them, and that he would grant me sufficient grace to enter into his most
<hi>Holy Law.</hi> I consider with my self, that being now 57 years of age, I have had
eyes all this while, and yet have never looked into his <hi>Holy Law:</hi> I have had
eares, and yet have never heard of his <hi>Sacred Name;</hi> but on the contrary have
followed the Sect of <hi>Scechia (which is the name of a very famous Idoll)</hi> and
although I understood, that it was repugnant both to truth and reason, I did
very much enlarge and spread abroad that superstition, the which I acknowledge
to be my very great fault, and almost Infinite sinne, which without doubt did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
no lesse than the lowest depth of Hell. Of late years it was my good fortune
to meet with the Masters of the truth, who came from the great <hi>West, Mattheus
Riccius</hi> and <hi>Lazarus Catanaeus</hi> together with their Companion <hi>Sebastian Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandes.</hi>
These were the first that did open unto me the <hi>Mysteries of Divine
truth:</hi> and now again of late, I mett with <hi>John Della Rocca</hi> and his Companion
<hi>Frances Martinez.</hi> These did confirm me in the beleef of those things I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
heard; by meanes of these Masters I learned, that Heaven and Earth, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
and all other things were made by <hi>God</hi> and that all things have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependance
on him; and are necessarilie subject unto his commands: that no other
Sect, or law, whatsoever besides this, is conformable to truth; that sinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
only by God by the intermission of his Ministers; that by him only the joyes
of Heaven are conferred upon such, who have a true and syncere sorrow for their
sinnes: and because I beleeve that by these meanes a man may obtain from God,
Grace and other benefits, I beseech his <hi>Divine Majestie,</hi> that he would so fill me
with his truth, that I may put it in execution by good works, and may be able
with a constant and firme resolution to worship the <hi>Heavenly Majestie</hi> and to
conforme my self to his Holy precepts and ordinances. And from the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I shall receive <hi>Baptisme,</hi> which cleanseth and washeth all filth and unclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
from the Soule, I do promise by his Grace for the time to come, wholly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
out of my thoughts the Sect of the vain and false <hi>Gods;</hi> as also their
doctrines, which are repugnant to reason; and to take care, that my thoughts do
not in any wise runne after the superfluous desire of riches, the vanitie of the
world, or the false and foolish pleasures thereof. I will obey the <hi>Sovereign
Lord</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> of all things, and will follow the direct way of his law; and by
a constant watch upon my sences, I will endeavour, as much as is possible for me,
to reduce the light of that reason, which God hath given me, to its former <hi>Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,</hi>
I will begin with my self, and afterward communicate unto others, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of those Graces I shall receive from his bountifull hand.</p>
                     <p>For as much as appertaineth unto the <hi>Articles of our Faith,</hi> although I am
not able to comprehend the greatnesse of each Mysterie, neverthelesse I do from
my heart submit my self to them; and do firmly believe whatsoever is
contained in them; beseeching the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that he would illuminate my
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64464:110"/>
understanding with his light, that I might be the better able to comprehend
them. Now therefore, since I have begun again to feele the first impressions of
<hi>faith,</hi> my heart is like a tender eare of corne, which is not yet come to its maturity,
wherefore I beseech the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> that she will grant me strength and
courage, by her <hi>Intercession</hi> for me with <hi>God her Sonne,</hi> that this my firm
purpose &amp; constant resolution might never be staggered or shaken: that he would
open the powers of my soule, and grant me a cleane and pure heart: That he would
open my mouth to declare his <hi>Divine law</hi> through the whole Kingdom, to the end
that none might be ignorant of the <hi>law</hi> of the <hi>True God,</hi> or refuse to give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to it.</p>
                     <p>This was the profession in writing of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> There was also baptized
in this house by the hands of Father <hi>Iohn della Rocca,</hi> who was superiour
thereof, <hi>Doctour Paul,</hi> whose life we shall set downe more at large toward
the end of this relation, and who may justly be called the pillar of the
<hi>Christianitie</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> who was so much celebrated in the yearly letters, so
eminent in dignitie and honour, having borne the highest office of the
Kingdom, that is, of <hi>Colao;</hi> so zealous in the Christian religion; so exact
in the observance of it; so humble; so vertuous and holy, that every great
thing may worthily be said of him.</p>
                     <p>This seed of the <hi>Holy Gospel</hi> was not contained within the walls of the
City of <hi>Nankim,</hi> but spread it selfe over the Province of the same name;
for upon the occasion of <hi>Dr. Pauls</hi> turning <hi>Christian,</hi> and of his Fathers
death, at what time he went to <hi>Scianhai</hi> to celebrate his funeralls, Father
<hi>Lazarus Catanaeus</hi> went thether, partly to visit him, and partly to see how
that Countrie was disposed to receive the word of God. His journey had
such good successe, that presently after one <hi>Masse,</hi> there were fifty <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi>
and in two years after the number was encreased to two hundred: the
example of <hi>Dr. Paul</hi> being of great efficacy to that purpose.</p>
                     <p>There happened also at that time severall miracles; as, driving out of
Devills, healing of the sick, and such like, with which this new <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie</hi>
was watred, and the earth disposed to bring forth more fruit, such
as were afterwards, and are still gathered there at this day. There was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a house founded in that Towne; and it is now one of the best <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi>
in all <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilest the Fathers of the three Southerne Residencies, under went so
much paines and trouble, Father <hi>Mattheus Riccius</hi> was not idle at <hi>Pekim;</hi>
but rather was so busied, that he had scarce time to breath, partly for the
visits of the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> which he was also obliged to returne them, nor
could he have omitted it without injury and discourtesie; and partly with
the <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Catechumeni;</hi> and partly in composing those bookes,
which are so much esteemed by the <hi>Chinesses.</hi> In the mean while the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and esteeme of our religion was every day advanced, and the
number of <hi>Christians</hi> encreased by rare and miraculous events. One of the
<hi>Neophites,</hi> or new <hi>Christians,</hi> being delivered from death, which he was
unjustly condemned to suffer, by the apparition of a man, like unto the
Image of our Saviour, one night to that Judge, who was to confirme the
sentence, who commanded him to save the life of that <hi>Innocent:</hi> and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whose recovery was despaired of by the Physitians, were cured by
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64464:110"/>
the favour of the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> who visibly appeared to them, spake to them,
and conforted them.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding his great employments, Father <hi>Mattheus</hi> did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the other functions of his charge in the House, he being superiour and
having the care of the whole <hi>Mission,</hi> which he governed with great care,
prudence, and charity: by reason of these continuall paines and care which
he tooke, (or rather because the Lord was pleased to deliver his servant
out of the troubles of this life, to give him the reward of his sufferings) he
fell into a sicknesse, and although all humane means were applyed, and all
possible care used to save his life, yet all was to no purpose. He desired to
receive the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which accordingly he received with very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
and devotion: The Fathers desired his blessing before he dyed:
about many questions which they asked him, he gave particular answers
to all: among the rest, to one who asked him, Why he would leave them
at a time, when they had so great need of his company? He answered, I
<hi>leave you the gate open to great victories, which notwithstanding are not to be
obtained without great pains and combats.</hi> And so entertaining with discourse,
sometimes the Fathers, sometimes the new <hi>Christians,</hi> and very often rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up his heart and voice towards heaven, in amorous <hi>Colloquies,</hi> lying in
his bed, without any motion at all of his body, and closing his eyes, as if
he were entring into a sweet sleep, he gave up his soule into the hands of
his Maker, with the generall greife and resentment, not only of those of
the house, and of the <hi>Christians,</hi> but also of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they all calling
him, <hi>a perfect Man, a Saint, an Apostle.</hi> I will forbeare to speak any more
of him for brevities sake, by reason his life is already written in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Father <hi>Trigaltius.</hi>

us by the King, and of the progresse of the
Christian religion, untill the time of
the persecution at Nankim.</head>
                     <p>IT is a custom among the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> (as we have already related,) to have
a particular place appoynted for the buriall of their dead. The Fathers,
who had very hardly a place allowed them for to live in, were altogether
destitute of a place of Sepulture; wherefore they were in great doubt,
where they should bury the Father. But the Lord who is a guide unto his,
and who had a particular intention to honour his servant, put them upon
a very difficult undertaking, and as farre as I am able to judge by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of <hi>China,</hi> without his speciall assistance, altogether impossible. This
was to Petition the King, desiring his favour, to have a place assigned us
for the buriall of our dead. And because it was the Lord, who had first
set this businesse on foot, without any consideration of the great difficultie,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64464:111"/>
which they were like to find, they presently framed a <hi>Memoriall</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the King, wherein they laid downe the reasons, which moved
them to make this humble request.</p>
                     <p>The very passing of this <hi>Memoriall,</hi> according to the <hi>Stile</hi> which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
upon that occasion, seemed so impossible a thing, that the <hi>Colao</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
who desired to assist them as a friend, accounted it a very difficult
enterprise. Neverthelesse after they had recommended their businesse to
Almighty God, the Memoriall was presented to the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> to whose
office it belonged first to over look it, and the Lord was pleased to favour
us so farre, that it passed the <hi>Chancery</hi> without any difficultie, which at first
seemed to be the greatest. When it was presented to the King, without
doubt he that holdeth the hearts of Kings in his hand, did dispose and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
him to favour us, and he remembring the former Present, and the
Clock which he had alwaies by him, did referre it to the <hi>Colao,</hi> together
with many other petitions, according to the <hi>Stile</hi> of that Court, and he to
the Councell of Rites, because it was a businesse of strangers, which did
properly belong to them. But after they of that Councell had considered
it, they judged it to be a speciall favour of the Kings, and that it did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
belong to the Councell of the Kings <hi>Patrimonie.</hi> Wherefore they
did remit our <hi>Memoriall</hi> to them. Assoone as the Fathers understood this,
and knowing they had no friends in that <hi>Councell,</hi> and that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be expected from them without favour, they made such means,
by way of other friends, that the <hi>Memoriall</hi> was not only remanded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to the Councell of Rites, wherein the Fathers had severall friends,
but that they also did receive it, and passe sentence in favour of them, as
accordingly they did in this form.</p>
                     <p>Your Majestie hath given command, that the Councell to whom this businesse
did belong, should give their judgement concerning this petition. And it being
come into our hands, we have well considered the laws and constitutions of this
Kingdom, and we find one which saith: That if any of those <hi>Strangers,</hi> which
are wont to come into this Kingdom, should chance to die by the way; if he were a
subject or Vassall, <hi>(for sometimes there come Kings and Princes thither)</hi> and
were not yet arrived at the Court, the Treasurer of the Province, where he dyeth,
shall assigne him a place of buriall, where there shall be set up an inscription gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in stone, wherein shall be expressed the occasion of his coming hither.</p>
                     <p>There is also another law which saith, If a <hi>Stranger</hi> come into this Kingdom,
and die after he is arrived at the Court, if he have not received the Kings gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,
and reward, according to the usuall custome, the Governour of the City
shall defray the costs of his funerall: But if he hath received his gratuity, it shall
be done at his owne expence.</p>
                     <p>In order to these two laws (from which I cannot well see how an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should be drawne to favour our cause, because the Fathers had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
received their gratuity) the <hi>Mandarine</hi> knew so well how to make
up the businesse, and to find out so many reasons and conveniences to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that favour, which Father <hi>Iames Pantoia</hi> required of his Majestie, for
the buriall of his deceased companion, that assoone as the <hi>Memoriall</hi> came
againe into the Kings hands, he presently referred it to the <hi>Colao,</hi> that he
should give what answer to it he thought fit. The <hi>Colao</hi> drew it up in this
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64464:111"/>
forme, That it seemed very reasonable unto him, the strangers should have
that favour granted them, which they did desire. And so it was againe
brought to the King, who signed it with his owne hand, and put to it his
<hi>Fiat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This expedition put an end to our troubles; and the Fathers ceased not
to render thanks to Almighty God for that favour, which they were so
cleerly to owne from his goodnesse, and which was of so great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for the Fathers residence in that Court, and in the rest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that concession of the King, serving not only for a Sepulture for
their dead, but also for a license for us to remain there during our lives. For
he having granted us a place in that Kingdom, to lie in after our death, it
was manifest that he granted us also a place of abode there during life: and
the words of the Grant runne thus, <hi>To bury their Father</hi> Riccius <hi>and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</hi>
And accordingly they who die in that Court at this day are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in the same place.</p>
                     <p>Having overcome the first part of the businesse, (which was the most
difficult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) without any trouble, but rather with a great deale of ease and
facilitie, there remained still the second, which was the execution of it;
which could not want very much opposition: but by having many <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darines</hi>
to their friends, and by procuring the good will of others, with
some Sun-dialls of Ivory, (which the <hi>Chinesses</hi> do highly esteeme, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Pantoia</hi> had the skill of making them very exactly) our poverty not
being able to extend it selfe to any great matter, at length they overcame
the smaller difficulties, and the execution of their desires became more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
for them; especially the Fathers having the <hi>Colao,</hi> (who is able to do
any thing,) for their friend: who indeed was so well affected to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that Father <hi>Pantoia</hi> going a second time to visit him, to refresh his
memory, fearing lest the multitude of businesse, which lay upon him
might cause him to forget them, before the Father could open his mouth,
the <hi>Colao</hi> tooke him by the hand, telling him, that he did not forget his
businesse; but fearing least any delay might be prejudiciall to them, he had
past it himselfe, and sent it to the Governour with particular recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
although he thought it needlesse, because he knew him already
to be very well affected to the businesse, and that he had done the like to
severall other officers, through whose hands the businesse was to passe:
Upon the recommendations of a person of so great qualitie, the businesse
was not only received, but very much favoured. There was presently or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
given to the inferiour Officers, by whose hands it was immediately to
be dispatched, that they should finde out a proper place for that purpose:
who being alwaies very obedient to the commands of their superiours,
and knowing what haste the businesse did require, they went immediately
about it; and having found out foure places, which to them seemed all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
convenient, they came to the Fathers, and desired them that they would
be pleased to go and see them, and make choise of that which liked them
best, and then the King should be made acquainted with it.</p>
                     <p>Among these foure places, there was one very neere the walls of the
City, with a very faire and stately house and garden, which had formerly
belonged to one of the chiefe Eunuchs of the palace; who for I know not
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64464:112"/>
what crime was condemned to die; and was still kept a Prisoner. This man
before he was condemned, seeing he should certainly be ruined, and that
his whole estate would be confiscated to the King, had a design to save
this Garden, by putting it, as it were, into Sanctuarie; wherefore he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Gate thereof to be altered, turning it into an habitation of <hi>Bonzi,</hi>
and consecrated the great Hall for a Temple of Idols, setting over it this
Magnificent Inscription, <hi>The Temple of the Science of Goodnesse.</hi> This place
was very commodious, and having but one only <hi>Bonzo</hi> that lived in it, it
seemed to be, as it were, abandoned, and that there would be but little
difficultie in obtaining it. That place then being designed and chosen,
there was not wanting a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who hoping to draw something out
of the Fathers by it, was very earnest to have the place prized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but there
was another <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who presently took him up, and told him, that
the favours of Princes were above all price; and that they were not to be
put to an out-cry. The Governour having notice that we had found out a
place, &amp; who was the owner of it, presently drew up an Order in this form,
<hi>The Temple of the Science of goodnesse, for as much as it did belong unto an</hi>
Eunuch, <hi>who was condemned to death by the King, ought not to be bought with
money. Let the</hi> Bonzo, <hi>who dwelleth therein, be sent away, and the place presently
consigned to Father</hi> James Pentoia, <hi>and his companions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Order was executed in the form of a Sentence: and because
the <hi>Fathers</hi> did imagine, that the <hi>Bonzo</hi> would make some difficulty in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
got out of the place, after they had given thanks to the <hi>Governour,</hi>
they desired he would be pleased to send for the <hi>Bonzo</hi> to come before
him, and to command him to leave the Temple He dispatched presently
two men for him, who brought him away in much fear and doubt, what
might befall him, by reason of the great danger that men ordinarily runne
into by such visits. When he was come, the Governour commanded him
immediatly without any reply, that he should quit that habitation, and
seek out another. He obeyed him very willingly, being very glad the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
was not so bad as he had feared: and the very same day the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
having some other <hi>Christians</hi> in their company, took possession of the
Temple, House and Garden, giving thanks to the Lord for their good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
thinking the businesse to be now at an end; not fores<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eing the great
contrasts and oppositions, which they were afterwards to find.</p>
                     <p>The secrecie and expedition, with which this businesse was
carried, gave no time for news to come to the ears of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
what became of the Temple, which he still accounted to be his. But
assoon as it was understood abroad that it was granted to the strangers, it
is not to be imagined what complaints and murmures it occasioned in the
Kindred, friends and disciples of the <hi>Eunuch;</hi> and how all of them, some
one way, and some another, undertook to oppose it, and to use their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
power to have it revoked by the King.</p>
                     <p>First, there went a company of inferiour <hi>Eunuchs</hi> to the Temple, where
at that time they found only a Brother of the Societie; after a long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
they told him, that there were there severall goods and pieces of
Houshold-stuffe not comprehended in the Kings grant to them. And at
length before their departure, they made severall speeches to the Idoll,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64464:112"/>
some bidding him adieu for ever; for now they never hoped to have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to come thither again: another in great rage called him, Masse of durt
and dung, (although the Idoll were made of Chaulk, and gilt) telling
him, that seeing he had not strength enough to defend himself, he would
not hope for any assistance from him; professing to his face, that he was
not worthy of any honour; and that from hence forward he would not
shew any sign of gratitude or memorie towards him: others said, This
statue had formerly the name of another Idoll, which was afterwards
changed: behold, what revenge he taketh upon him that usurped it.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> of greater authoritie left no way nor meanes un-at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted;
they made their application to the chief <hi>Eunuchs</hi> of the Palace, as
also to the <hi>Mandarines</hi> without, and other persons of great power, that
they might carry on their intent. And truly they prevailed so far, that they
perswaded the <hi>Culikien</hi> to interpose his authority; who is Secretary (as they
call it) of the Puritie, chief of the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> and who hath the frequentest
accesse to the Kings person. But assoon as he understood, that it was
done by the Kings Order, he would meddle no more with the businesse.</p>
                     <p>There was not left any person of greater authoritie, but only the Kings
Mother, who was a very devout worshipper of Idols; by her meanes they
did endeavour to bring their design about; a certain <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who was
much in favour with her, being made the first mover of this revolution.
He told her with great lamentations, that a Temple of his Gods had been
taken away from him; that it was worth many thousands of Crownes;
that it had been given to certain strangers, who did not only render them
no worship nor respect, but did also destroy them; and that he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
they would break them in pieces and burn them; wherefore he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
besought her <hi>Majestie,</hi> that she would vouchsafe to speak a word
concerning it to the King. But she would by no meanes allow of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest:
and it was known afterwards, that she answered him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>What though the</hi> Temple <hi>be of that value you speak of? What is that in
comparison of the Kings Magnificence? the very mentioning of such a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
now the King hath done them that favour, if the strangers should but make
their complaint, would be sufficient to take away the life of that</hi> Eunuch, <hi>who is
in Prison, and already condemned.</hi> To conclude, in spite of all the powerfull
endeavours, in spite of all the craft and machinations which were used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, the determination of the businesse was in favour of the poor
strangers, who were protected by a Divine power; and so having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all difficulties and obstructions, the Fathers went to the Palace,
according to the usuall manner, to render Thanks to the King.</p>
                     <p>This place which was granted them, is distant from the gate of the
Citie, about a third part of a Mile; the building is very neat, and all of
Brick; and had not then been built above thirty years: it is reported to
have cost 14000. Crownes; which is an excessive summe in <hi>China.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Morning the Body of Father <hi>Riccius</hi> was brought thither, having
been already laid in a Coffin, which was very well closed, and varnished
over after the <hi>Chinesse</hi> Fashion. A great number of new <hi>Christians</hi> did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
it, with lighted Candles in their hands, following the <hi>Crosse</hi>
which was carried before very richly adorned; and for the present the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64464:113"/>
Coffin was put in a room on one side of the Chappel, that there might be
a convenience to performe those ceremonies, which were requisite after
the manner of <hi>China;</hi> after that, it was transferred to the <hi>Dormitorie</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
prepared for it. At the further end of the Garden there is a Chappell
consisting of six sides; it is made of brick, and vaulted. From the sides
come out two walls, built compassing in figure of a Semi-circle. This place
was chosen by the Fathers for a <hi>Coemeterie,</hi> round about it there are four
<hi>Cypresses,</hi> which are also among the <hi>Chinesses</hi> accounted mournfull and
funerall Trees: they seemed as if they had been planted there on purpose,
to shade the Tomb of Father <hi>Riccius,</hi> which was also built there of Brick;
and the chief Idol being beaten to pieces, served in stead of Lime, that the
Father might even after death, triumph in the destruction of Idols. They
caused the Chappel of Idols to be cleansed, and consecrated it to Christ
our Saviour. There was in the Hal a very stately Altar, whereon was placed
the principall Idol, all gilt from head to foot, of a vast bignesse, called by
the <hi>Chinesses, Ticam;</hi> and their conceit is, that he doth preside over the
earth, and all treasures; and is the very same with <hi>Pluto,</hi> having a Scepter in
his hand, and a Crowne on his head, just as we paint our Kings. On each
side of him stood foure Ministers, or Servants, all made of the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
on each side of the Hall were placed Two great Tables, upon each
of which stood five inferiour Kings of Hell; the same Kings were
also to be seen painted on the walls of each side, sitting on a <hi>Tribunall,</hi>
and condemning Sinners to the punishments and paines of Hell; there
were also to be seen Painted horrible Devils, carrying Instruments of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their hands; and likewise severall sorts of punishments which are
inflicted on the damned wretches, and their caverns full of flames, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
and terrible fiends. There was also Painted a great Ballance, and in
one of the Scales was to be seen a man laden with sinnes and wickednesse,
and in the other the book of prayers belonging to that Sect, which did
out-weigh all the Sinnes, and deliver him who doth frequently rehearse
them. There was also a River of fire, which swallowed up very many
men; over it there were two Bridges, one of Gold, and the other of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and over these did the Ministers of the Idols conduct men to places of
pleasure and delight. There were also to be seen some of the <hi>Bonzi,</hi> who
plucked their Fathers out of the flames and torments in despite of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and other such things, by which those Ministers did gain a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to themselves: and over every sort of torment there was this inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Whosoever shall call a thousand times upon the name of such an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll,
shall be delivered from this sort of punishment. All was thrown
down and destroyed by our Servants, who strove who should do it fastest;
by reason that the <hi>Chinesses</hi> do put into the bellies of their Idols, money,
<hi>Medals,</hi> and also Jewels. The walls were playstered over a new, and over a
new Altar was erected the Image of our <hi>B. Saviour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the day of all <hi>Saints</hi> the first Masse was celebrated there, with all
possible Solemnitie, and with sound of Organs and other instruments.
All the <hi>Christians</hi> were there present, and after a brief exhortation, the
body of Father <hi>Mattheus Riccius</hi> was carried to the place of Sepulture by
the chiefest of them, and followed by all the rest; particularly by Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour

                        <hi>Paul,</hi> who loved him as a Father, and there, with the ceremones of
the Church he was enterred, there having been first placed in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
another Image of our Saviour. The Fathers also built there another
little Chapple to the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> in a place convenient for that purpose; to
which they had obliged themselves by a vow, which they made when
they first undertook this businesse.</p>
                     <p>Finally over the first Gate they placed in two <hi>Chinesses</hi> Characters this
Inscription, <hi>By the Kings liberalitie;</hi> which among them is counted a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
honour than will here easily be beleeved. Curiosity brought many
thither, to see the accommodation they had made, which was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and admired by all: neither truly ought it to seem a small matter, that
in the face of the King and the Court, Alters should be overturned,
and Idols beaten to pieces by a few poor strangers, and that too, even
with approbation of the greatest officers. This extraordinarie Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
by the King upon us was shortly after divulged in <hi>Pekim,</hi> which
gave no small strength and vigour to our affaires there. Their houses were
more frequented, the Fathers better looked upon, and the fruits of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
daily encreased.</p>
                     <p>They had only foure <hi>Residencies</hi> at that time, which was in the year
1610, but they were so disposed, that they did as it were comprehend the
whole Kingdome from South to North, upon the great road from <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
to <hi>Pekim,</hi> but the Fathers desiring, after they had runne in a manner
from pole to pole, to follow also the course of the Sunne, and to exalt
the light of the Gospel through the East and Western parts, (where
there are many famous Cities,) the occasion was offered them by <hi>Doctor
Leo;</hi> for his Father being dead, he was forced to leave his government,
and to return into his Country to bury him; and to observe that Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which is required by the custome of the Country, wherefore he
took along with him some of the Fathers, partly for his own particular
consolation, and to instruct the <hi>Christians</hi> in his Familie, and to Baptise
such as had not yet been converted; and partly to endeavour to found a
house in that his native City of <hi>Hamcheu.</hi> The first happy encounter
there, was that of Doctour <hi>Yam,</hi> named afterwards at his <hi>Baptism, Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
who is much celebrated in our yearly letters. He was a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> of
great account, and a Kinsman of <hi>Doctour Leo,</hi> and had been for seaven
years together Chancellour of the whole Province of <hi>Nankim,</hi> which is
an Office of very great importance, and was very rich, of a great House,
and allyed to the principall Families of that Citie; and above all, he was
very devout towards the <hi>Pagods,</hi> in so much that he had built a Temple
for them within his own Palace, with a certain number of <hi>Bonzi</hi> to serve
them, whom he maintained at his own charges. But he did this more out
of ignorance than malice, and therefore the Lord shewed mercy unto
him. He was one of the first that visited the Fathers, and being very
much addicted to the defence of his Religion, he began a very hot dispute
with a more than ordinarie zeal for the upholding of his Sect; the which
he continued likewise the day following, and the next day, and so
for nine dayes together, alwayes producing new arguments
and proposing new difficulties; not that he had a design
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64464:114"/>
to impugn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, but only to discover the truth. The ninth day he yeelded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
crying out, <hi>A true God, A true Law, A true Doctrine.</hi> And after
he had been very diligently <hi>Catechised</hi> and instructed, he was <hi>Baptized,</hi> to
the great consolation of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and also of <hi>Dr. Leo,</hi> (who did much
rejoice at it; and to the singular griefe and shame of the <hi>Bonzi,</hi> who were
presently discarded, and their Temple converted into a Church dedicated
to the <hi>Saviour of the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now did these two <hi>Heroes</hi> seem two firme and stable pillars, very proper
to sustaine that infant Church, with a certain hope, that their example
would draw many others to the law of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that there would be a
flourishing <hi>Christianitie</hi> founded in that so populous a <hi>Metropolis,</hi> which in
my opinion is the richest, the most delicious and magnificent in Temples
and other structures of any in that Kingdom. But for the generalitie the
least disposed to receive our <hi>Holy faith,</hi> whether it were then for this cause,
or because their hour was not yet come, which required a greater dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
there was so little fruit of the Gospel at that time, that the Fathers
judged it better to give place to time, and for the present to leave that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode,
and to finde out some other place, better disposed to receive the
seed of faith. They proceeded so farre as to propose their intention to
Father <hi>Nicolaus Longobardus,</hi> superiour of that <hi>Mission,</hi> who would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
approve, nor reject their opinion, but remitted the businesse to the
judgement of the House at <hi>Nankim,</hi> where I was then at that time, and by
the grace of God, we were there in all, nine of the Societie. The matter
was debated, and it was resolved by all of us, that according as experience
had taught us, they should proceed with patience and longanimitie, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
difficulties having been overcome by those weapons. So without any
more thoughts of change, the <hi>Fathers</hi> remained labouring in that City, not
knowing the great good which the Lord had there prepared for them, and
which, time afterwards discovered; not only by founding there, one of
the most numerous and best instructed <hi>Churches</hi> that is in <hi>China<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that house was ever a safe Port to us in all Tempests, and a secure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
in all persecutions, as shall be seen hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Christianitie</hi> also was much encreased in <hi>Xa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Paul;</hi> for his Father and all his houshold had been <hi>Baptized,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
people of that place: and although we had there no setled house, there
was neverthelesse a Church, and every year the <hi>Christians</hi> were visited,
both to confirme the old ones, and convert new ones.</p>
                     <p>In the foure ancient houses, the <hi>Fathers</hi> said Masse, preached and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
the <hi>Mysteries</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of our <hi>Holy Faith,</hi> very quietly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any disturbance at all. The <hi>Christians</hi> exercised their devotion, and
many <hi>Gentiles</hi> endeavoured to finde the way of their <hi>Salvation,</hi> the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion</hi> flourished every day more and more, with an abundant number
of new <hi>Converts,</hi> and also of new <hi>Labourers,</hi> which were sent to us from
<hi>Macao,</hi> where they were first instructed in the language and custome of the
Country. In the mean time we were sent unto from many places and
from severall persons, to desire us to come into their Country, and to
preach the Gospel to them.</p>
                     <p>This City of <hi>Vamcheu,</hi> which is neere unto <hi>Nankim,</hi> had so great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64464:114"/>
to be made partakers of our doctrine, that the <hi>Litterati</hi> there wrot a
letter to Father <hi>Alphonsus Vagnone,</hi> in <hi>Nankim,</hi> where he was at that time
superiour, which was subscribed by forty of them, wherein they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
the Father to come to them, with many prayers and entreaties, and
very earnestly desired him, that he would not deferre his comming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; that
good which they so much longed for. They did also the like in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places; whether the fame of our <hi>Holy Faith</hi> was arrived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either by the
books we had printed there, or by the relation of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> (for these
do sometimes serve as a guide to the rest, and I had once one of them, who
did help me to <hi>Catechise</hi>) or else by their conversation with <hi>Christians</hi>
themselves. And this was done with so much fervour, that really it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to us, the time was come, wherein, after all storms and tribulations
were blown over, the winter was passed away, and the spring time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to appeare, bringing forth flowers worthy the sight of that celestiall
<hi>Gardiner;</hi> or rather, that the crop was now ripe, and expected a happy har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.
The <hi>Fathers,</hi> being animated with these successes, and well pleased
with the many occasions, which continually presented themselves, were
not sparing to make good use of them, hoping that they would have been
dayly encreased. But who is able to comprehend the judgements of the
Lord? Or who hath been his Councellour? Whilest things stood in this
prosperous condition, whether it were for the sinnes of that Kingdom, or
for ours in particular, or because the Lord was pleased to prove and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
his servants, there was raised in <hi>Nankim,</hi> (where that house was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with much quiet, and had continued in greater tranquility than the
rest) the following persecution.</p>

                        <p>THis <hi>Persecution,</hi> which was the most terrible of all we have yet suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
began in the year 1615 upon this occasion which I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
                        <p>There was this year sent from <hi>Pekim</hi> to <hi>Nankim</hi> a <hi>Mandarine</hi> called <hi>Qui

of all <hi>Rites, Sects, Strangers</hi> and such like. This man, besides that
he was extreamly averse both to our <hi>Holy Faith,</hi> and to the <hi>Fathers;</hi> and on
the contrary, very much addicted to the worship of Idols, he had been stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up by severall occasions, to beare a particular hatred towards us; First
by reason of a booke written against our religion by a <hi>Bonzo,</hi> an intimate
friend of his, which was so well confuted by <hi>Dr. Paul,</hi> that the <hi>Bonzo</hi> broke
his heart with the very griefe and shame he conceived at it. Moreover the
<hi>Bonzi</hi> of <hi>Nankim,</hi> had given him a handsome bribe, reported to be 10000
crownes, to drive us away; hoping thereby, that fire might be extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which had been kindled against their Gods. To these may be added
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64464:115"/>
the spleen he had against <hi>Dr. Paul</hi> and <hi>Dr. Michael,</hi> who discoursing with
him, the one in <hi>Pekim,</hi> and the other in <hi>Cechian,</hi> did by such powerfull ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>fy those Idols, he did worship, that, having nothing left to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for himselfe, he converted his silence into rage, and his shame into
venome. But his spite and malice was much more encreased, when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
that two <hi>Memorialls</hi> had been presented to the King, by two
<hi>Mandarines</hi> of great qualitie, wherein they did earnestly move the King,
that the Fathers might be perswaded to translate the books of <hi>Europe</hi> into
the <hi>Chinesse</hi> language, and that they should be employed in the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their calendar; <hi>Xin</hi> not being able to digest, that strangers should
be held in such esteeme, who were enemies to his sect, to the manifest
danger and ruine of his Idols: and last of all, that which did strongly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
him to that enterprise, was the ambition he had to be <hi>Colao,</hi> hoping,
that this his zeale for the ancient <hi>Rites,</hi> and for the religion of his <hi>Fathers,</hi>
would aduance him to that dignitie; especially since it belonged to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
to have a vigilent eye over such matters.</p>
                        <p>Therefore besides other things, which belonged to his charge and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
he caused a damnable <hi>Information</hi> to be drawne up against the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
proving therein by feigned and colourable reasons, that they ought to be
banished the Kingdom. He said they had intruded themselves into <hi>China</hi>
without leave, making use, for proofe thereof, of a certain <hi>Memoriall</hi> which
we have formerly mentioned to have been made by the students of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim,</hi>
wherein they besought the <hi>Mandarines</hi> to banish the <hi>Fathers</hi> out of the
Kingdom, as persons who were very pernicious to the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi>
and had secret <hi>Machinations</hi> against the King and Kingdom; for said they,
if it be not for this reason, for what other end and purpose are they come
with so much eagernesse and zeale into another world, and had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
their owne habitations and estates? The other <hi>Testimonies</hi> which he
brought, were other such like impostures, wherewith a neighbour of ours
in <hi>Nankim</hi> had furnished him; that many nights in the year, under pretense
of some solemnitie concerning the divine worship, there were many great
assemblies held in our house consisting of thousands of men and women (a
most grosse lie) and that before the break of day they all dispersed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to their owne houses; that every new <hi>Christian</hi> had given him five
false duckats, made by <hi>Alchimy,</hi> after he had been enrolled in a list, which
they kept of them, and that they had strange and barbarous names impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon them at their admittance, and were taught to make the signe of
the crosse upon their forehead, to serve them as a marke of distinction in
the time of their rebellion and insurrection. That they had their houses

                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of all these arguments put together he framed a</hi> Memoriall, <hi>which he
presented to the King in the</hi> Month <hi>of</hi> May 1616. <hi>The substance whereof
was.</hi> Our entrance by stealth into the Kingdome. The propagation of a Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that of the Idols, which had been the religion of their Ancestours. The
concurrance which there was in high Titles between our God and their King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our West and their East. Our subtletie and craft in gaining of friends. The
destruction of the <hi>Astrologie</hi> of <hi>China</hi> as false and erroneous, occasioned by the
reading of that of <hi>Europe, and such like things. The conclusion of it was,</hi>
                           <pb n="207" facs="tcp:64464:115"/>
That it was necessary for the publike good, that he should cause a generall <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre</hi>
both of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Christians,</hi> before their force and
number could prove dangerous to the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>To this <hi>Memoriall,</hi> which was presented to the King very secretly, there
was no answer returned within the usuall time. Neverthelesse, <hi>Dr. Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
had notice of it by means of a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who was a friend both to him,
and to the said <hi>Xin:</hi> he presently gave advise thereof to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> with
directions what they should do. He worte many letters to severall <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi>
in our favour, and one directed to <hi>Xin,</hi> wherein without discovering
that he knew his intention, he confuted all his arguments against the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
and their religion. Last of all, he invited the <hi>Fathers</hi> to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to his house in the City of <hi>Hamcheu,</hi> untill the storme were over. In
the mean time, we laboured to obtain the help and succour of Almighty
God, by re-doubling our prayers and mortifications; and withall, we went
to <hi>Dr. Leo,</hi> who lived two dayes journey off, and shewed him the <hi>Apologie</hi>
written by <hi>Dr. Michael</hi> for our assistance and counsell, to which he added
a discourse in commendations of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and of their eligion; and by
their hands he dispersed many advertisements necessary for that time and
occasion, throughout the whole City: neither were the <hi>Fathers</hi> wanting
with fervent exhortations to do the office of <hi>faithfull Pastours,</hi> animating
and encouraging all to suffer for the defence of Gods honour, and his <hi>Holy
Religion.</hi> And the <hi>Christians,</hi> striving who should prepare himselfe best
against the storme, frequented our house and the <hi>Holy Sacraments,</hi> and
tooke counsell how to carry themselves in case of <hi>Persecution.</hi> There was
among the rest a prudent and learned person named <hi>Iohn Vao,</hi> who had
prepared foure small banners, wherein he wrote his name, Sir-name, and
Country, and the <hi>Christianitie</hi> both of himselfe and of his familie; which
might serve him for ensignes of his profession in time of <hi>Persecution;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did he cease to declare himselfe to be such, and to exhort others to a
constant confession of their faith.</p>
                        <p>Three <hi>Months</hi> after the first <hi>Memoriall; Xin</hi> having received no answer
from the King, presented another to the same purpose by the hand of
<hi>Xamxù,</hi> who was <hi>Lipù</hi> of the third <hi>Tribunall</hi> in <hi>Pekim,</hi> having preswaded
him also to frame another of the same Tenour, and to present it along
with his. <hi>The Mathematician,</hi> who had perswaded the <hi>Fathers</hi> to correct
and amend the <hi>Chinesse Calendar,</hi> discovered their plot, and privately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a copy of their petitions, he gave it to the <hi>Fathers</hi> and to <hi>Dr. Paul,</hi>
who in one night wrote an <hi>Apologie</hi> for the <hi>Fathers</hi> to present to the King,
when there was occasion, and dispatched a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> his disciple, a
man very well versed in the manage of affaires at Court, to the <hi>President</hi>
of <hi>Lipu,</hi> that having sufficiently informed him of the truth, he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him not to favour the intentions of <hi>Xin.</hi> This <hi>President</hi> concealed
the venome he had in his heart under faire and specious promises; but in
effect, he gave in a most pernicious <hi>Memoriall,</hi> wherein he affirmed, That
the request of <hi>Xin</hi> was so just and necessary for the preservation of the
Kingdom, that for his part he should have thought he had done well, if
without expecting any other leave from the King, but only by the duty of
his place, he had dispatched orders throughout all the Provinces for the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64464:116"/>
extermination and banishment of all the <hi>Fathers,</hi> excepting only those of
<hi>Pekim,</hi> because he saw them well backt and supported; taxing by these
words both the King and the <hi>Mandarines</hi> who did protect them. The
<hi>Memoriall</hi> was so handsomely woven, and the words placed so equivocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he could have given them quite another interpretation, if need had
required.</p>
                        <p>These two <hi>Memorialls,</hi> the one of <hi>Xin,</hi> and the other of the <hi>President,</hi>
were presented on the fifteenth of <hi>August,</hi> and after that a third, that we
could get no intelligence of, till it was presented. On the twentieth of the
same month they were published, according to the <hi>Stile</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<hi>Curriers,</hi> throughout all the Provinces of the Kingdom, together
with a particular order from the <hi>President,</hi> for the imprisonment of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
The people were amazed to see three <hi>Mandarines</hi> conspire against
those, whom the whole Kingdom had admired, and whom almost all the
<hi>Letterati</hi> had respected, visited, and esteemed; but they well perceived,
that these accusations were but forged calumnies, which proceeded from
a corrupt and malicious spirit.</p>
                        <p>On the thirtieth of the same moneth, about midnight, by means of a
<hi>Currier</hi> dispatched for that purpose, by the <hi>Quoi</hi> of <hi>Pekim,</hi> the news came
to the <hi>Fathers</hi> in <hi>Nankim</hi> of what had passed at Court. Immediately they
ran to the Church, and presented themselves as Victimes and Sacrifices
unto the Lord; and afterwards packing up their Pictures, and the sacred
Vessels that belonged to the Church, they conveighed them thence into
the House of a <hi>Christian;</hi> hoping by that meanes to secure them. Assoon
as it was day, the <hi>Fathers, Nicolaus Longobardus</hi> superiour of the <hi>Mission,</hi> and
<hi>Iulius Lenis,</hi> departed towards <hi>Pekim,</hi> to give what assistance they were
able to the rest. There remained in <hi>Nankim</hi> the Fathers <hi>Alphonsus Vag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none</hi>
and <hi>Alvarus Semedo (the Authour of this Relation,)</hi> who expected e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
moment, when they should be seised on by the Sergeants and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.
Not long after, came three <hi>Mandarines</hi> to us from the President
of the Councell of warre, to give us notice, that that President and <hi>Xin</hi>
were deputed to put the Proclamation in execution, which had been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
issued for our banishment out of that Kingdom; neverthelesse, they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to condole with us, because, as they said, they were very well satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both of our innocence and deserts; yet advised us to give place wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to force, before we should be necessitated to undergo the discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
aud barbarous usage of <hi>Xin:</hi> and that the <hi>President</hi> would give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that we might not receive any affront, nor molestation in our journey;
also one of the three did advise us as from himself, that we should not
make too much hast, for that he hoped through our Innocence, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the <hi>Fathers</hi> friends at <hi>Pekim,</hi> these troubles would shortly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased.</p>
                        <p>Toward the evening, there was a company of Souldiers sent by <hi>Xin</hi> to
beset the House, and about the break of day, the first of September, there
appeared three Sergeants to apprehend the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and to search every
hole and corner of the house: and although they had a speciall order from
<hi>Xin</hi> to abuse and evill intreate the <hi>Fathers,</hi> neverthelesse they carryed
themselves very courteously, and sent in their message in writing to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64464:116"/>
Father <hi>Vagnone;</hi> which is a great poynt of <hi>Civilitie</hi> in <hi>China.</hi> They set a
guard upon the doores, and made an inventary of whatsoever they found
in the House.</p>
                        <p>In the meane while Father <hi>Vagnone</hi> sent a Christian, called <hi>Donatus,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence that he was our <hi>Caterer,</hi> to <hi>Father Longobardus,</hi> to tell him
what had happened, and to advise him to take heed, that he did not fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the enemies clutches. <hi>Donatus</hi> did his message, and returned with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for our supper in his hands, although he was jeared by the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that he would returne into the cage of his owne accord, yet he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that prison before the liberty he might have enjoyed elsewhere. For
at the very first rumour of the persecution, He returned to the house pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to serve us, being resolved either to live or die with us for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of that faith, of which (though he was of very young years) he was
so zealous and observant; having converted many; and in effect, God did
give him the grace to suffer much for his religion; both in imprisonment
and stripes, he was our constant companion.</p>
                        <p>When the inventary was finished, to the great edification of the Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
who did not expect to finde such povertie; and when they had seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our chests and whatsoever could be shut up, they carryed away Father
<hi>Vagnone</hi> in a sedan, and brought him before <hi>Xin,</hi> leaving Father <hi>Semedo</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sick in a chamber, which they had sealed up. Assoone as he was
brought out, there was a great noyse and shouting made by the meaner
sort of people, and so great a crowde, that the Officers were forced to
make their way by blowes. After they had gone two miles, they stayed
according to the orders which <hi>Xin</hi> had given, at the house of the <hi>Tauli,</hi>
who was a Kinsman of <hi>Xins,</hi> spending at least two houres in giving him
an account of what had passed: during which time, Father <hi>Vagnone</hi> was left
in the open street exposed to the injuries, scoffes and abuses of the insolent
people. At length the Sergeants being returned, made their excuses to
the <hi>Father,</hi> for their long stay; and so carried him to prison, recommending
him to the <hi>Gaolers,</hi> as an innocent person.</p>
                        <p>A little after, the chief of the Sergeants sent him from his House a
good Supper and a bed; the other Sergeants did also the like in their turns,
every one taking his day. There were two of our domestique Servants who
waited upon Father <hi>Vagnone</hi> in the prison; one whereof was called <hi>Ciam
Matthew,</hi> he was a very zealous <hi>Christian,</hi> and for three years before, had
retired himselfe to our house, that he might with more liberty serve God,
and waite upon the <hi>Fathers,</hi> without expecting any other recompense, but
that of the next life. This man, assoon as the Sergeants were come into
our house, presented himselfe first of all to give them his name, that he
might have the opportunitie to be carryed along with the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as in
effect he was, and gained a happy crowne by this <hi>Persecution.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the news of the imprisonment of Father <hi>Vagnone,</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with zeale, ran to our house, neither could the guards hinder some
of them from going in. The most zealous of all the rest was <hi>Iohn Yao,</hi> who
sticking in his cap one of the above mentioned banners, and holding up
in his right hand a scrowl of paper, wherein were contained the chiefe
heads of our religion, and the necessity of them, being asked by the guard,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64464:117"/>
what he meant by it, answered, To die with the <hi>Fathers</hi> like a <hi>Christian</hi> for
the faith of Christ. The Souldiers were much astonished at that answer;
yet they put a halter about his neck, and lead him to the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> where
being asked, what he was, answered boldly and with a loude voice. That
he was a <hi>Christian,</hi> &amp; that he came to give an account of the law of Christ,
if they would be pleased to hearken to him. They immediately caused
the halter to be taken from about his neck, and gave him a seat to rest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
on; much admiting his resolution and constancy, the like whereof
had not till that time been seen in <hi>China.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the mean time, <hi>Xin</hi> understanding that the Sergeants had left one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the house, and used the other civilly, was very angry, and reproved
them sharply for it, commanding them to go next morning to a garden,
which we had without the City for our recreation, telling them they
should finde there store of armes concealed; and at their returne to carry
the other <hi>Father</hi> to prison. They found nothing in the garden of what they
looked for; but they carried Father <hi>Semedo</hi> out of the house to prison, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with foure servants, and foure other <hi>Christians,</hi> who had come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the house, as also brother <hi>Sebastian Fernandes,</hi> and another student, who
was a native of the City of <hi>Macao.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>Nankim</hi> wrote an account of what had happened, to
<hi>Father Longobardus,</hi> who was departed for <hi>Pekim.</hi> The messenger over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
him in <hi>Cauxeu,</hi> where he presently consulted with <hi>Dr. Leo,</hi> who was
Governour at that time of two territories; it was resolved, that the <hi>Father</hi>
should go alone to <hi>Pekim,</hi> that he might the more easily be suffered to
passe, and that he should leave his companion there. He furnished him
with an hundred crownes to defray such expenses as should be requisite
for the making of their defence. He wrote also to severall <hi>Mandarines</hi> of
<hi>Nankim;</hi> and to the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> himselfe. He procured many letters from his
friends to others in the Court in favour of the prisoners: he comforted
them with letters, and mony, and cloaths against winter, which began to
grow very sharpe; neither was his fortitude inferiour to his charity, resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
valiantly his kindred and friends, who did every day set upon him to
perswade him to leave that so open defence and protection of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
which might prove so prejudiciall and dangerous to him; but he gave
them so good reasons for what he did, that they were all silenced, and he
and his whole family persevered in the way they had begun.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dr. Michael</hi> shewed himselfe no lesse zealous, assoone as he understood
the newes by the letters, which were sent him by the <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>Nankim</hi>
and <hi>Nanham;</hi> for he advised the <hi>Father</hi> who was at <hi>Hamken,</hi> (for the other
was gone to visit the <hi>Christians</hi> thereabouts) that he should get him gone
out of the City; which accordingly he did with many teares of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
and fervour and zeale of the <hi>Catechameni,</hi> who accompanied him
to the boote; as did <hi>Dr. Michael</hi> likewise and his two sonnes, and a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his, who was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and three other <hi>Letterati,</hi> walking on foote
a great way, that cold and wet season of the year. He gave also a hundred
crownes to that lay-brother, whom the Fathers sent to <hi>Cauxen,</hi> to Father
<hi>Longobardus,</hi> towards the expence of his voyage, the which mony Father
Longobardus sent afterwards by the same brother to <hi>Nankim,</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of our prisoners.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="211" facs="tcp:64464:117"/>
When <hi>Longobardus</hi> was arrived at <hi>Pekim,</hi> he found the <hi>Fathers, Iacobus
Pantoia,</hi> and <hi>Sabbatinus D' Orsi,</hi> who negotiated our businesse, according to
the directions and instructions of <hi>Dr. Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> It is hardly credible, what
care and paines he tooke in writing of letters and learned <hi>Apologies,</hi> and all
other imaginable diligences, both openly and under-hand, for the defence
of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which things I forbeare to mention here, because
they shall be related in his life. Yet for all this, was he never able to get a
<hi>Memoriall</hi> passed to the Kings hands, <hi>Xin</hi> having craftily shut up all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
to him; neverthelesse those <hi>Apologies</hi> were dispersed through the
whole Kingdom, and did sufficiently manifest the malice of our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the injustice of the persecution.</p>
                        <p>While the <hi>Christians</hi> with one accord endeavoured to make our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
appeare, and defended it with all their might, <hi>Xin</hi> grew still the
more outragious against the <hi>Christians,</hi> and particularly against the poore
prisoners. He suffered them not to be together above five daies, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
they should be separated and put into five severall prisons, and
very strictly forbid they should be allowed any conversation or visits,
strengthening their guards, upon pretence, that those men could vanish out
of sight when they pleased. But he was extreamly vexed, when he saw
he could not so colour his cause, but that it appeared to most men to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
and occasioned meerly by malice; as also observed, that the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi>
shewed us the same kindnesse and respect, as they had done in the
time of our prosperity: but that which afflicted him most was the joy and
cheerfulnesse, which all those prisoners shewed in their sufferings for the
love of Christ, without ever giving any signe of sadnesse, or discontent, in
all their misery.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Xin</hi> not being able to shake the constancy of men, would needs try
whether he could overcome the courage of children, commanding that
five boyes, who were left behind in our house by reason of their tender
years, should be apprehended by the officers and carryed to prison: an
act which was accounted barbarous, even in the opinion of those that did
not favour us. He deprived of his degree of <hi>Batchelor Philippe Sin,</hi> who
was Master of the <hi>Chinesse</hi> tongue to the <hi>Fathers;</hi> who foreseeing the
blow, kept himselfe retired for a while in his house: But assoone as the
occasion of his <hi>Degradation</hi> was published, which was for having taught
the language to the <hi>Fathers;</hi> then he went abroad, rejoycing publickly,
that he had had the honour to obtain a more noble degree, by suffering
for the <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After this, <hi>Xin</hi> did very much endeavour to finde out some letter, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>Dr. Leo,</hi> or <hi>Dr. Paul,</hi> or by the Fathers; that he might pick some
occasion out of it to raise a calumny upon them: but this attempt proving
fruitlesse, he betooke himselfe to compasse his desire by a sleight, writing
to <hi>Dr. Leo</hi> in the name of Father <hi>Vagnone,</hi> on purpose to draw an answer
from him, which he might censure, and make his owne comment upon;
which in <hi>China</hi> is no hard thing to do, by reason of the custome they have
of writing and sealing letters with the hand and seale of another: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did this invention take effect. For <hi>Dr. Leo</hi> presently discovered the
cheat by the stile &amp; maner of writing, &amp; did but laugh at him for his pains.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="212" facs="tcp:64464:118"/>
In the mean time there arrived at <hi>Nankim,</hi> that lay-brother, who was
sent from Father <hi>Longobardus</hi> to assist the prisoners and <hi>Christians</hi> there;
where he found <hi>Ignatius Hya,</hi> a learned man, a good <hi>Christian,</hi> and kinsman
of <hi>Dr. Leo,</hi> who was sent thither from <hi>Cauxeu,</hi> to cause an <hi>Apologie,</hi>
which the <hi>Dr.</hi> had written, to be printed and dispersed in that Court. This
lay-brother undertooke the care of the presse, and having chosen out <hi>Six
Christians</hi> of the Art, he carried on the worke in a private garden that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to one of them. The uncle of this <hi>Christian</hi> to whom the garden
belonged, wherein the presse was, having counselled them in vain to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
by reason of the danger they put him in, went and discovered it to <hi>Xin,</hi>
who gave him a good gratuity for his news; and that night sent Officers,
who tooke them all and brought them before <hi>Xin,</hi> who was very joyfull
to have found this new occasion of traversing the <hi>Fathers.</hi> They were sent
to prison, and shortly after carryed before that <hi>Tauli,</hi> who was a kinsman
of <hi>Xin:</hi> who having read the <hi>Apologie,</hi> and understood the cause, finding
nothing in it to lay hold upon, to free himselfe of the trouble, sent them
to another <hi>Tauli,</hi> who imitating the first, sent them before another great
<hi>Mandarine;</hi> who having heard the cause, said they were not guilty of any
thing; and to conclude the businesse, gave his sentence in writing, That
those men ought in justice to be set at libertie; but if they were to have any
chastisement, he thought fifteen <hi>Bastinadoes</hi> to the chiefe of them would
be sufficient; and that his opinion was they ought to be set at liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ent any more to any other Tribunall: neverthelesse, he reman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them back to <hi>Xin</hi> out of the respect he bore to his great office, fully
perswading himselfe, that he would set them at libertie.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Xin</hi> heard the sentence, he was ready to burst with rage and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
but not knowing how to help it for the present, he sent them to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to Father <hi>Vagnone,</hi> after he had caused fifteen <hi>Bastinadoes</hi> to be given
the poore brother in so cruell a manner, that he was in great pain and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
I will not stand now to recount the villanies and outrages which
they suffered, whilest they were remanded from one <hi>Tribunall</hi> to another;
that tempest of <hi>Cuffes, Kicks, Thrusts,</hi> boxes of the eare, spitting upon, dirt
throwing in their faces, pulling of the haire of their heads and beards, and
other insolencies, which use to be done there to poore prisoners, when the
mony floweth not largely to the Officers; as it happened to these poore
<hi>Christians;</hi> leaving all to the consideration of the pious Reader.</p>
                        <p>After this, they were sent by <hi>Xin</hi> to the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of his <hi>Tribunall</hi> to
be examined; the examination lasted six houres upon these Articles: <hi>What
law is this law of yours? How came you into</hi> China? <hi>How do your professours
live? How do they maintain themselves? What Government have they? What
commerce with</hi> Macao, <hi>and the Fathers of that place?</hi> But at length the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was ended without torments, by means of a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who was
a Countriman of <hi>Dr. Paul,</hi> and <hi>Dr. Iohn,</hi> from whom he had received let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in favour of us. <hi>Xin</hi> was highly enraged at this, and having sharply
reproved the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> he removed the cause from that <hi>Tribunall,</hi> and
sent it to a higher Court, desiring the <hi>Tauli</hi> thereof to put on rigour in such
a cause as this was. They were examined by him for a little while, and
having pardoned the rest, he commanded twenty stripes to be given to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64464:118"/>
                           <hi>Vu Paul,</hi> who was owner of the Garden, and twenty more to the Lay-brother,
whose wounds were not yet healed which he had received by
the other fifteen stripes; and so sent them to <hi>Xin;</hi> who not contented with
these torments, sent them again to the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of his own <hi>Tribunall,</hi>
where they were examined a new; and for the Satisfaction of <hi>Xin,</hi> were
racked (after that manner which we have described, when we spake of the
torments among the <hi>Chinesses</hi>) to make them confesse that which they
knew not, These valiant <hi>Christians</hi> were very ill handled by these tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours;
not having any crime to confesse, they were accused to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
several Women to turne <hi>christians,</hi> assisting therein Father <hi>Vagnone;</hi>
wherefore by a new Sentence they were all <hi>Bastinadoed</hi> in the manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-said,
except a very old man, and two of the Printers, who were <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
But seeing the Lay-Brother and <hi>Vu Paul</hi> so torne and wounded with
the <hi>Stripes</hi> they had received, they gave over, and sent them back to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                        <p>They being cured and healed there by Father <hi>Vagnone,</hi> as well as he
could possible, in that misery and poverty he was in, fifteen dayes after
they were brought again before <hi>Xin,</hi> who examining them very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
said to the Brother, <hi>What kind of Law is that of yours, which holdeth
forth for a God, a man who was executed for a Malefactour?</hi> Whereupon the
Brother took occasion, with a great deale of Spirit, to open the <hi>Mystery</hi> of
the <hi>Incarnation</hi> to him. The <hi>Tyrant</hi> would not endure that liberty of speech:
but to take off his promptnesse, commanded there should be twenty stripes
given him; and as his former wounds were not quite healed, he endured an
incredible pain in having them opened again with new blowes; which
were laid on so lustily, that the bloud spurted as farre as where <hi>Xin</hi> sate;
by which being, as it were, more inflamed, he grew out-ragious against the
young man, whom he beleeved to have brought the Apology of <hi>Doctour
Paul</hi> from <hi>Pekim;</hi> which although it were false, yet that he might not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the true bringer, he under-went willingly a furious load of stripes,
for the love of <hi>Christ,</hi> and for his <hi>Holy Faith.</hi> After this, they were led
through the City to the Prison, which was three miles off; whither not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Brother was carried upon a board, being of himself not
able to move.</p>
                        <p>The courage and desire of these <hi>Valiant Confessours</hi> grew still the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
by how much these torments had weakned their Body. They had
no other regret, but that they had not lost their lives together with their
bloud; and so in the healing of their wounds, which being almost frozen
by reason of the extraordinary cold, required new cuttings and incisions
from the hands of those unskilfull Surgeons of the Prison, they rejoyced
in those new torments which they suffered in so glorious a cause. All the
sorrow and trouble fell to the lot of <hi>Xin,</hi> who still thirsting after <hi>Christian</hi>
bloud, remitted the cause of these Prisoners to the judge criminall. But the
successe fell out contrary to his expectation, for that Judge, after he had
conferred with <hi>Xon Xu,</hi> the President of his Tribunall, concerning the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement
of these Prisoners, pronounced them innocent: but that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
they were to expect what the Kings pleasure would be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them. In the meane time he gave them good words, and sent them
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64464:119"/>
back to Prison; but after five dayes, he set them at libertie, and sent
them home to their Houses, under pretence of getting their wounds
healed.</p>

                     <p>AS soon as <hi>Xin</hi> was acquainted with the <hi>Sentence</hi> which the Judge <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall</hi>
had given, he began to contrive new Troubles for them, that he
might not seem to have persecuted Innocent Persons. First he writ and
dispersed abroad libels against those <hi>Christians,</hi> accusing them to have
printed an Apologie against certain of the chiefest <hi>Mandarines,</hi> in favour of
the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who were Traytours and Disturbers of the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
After that, he privately stirred up the <hi>Censors</hi> of the people who
had recourse to him, as to their Superiour, to receive rules from him for the
ordering of the lives and manners of the people. The answer he gave
them was, That they should take heed of Fa. <hi>Vagnone</hi> and his companions,
who were Seducers of the people, and disturbers of the publick peace, by
teaching a law, which did infringe their fidelitie to their Prince, the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their Ancestors, the worship of the Gods, and the exercise of all
other vertues, which have been from all times so highly esteemed in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>
and in the conclusion, much deplored the misery and unhappinesse
of those times, wherein there were so may Persons, who suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be bewitched by such Deceivers.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, there was a <hi>Mandarine</hi> of the <hi>Tribunall</hi> of <hi>Xin,</hi> and two other
<hi>Doctours</hi> of small esteem and reputation, who began to write against the
<hi>Fathers,</hi> and one of them in particular, who had formerly been in the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippine</hi>
Islands, wrote, That the <hi>Christians</hi> did worship a <hi>Crucified Man;</hi>
That they signed their Foreheads with the <hi>Crosse;</hi> That they set it on the
top of their Houses and Steeples, and wore it about their necks as a Jewel;
That under pretence of Preaching their Law, they had made themselves
Masters of the <hi>Philippines,</hi> of <hi>Malacca,</hi> and of the <hi>Indies;</hi> That of late years
they had slain many <hi>Chinesses</hi> upon no occasion given them; That their
Religious men did commit horrible <hi>Sacriledge</hi> with the women, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
their Churches, drawing out all their Secrets from them under a
pretence of Piety; That the designe of their coming into <hi>China</hi> was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the Kingdom, under colour of such deceits and impostures; and
that therefore undoubtedly they ought to be droven out thence, as the
pest and plague of the <hi>Common Wealth.</hi> Besides these writings published
by <hi>Xin,</hi> and sent to the Court of <hi>Pekim,</hi> he laboured so powerfully with
the <hi>Tribunals</hi> of <hi>Pekim,</hi> that he perswaded them to present a <hi>Memoriall</hi> to
the King against the Fathers, and the law which they Preached; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64464:119"/>
also to have it signed with the Seale of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who is there in

                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Memoriall</hi> was presented the last day of <hi>September;</hi> the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they gave in another, wherein they besought the King to give a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
to the <hi>Memorials</hi> already presented. On the eighth of <hi>October<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Xin</hi>
presented a third; on the thirteenth day he caused a fourth to be presented
by the hand of a <hi>Tauli;</hi> and afterward a fifth by meanes of a certain <hi>Coli</hi> of
<hi>Nankim,</hi> who was one of the Kings <hi>Remembrancers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For all this the Kings answer did not yet appeare; and in the meane
while <hi>Doctour Paul</hi> wrote his second <hi>Apologie</hi> against all these calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and <hi>Slanders,</hi> which being joyned to his first, and to that which <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
Machael</hi> made, and other <hi>Memorials</hi> and Treatises, made a good
large volume. Thus did that primitive Church glory to defend the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their Holy Faith, both with their bloud and pens. The
writings of our Doctours were Authorized by the patience of our Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who cheerfully under went all the ill usage which was shewn them;
partly for the satisfaction of <hi>Xin,</hi> and partly for want of money; the <hi>Tyrant</hi>
not suffering the least thing in the world to be brought to us from our
House. They lay three months hin the worst place of all the Prison, with
Manacles on their armes: their food was only a little Rice ill-boyled, and
a few hearbs without any Seasoning; and this too alwayes cold, they boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
still as much at once as might serve them three or foure dayes. If there
were any Almes sent them from the <hi>Christians,</hi> either all or part of it was

them like Waspes.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Semedo,</hi> and Brother <hi>Sebastian Fernandes</hi> were put together in
one Prison, where by way of an extraordinarie favour they had allowed
them half a Duck Egge a piece, dried and salted in stead of hearbs; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
two of those Egges at least be sold for a farthing, yet was one of
them divided between two men. Father <hi>Semedo</hi> lay continually sick nine
moneths together, and through the convenience of this worthy Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie,
and the charity of his tenders, he was twice in great danger of
death; although he was once pardoned the <hi>Bastinadoes</hi> he should have
received by reason they found him in so weak a condition.</p>
                     <p>The other Christians fell sick likewise through their great sufferings
and durance; wherefore there were severall times <hi>Memorials</hi> presented to
<hi>Xin,</hi> to desire liberty, according to the custome, for them to go to their
own Houses to recover themselves, having first given in good security for
their returne. But there were only two or three who could obtain this
leave, and that for foure dayes only: so that two happily ended their
lives, only through the hardship they endured. The one of them was
called <hi>Peter Hya</hi> of <hi>Nankim,</hi> aged about 22 years: he had been five
years a <hi>Christian,</hi> of a very exemplarie life, in which time he vowed perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<hi>Chastitie,</hi> and endeavoured to preserve it by frequent penances, and
by keeping a strict watch upon his senses, not looking upon so much as his
neerest Kins-women, as also by frequent prayer day and night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> insomuch
that his khees were become her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y and callotus. He came every day to
<hi>Masse,</hi> although he lived four miles off: he was very discreet in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64464:120"/>
and of a sincere conscience, endeavouring to avoyd every small imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and the least shadow of evill. What he got by the handy-craft
trade he used, he still gave part of it to his parents, and the poore <hi>Christians:</hi>
he was very patient of injuries, saying, He ought to be a lambe who would
imitate <hi>Christ;</hi> and such a one did he shew himselfe to be, more than ever,
in his last sicknesse: for it being contrary to the lawes of that Kingdom to
suffer any prisoner to die in prison, <hi>Xin</hi> sent to the Father of the said <hi>Peter,</hi>
that he should take him home till he were recovered; but the Father
through meere hatred to his sonne, because he was a <hi>Christian,</hi> would not
receive him. Then <hi>Xin</hi> sent him by the Sergeants to his Mother-in-law,
who because she was an <hi>Idolatresse,</hi> used him very wickedly, yet did he
never shew the least signe of discontent, but alwaies of modesty and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
patience. At length, when he was neere death, he was fetcht back
into prison, from whence he flew into eternall libertie. And this was the
first lay-man who died there in prison for his religion; his corps was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Father to bury it, but without any Ceremony at all.</p>
                     <p>The second who dyed in prison was called <hi>Hierome Vem;</hi> he was taken
in our house coming thither to assist us: he also died of pure sufferance.
His wife presented many <hi>Memorialls</hi> to the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> that he might be
brought home to recover his health, but all was in vaine. At length she
had recourse to <hi>Xin,</hi> who understanding that her husband was a <hi>Christian,</hi>
gave her no other answer but this, You see what good you get by the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
they professe; and with this answer left her disconsolate and quite
out of hope: not long after her husband died with so much the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by how much the lesse he had of humane help, in that sicknesse he so
patiently endured for the love of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and the maintenance of his
religion.</p>
                     <p>The death of these men did stirre up in the rest of the <hi>Christian</hi> prisoners
a holy envie, and a new fervour to suffer for <hi>Christ;</hi> neither were the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
without wanting to shew themselves true followers of that persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
religion. They divided the prisons among them, so that every day the
<hi>Christian</hi> prisoners were visited, and succoured as much as might be, and
had also notice given them of the designes and proceedings of <hi>Xin,</hi> and the
other <hi>Mandarines:</hi> neither were they content with this, but relieved also
the wives and children of the prisoners, pawning sometimes their hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-stuffe,
that they might not want wherewithall to do it.</p>
                     <p>Captain <hi>Ignatius Cin,</hi> although he was but newly converted to the faith,
yet was as forward and eminent in this work of <hi>Charitie,</hi> as could possibly
be desired; as also three other families, with the hazzard of being made
infamous for ever; namely, that of <hi>Lucius Ciam,</hi> Captain of armes, that of
<hi>Andrew Hiam</hi> a smith; and that of <hi>Francis</hi> a guilder; where I cannot but
admire, the great charity of the said <hi>Andrew,</hi> who having received some
crownes from Father <hi>Vagnone</hi> for the reliefe of the prisoners, made no use
of them, but by the daily pains and labour of himselfe and his sonne,
made provision every day for two prisons, restoring afterwards to the
Father the mony he had put in his hands. There were also certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<hi>Christian</hi> women, who making a purse out of the fruit of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
bestow'd it in the prisons according to the necessities of the prisoners:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64464:120"/>
there was also one, who being himselfe a prisoner, spared still some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of the penny, which was given him every day for his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
and when he had made up a small summe, he divided it among the
most necessitous of the prisoners, with so much the greater liberalitie, by
how much the industry of that <hi>Charitie</hi> was more subtle.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning, when the <hi>Fathers</hi> were first apprehended, there were
not wanting certain wicked persons, who feigning themselves to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of justice, went from house to house to disturbe the <hi>Christians,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to draw mony from them; and if in searching every corner of the
house, they happened to finde any Images, they threatned to accuse them
to <hi>Xin.</hi> This lasted till a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who had notice of this roguery, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
many of them, and caused them to be well <hi>Bastinadoed,</hi> and
one of them for no other cause, but that he had inform'd against a man to
the <hi>Tauli,</hi> that he was a <hi>Christian.</hi> Neverthelesse, there were some accused
before <hi>Xin,</hi> only for being <hi>Christians;</hi> he accepted the accusation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it to the Court <hi>Criminall,</hi> whither the highest offenders are sent.
They were rigorously examined, and after that declared innocent, with a
foule staine upon <hi>Xin,</hi> both of injustice and ignorance.</p>
                     <p>Neither was the infamy lesse which he received by the words of two
great <hi>Mandarines.</hi> The one of them (called <hi>Hò</hi>) in a great assembly of
<hi>Letterati,</hi> asked him, For what reason he had imprisoned the <hi>Fathers?</hi> and
he answering; Because they preached a law contrary to theirs; the other
replied, Why do you not then imprison so many others, who follow laws
much more contrary to ours, than that of the <hi>Fathers</hi> is? They have not,
said <hi>Xin,</hi> any accusers. And these <hi>Fathers,</hi> replyed <hi>Hò,</hi> Who accuseth them
to your Lordship? He knew not what answer to make him, but seeing
himselfe thus confuted, lest there should be a laughter raised at him, he
withdrew himselfe out of the <hi>Assemblie.</hi> The other, who was <hi>President</hi>
of the <hi>Tribunall</hi> of warre, sharply reproved him, that without reason he
had so mis-used the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who had committed no fault, nor had ever
offended him: And although <hi>Xin</hi> did endeavour to justifie himselfe, yet
the <hi>President</hi> threatned to accuse him to the King, for a disturber of the
peace of the Kingdome, and in effect he dispatched a <hi>Courrier</hi> to <hi>Pekim,</hi>
with a stoute <hi>Memoriall</hi> against him; which neverthelesse he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
re-call, by reason that many <hi>Mandarines</hi> did interpose themselves
in the businesse; but he would never after maintain any friendship with so
unjust a person.</p>
                     <p>Very admirable at the same time was the <hi>Charitie</hi> of a new <hi>Christian</hi> of
<hi>Pekim,</hi> who had taken the degree of <hi>Batchelor;</hi> who having understood of
the <hi>Fathers</hi> imprisonment, ranne to <hi>Nankim;</hi> and although he had never
seen them, he went to visit them, and much assisted them in their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and not only invited, but also perswaded severall of his friends to do
the like; who extended also their <hi>Charitie</hi> to the other <hi>Christian prisoners:</hi>
And for this cause only he remained there many months; he accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Christians</hi> to the <hi>Tribunalls,</hi> healed their stripes, encouraged and
comforted them all; to which the quality and reputation of so grave and
learned a person did very much conduce. He undertooke also to dispute
with a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who had written a declaration against the <hi>Fathers</hi> in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64464:121"/>
favour of <hi>Xin,</hi> and used such powerfull perswasions to him, that he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his resolution, and brought him to favour the <hi>Fathers</hi> so farre, that he
did publiquely praise and extoll them.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, our adversary seeing that the Kings answer was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed,
used his utmost endeavour to gaine the <hi>Colao</hi> to his party, who was
(otherwise) not much averse to us; and at length perswaded him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
a <hi>Memoriall</hi> to the King, by the hands of an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
prepared for the businesse with a very great bribe, to procure the
Kings order upon it. The <hi>Eunuchs</hi> passed this pitition so secretly among
themselves, that without showing it to the King, they brought it againe to
the <hi>Colao,</hi> requiring him in the Kings name to draw up an order for our
banishment; the which he did in this manner.</p>
                     <p>For as much as we are informed by the <hi>Collaterall Lypu</hi> of the third <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
of <hi>Pekim,</hi> that there remain in this our Court certain strangers, who do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
our good leave and dispatch; and the said <hi>Tribunall</hi> hath besought us, that
we would send our orders to the <hi>Provinces,</hi> that they should send them away to
their owne Countries, <hi>Alphonsus Vagnone</hi> and <hi>Jacobus Pantoia</hi> with their
companions, who under pretence of preaching a certain law, do much disturbe the
people, and also secretly endeavour to make an insurrection in the Kingdom: We
do therefore ordaine, that notice be given to the <hi>Lypu</hi> of <hi>Nankim,</hi> to give order
to the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of the respective <hi>Provinces,</hi> wherein any of these men shall
be found, that they send them with a guard of Souldiers to the Province and City
of <hi>Canton,</hi> to the end they may returne from thence to their owne Countries, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>China</hi> in peace and quietnesse. And because the last year we were given
to under stand by severall persons, that <hi>Jacobus Pantoia</hi> and his companions, who
came into this Kingdome to enjoy the delights and pleasures thereof, were very fit
to be employed in the emendation of our <hi>Calender,</hi> whereupon they were aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
to the number of the <hi>Mandarines;</hi> yet notwithstanding the said aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we will and command, that they be forthwith dismissed, and sent away to
their owne Countries. Let this sentence be given to the <hi>Lypu</hi> and to the <hi>Ciayan</hi>
the twenty eighth of the <hi>twelfth Moone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Assoone as this Order was drawne up, at the foot of the <hi>Memoriall,</hi> the
<hi>Colao</hi> sent it back into the <hi>Palace</hi> to be signed by the King according to the
custome. Presently the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> being all gained by the Presents of <hi>Xin,</hi>
fraudulently contrived a way to get it subscribed; or, as some say, they put
it among a great heape of petitions, so that the King signed it without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice what it was; or as others say, they perswaded the Queen to
subscribe it, to whom the King doth often remit the signing of <hi>Memorialls.</hi>
And truly it is not very probable, that the King who had lent but a
deafe eare to so many former <hi>Memorialls,</hi> should be so soone perswaded to
it; besides that, it is more conformable to the stile of that Court to have
sent them rather to some <hi>Province</hi> lying in the middle of the Kingdom,
than to send them away after they had gained so perfect a knowledge and
full information of the affaires of <hi>China.</hi> However it was, the sentence was
published the fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> which is the solemne beginning of
their new year.</p>
                     <p>The news was blowne of a sudden through the whole Kingdome: The
<hi>Mandarines</hi> of <hi>Nanchium</hi> in the Province of <hi>Canton,</hi> where Father <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64464:121"/>
Ferrera</hi> was, did in a very quiet and civill manner give him notice of the
order, allowing him with all liberty to stay till his companions came. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
the Father thought it more fit to sell the House, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
himselfe to another <hi>Mission,</hi> according to the instructions he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from Father <hi>Longobardus.</hi> In <hi>Hamlu</hi> there were two Fathers, who
were brought thither by <hi>Doctour Michaels</hi> meanes; but they had no notice
given them of the Order, the <hi>Mandarines</hi> forbearing, as it seemeth, to do
it, out of respect to their Protectour, who writ to the Father superiour to
send him two more, which accordingly he did with very good successe.
Father <hi>Iohn Rocca</hi> with two others of <hi>Nanchiam,</hi> where he left Brother
<hi>Pasquel Mendez</hi> for the consolation of those Christians, came to <hi>Chien
Chiam</hi> in the Province of <hi>Chiamsi,</hi> where he kept himselfe private in the
Houses of the Christians, untill the Lord sent better times.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Pekim</hi> the <hi>Colao</hi> made excuses to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in that he was obliged
by his place to give them notice of the Kings Order, promising them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
his Assistance to hinder their going, in case they should think good
to present a <hi>Memoriall</hi> to the King to that effect. But all passages were so
shut up, that it was impossible for them ever to present one: wherefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
place to time and necessity, having encouraged the <hi>Christians,</hi> after
the distribution of <hi>Palmes,</hi> that very <hi>Sunday</hi> they departed for <hi>Canton,</hi> the
<hi>Mandarines</hi> having strictly forbid the people to offer them any injuries by
the way: and left the House which the King had granted them in the
custody of a good <hi>Christian,</hi> having obtained a licence of the <hi>Mandarines</hi>
to that effect.</p>
                     <p>The greatest stirre was in <hi>Nankim,</hi> where assoon as the <hi>Courier</hi> was
arrived, he would needs give notice himselfe to the <hi>Fathers</hi> of their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
thinking it a high favour, that they were not cut in pieces. Assoon
as it was known abroad, the <hi>Mandarines</hi> came to visit them with much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and congratulations. On the sixt day of <hi>March,</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi> were
brought first before a Tribunall of six <hi>Mandarines;</hi> and after that, before
<hi>Xin</hi> to be examined, with a halter about their necks; and Father <hi>Semedo</hi>
was brought upon a board, not being able through weaknesse to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his leggs. <hi>Xin</hi> after another examination, declared, That although they
had deserved death for preaching a new law in <hi>China,</hi> yet their life was
granted them by the Kings clemencie; notwithstanding, he condemned
them to receive ten <hi>Bastinadoes</hi> apiece, and so to be sent away to their own
Country. Father <hi>Semedo</hi> was excused by reason of his sicknesse, But Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <hi>Vagnone</hi>
received them in so cruel a manner, that he lay very ill upon it, and
it was above a moneth before his wounds were closed. In conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
their house and goods were confiscated; and many books were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
against them, which declared them to be unworthy the name of <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terati.</hi>
They themselves were put into very narrow Cages of wood,
(such as are used in that Country to transport persons condemned to
death, from one place to another) with Iron Chaines about their necks,
and Manacles on their Wrists, with their haire hanging down long, and
their Gownes accoutred in an odde fashion, as signe of a strange and
Barbarous people. The thirtieth of Aprill, they were brought out of
Prison to a <hi>Tribunall,</hi> where they were shut up in those straight Frames,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64464:122"/>
and sealed with the Kings Seale; and order was given to the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of
the Guard, to tale them out at such times, as were allowed them to eate
and sleep in. In this manner were the Fathers carried with an inexpressible
noise, which the Ministers made with their ratling of Fetters and Chaines.
Before them were carried three <hi>Tablets,</hi> written on with great letters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the Kings Sentence, and forbidding all men to have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
or conversation with them.</p>
                     <p>In this equipage they went out of <hi>Nankim,</hi> and were carried in these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for thirty dayes together, untill they came to the first City of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Canton,</hi> where they were presented to the <hi>Tutan;</hi> who having
sharply reproved them for preaching a new law in <hi>China,</hi> caused them to
be consigned to the <hi>Mandarines:</hi> whence they were carried in that manner
throughout all the <hi>Tribunals</hi> with all the people running after them. In
conclusion, they were taken out, and after a few dayes were sent away to
<hi>Macao</hi> along with the Fathers which came from <hi>Pekim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Christians</hi> which remained in Prison, after many sufferings and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usages,
were in conclusion, by the power and sollicitation of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
<hi>Xin,</hi> condemned to receive 70 <hi>Bastinadoes</hi> apiece. The two Lay-Brothers,
because they were <hi>Chinesses,</hi> after severall out-rages and <hi>Bastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi>
were condemned, one of them to serve at the Tartars wall, the other
to tow the Kings barques, as Oxen do in our Country. Neverthelesse,
there was seen in all the <hi>Christians</hi> a wonderfull constancie and joy to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for Christ, who shewed so much cheerfulnesse outwardly, that the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> did much admire at it. There was a Woman, who having heard
that our Brother <hi>Sebastian Farnandes</hi> had been Tortured at an examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the squeezing and pinching of his hands and fingers, desired that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Lord, that she her self might likewise undergo it, and her prayer
was granted her in part; for being one day in prayer, she saw in a Vision <hi>Xin</hi>
sitting on his Tribunall, who commanded her to renounce the Faith of
<hi>Christ,</hi> which she not consenting to, he caused the same Torture to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to her. When the Vision was ended, the Marks were to be seen for
some time on her hands, and the black and blue strips on her body; which
was a very great comfort and contentment to her.</p>

                     <p>ALl the other persecutions, which happened before this of <hi>Nankim,</hi>
were particular, and commonly the fire went not farre. For the cause
belonging to the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of that <hi>Province,</hi> the sentence was alwayes
given there, without extending it self to the <hi>Residencies</hi> of other remote
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64464:122"/>
                        <hi>Provinces.</hi> But in this <hi>Persecution</hi> the Tyrant accounted it too meane an
enterprise to discharge his choler on the <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>Nankim</hi> only. And
therefore he would strike at the <hi>Christianitie</hi> of the whole Kingdom, to
root it out at one blow. He presented the cause to the King, that his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
might include all, with the greater rigour and authoritie. But this
Tragedie being ended, the <hi>Fathers</hi> being banished from their <hi>Residencies,</hi>
their Houses confiscated and sold, the Churches ruined, and that of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi>
thrown to the ground by the fury of Xin, their goods lost; and finally,
the Fathers of <hi>Nankim</hi> sent away from that Court with so much hubbub

how much mischiefe followed upon it, how much good was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

much good even from these evils. For although the liberty and facilitie
of making new <hi>Christians</hi> was impeded at that time; yet it manifested the
constancie and valour of those that were already such; all of them shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how highly they did esteem the being followers of the <hi>Law of God,</hi>
and how much they did desire to keep the Fathers in their Kingdom, that
they might be still instructed in the Doctrine which they had already
received: and so, many of them, which live in other Cities, either sent,
or came in person, to receive the Fathers, and carry them to their Houses.
Which was the reason, that, except in the two Courts, we found good
shelter in other places, whereby the <hi>Christians</hi> were comforted in their
sufferings, and confirmed in their <hi>Faith,</hi> and the Churches (I speak not
of materiall ones) maintained and upheld, as also many new ones set up, as
we shall shew hereafter.</p>
                     <p>At the Court of <hi>Pekim</hi> there remained two of our Brothers, in the
place of Sepulture given us by the King: for, being <hi>Chinesses</hi> they were not
comprehended in the Sentence of banishmnt, wherefore under pretence
of Piety and Devotion, whereof the <hi>Chinesses</hi> make great esteem, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
there to keep it, although with much trouble and many contrasts
which they had with the <hi>Eunuchs:</hi> for they, assoon as they saw the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
out of the Court, thought the House had been without a head, and
that the brothers alone would never have had strength enough to resist
their batteries: and therefore it is almost incredible, what attempts they
made every way to arrive at their design, and how many times they
brought the brothers into the Tribunalls, accusing and troubling them,
but alwayes to no effect. For the Lord, who had granted that place to the
Fathers, that they might be buried there after their death, would keep it
for them, to serve them as a retreate and hiding place, even in their life
time, disposing it so by his providence, that <hi>Doctour Paul</hi> should reside in
the Court at that time; and that by his authoritie he should overthrow all
the plots of our enemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:64464:123"/>
Once especially the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> had put their businesse in such a forme,
that it it seemed impossible for them not to carry their design; partly
because they had (as they said) corrupted some of the Magistrates with
bribes; and partly (which was more considerable) because they had the
<hi>Chi Fu,</hi> or Governour of the City on their side, to whom they had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
very effectually concerning the businesse, and he had promised them
his favour in it. The worst was, they gave the Brothers such short war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to appeare, that they had hardly time to give <hi>Doctour Paul</hi> notice of
it, and he to write a letter to the <hi>Governour</hi> of the City, giving Order to
the Servant which carried it, that he should give it him, in what place so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he met him, although it were in the street: and so he did, finding him
almost entring into the <hi>Tribunal;</hi> (for in <hi>Pekim</hi> they are without the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
where they dwell) where there was gathered together a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> who did already assure themselves of good successe, by
reason of the care and diligence they had used in the businesse. The <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi>
after he had read the letter, called the cause: and the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> with
greater store of words than reasons began to plead for themselves. The
Brother being called, did no more but shew his Patent, wherein was contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
how the Officer, and former <hi>Governour,</hi> by Order from the King, had
granted that House, and the Gardens thereunto adjoyning, for the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Father <hi>Matthaseus Riccius</hi> and his companions. The <hi>Governour</hi> took
it and read it, and in stead of the favour he was to do the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> did
strengthen it with one Seale more, putting to it the Seale of his Office, and
telling the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> That which is once well done, ought not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.
So the suit was ended for the Fathers advantage, not only this, but
also many other times; whilest the neer Kindred of the imprisoned <hi>Eunuch</hi>
lived, they never gave over their endeavours to re-gain it; whereby they
got often some small summes of money, which were given them on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to avoyd suits and contrasts.</p>
                     <p>The Brothers, who kept the House, making use of this opportunity,
went sometimes one, sometimes another to visit the <hi>Christians</hi> of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and after the persecution began to be over, and the fury of the tempest
was allayed, one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> was sent thither in diguise; who although
he was glad to lie hid there, yet did he much assist the <hi>Christians,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the protection of the old ones, converted many new ones also.</p>
                     <p>The House which we had in <hi>Canton,</hi> the most Southerly Province of
<hi>China,</hi> was totally ruined; for, although at the beginning there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
small House taken, where some of the Lay-Brothers should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided
for the reception of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in their passage to the City of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hium,</hi>
yet upon better consideration it seemed good to them to take it
wholly away, because the place was very subject to tempests and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
The <hi>Father</hi> who had his <hi>Residence</hi> there, as I have already said, went
up farther into the Country, as did also the Lay-Brother, with a promise
neverthelesse, and obligation upon him, to come and visit the <hi>Christians</hi> of
that Country every year.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Rocca,</hi> with other two <hi>Fathers,</hi> who, (as we have said,) depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from <hi>Nankiam,</hi> a City in the Province of <hi>Kiamsi,</hi> retired to the City of
<hi>Kiencham,</hi> in the same Province; where they were visited by a <hi>Christian,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64464:123"/>
Stephen,</hi> of a Noble Family, and one of the chiefest of that place, being
also the Sonne of a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> who was afterwards himself converted to
the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion. The Fathers at their arrivall there, were received
with all manner of <hi>Christian</hi> love and charitie, and were lodged in a house
neerto the walls of the City, such a one as they cal a <hi>House of Studies,</hi> where
they had an appartiment provided for them, consisting of foure chambers,
with the Offices belonging to them, and a faire Hall, which served them
for a Chappel. At the beginning there came thither only those of the hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
of their Host, who were all <hi>Christians.</hi> Afterward, their Kindred
who were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and their most Familiar acquaintance; and by occasion
of these Visits, there was alwayes some one or other gained to the Faith;
and these likewise brought in others; and so by little and little this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
encreased so, that when I came thither about two years after, they
said <hi>Masse</hi> on Holy dayes, with Musicall Instruments, and with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of a good number of Christians. They who played on the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
were the Sonnes of Christians; and among them the <hi>Letterati,</hi> and
those of the best quality served at the <hi>Masse</hi> in their coates foure at a time,
as I saw at my being there. At this day there is a good <hi>Residence,</hi> with a
copious and well instructed Christianity, which hath annexed to
it two Churches in the Province of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> which bordereth upon it,
and are visited every year by the <hi>Father</hi> of this House.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Residence</hi> of <hi>Hamcheu</hi> doth flourish most of all under the Protection
of <hi>Dr. Michael.</hi> For though the <hi>Fathers</hi> went out from thence publickly
at noone day, that the world might take notice of their obedience to the
Kings proclamation, accompanied by the said <hi>Dr.</hi> and the <hi>Christians</hi> of
the best quality; yet <hi>Dr. Michael</hi> having prepared a faire appartiment in
his <hi>Palace,</hi> provided with Chambers, Offices, Chappel, Hall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did
build also a new range of Chambers, furnishing them all after our fashion,
that there might be roome enough for all of us, if there should be occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and when he had fitted every thing, he sent for the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who came
thither very secretly, although he was not very sollicitous to conceale
them: But three years after told <hi>Xin,</hi> who being a native of that City, was
now come to live at his owne <hi>Palace,</hi> That he had the <hi>Fathers</hi> with him in
his house, and perswaded him to come and visit them, and discourse with
them; Telling him, he should finde them other manner of men than he
took them for.</p>
                     <p>This house was in those troublesome times the most secure, commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and easie refuge, which the <hi>Fathers</hi> had. Here lived the <hi>Superiour,</hi>
hither came all businesse, and upon any straite, the greatest part of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
who sometimes made a considerable number: and although there
was care taken, that no <hi>Gentile</hi> should come in amongst them, unlesse he
were very well knowne, neverthelesse, there was <hi>Masse</hi> said, and a sermon
every Holy day, with a great concourse of <hi>Christians,</hi> and a good number
of new ones converted to the faith.</p>
                     <p>The greatest tempest fell upon the Church at <hi>Nankim:</hi> for as the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
were prisoners a long time there, and after they had received their
sentence, were sent out in cages, being carried through the whole City
with a great noise and shouting of the guard, and an infinite concourse of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64464:124"/>
people, their case was more notorious and ignominious, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
were more alienated from the <hi>Christians,</hi> accusing them upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the <hi>Magistrate.</hi> Wherefore for diverse years after there was almost
every year some particular vexation, and the <hi>Christians</hi> were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Tribunalls,</hi> and troubled, and many times were <hi>Bastinadoed;</hi> all
which they suffered with great constancy and cheerfulnesse, <hi>gaudentes à
conspectu Concilij, quoniam digni habiti sunt pro nomine Iesu contumelium pati.</hi>
Neither truly is there any doubt, but as the Lord did exercise this Church
of <hi>Nankim</hi> with particular tribulations, so he did also endowe it more
particularly with the vertue of <hi>Patience,</hi> as was seen upon all occasions.</p>
                     <p>In this manner were our ancient houses demolished, although the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
belonging to them, were preserved, who divided themselves into
companies, making by that means severall <hi>Co-fraternities:</hi> the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and pious among them did visit and comfort the rest: the <hi>Fathers</hi> also
at certaine times came to confesse and communicate them, and staied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them as long as they could: But as they durst not stay long, at least
in some places, they were forced to find out other places of abode, which
was an occasion of laying the foundation of new Residencies, which were
afterwards brought to perfection, and became well ordered Houses and
Churches, as they are to be seen at this present time.</p>
                     <p>The first <hi>Residence,</hi> which was begun in the time of our troubles and
<hi>Banishment,</hi> was in the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Kiamsi,</hi> in the City of <hi>Kiencham,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I have formerly spoken.</p>
                     <p>The second was the Province of <hi>Nankim</hi> in the City of <hi>Kiatim,</hi> where
<hi>Dr. Ignatius</hi> dwelt, a <hi>Christian</hi> of great power and authority, who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<hi>Vice-roy</hi> of the Province of <hi>Xantum:</hi> he, assoone as he had notice
of the sentence pronounced against the <hi>Fathers,</hi> immediately dispatched
one of his Sonnes to <hi>Father Lazarus Catanaeus,</hi> who lived in <hi>Hamcheu,</hi> with
a letter, wherein after the usuall complements, he wrote him only these
words, <hi>There is a businesse of importance, which I must necessarily treate of with
your Reverence before you leave this Kingdome.</hi> When this letter was brought
to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> they were putting themselves in are dinesse to depart out of
that City, as accordingly they did, with a designe to go to <hi>Xanhai,</hi> which
was <hi>Dr. Pauls</hi> Country: but having received this invitation, that they might
give satisfaction to both parties, the <hi>Fathers</hi> divided themselves, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Francis Sanbiasi,</hi> went to the City of <hi>Kiatim</hi> to <hi>Dr. Ignatius,</hi> who, by
that time the <hi>Father</hi> arrived there, had got ready the lodgings neere his
house, which served him for a place of study, and stood within the walls
of his <hi>Palace,</hi> being very convenient for his occasions, having severall
Chambers and a Chappel to say <hi>Masse</hi> in, and being provided with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
furniture: and although that Chappel was bigge enough for the
reception of the <hi>Christians</hi> of his owne houshold; yet neverthelesse, he did
afterwards build in the same place a faire Church, which though it was
not very great, yet was of perfect good <hi>Architecture.</hi> The <hi>Fathers</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
draw many people to them by their preaching and discourses;
so that when I was there about foure years after, I found a well formed
<hi>Christianity,</hi> very devout, and both men, women and children, very diligent
in hearing of <hi>Masse</hi> and sermons, as also in confessing themselves, with such
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64464:124"/>
an affection to the <hi>Holy Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> that they seemed even
<hi>Christians</hi> brought up in <hi>Europe.</hi> I forbeare to mention many examples of
much edification, referring my Reader to the the yearly letters.</p>
                     <p>This House also served for an <hi>Academie</hi> to our people that came new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
over: for the City being very private, and having but little trade, and
the Houses being spacious and convenient, they who were to study the
<hi>Chinesse</hi> language and letters, did constantly come thither: so that the
number of <hi>Fathers</hi> and Students (who were <hi>Chinesses</hi> of <hi>Macao,</hi> whom we
bred up and instructed in vertue and the learning of <hi>China,</hi> that they might
afterward be helpfull to us in propagating the Gospel) was about eleven or
twelve, which considering the time, was a great number.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Father Catanaeus</hi> went to <hi>Xanbai,</hi> where he laboured in the same manner,
confirming the old <hi>Christians,</hi> and adding new ones continually to the
<hi>Church.</hi> In the meane time <hi>Dr. Paul</hi> came from Court to his owne house,
and by his presence gave a greater libertie, with lesse danger to preach and
reduce that people: So that the Baptismes grew to such a number, that
the <hi>Father</hi> was forced to write for assistance, and to call a companion to
him, and sometimes they were three; and <hi>Dr. Paul,</hi> to enlarge that Church,
did in a manner pull it all downe, and build it a new; and so it continueth
to this day with a very numerous <hi>Christianity</hi> belonging to it.</p>
                     <p>At the same time began the <hi>Residence</hi> of <hi>Xamsi,</hi> which hath at this day
belonging to it, one of the most flourishing <hi>Christianities</hi> of all <hi>China.</hi> It
had its beginning by occasion of a <hi>Christian</hi> named <hi>Peter;</hi> who went to be
<hi>Mandarine</hi> in that <hi>Province,</hi> and carried with him Father <hi>Iulius Alexis,</hi> that
he might be there in safetie under his protection, and that he might also
prove the disposition of that people, whether they would be apt to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the preaching of the <hi>Gospel</hi> in a place where the <hi>Fathers</hi> had never
yet come; and although the House was not perfected at that time, yet
things were put in such order, that it was brought afterwards to perfection
with much facilitie, as we shall shew anon.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Macao</hi> they were more particularly sensible of the successe of the
<hi>Persecution</hi> and troubles; by which, foure <hi>Fathers</hi> of the two Courts were
brought prisoners to that Colledge, Neverthelesse, by the resentment of
those troubles, their desires were more inflamed to enter afresh upon the
work, and to assist their brethren, who remained behinde, exposed to all
dangers and sufferings, labouring under the heavie burthen of the <hi>Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gospel.</hi> All the difficultie was, how to get the foure <hi>Fathers</hi>
backe again, by reason they were so well knowne there, and were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
named in the proclamation for their <hi>Banishment:</hi> it was judged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
more fit for them to delay their returne for a while, during which
time the Lord was pleased to take to himselfe the <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>Pekim,</hi> namely,
Father <hi>Iacobus Pantoia,</hi> and Father <hi>Sabatinus</hi> de <hi>Ursis:</hi> who having been
the ancientest labourers in that vine-yard, were called first of all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their reward. It was more dangerous for the other two <hi>Fathers</hi> of
<hi>Nankim</hi> to returne backe againe, by reason their banishment was more
publique; they having been carried before many <hi>Tribunalls,</hi> and through
several <hi>Provinces,</hi> during that <hi>Persecution.</hi> Neverthelesse, Father <hi>Alvarus
Semedo,</hi> who had lived there a lesser time, and consequently was lesse
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64464:125"/>
knowne, returned back about three years after, having changed the name
and Sir-name, which he used in that Country; and about two years after
that, Father <hi>Vagnone</hi> did the like; who is there living at this day in the
Court of <hi>Xansi;</hi> where, although he be growne very old, yet is he as pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and diligent, as any young man whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>In this condition stood the state of <hi>Christian</hi> affaires, which still prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and encreased in every place, by the great industrie and caution which
was used; as also by the protection of some <hi>Christians</hi> of quality, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of some <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were our friends; and by this means the ancient
Churches were confirmed, and some new ones set up; when the second
tempest began in <hi>Nankim;</hi> which although it were not so great as the first,
because it came not to the Kings ears, ye was it fuller of trouble and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
to us.</p>

                     <p>THe affaires of <hi>Christianitie</hi> in <hi>China</hi> seemed to be in a calme and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
condition, and we had almost as much libertie, and as much
fruit of our endeavours as we could reasonably have expected. Only in the
City of <hi>Nankim,</hi> which was much distempered by reason of the former
<hi>Persecution,</hi> there were alwaies some troubles more or lesse, according as
the occasion happened; but the best was, that they were never so great,
that many persons were engaged in them. In the year 1622. in the <hi>Province</hi>
of <hi>Xantum,</hi> there happened a rebellion by a certain people of a sect which
they call <hi>Palien Kiao,</hi> whereof we have formerly spoken in its proper place.
These assaulted and tooke the barques laden with victuals, which passed
through that <hi>Province</hi> to <hi>Pekim;</hi> and after that, certain Townes; and last of
all, they tooke a City, where they put very many to the sword. This news
presently alarmed the neighbouring <hi>Provinces,</hi> and especially the Court;
whence the <hi>Mandarines</hi> immediately dispatched orders through the whole
Kingdome for the apprehending and chastising all people of this <hi>Sect.</hi> In
the more remote <hi>Provinces,</hi> there was no great heed taken to this <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
but in the Province of <hi>Nankim,</hi> which bordereth upon that of <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
there were great rewards proposed to him that should discover any
of that <hi>Sect.</hi>
                     </p>

                        </gap>out that time, that certain Sergeants did molest and
trouble a neighbour of a certain <hi>Christian,</hi> who going out to help him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he saw him much injured without any pretence of reason for it,
drew them all upon himselfe, who following of him into his house with
much rage and passion, &amp; finding there a <hi>Crosse</hi> &amp; an Image of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
they tooke them and carried them to the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> accusing that <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
to be a follower of the <hi>Law of the Lord of Heaven;</hi> which was all one with
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64464:125"/>
that of the <hi>Palien Kiao.</hi> The <hi>Mandarine</hi> sent to apprehend him, and giving
him the rack, he questioned him; who were the other followers of his <hi>Sect:</hi>
He named only the <hi>Paynter,</hi> who had paynted the Image, and was also
a Christian. He being apprehended and tormented in the same manner,
(whether it were through ignorance, or that it seemed to him, that he did
by that means give a greater authority to the law he followed,) impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many of his companions; naming at least fourty, and among them those
who were left as heads and overseers of the rest; and in absence of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
did assemble the rest in the <hi>Chappels</hi> and <hi>Oratories,</hi> where they used to
exhort them to vertue and piety.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, rather simple confession, than malicious accusation, the
<hi>Mandarine</hi> sent presently to apprehend those persons who had been nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him, so that it seemed as if the furies of hell had been turned loofe
that day into <hi>Nankim.</hi> There was no other noise hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

ratling of chaines, the voyces and exclamations of the Sergeants, who ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Where is the house? Whither is he gone? Where shall I finde him?
When will he come? Being so much the more eager in their pursuit of
the <hi>Christians,</hi> by how much the more they saw the <hi>Mandarines</hi> bent to
ruine them. When they found out any one of them, they presently rushed
into the house, &amp; seized upon their <hi>Beads, Crosses, Images, Books, Catechismes,</hi>
for commonly all of them used to have them in their houses. Then they
feized on their persons, dragging them through the streets with a chaine
fastened about their necks, and manacles about their wrists, carrying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them the ensignes of their faith which they had taken, with a great
noise, and out-cry of the people, that they were of the <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Palien Kiao.</hi>
The number of those who were taken was thirty foure, beside the two first,
and they were all presently put to the torment of pressing their hands and
feet, to make them discover others. But they taking warning by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the two first, said only that they were <hi>Christians,</hi> they and their
wives and children; that they followed the <hi>Law of the true God,</hi> who alone
can punish and reward both in this life and the next; and that their law
was not the law of <hi>Palien Kiao,</hi> neither had it any resemblance to it: and
more than this they said not any thing.</p>
                     <p>Among the prisoners there was a certain <hi>Christian</hi> named <hi>Iohn Yao.</hi>
This man had been formerly imprisoned (as we have already related) with
the <hi>Fathers</hi> in the other persecution by <hi>Xin,</hi> &amp; had been sometimes <hi>Bastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed</hi>
before the <hi>Tribunals,</hi> &amp; was at last condemned to be the Kings slave for
certain years (which is much like putting into the Gallies with us:) but
was now returned from his slavery, and began again to edifie the brethren
by the example of his holy life, in the same maner as he had formerly done
in that City. This man hearing that some <hi>Christians</hi> were apprehended,
and that they sought for him, never staid till he was discovered, but went
of his owne accord and presented himselfe to the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> and kneeling
in the sight of the <hi>Christians</hi> that were tormented, told him, that he was a
<hi>Christian,</hi> and that the <hi>Law of Christ</hi> was the true law, and other such like
things which the Lord put in his heart. When the <hi>Mandarine</hi> heard him,
he told him (with what intention is not knowne) that he did not see in him
any garbe or appearance of a preacher of the law, and therefore charged
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64464:126"/>
him to be gone, and never to appear before him again. Whereupon
<hi>Iohn</hi> rose up and went his way, leaving an eminent Testimony of the
<hi>Divine Law,</hi> and the <hi>Chinesses</hi> astonished at so great a courage.</p>
                     <p>Such another thing was done by the same <hi>Mandarine,</hi> although the end
and reason which moved him to do it, were not known. Of the six and
thirty which he had apprehended and tormented, he set foure and twenty
of them at liberty; and the others who did use to assemble the <hi>Christians,</hi>
and preach to them, he sent before the six chief Tribunals; where they
were all <hi>Bastinadoed,</hi> some at one, and some at another; the worst Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

back upon mens shouldiers into Prison.</p>
                     <p>But they were not used so by the <hi>Quecum</hi> (who is equall to one of our
Dukes) before whom they were brought: for seeing them in so miserable
a condition by reason of the torments and stripes they had received, he
did not only not cause them to be beaten, but complaining of their ill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
said publiquely, That he was well informed concerning the Religion
they professed; and that it was a good and true <hi>Law,</hi> and so sent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with good words; that <hi>Gentile</hi> giving a cleare Testimony to our <hi>Holy
Faith,</hi> to which those <hi>Christians</hi> had born witnesse with their bloud.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>While these things were doing, the chief</hi> Mandarine <hi>of the six before
whom they were presented, drew up the Sentence against them; which
being faithfully translated out of the</hi> Chinesse <hi>language, runneth thus:</hi> The
Law of the Lord of heaven is false, it blindeth the understanding of men, and
causeth dangerous assemblies. Of late years there was a <hi>Memoriall</hi> presented
against it to the King, who did very severely prohibite it. And now they
who follow that <hi>Law,</hi> are convinced not to have obeyed his commands. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
according to the <hi>Lawes</hi> of the Kingdom there ought to be an inquisition
made against them, and they to be rigorously punished. But considering they are
men of little knowledge, or understanding, we do order, that the strangers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countries be sent home with a Guard to convoy them; and that they shall all
have the charges of their journey defrayed out of the <hi>Kings exchequer:</hi> but
for the Natives of this Court, we condemn them to carry a board about their necks
for a moneth <hi>(which is a kind of punishment we have formerly given an
account of)</hi> and when that time is expired, they shall be carried before the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,</hi>
where they were examined, and there they shall be admonished to observe
the Kings orders, and not to follow this <hi>Law</hi> any longer. The Books, Images, and
such like things, which were found with the Christians, shall be kept in the Kings
Treasurie. <hi>Thus farre the sentence of their condemnation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fathers</hi> had heard nothing of these proceedings at <hi>Nankim,</hi> when

perswade the <hi>Mandrines</hi> of <hi>Nankim</hi> to shew some favour to the <hi>Christians;</hi>
which accordingly they did, with much zeale and efficacie, especially
<hi>Docto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r Paul,</hi> who observed to them in his writings fourteen principall
poynts, wherein our <hi>Holy Law</hi> did differ from the Sect of <hi>Palien Kiao.</hi> The
letters had not that effect that was hoped of them, some of the <hi>Mandarines</hi>
being rendered very averse to them by the power and perswasion of <hi>Xin,</hi>
who actually enjoying at that time the dignity of <hi>Colao,</hi> every one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to gain his favour by following his inclinations. And that was
plainely seen by their answers, which are not wont to be in such termes to
<hi>Mandarines</hi> of so considerable Quality as those <hi>Christians</hi> were. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to <hi>Doctour Paul</hi> was, that the <hi>Law,</hi> which his <hi>Lordship</hi> said was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that Sect of <hi>Palien Kiao,</hi> was not so, but the very same, both of
them professing not to obey the King nor his Ministers; as was plainly to
be seen by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who being banished out of the Kingdom by the
Kings order, yet were so audacious, that they still remained there, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of the same straine; which evidently shewed, that they who
gave such answers, were changed, as also for whose sake they gave them.</p>
                     <p>This unpleasing answer was followed by a thing of greater danger; (for
in <hi>China,</hi> even in the quietest times, it is necessary to live very retired and
reservedly) which was the Intelligence, that <hi>Doctour Paul</hi> had received,
how that, not many daies before, two <hi>Mandarines</hi> of the same City of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi>
had presented a <hi>Memoriall</hi> to the King against the <hi>Law of Christ;</hi> both
against the <hi>Chinesses</hi> who were followers of it, as also the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that
did preach and propagate it, accusing <hi>Doctour Michael</hi> by name for being
a <hi>Christian,</hi> and for keeping the <hi>Fathers</hi> in his House; they did also accuse
severall others for keeping of them; and although they did not name
<hi>Doctour Paul,</hi> yet it might be easily understood, that they meant him for
one.</p>
                     <p>This news did require their most serious deliberation; for when a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is brought before the King, it is alwayes of dangerous consequence,
and doth ever shave or flea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doctour Paul</hi> immediately wrote to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that in what place soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they were, they should without any farther delay resolve to retire
themselves, and to break off all commerce with all manner of persons
whatsoever, although they thought them never so safe or trusty, giving
way to the necessity of the times, as at that present was very convenient
for them. <hi>Doctour Michael</hi> was of the contrary opinion; at least he would
not suffer those which lived in his own House to hide themselves. <hi>Doctour
Ignatius</hi> his Sonne also, who dwelt in the City of <hi>Kiati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> was of opinion,
that the <hi>Fathers</hi> should keep themselves private and concealed; for if any
thing should be decreed to their disadvantage, it could not be executed
so suddenly, but that there would be time enough for them to make
their escape, especially since the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of the City were their
friends.</p>
                     <p>Although this were a very young man, yet his <hi>Father,</hi> who lived then
at the Court, was much satisfied with his opinion in that case. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
it was judged more expedient, that we should withdraw our
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64464:127"/>
selves, before the storm appeared, and that afterward those, who could
not hide themselves, should fly, before they were apprehended by justice.
But the difficulty was, where to find another secret place beside that
where we were, which was in a very populous City, and among many of
our trusty and faithfull friends: and because it was so difficult to lie hid in
that place, we did think of searching out some desert; but by reason that
<hi>China</hi> is so populous, that was no easie thing to be done: At length it was
resolved, that we should all quit the habitations we were in, some going
to the Country Houses of the same <hi>Christians,</hi> some to the sepulchres of
others, with a caution, that if there did not come a favourable answer
from the King, there should be boates provided in a readinesse for to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them up and down the Rivers, where the not remaining long in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
certain place, would be a good way to secure them, till the Lord should
direct them to a better.</p>
                     <p>During this time, <hi>Doctour Paul</hi> kept a man on purpose in the City of
<hi>Sucheu</hi> (where the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of the Province hath his Residence; for he may
not dwell in the City of <hi>Nankim,</hi> because it is the Kings Court, as well as
<hi>Pekim</hi>) that assoon as the Kings answer came, he might presently bring
him word of it: and according to the stile of that Country, it was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that it might be delayed yet many dayes. The <hi>Fathers</hi> expected ten
weeks to their great discommodation and inconvenience, because those
things which might easily have been had in the Towns and Cities, could
not be come by but with a great deale of trouble, as they lay thus hid;
neither did any answer come in all this time: for which there were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reasons given, but the best seemed to be, that these <hi>Memorials</hi> against
our <hi>Holy Faith</hi> were sent with an Order, that they should first be registred
by <hi>Xin,</hi> for whose sake they were presented, who at the same time was
put out of his Office. So that when the <hi>Memorials</hi> came, he had now no
power nor authority to preferre them; and so they were not presented at
all; for if they had been presented, whether the King had answered them
or no, we should have been sure to have had notice of it. Thus the storm
ended, which seemed to threaten us with a greater danger; and the effect
of it was turned upon <hi>Xin,</hi> although upon another occasion: for it is most
certain, that at the same time, when the Petitions against the <hi>Law of Christ</hi>
were sent from the <hi>Southern</hi> to the <hi>Northern</hi> Court, the King took away
his Office of <hi>Colao,</hi> by reason the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of <hi>Pekim</hi> had petitioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; and although they had endeavoured his disgrace for 16 months
before, yet they could never bring it about till then. So that it seemeth,
the Lord did reserve the fall of this <hi>Tyrant,</hi> for that time wherein he
might have done the greatest mischiefe, and would shew us, what trust
and confidence we ought to have in him upon the like occasions.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Doctours</hi> being of the opinion, that the <hi>Memorials,</hi> neither were,
nor would be presented, the <hi>Fathers</hi> returned all to their <hi>Ancient Residen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi>
although they were obliged to use more caution, and to make fewer
assemblies; and this the rather, because they did not yet receive good
news from <hi>Nankim,</hi> where there were new edicts published against the
<hi>Christian Religion:</hi> which news, although on the one side it occasioned
much grief to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> yet on the other side it gave them much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64464:127"/>
by the relation of the <hi>Martyrdome</hi> of a certain <hi>Christian,</hi> called <hi>Andrew,</hi>
concerning whose life and actions very much might be said, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of that courage and constancy which he shewed in all the torments they
gave him: which is so much the more admirable in a <hi>Chinesse;</hi> because
that Nation is by nature very cowardly and timorous: yet we have had
certain experience, that even to this day the <hi>Christian Chinesses,</hi> in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of <hi>Persecutions</hi> and <hi>Troubles</hi> that have happened to them, have ever
continued firme in the <hi>Faith:</hi> (so that by the grace of God they have not
been wanting to <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> but <hi>Martyrdome</hi> hath been wanting to them,)
as was seen in those of <hi>Nankim,</hi> and was proved in this good <hi>Christian
Andrew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Andrew</hi> was borne in the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Kia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>si,</hi> where after he had
lived many yeares, he removed from thence into the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Nankim,</hi>
where having had some information concerning our religion, he came up
the <hi>Fathers;</hi> and after he had been well instructed by them in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
points of our <hi>Faith,</hi> he received <hi>Baptisme</hi> from them, together with
the name of <hi>Andrew.</hi> Some few daies after his whole familie was <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>
by the hand of <hi>Father Rocca,</hi> who was <hi>Superiour</hi> there at that time. After
his <hi>Baptisme, Andrew</hi> became a pattern and example to the rest of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
by endeavouring to communicate to others the good which he had
received, and to draw others to <hi>Christ,</hi> which succeeded very happily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many being <hi>Baptized</hi> by his perswasions. He had a great devotion to
the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> and was the most zealous man of a whole fraternitie, which
before the <hi>Persecution</hi> of <hi>Nankim</hi> was dedicated to her in our Church there:
and after that, when the <hi>Fathers</hi> were banished, he built an oratory in his
owne house to the honour of that <hi>Holy Mother;</hi> whither he used to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the <hi>Christians,</hi> and to exhort them to devotion and observance of our
<hi>Holy Law.</hi> At the time the <hi>Fathers</hi> were imprisoned there, and the other
<hi>Christians</hi> were divided into five prisons, he without any fear of that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to which he did expose himselfe, tooke upon him to serve them, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit,
comfort and assist them, especially the <hi>Fathers,</hi> with many almes at his
owne expence; not being content to performe these offices of <hi>Charitie</hi> in
his owne person only, he imployed in them also a little boy that was his
sonne, whom he sent to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that they might make use of him to
send him of errants, and other little occasions. Likewise at our return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he lent us his house for our habitation when we went to visit the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
of that place, and for an Infirmary, or Hospitall, when any were sick,
whom he served and tooke care of with great charity and affection. These
and other good works did the Lord pay him by crowning him with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome,</hi>
and making him to suffer death for his sake. The good old man
patiently suffered the torments and <hi>Bastinadoes</hi> abovementioned; and when
as the last which he received, beside that they were very cruell ones, were
also laid on upon the wounds and stripes, but lately inflicted on him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
other <hi>Tribunalls,</hi> it is no wonder, that an old man, who though he were
strong in courage, yet was but weake in body, should render his life to the
violence of those torments; since the youngest of those <hi>Christians,</hi> and
those of the most robust complexion did hardly escape with life. Thus he
dyed, leaving that <hi>Church</hi> much edified by his good example, and much
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64464:128"/>
afflicted for the losse of him. For he was, as it were a <hi>Father</hi> to them all,
and in the absence of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> a <hi>Master.</hi> He was buried decently in a
particular Sepulchre by himselfe, to the end that one day he may have
those honours, which are due to him, performed with greater solemnitie.</p>

                     <p>IN the mean time there came better news from <hi>Nankim,</hi> whither the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
had sent a man on purpose, with letters from themselvs, as also from
our <hi>Doctours,</hi> to comfort and strengthen the <hi>Christians</hi> there in their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and troubles; although the Lord had so filled their hearts with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and contentment, that they had little need of any humane consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This man returned with a confirmation of the news, which was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
spread abroad, assuring them that all things were quiet: the same also
was written by the <hi>Christians</hi> in their letters. For the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> seeing that
the plot did not take, and that the <hi>Memorialls</hi> were not presented at <hi>Pekim,</hi>
and on the other side, that <hi>Xin</hi> was turned out of his Office, they presently
changed their stile and opinion; they set the <hi>Christians</hi> at liberty, and also
moderated the punishment that had been imposed upon them. Only there
remained in prison three <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> who expected every day to
be sent into their owne <hi>Province,</hi> as it afterwards fell out. From <hi>Pekim</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the <hi>Father,</hi> who lay hid there, wrote, that all the hopes of our enemies
of <hi>Nankim</hi> were quite overthrown at that Court; and that the face of
things was so changed, since the departure of <hi>Xin,</hi> that our friends did
counsell him to treate with the Christian <hi>Mandarines,</hi> and such other of
them, as (although they were Gentiles, yet) had a good affection for us, to
finde out some way for him to go publickly abroad, and for us to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
thither againe.</p>
                     <p>By this time there had six or seven years passed, since the first <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Nankim;</hi> and the <hi>Tartars</hi> made a cruell warre upon the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> and
had already not only defeated severall of their armies, but also gained di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
places from them in the Province of <hi>Leaotum;</hi> neither did they well
know which way to put a stop to the advance of their army. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
the <hi>Fathers</hi> did endeavour to finde some way to manifest themselves
to the Kingdome, and to appeare in publick, according to the tenour of
what had been written them from <hi>Pekim:</hi> But because their banishment
was decreed by the King, they found no small difficulty in the businesse.
Notwithstanding, the <hi>Christians,</hi> and the <hi>Doctours</hi> that were our friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to frame a <hi>Memoriall;</hi> taking the occasion from the warre with the
<hi>Tartars,</hi> and the extremities to which the <hi>Chinesses</hi> were reduced, and to
present it to the King; setting forth in the first place the misfortunes of the
warre, the mortality and damages which they had received; the losse of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64464:128"/>
their Townes and Cities, without having been able for the space of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years, after such infinite expence of treasure and losse of men, either to
divert or stop the course of that calamitie. In the second place they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the errour, which was committed in banishing the <hi>Europaean
Fathers,</hi> who, beside that they were vertuous, learned, and men capable of
the management of great affaires, they were also very great <hi>Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who without doubt had particular secrets, and extraordinary inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which might be made use of to their extraordinary advantage in that
great straite wherein the Kingdom was at present: and that if they were
in the Court, as they had formerly been, that they would be able to reduce
the affaires of state into a better condition. Last of all they added, that it
was probable, that they were not all yet departed, and that it
was not possible, that so many men should be able to passe through so
great a Kingdom, through so many straite and uncouth waies; That his
Majesty should do well to give order for diligent search to be made
through the whole Kingdom, to see if any of them were still to be found
there, and to send for them to Court, that they might be serviceable to
him in this present conjuncture of the warre.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fathers</hi> made great opposition against this particular means which
was taken for their re-establishment; by reason they were altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in matters of warre and armes, and all things belonging to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:
and therefore they did not thinke it convenient, that they should
be petitioned for under that pretence. To this, as I understand, <hi>Dr. Leo</hi> who
was one of the chiefe Actours in this Tragedie, presently made answer,
<hi>Fathers,</hi> let not this trouble you, for this pretence of arms shall stand us in
no more stead, then the needle d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

through the thred he soweth with, and the garment is finished, presently
taketh the needle away; let your Reverences once get in by the Kings order,
and the armes to fight with, shall be turned into pens to write. In conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
the <hi>Memoriall</hi> was drawne up very well; they having excellent skill to
frame a petition after their manner; it was presented in the <hi>Chancery</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,</hi>
and they tooke such paines in solliciting their friends, that they got
it passed, and presented to the Kings hands, with such good successe, that
immediately he made a favourable reference of it to the <hi>Councell of warre;</hi>
who did not only favour the disigne, but added also, that they did verily
beleeve, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> by their skill in the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> would be able
so to enchant the <hi>Tartars,</hi> that they should not be able to manage their
armes against them. They therefore immediately gave order, that they
should be sought out with all possible diligence: But there was no need to
take much pains to finde them out, for he that was to seeke them, knew
well enough where to have them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Father Rocca,</hi> our <hi>Superiour,</hi> who resided at that time in the <hi>Southern</hi> parts,
had presently news of the Kings order; &amp; that he was to send two <hi>Fathers</hi> to
that Court. It is almost incredible what joy there was both among the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
&amp; the rest of the <hi>Christians;</hi> they knowing, that this was the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
way, for the <hi>Fathers</hi> to returne publickly into the Kingdom, &amp; for the
propagation of the Gospel, with the same libertie they formerly enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Father Nicolas Longobardus</hi> and <hi>Father Emanuel Dias</hi> were named for this
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64464:129"/>
expedition; who assoone as they had fitted themselves for their journy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
for <hi>Pekim;</hi> where they made their entrance publickly. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some years had now passed, since beards of the <hi>Europaean fashion</hi> had
been seen in that City, there was so great a concourse of people to see them,
that they could hardly make their way through them. The first thing they
did, was to present themselves to the <hi>Tribunall of warre,</hi> (the care of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them out having been recommended to the <hi>Mandarines</hi> of that <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall</hi>)
who received them with all manner of courtesie and civility, and
profered to take the care themselves of their lodging and accommodation,
which the <hi>Fathers</hi> would by no means accept, excusing themselves, that
they had not yet merit enough to accept of their offer: but gave them very
great thanks, and promised to receive their kindnesse, when they should
see a fit time for it. But the true reason was, partly that they might not
be burthensome to them, and partly that they might remain the
freer by having the lesse obligation to be employed in their affaires of
warre; under which title they had been brought in thither. As for a House,
it seemed good to the <hi>Christians,</hi> that they should returne to that, where
they had formerly made their abode for so many years, and where they
were yet well knowne and beloved of the neighbourhood: Besides that,
by that means the world would more clearly understand, upon how little
reason they were banished; and moreover, they should save building of a
new Church, the old one having been bought on purpose by a <hi>Christian:</hi>
only there was great need of repayring; for the buildings of <hi>China,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
principally of wood, are not so strong and lasting as ours: But <hi>Dr.
Ignatius,</hi> who resided at that time in the Court, tooke upon him to repaire
all at his owne charges, and did accommodate them very excellently, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
the Church; and when every thing was ready, the Fathers went
thither to dwell; where they do yet inhabit to this very day, medling on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with such things as belong to their profession, without being ever spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to concerning warre, <hi>Tartars</hi> or <hi>Armes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The affaires of the Court being thus happily accomplished, and the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
dwelling freely and openly in their ancient House, they began to set
on foote their former exercises. They did cultivate and perfect the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Christians;</hi> they preached to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> they received the
visits, which the <hi>Mandarines</hi> and their friends did pay them, with the same
familiaritie as formerly, and without any other cautions, but such as are at
all times necessary in <hi>China.</hi> This securitie and libertie in the Court by
publique approbation, was in a little while after communicated to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Houses, where the rest of the <hi>Fathers</hi> did reside. So that by little and
little, preaching and other exercises of religion were so happily encreased
and enlarged, that in the year 1628, and 29. whilest we lived peaceably
in the places of our abode, a doore was opened to the Gospel, and the way
cleared to the conversion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without finding any opposition,
or resistance, to the designes which God had encouraged us to undertake;
although it was alwaies necessary to make some <hi>Magistrate</hi> our friend in the
place of our employment.</p>
                     <p>In the same measure that our libertie encreased, the Gospel was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
divulged in severall parts; new Residencies were set up, with Houses
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64464:129"/>
and Churches belonging to them, and <hi>Fathers</hi> were sent to make their
abode at them. Two, beside Oratories, were instituted in the Province of
<hi>Fokien,</hi> both of them very numerous in <hi>Christians.</hi> In the Province of
<hi>Xansi,</hi> there was one set up, and in that of <hi>Xunsi,</hi> another, as also another in
the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Honan,</hi> all which do flourish at this day in a copious <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie.</hi>
At my departure thence, there was another beginning, which is
now finished, having a Church and some store of <hi>Christians,</hi> and they did
resolve to send some <hi>Fathers</hi> to reside there. But because hereafter there
will be an account given of them all in particular, I will stay no longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this subject.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fathers</hi> returned to their ancient Houses, (which were five in all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the persecution) after they had repaired and put them in some hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
condition. That of <hi>Pekim,</hi> (with the accommodation of the House
and Church, as is above-said,) had three <hi>Fathers,</hi> &amp; one Lay-Brother, who
laboured very successefully in encreasing the number of <hi>Christians.</hi> That
of <hi>Hamcheu</hi> had a new House and Church, and more capacious than the
former; which was indeed very necessary, by reason of the great number
of <hi>Christians,</hi> both Old and new ones, of which there are some made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day. That of <hi>Kiamsi</hi> had likwise a new Church and House scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the most publique Street of that City. That of <hi>Canton</hi> was let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
not only because (before) it could not be continued as the rest were;
but also out of consideration that it was better to leave a place so subject
to stormes and troubles, and in stead thereof to take another, where we
might find more profit and security. Neverthelesse, the <hi>Christians</hi> there
are very carefully visited every year,</p>
                     <p>At the House of <hi>Nankim</hi> we had enough to do; for the <hi>Christians</hi> of
that Church could not endure, that they having been the first in persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and troubles, and the most exercised in them, should be the last in
spirituall favours; and not only the last; but even when other Houses were
well provided with <hi>Fathers,</hi> their Church only should want them.
The <hi>Fathers</hi> also did much desire a Residency there, &amp; did therefore very
frequently visit them. But to set up a publique and open House, was very
difficult, by reason of the persecutions that had happened there. But at
length, all difficulties were overcome; &amp; a Residencie was instituted there,
although it were late first; which, next under God, we owe to <hi>Dr. Paul,</hi> who
that he might alwayes do good, did this even after his death, in this maner.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fathers</hi> had no other hope of this businesse, but the opportunity
of some <hi>Christian Mandarine</hi> or friend, who should come to governe that
City; that under his protection they might be introduced with greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
and security. It happened about that time, that a Disciple of <hi>Doctour
Pauls</hi> was sent thither to be <hi>President of the Councell of Warre;</hi> and as the
<hi>Doctour</hi> was very vigilant in this matter, he presently helped the Fathers
to that which they desired; that <hi>Mandarine</hi> being of great authority, and
being his Disciple, he would do whatsoever he should require of him.
This overture pleased the <hi>Fathers</hi> very well: and because they would
send thither an experienced person, the place being of such great danger
and such great importance, they did for some time retard the execution of
it, because they were to take a Father away from some other Place, which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64464:130"/>
so was to remaine unprovided. In the meane while <hi>Doctour Paul</hi> fell sick,
who was at that time actually <hi>Colao</hi> in the Court; yet did not his sicknesse
hinder him from writing and sending a letter to the <hi>Mandarine</hi> in favour of
us. But his sicknesse increasing, by that time the letter arried at <hi>Nankim,</hi>
the good <hi>Doctour Paul</hi> was gone to a better life. But the <hi>Mandarine</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the letter, (which the <hi>Father</hi> gave him with some hesitation) not as
from a dead friend, but from a living Master: he received also the Father
with all demonstrations of courtesie and good will. By his favour and
order a House was taken; and the other <hi>Mandarines</hi> seeing how he used
the Father, to please him (for all desire to second the great ones) they
did likewise shew him many favours, not only with their authority and
frequent visits, but also by giving him money toward the buying of the
Houses. In this manner was that Church well provided for, and the
<hi>Christians</hi> comforted, who have been since very much encreased.</p>
                     <p>About that time, which was in the year 1632 the affaires of that Church
did proceed in a much different manner, from what they had done former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
so that it seemed that those stormes had only raised the little barque of
that Church to a greater height; not only in the number of the <hi>Baptized,</hi>
which without comparison every year encreased, but also the peace and
quiet they enjoyed, and the liberty they had to preach: so that there was
a generall knowledge of our <hi>Holy beliefe</hi> dispersed over the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
insomuch that there is hardly a place in it, whither, either by books
written upon that subject, or by the acquaintance of <hi>Christians,</hi> or by the
report of <hi>Gentiles</hi> themselves, it is not arrived; and this not only in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost
parts of the Kingdome; where for the most part the <hi>Fathers</hi> are
employed, but also in the skirts and extremities thereof. I will bring some
examples, which will clearly demonstrate it.</p>
                     <p>There came sometimes to the City of <hi>Macao</hi> (which is inhabited by
<hi>Portugheses,</hi> and is scituated on the Confines of <hi>China</hi>) some <hi>Christian Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darines</hi>
about state affaires; who have not onely publickly declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be <hi>Christians,</hi> but have also made it appear that they were well
instructed in the principles of our faith; and have carried themselves with
so much edification; and sanctity of life in the exercise of all <hi>Christian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
that they have much edified that people, and may be examples to
<hi>Christians</hi> of much greater antiquity.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1631 the <hi>Portughesse</hi> ships setting saile from <hi>Macao</hi> toward <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appon</hi>
(as usually they do every year) about the height of <hi>Fokien</hi> a Province
of <hi>China,</hi> one of the ships was cast away; and all the men drowned, except
onely 12 persons, who saved themselves in the long boate almost by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
by reason it happened in the night, and the wind blew very strong,
and the seas ran exceeding high: yet at length with much ado; although
they had neither needle nor compasse, they came a shore, and landed in the
said Province of <hi>Fokien.</hi> Presently the people flocked about the poor
shipwrackt men who had more need of food and clothing than of being
examined who they were; but because the <hi>Hollanders</hi> (of whom the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>
have a very ill conceit) did use about that time to exercise much pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
and robbery upon those coasts, they put them in prison, where by
reason they were not only strangers, but were also accounted enemies,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64464:130"/>
they endured extraordinary want &amp; misery. Many people went to see them
out of curiosity, because they were strangers, who as they are seldome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into that Country, are thought a rare spectacle. Among the rest,
there were some <hi>Christians</hi> (which is that I would shew) who were led to
see them out of the same curiosity that others had: and taking notice that
they carried beads, and crosses about them, and that they used to say
over their beads, they judged them to be of the same profession as
themselves were: therefore they made diligent enquirie about it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
assured that they were <hi>Christians,</hi> although they were strictly forbid to
shew them any kindnesse, yet Charitie, which is alwayes ingenious, found a
way for them to help them, and to provide them with what they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
To cloath them they used this pious shift: they would go into the
prison (for as I have fomerly said, he that visiteth a prisoner must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
go into the prison) having a double suit of cloathes one over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and as soon as they were got in, they would very dexterously slip off
their under garments, and give them to those poor men, and go out again
onely with their own cloathes, without any discovery of so seasonable a
charity, for the reliefe of those unfortunate wretches.</p>
                     <p>Whilst I lived in the Province of <hi>Kiamsi</hi> at <hi>Nancham,</hi> the capital City
thereof; where we have a Church and House, there came thither a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
of another City, on purpose to conferre with me concerning his
consciennce, and other spirituall matters: and because the place where he
lived was far distant from us, and he could not often make that journey;
his custome was to make a pretty long stay when he did come, and then,
after his generall confession and pennance was ended, to returne home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
One time at his departure I desired him to use his best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to perswade his kindred, friends, neighbours and other persons, to
embrace our <hi>Holy Faith,</hi> and that if he found any disposition or inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them to it, he should presently give me notice of it. He did so, and
about a month after, he sent me an invitation to come thither, for that
there was an opportunity of casting my nets: I went thither, and because
he had not a House bigge enough to receive the company that would
come to treate with me, I did accommodate my self in one of those Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which the <hi>Chinesses</hi> call <hi>Zutham,</hi> and do belong to a whole Family in
common, where at set times of the yeare the whole Family do assemble
themselves to treate of the affaires of that Family, and of the behaviour
and manner of living of some of that Kindred; and there they reprove,
chastise, give orders, &amp;c. these Houses for the most part stand empty, only
there is some one or other, who keepeth and taketh care of them. Neere
unto that dwelt a <hi>Mandarine;</hi> who having heard of my arrivall, and that I
was a stranger, drawn as I beleeve by his curiosity, came presently to visit
me. But as we do not use in these visits to let slip any opportunity of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, I entred into discourse with him
concerning that matter. He asked me thereupon many extravagant que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions;
and not being, as it seemed, much pleased with my answers, he
took his leave of me with a great deale of civility; and, when he had done,
he went and accused me to the second <hi>Governour</hi> of the City; telling him,
that there dwelt a stranger; that the times were dangerous; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64464:131"/>
that I taught a new law, which was contrary to theirs, and prejudicial
to the State; that therefore it did behoove his Lordship to use all care and
diligence to prevent the mischiefe that might ensue upon it. Lesse than
this would have been sufficient to have caused me to be apprehended, if
the <hi>Mandarine</hi> had not been a cautious and discreet person. Neverthelesse,
he sent some of his Officers for me: there came into the House where I
was about thirty or fourty men, some of them being sent, and others only
out of curiosity to see me; as also the <hi>Tifam</hi> of that street, (who is obliged
to give account of what ever passeth there) and brought an order for me to
appear before the <hi>Governour.</hi> Just in that instant in came the <hi>Christian</hi> who
had sent for me, who was a <hi>Litterato,</hi> and well esteemed in that City; and
taking me by the hand, would needs go along to give an account of me to
the <hi>Governour;</hi> where he found also the <hi>Mandarine</hi> that had accused me.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Christian</hi> told the <hi>Mandarine,</hi> that I lived in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the
<hi>Province,</hi> and that I had a friendship with the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> and other <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi>
of Quality (which was very true:) and that for the <hi>Law</hi> which
I taught, it was no secret, but that I did preach it openly at the Court; and
that my companions did the same every where publickly; as the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi>
of the <hi>Metropolis</hi> knew very well. The <hi>Governour</hi> having heard these
words, from a person of that merit, would make no further enquirie into
the cause, but remitted it to the first <hi>Governour,</hi> whom we found on his
<hi>Tribunall.</hi> The <hi>Tifam</hi> began to give him an account of the businesse, but he
being not well instructed in it, could not make him understand it. Then
the <hi>Christian</hi> began to speak, and to give an account of what had happened,
in the presence of almost an infinite multitude of people; of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
there being two, who, hearing him talk of the <hi>Law of God,</hi> signed
themselves with the <hi>Signe</hi> of the <hi>Crosse</hi> in the sight of a young man who
stood near them: The young man asked them, If they were <hi>Christians:</hi> They
answered, No, but that they had a friend who was a <hi>Christian,</hi> and
that he had taught them to make the signe of the Crosse, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse
several prayers. The <hi>Governour,</hi> assoon as he heard of <hi>Thien Chu Kiao,</hi>
that is, <hi>The Law of the Lord</hi> of heaven; he said: this law hath many follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in my Country, and is a very good <hi>Law:</hi> what would the Father
have else? The <hi>Christian</hi> answered: nothing, <hi>my Lord,</hi> but only to give
an account of himself in answer to what he is accused of by <hi>Hioquon</hi> (for
that was the name of the <hi>Mandarine</hi> that had complained of me) neere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom he dwelleth. Then the <hi>Governour</hi> replyed, Tell the <hi>Father</hi> he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in no good neighbour-hood; and wish him to find a better. The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
answered, since your <hi>Lordship</hi> would have him change his habitation,
be pleased to command he should have a House allowed him during the
short time he is to make his abode in this City. The advice pleased him,
and presently he gave order, there should be some Chambers provided
for me in a certain <hi>Palace,</hi> and in them I lived during the whole time that
I spent there: so that by the occasion of the others turning me out of
the House, I came to get one that was farre better.</p>
                     <p>As a <hi>Portughese Carrack</hi> was on her way from <hi>Macao</hi> toward <hi>Manila,</hi> she
strook unfortunately upon the sands of <hi>Pulosisi,</hi> and was cast away; there
being hardly fourty persons saved in the long boate; who steering as
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64464:131"/>
well as they could towards the next land, after some daies, arrived at the
Island of <hi>Hainan,</hi> which is but a little way distant from the Westerne
part of the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Canton,</hi> and from <hi>Macao</hi> two daies saile with a good
winde. Assoon as they landed, they were presenly apprehended accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the custome of that Island, with a noise and stir which boded no
good to those poor shipwrackt men. They found some <hi>Christians</hi> in that
Island, who were very helpfull to them, and among the rest there was a
<hi>Mandarine</hi> called <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who had been a long time a <hi>Christian,</hi> as also
his whole Family, a very good and devout person, as I had formerly
known him to be at <hi>Nankim.</hi> It pleased God for the comfort and solace of
those poor <hi>Portugheses,</hi> that he should govern the Island at that time. Assoon
as he had understood what had happened to those prisoners, fearing what
might fall out, he commanded the cause to be brought unto his <hi>Tribunall.</hi>
When therefore the poor prisoners were brought into his presence; and
after that he understood they were <hi>Christians,</hi> he not only commiserated
their condition, but presently commanded they should be set at liberty,
and kept them for some time in his Palace. It is hard to expresse the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
and <hi>Love,</hi> with which he entertained them, endeavouring to refresh
and comfort them after the labours and dangers they had passed, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with them so familiarly and so cordially, and giving them such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in his own person of all <hi>Christian vertues,</hi> that the <hi>Portughesses</hi> did
afterwards very highly commend him, both in <hi>Macao</hi> and many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and not only his own carriage and behaviour, but also that of his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;
but above all, they did admire the care and diligence with which he
gave them notice both of Fasts and Holy-dayes, to the end they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them: so that while they stayed there, he served them also in stead
of a Parish Priest.</p>
                     <p>On the day of <hi>S. Agnes,</hi> which was that whereon his wife was <hi>Baptized,</hi>
and called by the same name, he made a very great <hi>Feast:</hi> first a Spirituall
one in his Chappel, where they all met to do their devotions, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
themselvs unto <hi>God;</hi> and after that, he gave them a Sumptuous and
Splendid banquet. After he had entertained them a good while, and that
they had recovered their health and strength againe, he lent them a Barque
and Marriners to carry them to <hi>Macao.</hi> I could bring many other examples,
which I omit for brevities sake, seeing these are sufficient to prove what I
said before; That the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> one way or other, is dispersed over
the whole Kingdome of <hi>China.</hi>

and the Conclusion of this
History.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Chinesse Christianity</hi> hath so great an obligation to the singular
pietie, and charitable assistance afforded them upon all occasions by
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64464:132"/>
                        <hi>Doctour Leo,</hi> that I cannot finish this relation without giving a briefe <hi>Essay</hi>
of his life and death, which may serve also for a testimony of the great
zeale of those new <hi>Christians;</hi> although I shall forbeare to mention many
things concerning his sanctitie; as also severall graces and gifts conferred
upon him by Almighty God, referring the <hi>Reader</hi> to the yearly letters,
where they are more particularly set downe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dr. Leo</hi> was borne in the City of <hi>Hamcheu</hi> in the Province of <hi>Chekiam,</hi>
and having happily finished the course of his studies, he removed to the
Court of <hi>Pekim,</hi> where he obtained the degree of Doctour, and executed
the first employment, which was conferred upon him after his degree.
There he saw and conversed with Father <hi>Matthaeus Riccius,</hi> as did also the
greatest part of the chiefe Officers and <hi>Letterati;</hi> moved by a curiositie of
seeing men of <hi>Europe.</hi> This <hi>Leo,</hi> besides that he was of a quick and viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
wit, had a most eager and intense desire of knowledge; by which
means he did the more engage himselfe to an inward friendship and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with the <hi>Father,</hi> being allured thereunto by the solidity and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
of our <hi>Sciences,</hi> and particularly by the delight he tooke in some maps
and other curiosities; so that he could have been willing to have lived al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
in his company. In the meane while, together with humane <hi>Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
the <hi>Father</hi> did instruct him in the heavenly wisdome of the <hi>Law of God;</hi>
and he was growne so skilfull and well versed in it, that he was able to
help the <hi>Father</hi> in the correction and augmentation of a <hi>Catechisme,</hi> which
he had made some years before, and was then about to re-print it. He did
therein much admire the great conformitie of our <hi>Mysteries,</hi> with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalls
of reason, the concordance, order, and admirable consequence of
the points of our <hi>Faith:</hi> and although he did not at that time give an entire
credence to them, neverthelesse he was much delighted to see every thing
therein so well ordered and disposed; being wont often to say, That if these
things were not true, they were wisely invented, and very conformable
to the light of nature. He continued the same affection toward the <hi>Father</hi>
for some years; wherein he much assisted, both with his counsell and
authority, the foundation of that House; and indeed he was the first
that did encourage the <hi>Father</hi> to the enterprise; and furnished him with
mony to buy the ground, and to build the Church.</p>
                     <p>All these good works, accompanied with the <hi>fastings</hi> and <hi>Penance</hi>
which he performed, while he was yet a <hi>Gentile,</hi> were as so many disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to fit and prepare him for the reception of that divine light,
which the Lord was pleased to communicate unto him. He was then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in the truth of our <hi>Holy faith,</hi> and did much desire to be baptized;
which notwithstanding <hi>Father Riccius</hi> would not consent unto, by reason
of a certain impediment which he had at that time; but being afterwards
sick and in great danger of death, the <hi>Father</hi> was constrained to <hi>Baptize</hi>
him. And immediatly after, the <hi>Lord</hi> was pleased, by means and vertue
of that <hi>Sacrament</hi> and the other of <hi>Extreame Unction,</hi> to deliver him from
that death, which he expected every hour; as he himselfe confessed during
his whole life, and alwaies gave particular thanks to God for it.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, he returned home to his owne House; where, having bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
himselfe one evening in breaking and burning all the <hi>Idols</hi> he could
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64464:132"/>
finde, <hi>Dr. Michael</hi> his ancient friend, (though yet a <hi>Gentile</hi> and very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in the worship of <hi>Idols,</hi> and observant in their superstition) came in
to visit him. He was much astonished at the sight, and could not forbeare
to reprove him for it: but by the others answer, he received so much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
that he had an earnest desire to heare and understand better the
<hi>Law of Christ,</hi> which he afterwards received; &amp; the same <hi>Dr. Leo</hi> assisted him
as <hi>God-father</hi> at his <hi>Baptisme;</hi> for about that time there came to live in <hi>Leo's</hi>
House, the <hi>Fathers, Lazarus, Catanaeus,</hi> and <hi>Nicolas Trigaultius,</hi> who did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
discourse there, with <hi>Dr. Michael;</hi> he carried them to a Country house
of his, (whither he went often to dwell,) that he might with more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and leisure discourse with them concerning the <hi>Law of God:</hi> he doing
this often, was at length converted and <hi>Baptized;</hi> wherein <hi>Dr. Leo</hi> had the
greatest share and merit; conferring a most important benefit upon this
Church, by the conversion of a person of that <hi>Quality,</hi> who for many years
together, in the heate and trouble of the greatest persecutions, did ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
protect, and favour us above measure.</p>
                     <p>From that day forward these two <hi>Doctours, Michael</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> were the
heads and pillars of our <hi>Holy faith</hi> in those Kingdoms: for, in the greatest
fury of that persecution, wherein the <hi>Fathers</hi> were banished the Kingdom,
eight of them concealed themselves in that City; not only maintaining
what they had already gained, but also encreasing it so much, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
about 8 or 10 years before, there were but three Churches in all <hi>China,</hi>
we have at this day many in eight Provinces, as also twelve Houses, the
number of the <hi>faithfull</hi> being very much encreased every where.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dr. Leo</hi> made continuall progresse in the <hi>Christian religion,</hi> and shewed
in act, upon all occasions, what he had before embraced and resolved in his
minde. When he went to take possession of the first office, which was
given him after he was a <hi>Christian,</hi> he was advertised by the Ministers and
Officers, that, according to the custome, he should go and worship, and
take his oath before the <hi>Idols,</hi> which in great number were placed in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Hall of that <hi>Palace,</hi> where he was to lodge. The <hi>Doctour</hi> went, and
being come to the roome where the <hi>Idols</hi> were, the <hi>Ceremonie</hi> he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
was, to cause them to be all overturned and throwne to the ground,
and then to be broken in pieces: so that the Sergeants themselves, who
were constrained to execute this Commandement, which seemed to them
a very great impiety, said among themselves, <hi>Sure this new Lord of ours is not
very well in his wits.</hi> So great was the horrour and hatred which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
against the devill. He was in this particular very severe and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
all the time of his life; neither did he account them men, that were
deceived in that point, &amp; had so little sense, as to believe <hi>Idols</hi> to be gods;
and those, who had any occasion to heare the <hi>Law of God,</hi> or to read the
books which treated of it, and did not judge it to be true, to want braines,
and to be voyd of understanding. He perswaded himselfe, that all they
who could read, and took a delight in the reading of books, that it was not
possible, but that they should have a great passion for the Learning and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of <hi>Europe;</hi> and that by means of them, they must needs arrive at the
knowledge of the true God, and receive his <hi>Holy law.</hi> Therefore his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
care always was to perswade the <hi>Fathers</hi> to apply themselves to the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64464:133"/>
translating the books of <hi>Europe;</hi> and he himselfe did help them in it all he
could, which was not a little.</p>
                     <p>Hence it was, that ever since he knew the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which was about the
space of thirty years, he almost alwaies busied himselfe in this exercise;
which he followed with so much study and application, that even in the
Country, at recreations, visits and banquets, he never went without a book
in his sleeve, or in the chaire, wherein he was carried on mens shoulders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and when he was alone, he did either read or write; although it was more
troublesome to him, than it would have been to another of lesse ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and capacity, by reason of his want of sight in one eye, which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
lost; and the little sight he had in the other which was left: so that in
writing or reading he was faine almost to touch the paper with his eye.
And truly he made such progresse in our <hi>Sciences,</hi> that he could have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
upon any subject better than many in <hi>Europe,</hi> that esteeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
learned men.</p>
                     <p>He perfectly understood the first six books of Euclid; which are now
translated into the <hi>Chinesse</hi> tongue; he had learned all the kinds of our <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,</hi>
with many particular rules and subtleties which are taught in that
Art; of which subject he composed seaven <hi>Tomes;</hi> he was very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with all that belongeth to the <hi>Spheare,</hi> and such like <hi>curiosities.</hi> But
what is most of all, he understood very well, and helped to translate the
books of <hi>Aristotle de Caelo;</hi> together with the questions, which are handled
upon them by the Schoole of <hi>Conimbra;</hi> so that he had perfectly penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into that matter: and finally, he learnt a great part of our <hi>Logick,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which he left 20 <hi>Tomes</hi> in the <hi>Chinesse</hi> language to be printed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
he discoursed so pertinently of all these and other matters, with so
much ease and delight, that it was not so facile for others, who were well
versed in them, to follow him. He never made account of those curious
commodities, which came from <hi>Europe,</hi> and which were so much este<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by others; all his delight and content was, to see some new and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
book, that was brought out of <hi>Europe:</hi> Then would he sigh to see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
old and alone, not finding in other <hi>Christians</hi> the zeale, which he had
of a thing so important, to the conversion of that Kingdom, as was the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
us in the translation of such books. With the <hi>Fathers</hi> he never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
of any thing, but either of <hi>God,</hi> or of our <hi>Sciences.</hi> It was a know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thing among us, that when he saw us, (which he did many times a week,)
the first thing he would ask, was, What book it was we were about transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
and if he knew the subject, how much we had already translated? And
I can speak it with truth, that of fifty works which the <hi>Fathers</hi> have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
into the <hi>Chinesse</hi> tongue, both of <hi>Divinitie</hi> &amp; other <hi>Sciences,</hi> among
which there are some which do consist of many <hi>Tomes,</hi> there is hardly one
which hath not passed through his hands, he either correcting it himselfe,
or helping us to do it, or revising and fitting it for a new impression; or else

                        </gap>ding it of more Authority, with the addition of prologues and other

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64464:133"/>
he seemed to consume himselfe; which was to have many <hi>Fathers</hi> come
into <hi>China;</hi> and it was so vehement in him, that it made him fall into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
against our <hi>Superiours,</hi> saying, They did not understand, because
they could not see with their eyes the importance of that businesse; &amp; that
therefore they did not supply that want so much as was necessary. One
day falling into a great heat upon this subject, the <hi>Father</hi> with whom he
discoursed, mildely replied, Sir, we thank you for your zeale, and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the favour you shew us, in complaining on this manner; but
our <hi>Superiours</hi> have many places to succour and supply, and it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them to do it to the satisfaction of all. To which he replied very
gracefully, Your Reverence doth reprove me for daring to murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Superiours;</hi> but it is not so; but only I say, That I
should be very glad to have the opportunity to speak in person with our
<hi>Reverend Father Generall</hi> (in these very tearmes he spake it in the <hi>Chinesse</hi>
tongue, and when ever he mentioned the <hi>Superiours</hi> of the Company, he
alwaies called them <hi>Our Fathers and Superiours</hi>) because I would very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desire of him, that he would be pleased seasonably to supply our
Kingdome of <hi>China</hi> with store of <hi>Fathers,</hi> by reason the letters and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
are so difficult to be learnt: for ere long your <hi>Reverences</hi> will be so
old and worne out, that you will not be able to teach those, who are new
comers. Thus he spake, and this was his opinion concerning it. And a
good Testimony thereof will appeare in a letter which he wrote in answer
to one, which Father <hi>Mugnez Mascaregnas</hi> the <hi>Assistant</hi> of <hi>Portugall</hi> had
sent him: wherein he offered to send him whatsoever curiositie or raritie
he desired out of <hi>Europe:</hi> to which point his answer was, that he neither wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
nor desired any thing, but only that he would earnestly endeavour to
send more of the Societie into <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In proportio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to the love he had for the <hi>Fathers,</hi> his zeale and care for
their studies and health did encrease; as also that they should be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated,
and that they should know how to converse with those of
the Country, in such Termes, Ceremonies, and Compliments, as were
most esteemed among them: admonishing, and instructing us with great
confidence upon all occasions, when ever he saw us mistaken in the <hi>Stile</hi> of
that Country. He had so tender a kindenesse for us, that many times with
his owne hands he would open our gowns before to see whether we were
sufficiently provided with cloaths to defend us from the cold. When a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of us was sick, he caused the medicines, to be boyled and prepared
at his owne House, saying, That either through the ignorance, or unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of our servants they might lose their force, and so the sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
would receive no help by them. At the first sight, after a little discourse,
he could very well judge of the talents and parts of every one of us, and
had a great facilitie in gaining our affections. He had a great esteeme and
affection for us all in generall, but much more for those who were newly
come, and could not yet speak the language; of whom he had alwaies a
very great care, much compassionating the labour and paines they were to
take in the study of that language, and the letters belonging to it; and to
encourage them, would much rejoyce at every word, which he heard
them bring out, when they began to speak it. He gave them very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64464:134"/>
instructions concerning the manner and method they were to study it
by. He gave them the names of the books to which they were most to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themselves; and many times he sent them to them, written in his owne
hand, concerning the poynts and strokes, of which in <hi>China</hi> there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Science.</hi> It was an incredible consolation, and truely did cause no
lesse then our admiration, to heare the two <hi>Doctours, Leo</hi> and <hi>Michael</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
when they came both at once, (as they did often,) to our House;
for they scarce spoke of any thing else but of the way how to propagate
the Gospel, and how to protect, defend and authorize the preachers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
throughout the whole Kingdom; consulting with themselves to which
of their friends they should recommend them; what books they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
them to write; to which Province it were best to go first; and which
<hi>Father</hi> were fittest to be required of the <hi>Superiour</hi> for such a part. In the
end, all their consulations concluded in sighs, saying: We are old men, to
morrow we shall die; whom shall wee leave in our stead to carry on, that
which we have seen begun in our daies? Sometimes transported by their
affections, they did imagine themselves to be then at the Court, informing
the King himselfe by their <hi>Memoriall</hi> of the sanctity and purity of our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith;</hi> and having obtained leave and authority of him to set up pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Churches, they did already in their imagination make choice of the
ground and scituation, and design the form of the buildings; otherwhile
they fancied themselves to be accused for this cause, to be laid in prison,
and after that to be beheaded; and all with so much courage and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as did well shew the esteem they made of the honour of <hi>Martyrdom;</hi>
and the ardent desires they had to lose their lives for the interest of Gods
cause.</p>
                     <p>Neither did he stop at discourses and desires; for I can justly affirme,
That of all the Houses and Churches our Societie hath in <hi>China,</hi> there is
not one of them, which <hi>Dr. Leo</hi> hath not helped both to build and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve;
giving towards some of them, although he was not rich, a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
summe of money.</p>
                     <p>But that zealous love of <hi>Leo</hi> was most remarkable, in that occasion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling
the <hi>Fathers</hi> to the Court and City of <hi>Pekim,</hi> where they formerly
resided. He contrived all possible means to effect it, and made use of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities:
and by reason that <hi>China</hi> was then infested by the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
and the Court of <hi>Pekim</hi> in danger, he tooke advantage by that occasion to
remonstrate to the King, that besides our learning and skill, which might
be of great use to him, in this conjuncture of time, we had also great power
and interest with the inhabitants of <hi>Macao,</hi> from whom we could easily
obtaine a considerable succour of men and armes to his assistance; and the
better to perswade the King and his counsell to it, he used so much <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
and produced so many, and such apt and proper examples out of their
books and ancient Chronicles, wherein he was excellently well versed,
that I doubt not, but the Reader would receive much delight, if I should
give him a little tast of that excellent memoriall of his, did not that Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie,
which I have tied my self to in this relation, forbid it. In conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he did and said so much, that he obtained his desire; wherein he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no lesse satisfaction than we have, and ever shal have obligation to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64464:134"/>
him for it. Neverthelesse, he lost the great office he had, only upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
through the malice of his enemies; who accused him to the
King; though they had nothing to lay to his charge, but the neare friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
he had had with <hi>Father Matthaeus Riccius;</hi> and that he did beleeve and
professe a certain Law, which that Father taught, and which was different
from the Law of that Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>But it pleased the Lord to recompense him abundantly for what he
then lost; restoring him 4 or 5 years after to the same place with much
more honour and Fame throughout the whole Kingdom, by means of <hi>Dr.
Puul,</hi> who being also a <hi>Christian,</hi> and of so much courage &amp; understanding,
as to be able to assist and favour our affairs, brought it about upon occasion
of the reformation of the <hi>Kalender<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> He accepted of the employment, the
better to enable him, together with <hi>Doctour Paul,</hi> to promote the interest
of the Gospel; and so he began his journey toward the Court: but, beside
the infirmities of his old age, the length of the voyage, and the excessive
cold of the winter, did so weaken him, that, not many moneths after his
arrivall, he ended his life on the day of <hi>All-Saints,</hi> which was the very day,
whereon foure years before the first <hi>Masse</hi> was said in that House, which
he built on purpose to bestow upon the <hi>Society;</hi> where at this day is one of
the two Residencies, which we have in the City of <hi>Hamcheu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will not stand to rehearse the Piety, compuncton, and resentment, with
which he did severall times confesse himself during his sicknesse; nor the
consolation with which he received the holy <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
and <hi>extreame unction,</hi> and with what devotion he hearkned to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
and exhortations, which were made to him (at that time by
three of the Fathers, who were present) at his death, (a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
which certainly the Lord was pleased to bestow upon that love and
affection, with which he had alwayes helped and favoured us, from the
first time he knew us,) I forbear, I say, to mention them, by reason any one
may imagine them in so learned a man and perfect a <hi>Christian.</hi> I will only
take notice briefly of what he said at that time to <hi>Doctour Paul;</hi> whom he
tooke by the hand, just as he was about to depart, &amp; after he had given him
thanks for the favours he had received of him upon many occasions, and
particularly in that last, he said to him with teares in his eyes. <hi>Sir, I dye
much comforted to see with my eyes how well our</hi> Fathers <hi>arere-established, and
protected by your zeale. I will not recommend them to you, because I know the
place they hold in your heart. My sinnes have made me unworthy to have any
share in this work, to which you have done me the favour to call me for your
companion. But if after this work is ended you would be pleased to make use of my
name to any thing, which might result to the glory of God, and the propagation
of his most</hi> Holy Law, <hi>you would do me a high favour; and so, Sir, I leave up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Shoulders the Christianitie of</hi> China. With these words, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sufficiently the esteem he had of the Gospel, and of the preachers
thereof, <hi>Doctour Leo</hi> ended piously and holily that life; a good part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he had spent in the assistance of this new Church. He dyed on the
first of November 1630 although his memory will alwayes live, in the
breasts of the Labourers of our Society; and we hope, that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
will be preserved in other generous mindes of the <hi>Chinesse No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:64464:135"/>
To this state and condition is the Church of <hi>China</hi> arrived, after the
continuall labour and paines of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> during fifty eight years; and
truly so happy and prosperous a successe could never have been expected
from such difficult beginnings, and such weak meanes. Neverthelesse,
from the contexture of this Narration, it may well be perceived, what
paines, trouble, caution, patience and longanimity have alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
this enterprise, and also upheld it in the greatest persecutions. The
zeale and heate of those persons, who would convert the world perfectly
on a sudden, is much to be commended; and we do esteeme, and reverence
it in all; neverthelesse, in new <hi>Missions,</hi> and particularly in such, which are
not susceptible of this fire, which flameth out so suddenly, but do require
to be disposed to it by longer time, we do endeavour to retain them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the limits of prudence, more safe, and the bounds of patience, more
profitable, for that which is pretended to, by our Society, when ever we
meet with any of such a Spirit among us; and if that will not serve, we send
them to the pulpets and auditories of <hi>Europe,</hi> where that fire may shine
out without any danger of burning. And this is observed by us in order to
the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the new <hi>Christians,</hi> I doubt not at all, but that it is a holy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable
thing, presently to fashion and accommodate them to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
way of the universall Church, to her lawes, decrees, statutes, &amp;c. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
we must look how farre that is possible; and if possible, whether
it be convenient; and whether it would not be more for the destruction
then edification of such tender plants. Our Saviour Christ and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
have left us this doctrine so cleer, that there doth not seem any place
to be left for errour. St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, It is a property of false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to teach every thing to every one without difference of persons; the
which difference was alwayes observed by our Saviour in his holy doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,

it) <hi>Dijs Asiae, Europe &amp; Lybiae, dijs ignotis &amp; peregrinis:</hi> And without ever
reproving those words, or condemning the superstition, (although it was
bad enough) judging it more convenient at the first, he made use of this
<hi>darknesse</hi> to communicate light to them by it. The Apostles in the first
councell treated only of the facilitating of the conversion of the <hi>Gentiles,

of the <hi>Ius Positivum</hi> to which those new <hi>Christians</hi> were obliged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
(what is more) these were (all three) <hi>Iewish Ceremonies;</hi> which if they
should be observed at this day, would give much scandal. Nevertheless, to
facilitate the conversion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to avoyd giving <hi>Scandal</hi> to the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> they were, at that time, judged necessary. The same thing happened
about circumcision, the which S. <hi>Paul</hi> not only permitted, but even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
himselfe on the person of his disciple <hi>Timothy;</hi> condescending to
the weaknesse and ignorance of those first <hi>Christians.</hi>

saith thus:</p>
                     <p>But at the end of this Letter I do judge it not from our purpose to be mind your

That the severall institutions and different manners of living of Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ought not to be entruded upon young and tender Churches, such as are but yet
in a manner sucklings; but only to be introduced into such Churches, as are come
to their full strength, and are fortified by a long continuance of years. For many
times, emulation growing among them, and many wanting prudence, and others
abounding in an indiscreet zeale, they do many things, which tend rather to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
than edification <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord blesse your Eminencies <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From <hi>Goa</hi> the

frequent mention of the chiefe Provinces and Cities in
<hi>China;</hi> which have either been assaulted and defended,
subdued or destroyed, by the severall Armies, as well
from North to South, as from East to West; least the
pleasure and delight of this History, should be any way
diminished by the frequent re-encounter of harsh and
barbarous names of Countries, and Towns unknown to
the <hi>European</hi> Reader; I thought it good to prefix a
little Geographical table of the Countries, and chiefe Cities, which might serve
as a guide to conduct the eye of the understanding, in the pursuit of the mentioned
victories. I confesse it is not so exact as the rigour of Geography exacts, but yet
it is such an one, as was drawn by the hands of their learned Phylosophers, and
may well give a sufficient notion of all the places mentioned.</p>
                  <p>As for more exquisit, and rare Maps both universal and particular, as well of
the Countries, as of the Cities, and of all the rarities they contain, together with
the exact knowledge of their Longitudes and Latitudes, and of all that does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
either to Astronomy or Geography in relation to them; with what may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from Natural or Humane History, I reserve all these to my <hi>Atlas of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>

time of <hi>Noah;</hi> all which I have with much pains and industry gathered up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and transported with me to <hi>Europe.</hi> I will not therefore for the present
deflower that work of its greatest beauty, by an unseasonable exposition of it to the
Readers view; but expect till it grow to that perfection, as I hope will satisfie the
appetite of this our curious Age.</p>

(of which <hi>Paulus Venetus,</hi>) and <hi>Ayton</hi> make mention under the names of
<hi>Cataye</hi> and <hi>Maningin</hi>) and this before the times of great <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> who
never subdued <hi>China,</hi> as some have falsly writ; for he flourished about the
year MCCCCVI; in which time <hi>Taichangus,</hi> Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> and
the second of the <hi>Taimingian</hi> Family (the <hi>Tartars</hi> being before beaten out
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64464:140"/>
of his Kingdom) governed peaceably all the Provinces included within
the compass of that Vast Wall which before I mentioned.</p>
                  <p>But the War which <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> toucheth, betwixt the <hi>Chinesses</hi> and
<hi>Tartars</hi> began in the year MCCVI. as their History and Chronology te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify,
which lasting 77. years, at last the <hi>Tartars</hi> in the year MCCLXXVIII.
having totally conquered all that potent Empire, extinguished the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

<hi>Iuena;</hi> of which <hi>Tartarian</hi> Race nine Emperors by descent, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned

                     </note> came <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> into

                  <p>In this tract of time, the <hi>Tartars</hi> forgetting their ancient Vigour of
Mind and warlike Spirits, which the pleasures and delices of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
had quailed and tamed, and being also weakned by so long a Peace,
became of a softer temper, and received a deep Tincture of the Nature
and Disposition of the Natives of <hi>China.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon a contemptible person (who was servant to one of those
deputed to offer Sacrifice to their Idols) called <hi>Chu,</hi> presumed to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them.</p>
                  <p>This man commiserating the condition of his enslaved Country, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotouched
with the ambition of Reigning, first acted the part of a Thief,
or High-way man; and being of a Generous Nature, bold, and as quick
of hand, as in wit; wanted neither Courage, nor Art, nor Companions, nor
Fortune, to gather such a multitude as in short time made up the vast body
of an Army; whereupon deposing the person of a Thief, he became a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
and with a bold attempt presumed to set upon the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fought many battailes with them, obtained many singular Victories;
so as in the year 1368<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he finally drove them out of the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi>
receiving for so memorable an action, the whole Empire of <hi>China</hi> as a
worthy reward of his Heroical Actions.</p>
                  <p>It was he first erected the Imperial Family of the <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he was the first Emperour of that Race, stiled himself by the name of
<hi>Hunguus;</hi> which signifies as much as, <hi>The famous Warriour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After such an illustrious Action, it was no wonder if all the Provinces
submitted to him, both as to one that was a Native of their Country; and
also because they looked on him as a man who had redeemed them from
Thraldome: for it is the Nature of the people of <hi>China</hi> to love and esteem
their own, as much as they hate and vilifie Strangers.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore he first placed his Court at <hi>Nanking</hi> neer to the bank of that
great River of <hi>Kiang,</hi> which the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> in respect of the huge Mountains
of water which it discharges into the Ocean, call the <hi>Son of the Sea:</hi> And
having speedily ordered, and established that Empire, fearing no Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
from these new redeemed Creatures, he was not contented to
have chased the <hi>Tartars</hi> out of <hi>China,</hi> but he made an irruption into <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
it selfe, and so followed the point of his Victory, as that he routed them
several times, wasted all their Territories, and finally brought the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<hi>Tartars</hi> to such streights, as he forced them to lay down their Arms, to
pay Tribute, and even begge an Ignominious Peace. This Storm of War
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64464:140"/>
fell chiefly on the <hi>Tartars</hi> of the Province of <hi>Niuche,</hi> whither the <hi>Tartars</hi>

which they call <hi>Hordes;</hi> and these fighting one against another, at

called the Kingdome of <hi>Niuche.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus stood <hi>China</hi> in relation to the Eastern <hi>Tartars;</hi> but to the Western

                  <p>For the <hi>Chineses</hi> esteem it very unhandsome to make war against any, if

                  <p>Therefore this Kingdome of <hi>China</hi> being thus established in the <hi>Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingian</hi>

                  <p>But in this time the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Niuche</hi> had so multiplied and spread

have so much Power and Authority, that although they live as Slaves to

                  <p>First therefore the Prefects or Governours,<note place="margin">The first cause of the <hi>Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> war.</note> did abuse the Merchant

                     </note> the Kings Son gathered a strong
Army, and taking his time, found meanes to get over the great Wall I

                  <p>From this City he writ a Letter in <hi>Tartarian</hi> Characters to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

nothing Barbarous. By this Letter, which he sent by one of their <hi>Indian</hi>

he declared to him, that he had invaded his Country to revenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries

But yet that he was ready to restore the City he had taken, and
depose his Armes, if his complaints might be heard, and satisfaction gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him. The Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> called <hi>Vanley,</hi> having received this
Letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though otherwise of an eminent wisdome, and of as great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
yet being now broken with Age, in this businesse seems to have
proceeded with lesse Prudence than that which accompanied the former
Actions of his life; For, thinking it not to be a business of that moment as
that it deserved to be treated before him in his own Court, he remitted it
to the chief Governours and Commanders. And these men puffed up
with their usuall pride, thought it not fit so much as to give an answer to
the <hi>Barbarian</hi> King, but resented it very highly that he durst be so bold as
to complain to the Emperor of any injury received.</p>

For it is the custome of the <hi>Tartars</hi> when any man of quality dyeth, to
cast into that fire which consumes the dead Corps, as many Servants,
Women, and Horses, with bows and Arrows, as may be fit to atend and
serve them in the next life: Though now since they conquered <hi>China,</hi>

City of the Province of <hi>Leaoyang</hi>) with 50000. men. But the City was
defended by exceeding many men, who generally were all armed with
Musquets: The <hi>Tartars</hi> had nothing but their Scymetars, with Bows and
Arrows, which they discharge with strange Dexterity and Art. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they chiefly feared the musquet bullets,<note place="margin">A Stratagem against mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.</note> they resolved by a Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
to make that unknown Instrument lesse hurtfull to them than their
enemies did imagin. For the <hi>Tartarian</hi> King commanded such as made
the first on-set, to carry a thick hard board for their Shield, which was as
good to them as a wooden Wall; these men were seconded by other
Companies who carried Ladders to climb up the Walls; and the Horse
came up in the Rear. In this manner he set upon the City in foure quarters,
and received the discharge of their Musquets against his wooden wall;
Then in a moment the scaling-ladders being applied, before they could
charge again, they were upon the Walls and entred the City; for such is
the quicknesse and nimblenesse of the <hi>Tartars</hi> (in which they excell all
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64464:141"/>
Nations, and in which also they place their chief art) that in a trice, they
either prevail in their designs, or retire: and the little skill the <hi>Chinesses</hi>
had in the use of Musquets, was no small hinderance to the warre. For
the <hi>Tartars</hi> quicknesse and nimblenesse not giving them time to charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
being astonished with the sudden inundation of armed men, they
presently fled which way soever they could; but being pursued by the
swift <hi>Tartarian</hi> Horse, most of them perished in the taking of this great
City,<note place="margin">Many other Cities taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> This City being taken, the <hi>Tartar</hi> like a Torrent over-run many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of lesse note; but amongst others, he took that Noble City <hi>Evamg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
and overrunning most speedily the whole Country of <hi>Leaotung,</hi> he
entred the Province of <hi>Pekin;</hi> and comming within seven Leagues of the
very Imperiall City, He durst not advance, fearing the Enemy might
compasse or surround him, because he heard that a world of men came in
to help their distressed Prince. But the <hi>Tartar</hi> struck such a terrour into
the hearts of all the Countries he had passed, as both Souldier and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
quitting their Houses left the empty walls to the <hi>Tartarians</hi> possession;

leaving the Citizens alive, and treating them courteously. By
which meanes having collected a world of riches, he returned to <hi>Leaotung</hi>
victorious. And because his South-sayers had perswaded him that the
standing of the old Walls were unfortunate, he beat them down, and
compassed it about with new, fortifying them with new Munitions, and
there proclamed himself Emperour of <hi>China:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Tartar</hi> calls himself Emperour of <hi>China, An. 1618.</hi>
                     </note> For although as yet he had
taken nothing of <hi>China,</hi> but only the skirts of the Eastern Country of the

the whole Kingdom: wherefore he was called in the <hi>China</hi> language
<hi>Theienmingus,</hi> in the third year of his Reign, which was in that of one
thousand six hundred and eighteen.</p>
                  <p>In this year, some in authority about the Emperour <hi>Vanley,</hi> demanded
the banishment of the Priests, who did then preach the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that Nation; But the Emperour (who in his heart loved Christanity,
and those particularly that first planted that Religion amongst them) gave
no eare for a long while to their demands; But at length overcome by the
importunity of a chief Commander, who had ever been a sore Enemy to
Christian Religion, and was called <hi>Xinchio,</hi> it was ordained and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that all those <hi>Fathers</hi> that did propagate Christan Religion should
be banished the Kingdome. Upon which some of them were secretly
concealed in severall Provinces by some Christian Governours, others
being taken were carried in great Cages to <hi>Macao,</hi>

was the Emperour <hi>Vanley's</hi> Prohibition to all his to professe Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion. But, upon this occasion, the Christians of <hi>China</hi> (who from
the horrid wildernesse of Infidelity, had been brought to the pleasant
Pastures of Christianity) gave illustrious examples of their Faith and
Constancy; but the longer Narration of this glorious persecution is reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64464:142"/>
for another place. I only touch it here, to admire the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, who raised so sharp War against <hi>China,</hi> when they neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christian Peace; and permitted, at the same time, these <hi>Tartars</hi> to take
so deep a root in this Empire of <hi>China,</hi> as afterward grew to that height,
as to extirpate the Royal Family of the <hi>Taminges,</hi> together with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
at the very same time they went about utterly to destroy all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
But, (as ordinarily it doth) by this very persecution, Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
grew to that height and greatnesse, that the Church glories to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it; whilst, (unlesse God vouchsafe to lend a potent helping hand,) the
vast Kingdom of <hi>China</hi> is utterly overthrown.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Chineses</hi> were very solicitous to expell this Enemy
from the bowells of their Country; and first, they selected very chief and
eminent men for Commanders and Governours; then they gathered an
Army of six hundred thousand choise Souldiers. The King of <hi>Corea</hi> also
sent to the Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> twelve thousand; with this potent Army
therefore they went out in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> MDCXIX. to give Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
to the Enemy. The <hi>Tartars</hi> resolved to meet them with an undaunted
courage; and for a good while the event and victory was very doubtfull;
but in the end the Army of <hi>China</hi> was wholly routed, &amp; their chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
with fifty thousand men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were all slain: The <hi>Tartars</hi> according
to their custome, prosecute the victory with all quicknesse and diligence;
for the same day they took and sacked two Cities which they burned. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, they over-run that whole Country, and came to the very Walls of
<hi>Pekin,</hi> the Emperours Court; but durst not venture to besiege it, because
they knew (besides the infinite number of Canons it contained) there was
lodged fourscore thousand Souldiers in it.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Chineses</hi> confess that there was such a fear and consternation in
the City, that the King thought to have left that City and gone into the
Southern parts of the Kingdom: which he had effectually performed, had
not some Commanders suggested; that his flight would give courage to
the Victorious, and breed trouble and confusion in the whole Empire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that to fly is nothing else but to yeeld up the land to the Enemy. Nay
more, they say, the disorders were such in the City, that if the <hi>Tartar</hi> had
come on, he infallibly had made himself Master of it. But the Enemy was
more greedy of Prey; and therefore they dispersed themselves abroad,
spoiling and burning all Towns and Cities, and killing and destroying an
immense company of <hi>Chineses</hi> in a most cruell manner;<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> return with great Riches.</note> and so leaving all
these places dismantled and without Garisons, laden with infinite Riches,
they returned victorious to <hi>Leaotung,</hi> where they had their first footing.</p>

                  <p>Besides, that he might more effectually divert the imminent danger of

kill none, if they would cut their hair, and use the <hi>Tartarians</hi> Habit. For the

which they extend to a great length, and in the hinder part of
their heads they leave a Tuff, which being curiously woven and plated,
they let hang down carelesly below their shoulders; they have a round and
low Cap, which is alwaies garnished round with some pretious skin three
fingers broad, of <hi>Cast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Foreheads from colds &amp; other Tempests. That which appears above
the skin being covered over either with curious red silke, or else with black
and purple horse-hair, which they die and dresse most curiously; so as their
appurtenances being decently joyned together, makes the cap both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
and handsom. Their Garments are long Robes falling down to
the very foot, but their sleeves are not so wide and large as the <hi>Chineses</hi> use,
but rather such as are used in <hi>Polony,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hungary,</hi> only with this difference,
that they fashion the extremity of the Sleeve, ever like a Horse his Hoof.
At their Girdle there hangs on either side two Handkerchiefes to wipe
their face and hands; besides, there hangs a Knife for all necessary uses,
with two Purses, in which they carry <hi>Tobacco,</hi> or such like Commodities.
On their left side they hang their Scymiters, but so as the point goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and the handle behind, and therefore when they fight they draw it
out with the right hand behind them without holding the Scabbard with
the other. They seldome weare Shoes; and use no spurrs to their Boots,
which they make either of Silk, or of Horse-skin very neatly drest; but they
often use fair Pattins, which they make three Fingers high. In riding they
use Stirrups, their Trappings are both lower and broader than ours, their
faces are comely, and commonly broad as those of <hi>China</hi> also have, their
colour is white, but their Nose is not so flat, nor their eyes so little, as the

                     <hi>Chineses</hi> are; They speak little, and ride pensively. In the rest of their
manners they resemble our <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> though they be nothing so
barbarous. They rejoyce to see Strangers: They no way like the grimness
and soureness of the <hi>Chinesse</hi> gravity, and therefore in their first abords they
appear more humane.</p>
                  <p>Having thus briefly described their manners, we resume our former
discourse, and return to the victorious <hi>Tartars</hi> in the City they had taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In
which, finding many rich and wealthy Merchants of other Provinces,
they published a Licence that they might depart with their Goods; and
withall commanded them speedily to void the City;<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> perfidiousness.</note> who presently obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the order, carried away all their goods and riches, little suspecting the
perfideous treachery of the <hi>Tartars;</hi> For they had not gone three miles
from the Town, but being set upon by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> they were plundred of
their goods, and lost all their lives; which being done, they returned into
the fearfull City, laden with Riches, the Citizens trembling, lest they
might happely experience the like perfidiousnesse.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Tartar</hi> considering at how dear a rate he had bought the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering
of that City, and fearing also to find the like provision and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
in other Cities, they durst not make any further attempt; for they
knew well that the Emperour had not only fortified all the ancient places,
but erected also new munitions, in the straights of many hard and rude
passages.</p>
                  <p>And amongst all other strong Holds, that of <hi>Xanghai,</hi> scituated in the
Island of <hi>Cu,</hi> was most eminent; containing a vast number of men in the
Garrison, to resist the further progresse of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Forces. But that
which most of all repressed the <hi>Tartars,</hi> was the great valour of the
incomparable Commander <hi>Maovenlungus;</hi> who having with
his great Fleet taken an Island neer <hi>Corea</hi> in the mouth of the River
<hi>Yalo,</hi> vexed much their Army in the Rear,<note place="margin">The valiantest Commander of <hi>China.</hi>
                     </note> and was victorious in severall
Skirmishes against them; so that the <hi>Tartars</hi> bent all their care and
thoughts against this their Enemy. This renowned person was born in
the Province of <hi>Evangtung,</hi> where being neer the <hi>Portugese</hi> of <hi>Macao,</hi> he
had much perfected himself in the Art of war, and he brought with him
many great pieces of Artillerie, which he had recovered from the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
of a <hi>Holland</hi> Ship, upon the coasts of that Territorie. And because
the Emperour of <hi>China</hi> had declared the City of <hi>Ninguyven</hi> to be the
chief (in place of <hi>Leaoyang</hi>) (where also he had placed a new <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> and
his Royall Visitor) therefore <hi>Maovenlungus</hi> placed the best part of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillarie
upon the Walls of this City.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> therefore acted nothing till the year 1625. and because
they resolved to besiege the new Metropolitan City of <hi>ninguyvne,</hi> they
first purposed to trie <hi>Maovenlungus</hi> his fidelity;<note place="margin">The faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Commanders in <hi>China.</hi>
                     </note> offering him halfe of the

his, proved as faithfull, as valiant, by rejecting those demands with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and came presently with his Forces to succour the City <hi>Ninguyven</hi>
which they besieged; by which means,<note place="margin">The overthrow of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>

into <hi>Tartary,</hi> not with a resolution to sit still, but an intention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

the year 1627. in which the Emperour <hi>Thienkius</hi> dyed in the flow'r of
his age,<note place="margin">The Kings of <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> both died.</note> and with him the whole Empire of <hi>China</hi> seemed to fall to ruin
and destruction; and, in the same year, the King of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who had
cruelly murdered many men, himselfe augmented the number of the
dead.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Thienkius,</hi> in the Empire of <hi>China,</hi> succeeded that unhappy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

And after <hi>Thienmingus</hi> King of <hi>Tartary,</hi> succeeded <hi>Thienzungus</hi> his Son,

but though he lived not long, yet he served for a good example for his
Son to conquer <hi>China</hi> more by Civility and Humanitie, than by force of

all the passages; who falling upon the <hi>Chineses</hi> Armie (which suspecting
nothing, was divided, and many stragling up and down the Country)
made a huge Carnage amongst them. But when <hi>Maovenlungus</hi> perceived
they were <hi>Tartars,</hi> he presently made head, rallied his forces, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
opposed all those sharp assaults. But yet at length he was forced to
yeeld the Field; and therefore leaving a Regiment or two, to hold the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
in action whilst his Army retreated, he fled to his ships, and to the
Island which he had fortified. The <hi>Tartars</hi> were vexed and grieved, both
to see their victory so bloody, and also that <hi>Maovenlungus,</hi> whom they
chiefly aimed at, had escaped with most of his Army; and therefore enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with anger, they fell upon the <hi>Corean</hi> Traitors, as false to them, and
killed every man; (which action the King of <hi>Tartary</hi> himself afterward
much condemned;) and then turning their wrath to the four Northern
Provinces,<note place="margin">Corea <hi>wasted.</hi>
                     </note> which border upon <hi>Tartary,</hi> they wasted and destroyed them
all in a moment.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the King of <hi>Corea</hi> gathered an Army to resist the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars;</hi>
and <hi>Maovenlungus</hi> also, having recruited his Forces, came into <hi>Corea,</hi>

seven Leagues of the principallest City of all <hi>Corea.</hi> And, finding the
King to have taken the Straights and Passages of the Mountains which
lead, unto it, they desperately resolved to force their passage. The Battel
was hardly begun, when <hi>Maovenlungus,</hi> after a long march, falls in upon
their Rear: the <hi>Tartars</hi> finding themselves encompassed before &amp; behind,
nor any means to escape but by dint of Sword, fought most desperately,
sustaining the shock of two Armies; such was the fury of this battell, as

lost seveny thousand; and few or none escaped of the <hi>Chineses;</hi>
for their Quarter being most commodious for the <hi>Tartars</hi> flight, they
there made their most vigorous Charges, and so forced their way towards
their own Country. So as none of them all gained the field, or could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
the course of a Victory. Yet the King of <hi>Corea</hi> made a shift to rallie
so many together again, as to take possession of those his Countries which
the <hi>Tartarians</hi> by their flight had left desolate. But the <hi>Tartars</hi> after all
their losses, ceased not to make frequent in-rodes into the Country of <hi>Leao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tung,</hi>
and took all the Orientall part of it.<note place="margin">The Eastern part of <hi>Leao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tung</hi> is under the <hi>Tartar.</hi>
                     </note> From thence they made incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
into the other part, and carried away great Preys and Booties; But
they were alwayes so beaten, and so defeated, as they could never fix a

Gunners from the <hi>Portughese</hi> quarters, which both by themselves,<note place="margin">The <hi>Portugese</hi> send succour.</note> and by

                  <p>In this conjuncture of affairs, the Emperour <hi>Zungchinius</hi> sent a new
Commander called <hi>Yvenus</hi> into <hi>Leaotung,</hi> with a new Armie and full

wit, most eloquent both in speaking and writing; who by politick discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

upon the Emperours mind, but also upon all the Councell, that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
what he concluded as a Law to be observed: Wherefore the

their hopes, had not this wicked man been more wedded to his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and love of Riches, than to the publick good, and fidelitie to his
Prince: For first he received of the <hi>Tartars</hi> a vast Summe of gold; which

Emperour had perused the Treatie, he presently found his Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
had sold him, and therefore refused to ratifie or confirm the Articles.

What should <hi>Yvenus</hi> act in this exigent? That he might force the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to admit them, he perswaded the <hi>Tartars,</hi> in the year 1630. to enter
<hi>China</hi> by another Country than that which was committed to his charge,
promising them for his part, he would no way with his Army hinder
their progresse. The <hi>Tartars</hi> knew that his avarice had so potent an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
over him, as that they need to fear no hurt from him; and upon
that confidence admitted of his Counsell. Wherefore being secure from
all assaults from any Enemie behind them, they entred the Province of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi>
&amp; at length besieged the Kings Court:<note place="margin">The Kings Court besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> Insomuch that his Councel
perswaded him to leave the Imperial City, and retire to the Southern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
but he protested he would rather die, than quit the Northern
quarters; and not only so, but he forbade any to depart the Court, or
Town besieged. In the mean time, the <hi>Tartars</hi> make many fierce as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults,
and as often were valiantly beaten back with great losse and
Carnage. <hi>Yvenus</hi> was called to resist the <hi>Tartars,</hi> for as yet his Traiterous
Complo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he comes with his Armie neer the very Walls of the Court, which
was of a vast extent, and as it were a great partition between the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
from which both the <hi>Chinese</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> forces were perfectly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
But though <hi>Yvenus</hi> was under the Emperours eye, yet he acted
little; for his only aim being to returne home laden with Riches, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
desisted to perswade the Emperour to admit his conditions of Peace.
So that the Emperour finding him evidently to be a Traitor, disclosing
his intention to none of his Councel nor Governours, sends to invite him
to a private Councel of war, giving also order that he should be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the City over the Walls, lest if any Gate should be open, the

businesse in this manner, lest he should bring his Armie into the City

none of them gave him the least sign of any distaste that the Emperour
might conceive against him,<note place="margin">The perfidious General killed</note> boldly and securely presented himself at

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64464:145"/>
all the Examples of his Predecessors: For having observed, that their
too hard and cruel usage of the <hi>Chinesses,</hi> had been the principal obstacle
of their advancement,<note place="margin">Mildenesse and Gentleness to be used in Conquering Nations.</note> to the end he might conquer that Empire he so
much thirsted after, as well by Love as by Arms, he courteously entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and cherished all those of <hi>China</hi> which came unto him, using all Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with great sweetnes, and inviting them either to submit freely to his
Government, or take their course with full freedom. The fame of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
was spred far and neer; which induced many Commanders and
chief Officers to fly unto him; by whose means and help, at length he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Emperour of that spacious and flourishing Country. For experience
shews us, that Love and Humanity do work more upon mens hearts, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
and conserving Kingdomes, than Arms; and crueltie of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
hath lost that, which strength of Arms had happily subdued.
Wherefore when the <hi>Chinesses</hi> came to understand, that the King of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
did not only afford them a refuge, but friendship, many great
persons flying the Indignation of the King of <hi>China,</hi> sheltered themselves
under the <hi>Tartars</hi> protection. For, by reason of the <hi>China's</hi> great Avarice
and Perfidiousness,<note place="margin">A barbarous Principle of the <hi>Chineses.</hi>
                     </note> it's a necessary, (though most inhumane) Maxim, that
those Officers perish, who have managed the Kingdomes Affairs with
lesse successe. For they easily are brought to beleeve, that such unhappy
events, do not proceed so much from the frown of inconstant Fortune, as it
doth from the perfidie or negligence of the Commanders. So as if any
fought unhappily, or if he lost the Country committed to his charge, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sedition or Rebellion happened, the Governors hardly ever escaped
alive. Seeing therefore they found so much Humanitie in the <hi>Tartar,</hi> and
so much Inhumanity in the Emperor, they rather chose to fly to the
former.</p>

his head to a Block by an unjust sentence, than to abandon his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or once commit the least fault against his Soveraign, though guilty of
much injustice towards Him:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ignatius</hi> his fidelity.</note> He might perchance have swayed the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Scepter of <hi>China,</hi> if he would have hearkened to his Souldiers, but
he rather chose to die gloriously, than to be branded with the name of a
Traitor.</p>
                  <p>After this man therefore had gained several Victories against the
<hi>Tartars,</hi> and recovered many Cities from their possession, so as he hoped
shortly wholly to extirpate them out of <hi>China,</hi> His Souldiers being long
without pay, seditiously plundred and pillaged a Town which had ever
been faithfull to the King. <hi>Ignatius</hi> by several petitions and Remonstrances
to the Emperour, had declared his wants of mony, and their want of Pay;
but because he fed not those venal souls that mannaged the businesse for
mony and presents,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Piety.</note> they alwaies suppressed his humble addresses for relief.
Besides, this man being a very pious Christian, he did nothing in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but what was conform to Reason and Justice; which was the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64464:146"/>
cause he incurred the hatred of all the ancient Prefect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; who usually recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Bribes from the contesting parties, demanded favour of <hi>Ignatius</hi> for
their Clients. But it was in vain to intercede for any, unlesse the justnesse of
the cause did also ballance their Petitions. And these men attributing this
proceeding, not to vertue, but to his Pride, thinking themselves underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
by him, dealt under-hand with the Prefects in the Court, to stop the
Armies pay, that so they might destroy this innocent man. Moreover, he
was envied by the Commanders in the very Court, because he came to
this eminent dignitie by his own valour and industry; which they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
was only to be given to Doctors, and <hi>Ignatius</hi> was but a Licenciat; as if
the most learned must needs be also the most valorous. In this conjuncture
of affairs, the Souldiers not contented with the seditious pillage, seeing the
most imminent danger hanging over their most esteemed and beloved Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
by reason of their folly, go about to perswade him to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
King of that Province; nay more, to take the whole Empire to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as a thing due to his Prowess and Merits; promising their whole
strength to effect the businesse; and also to extirpate those men about the
Emperour, that aimed more to compasse their malicious ends, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the general affaires of the Empire: But <hi>Ignatius,</hi> by pious admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
staved them off from further violence, made them obedient and quiet,
commanded all to stand faithfull to the Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> and punished
the chief of that sedition.</p>
                  <p>This supreme act of fidelity deserved a better esteem and acceptance,
than th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t which was returned by the Emperour and his Court: who sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this his allegeance, sent another Vice-Roy in his place, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to appear in Court: He then perceived they aimed at his life;
and the Souldiers suspected the businesse; and therefore, mad with anger,
they all jointly rose in Arms for him, swearing they would live and
die with him, and that he should not present himselfe at Court. <hi>It is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
(say they) <hi>to conserve thy life, which hast been so carefull of ours; and we
have strength and courage enough to resist all the force of thy perfidious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Ignatius</hi> was deaf to all these allurements,<note place="margin">He chuses rather to die, than either to reign, or to serve the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                     </note> and studied by all means
to sweeten their exulcerated minds; alwaies inculcating to them to die
true and loyall to their Soveraigns service: chusing rather to water that
ungratefull Soil of his native Country with the streams of his Blood, than
either to spill his Enemies blood by the force and pow'r of his Souldiers,
or to retire to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> King, which offered him so fair preferments.
But many of his Captains fell off to the <hi>Tartars;</hi> following, in this, not
his example, but that of many others, whom they saw eminently promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
amongst the <hi>Tartars.</hi> Some of those that then fled from the Emperour,
are now chief Commanders under the <hi>Tartarian</hi> King, in their <hi>China</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
some also have obtained the dignity of Princes, or Royolets in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Countries, for the reward of their Valour and faithfull Service against
<hi>China. So much more piercing is that wedge, which is made of the same wood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But although hitherto these <hi>Tartarian</hi> Wars had caused great troubles &amp;
tempests in the <hi>China</hi> Empire, yet all things now seemed so calmed and
pacified, as they seemed secure from any further danger; for the Western
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64464:146"/>
part of <hi>Leaotung</hi> was strongly fortified, and there was a great Army in the
Island of <hi>Cu,</hi> and the bordering quarters, which hindered the <hi>Tartars</hi> in the
Eastern part of the Country,<note place="margin">The Theeves in <hi>China,</hi> a chief occasion of its overthrow.</note> which they possessed, from further passage.
But now the chiefest danger was from the Traitors and Theeves which
were in the very Bowells of the Country; who finally destroyed it, and
gave it up in Prey to the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I touched somthing of their Commotions before, now we must treat a
little more largely of their proceedings, that the Reader may see how the
<hi>Tartars</hi> came to subdue and conquer <hi>China.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first Combination of these Rovers appeared in the remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Suchuen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Severall Theeves.</note> who having pillaged divers Cities, and emboldened by
prosperous successe, ventured to besiege the chief City of that Country

whom I mentioned before,<note place="margin">They are defeated, but not vanquished</note> had not come to relieve it with her Army; but
by her valour they were beaten off with great losse; and, not being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extinguished, they retired into the mountains to recruit their Forces.
These were seconded by a like race of people in the Province of <hi>Queicheu,</hi>
who took occasion of rising by reason of an unjust Sentence passed in a sure
betwixt two Grandees of that Country; he who lost the cause being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the Governors. These roving companions, first kill'd all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
which had pronounced that unjust sentence; and then they defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Vice-Roy his Army;<note place="margin">Famin augments the Theeves.</note> yet afterwards he routed them with a new
Army, but could not extinguish them. Besides these, the Famin increasing
in the Northern quarters in the Countries of <hi>Xensi</hi> and <hi>Xantung,</hi> by reason
of a great inundation of Locusts which devoured all, there riss up by this
occasion, many loose fellowes which lived by Rapin. These men at first
were few in number, and small in strength, and after only preying in little
places, presently fled to the Mountains; but finding they got both Meat
and Riches, with little labour and lesse cost, they quickly got Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to re-inforce them; This Sedition being also much augmented by the
Emperour <hi>Zungchinius</hi> his notable avarice,<note place="margin">And the Emperour his avarice.</note> who so exhausted the people
by Imposts and Taxes, as if it had been a year of the golden Age. The
Prefects of the Provinces, not being able presently to represse the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of those people, they daily increafed in courage and strength; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as in several Countries they had eight very considerable Armies.
They chose the strongest &amp; valiantest men amongst them for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders;
and these persons being grown rich and potent by preying, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
now the person of Ring-leaders of Theeves, and aspired to no lesse
than to the Empire of <hi>China.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders aspire to the Empire.</note> And at first they fought one against another,
every one pillaging another of what he could: But at length things were
brought to that passe, that two of the Commanders being only left alive,
these two prevailed with the Souldiers of those that were killed, to follow
their Ensignes and Fortune; and they knowing well that if they were taken
by the Emperors Officers, they could not escape a most certain death, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
resolved to shelter themselves under the Arms of these two victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
persons.<note place="margin">The names of the chief felons</note> The name of one of these chief Brigands was <hi>Lacungzus;</hi> the
second was called <hi>Changhienchungus;</hi> two notorious bold roguish fellows;
who lest they should destroy one anothers fortunes by their ambitious
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64464:147"/>
emulation, separated themselves far from one another, resolving both to
pursue their prosperous fortunes. <hi>Licungzus</hi> therefore possessed himselfe
of the Northern parts of <hi>Xensi</hi> and <hi>Honan;</hi> and the other tyrannized over
the Countries of <hi>Suchuen</hi> and <hi>Huquang.</hi> But that we may not interrupt our
discourse, by delivering the Acts of both these together, we will first treat
of <hi>Licungzus</hi> his feats, being he was the cause of the <hi>Tartars</hi> coming to the
Empire, (which he himself might have possessed, if his proceedings had
been moderate and humane;) and of the other we shall speak hereafter.
Therefore in the year 1641. these pilferers having got immense riches in
the Province <hi>Xensi,</hi> made an irruption, in a vast body, into that delicious
sweet Province of <hi>Honan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">They vex seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Provinces.</note> and went strait to the chief City called <hi>Caifung,</hi>
which they besieged. There was in that place a very great and strong Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
who by the benefit of Artillery mounted upon hand-wheeling Cars,
forced them to quit the siege; then they fell upon all the neighbouring
Cities, plundring, spoiling, and burning all they could master. Having
hoorded up store of provision of Corn, and augmented their Army by a
company of rascally Vagabonds and loytering Fellows, they returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to besiege the Metropolitan City;<note place="margin">They besiege the noble City <hi>Caifung.</hi>
                     </note> but dispairing to take it by Force
or Assaults, they resolved to ruin it by a long siege, that they might enjoy
the immense Riches of that noble City; and though this Town be three
great Leagues in circumference, yet they rounded it so by their lines, as
nothing could enter the City; this drave them to some straits; for although
the Purveyer for victualls had brought in good store of provision in the
two moneths space in which they were absent, yet because that Province
which used to be most plentifull, was now deficient in Corn, they could
not make sufficient provision for six moneths siege, for such an infinite
multitude of people as were retired within the Walls; Yet it held out most
resolutely for the space of six moneths, in which time though they were
brought to hard shifts, yet hoping alwaies for succour from their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
they would never submit to any conditions. I dare not relate to what
an excesse this Famin came to; but it seems it surpassed the Famin of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi>
a pound of Rice was worth a pound of Silver;<note place="margin">An unheard of Famin.</note> and a pound of any
old rotten skin was sold at ten Crowns; dead mens flesh was sold publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Shambles as Hogs flesh, and it was held an act of Piety to expose
the dead in the streets for others to feed on, who shortly were to be food
for others; but I will passe over, and conceal yet more horrible things
than I have related. This City lies towards the South side of that vast and
precipitate River which the <hi>Chineses</hi> call <hi>Hoang,</hi> because the streams al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
appear of a yellowish saffron colour; and because the River is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the plain levell downs, of a Leagues distance from the Town, they
built upon the River side, a long and strong Bulwark of great square stones,
to prevent all inundations. The Emperours Army, after long expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
came to relieve the Town, and advanced as far as these Bulwarks, and
having considered the situation of the Country and Enemies Camp, it was
thought the fittest &amp; easiest way to raise the siege without giving battail,
and to let in the water upon the enemies Army, by some breaches made in
that long Wall or Bulwark. It was in <hi>Autumn</hi> when they took this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and the River, by reason of extraordinary rains, was swoln bigger
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64464:147"/>
than ever before; and they, making the Sluces, or inlets, too great, and the
Breaches too wide, gave way to such an Ocean of water, as it overran the
walls of the Town (which were very stately and high) involving not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
many of the enemies in its ruin and destruction;<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Caifung</hi> is drowned.</note> but also 300000. men,
and the City it self perished in those floods of water. So the ancient City,
which heretofore had been honoured by the Emperor's Residence, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
no more a place of pleasure, but a vast Pool or Lake for Monsters of the
waters to inhabit; for the houses of the Town were not over-run with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but also beaten down; and also the Church of the Christians, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their Priest, who was one of the Society of Jesus; who when he
could timely enough have saved himselfe, chose rather to laydown his life
for the sheepe: For that City had many Christians. The destruction of this
City happened the ninth of <hi>Oct. 1642.</hi> about which time this famous
Conductour of Theeves took the name of King,<note place="margin">The General of the Theeves takes the Title of a King.</note> with an addition of <hi>Xun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang,</hi>
which sounds as much as <hi>Prosperous,</hi> and so was stiled <hi>Licungzus the
prosperous;</hi> and having in a manner taken all the Country of <hi>Honan</hi> into his
Dominion, he returned into the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He takes the Country of <hi>Xensi.</hi>
                     </note> and won it wholly to
his subjection. When he came to <hi>Sigan,</hi> which is the Metropolis of <hi>Xensi,</hi>
he found some resistance from the Garrison; but yet he took it in three
daies, and for a reward and encouragement to his Souldiers, he gave it to
them to pillage also for three daies space; and then he gathered up all the
Corn of the whole Province, as well to keep all the Country in their duty
to him, as also to leave no Provision for the Emperours Army. And now
thinking himself secure of the whole Empire, he took the name of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
upon him,<note place="margin">Calls himself Emperour.</note> and stiled the Family wherein he thought to establish this
Dignity, <hi>Thienxunam,</hi> as much as to say, <hi>Obedient to Heaven;</hi> By which
Title he perswaded the Souldiers and the People, that it was by the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
of the Heavens that he should raign, that he might deliver the people
from the Emperours Avarice, and extirpate those wicked Governours that
so much vexed the Nation, &amp; deliver them from all their perfidious plots.
For he knew well, that this Glorious Title would be very acceptable to
them of <hi>China,</hi> who beleeve that Kingdoms and Empires come only from
Heaven, and are not gained by any Art or Industry of Man; and that his
actions might carry a face correspondent to his illustrious Title, he began
to use the People with all humility and sweetnesse; not permitting any
Souldier to wrong or injure them;<note place="margin">The Theeves good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> only he persecuted all the Officers call'd
Presidents, which he could find, and all those he put to death; and as for
those that had been Presidents, because he found them rich, he made them
pay great Fines, and let them live; remitting all Taxes in the places he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued;
severely commanding that the subjects should be treated with all
civility and courtesie. So as all men applauding and loving so sweet and
milde a Government, easily submitted to his Power and Dominion; but
where the Governours use Tyranny, there the subject hath little care of
Fidelity. There were in this City <hi>Sigan</hi> two Priests which served the
Christians that were Jesuits, and suffered much in the saccage of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but being afterwards known for Strangers, they were used with all
humanity.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time a third cause of this Empires ruin grew up in the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:64464:148"/>
Court; which was hatched in the Emperour <hi>Thienkins</hi> his time: For that
Emperour exalted an Eunuch called <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ueio,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Prefects Discord was another cause of the ruine of <hi>China.</hi>
                     </note> to such a height and power, as
he gave the absolute, and soveraign Command into his hands, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so far, as alwayes to stile him by the name of Father. This extravagant
power caused much Envy, Dissention, and banding one against another,
amongst the Governours, Presidents, Commanders, and Counsellors:
and the Eunuch also added much to incense the flame, by his indiscreet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of the favour he possessed; for if any man had touched him, either in
word or writing, or expressed lesse respect unto him in conversation, or
behaviour, or did not flatter the base fellow, he would presently give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to put him to death, though he were a very eminent person;
or at least degrade him from all Office or Dignity. By which means he
exasperated many, and amongst the rest he offended <hi>Zunchinius</hi> when
Prince; who now, by the death of his Brother without issue, was come to
to be Emperour of <hi>China.</hi> This Emperour knew that the Eunuch had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Heaven and Earth to hinder his coming to the Crown; but seeing he
could not effect that, at least he maintained a seditious faction against the
great ones, which finally proved the destruction of the Estate; For these
men banding in two factions, studied more how to destroy one another,
than to advance the publique good; yet both parties pretended the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
benefit, but both neglected it; Every party endeavouring to extoll and
exalt his own Creatures into places of trust and power: All which when
<hi>Zunchinius</hi> the emperour went about to redresse, he exasperated the minds
of many of the Commanders against him; for as soon as he came to the
Crown, he cruelly persecuted all that favoured the Eunuch; and in fine,
killed this very Eunuch which had been his, Predecessors Favourite, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with many more of his partie; of which Tragedy I will only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Catastrophe. The Emperour <hi>Zungchinius</hi> resolving to destroy
both the Eunuch &amp; all his power, sent him an order to go visit the Tombs
of his Ancestors, to consider if any of those ancient Monuments wanted
reparation: the Eunuch could not refuse so honourable an imployment,
which seemed rather an addition to his former hounours; but he had not
gone far upon his journey, but there was presented to him (from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour)
a Box of Silver gilt, with a Halter of Silk folded up in it; by which
he understood he was to hang himself by the Emperors order: which he
could not refuse, being that kind of death (amongst the <hi>Chineses</hi>) is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
honourable, when it is accompanied with such formalities. But by
this occasion the Emperour raised against himself new Factions and more
Traitours, which held secret correspondence with the Theeves Army.
Hence it came to passe, that no Army was sent to oppose them; or if any
went, they did no manner of action, being alwayes hindered by the emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of others; nay it happened often, that when they might have taken
great advantages, yet the occasion was neglected, lest the Commanders
should increase other mens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Power and Credit, (by their Victories,) with
the Emperour. These Dissentions and Emulations happend so seasonably
to the Roving Army of Theeves, as that to <hi>come, to see, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi>
was to them one and the self same thing, as I shall declare unto
you.</p>
                  <p>

Whilest these transactions passed in the Court,<note place="margin">The Theevs take the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Xensi.</hi>

                     <hi>Licungzus</hi> Conductor
of the Theeves, having setled all things in the Country of <hi>Xensi,</hi> passed to
the East; and coming to the famous great River of <hi>Croceus,</hi> finding no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to defend it, he passed over with as much facility, as it might have
been maintained with ease, if there had been placed but a handfull of
Souldiers. For this River runnes with a violent rapid course, and a vast
Sea of waters from West to East; but being there was no man to defend
it, they passing it easily, presently seized upon the chief and richest City in
all those quarters, called <hi>Kaiangch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ankside of that River; and being carried on with a strong gale of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
he seized upon many other Cities, every one desiring either to free
themselves from further vexation, or blindly and fondly submitting
themselves to any new change of Government. For we commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in varieties and novelties, and hoping for better, we find worse. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the City of <hi>Thaiyven</hi> made some resistance, but being presently subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was fined with great sumes of money for their temerity. The Emperour
<hi>Zungchinius</hi> hearing the Theeves had passed the River <hi>Croceus,</hi> and were
advanced to the very Confine; of <hi>Xensi</hi> (which borders upon the Province
where he had placed his Throne and Royall Seat) he sent an Army under
the Lord Marshal of <hi>China,</hi> to hold them at least in play, if he could not
overthrow them; But this Army did just nothing; nay most of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ran to the Thieving party, in so much as the Lord Marshal himself,
called <hi>Colaus Lius,</hi> seeing Affairs grew so desperate, Hang'd himself for
fear of further shame and dishonour.<note place="margin">The Emperour of <hi>China</hi> is troubled,</note> The Emperour hearing of the ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

his Royal City of <hi>Peking</hi> is situated, and to passe to <hi>Nankuing</hi> which is
far more Southward; but he was disswaded from this intended course as
well by his loyal, as disloyal subjects: by these, that they might give him
up more speedily into the enemies hands, before their treachery was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
and by the others, lest his flight might trouble the Kingdome
more, and discourage all his Subjects from giving their best assistance;
for they thought the City impregnable, being fortified with so strong a
Garrison; nor did they doubt that the Kings presence would draw the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the whole Kingdom to him. And their Counsel had been good, if
the Court had been purged of Traytors.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Theeves Conductor,<note place="margin">The Stratagem of the Theef.</note> who was no lesse quick and
nimble in execution, than witty in invention, sowing a Fox his tail to the
Lions skin, caused many of his Souldiers in a disguised habit to creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that Princely City, and gave them money to trade in trifling ware, till
he assaulted the walls with the body of his Army; for then they had order
to raise sedition, and tumult in the City; and, considering they were a
Company of desperate Fellows, and of a very low and base fortune, it is
stupendious to think how they could keep so profound secrecy in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of so high concernment: But to this mine, which was prepared in the
bowels of the City, he held a secret train of Intelligence, with the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the City; who seeing the Emperours Affairs desperate, is said
to have dealt with the Conductor of these Brigants about giving up the
City unto their power; But, however it was, these Pilferers came in a

                     </gap>er, he hung himself
upon a Prune tree. Thus that unfortunate Emperour put a period, as
well to that Empire, which had flourished so long with much splendor,
riches, and pleasure, as to his Illustrious Family of <hi>Taimingus,</hi> by finishing
his life upon so contemptible a Tree, and in such an infamous manner:
To all which circumstances, I adde one more; that as the Empire was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by a Theef, so it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

were chosen to succeed him, as we shall relate hereafter, yet because they
held a smal parcel of the Empire, they are not numbred amongst the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.
His example was followed by the Queen, and by the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall,
who is call'd in their language <hi>Colaus,</hi> together with other faithfull
Eunuchs; So as those pleasant Trees which served heretofore for their
Sports and pleasures, now became the horrid and surest Instruments of
their death. And this cruell butchering of themselves passed not only in
the Court but also in the City; where many made themselves away, either
by hanging, or drowning by leaping into Lakes; For it is held by this
Nation to be the highest point of fidelity, to die with their Prince, and
not to live and be subject to another.</p>
                  <p>Whilest these things were acting, <hi>Licungz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and ascending up to the Chair of State, sate himself down in that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariall
Throne; but it is recorded, that in executing this first Act of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
he sat so restlesly and unquietly, yea so totteringly, as if even then that
Royal Chaire would foretel the short durance of his felicity. The next
day after,<note place="margin">The Theefs Tyranny and cruelty.</note> he commanded the body of the dead Emperour to be cut into
smal pieces, accusing him of oppression and cruelty against his subjects; As
if he, being a villanous Traitor, and a Theef, after the saccaging &amp; burning
so many Provinces, and shedding such an Ocean of blood, had been of
a better disposition. So we often condemn others, when we do worse our
selves, and remark, yea augment, the least faults of others, when we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take no notice of, or diminish our own. This Emperour <hi>Zungchinius</hi>
was Father of three Sons, of which the eldest could never be found, though
all imaginable means was used for his discovery; some think he found
means to fly away; others think he perished by leaping with others into the
Lake; the two others being yet little Children, were by the Tyrants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
beheaded three days after; his barbarous humour not sparing even
innocent blood: Which disposition he made further to appear, when casting
off that vail of Piety and Humanity, with which he had for sometime
charmed the people, he commanded all the Principal Magistrates to
be apprehended, of which he murdered many with cruel torments, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
he fined deeply, and reserved the Imperiall Palace for his own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad.
He filled that most noble and rich City with ransacking Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and gave it up to their prey and plunder; where they committed such
execrable things, as are both too long, and not fit to be related. But by
this his horrid cruelty, and Tyranny, he lost that Empire which he might
have preserved by courtesie and humanity.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the other imprisoned Magistrates, there was one a venerable
person called <hi>Us,</hi> whose Son <hi>Usangueius</hi> governed the Army of <hi>China,</hi> in
the Confines of <hi>Leaotung,</hi> against the <hi>Tartars.</hi> The Tyrant <hi>Licungzus</hi>
thereatned this old man with a most cruel death, if by his paternall power
over his Son, he did not reduce him with his whole Army, to subjection
and obedience to his power; promising also great Rewards and Honours
to them both, if by his fatherly power (which they hold facred) he did
prevail for his submission. Wherefore the poor old man writ to his Son
this ensuing Letter.</p>
                  <p>It is well known that the Heavens, Earth, and Fate can cause these strange
vicissitudes of Fortune which we behold; know my Son, that the Emperour
<hi>Zunchinius,</hi> and the whole family of <hi>Taimingus</hi> are perished. The Heavens

thou owest to him that gave thy life.</p>

is not faithfull to his Soveraign, will never be faithful to me: and if you forget
your duty and fidelity to our Emperour, no man will blame me if I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
my duty and obedience to such a father. I will rather die than serve

And presently after the dispatch of this Letter, he sent an Embassador
to the King of <hi>Tartary,</hi>

he promised to send him some store of them; and presented him

The <hi>Tartarian</hi> King neglected not this good occasion, but presently
marched with fourescore thousand men, which were in Garrison in <hi>Leao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tung,</hi>

knowing himself not able to resist, quitted the Court and Palace as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
as he had taken it: but he carried with him all the rich spoyls of the
Court, and marched away into the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi> where he establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Court in the noble City of <hi>Sigan,</hi> which heretofore had been the
seat of the Emperours. It is accounted that for eight daies space by the
four Palace gates, there was nothing seen but a continuall succession of
Coaches, Horses, Camels, and Porters, carrying away the preciousest
treasures;<note place="margin">They carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Palace.</note> though they left also much, because the enemy approached.
Thus the immense Riches of Gold and Silver, which the Emperours of
the <hi>Taimingean</hi> Family had at leasure hoorded up, in the space of two
hundred and fourscore years, were in a moment dispersed. But although
they fled very speedily, yet they could not avoid the swift Tartarian Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
for overtaking their Luggage, and the Rear of the Army, they pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and vexed them for eight daies; but yet they either could not, or
would not passe the River <hi>Croceus,</hi> that so they might speedily returne to
amuse the trembling hearts of the Territory of <hi>Peking.</hi> The <hi>Tartars</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
therefore victorious and rich into the City <hi>Peking,</hi> and there being
admitted by the <hi>Chineses,</hi> they gave them the Empire. Where it is
to be observed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zungteus</hi> King of the <hi>Tartars</hi> dyes.</note> that although <hi>Zungteus,</hi> the <hi>Tartarian</hi> King, dying at the
first entrance into <hi>China,</hi> did not obtain that noble Empire he so much
thirsted after; yet he gave those Instructions, of the manner of conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it, to his Councel, that they never desisted till they obtained it. This
Prince dying, declared his Son of six years old, his Successor; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all his own Brethren to manage the Childs Affairs with all fidelity
and circumspection, making his eldest brother his Tutor; and all those
brethren, being uncles to the Child, by a stupendious union, and never
to be parallel'd in any ambitious Nation, exalted this Infant to the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>These things being thus passed, <hi>Usangueius,</hi> seeing the Thief expelled,
began to think of creating a new Emperour,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> refuse to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part <hi>China.</hi>

To this demand the <hi>Tartars</hi> returned a long premeditated answer,

To all whom he, commonly, continued the same Commands
and Offices they were established in before, and advanced many of them
to higher dignity; and so by this Humanitie with which he treated all that
came flying to him, and by the crueltie he used to those that resolved to
make resistance to the Force of his Arms, he gained this, that most men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to partake of his sweet treatie, rather than of his cruelty; so he easily
conquered all that which lies on the North side of that River, which I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
before the Son of the Sea. This River being a <hi>German</hi> League in
breadth, and rising from the West of <hi>China,</hi> holds its course to the East, and
divides the Kingdom into Northern and Southern Quarters; it also divides
the Country of <hi>Nanking</hi> in the very middle; though <hi>Nanking</hi> the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
and Royal City be placed in the Southern part. To Master this
great Citie, they were to passe this River. They gathered therefore toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
many Ships, to Conquer this new Emperial seat, and also the new set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
Emperour. The Fleet of <hi>China</hi> commanded by the most generous and
faithfull Admiral called <hi>Hoangchoangus,</hi> lay towards the other side of this
River. Here the Admiral fought so gallantly and resolutely, that he made
it appear to the world, that the <hi>Tartars</hi> were not invincible; Till at length
one of his own Commanders called <hi>Thienus</hi> born in the Citie of <hi>Leaotung,</hi>
being corrupted by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> shot him with an Arrow to death: which
Arrow fixed the unconstant wheel of <hi>Chinas</hi> fortune, and lost the whole
Empire. But the Traitor, not contented with this perfidious Act, began
himself to run away, and by his example drew all the rest to imitate this
Ignominious Action. His impudence passed yet to a higher strain: for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Imperial Citie, and finding the Emperour preparing to retire,
he joyned himselfe with him, as a faithfull friend, participating of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity;
till he saw the <hi>Tartars</hi> (who passing the River followed the Kings
flight with all imaginable diligence) were come near him,<note place="margin">The Emperour <hi>Hunquangus</hi> is taken and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> &amp; then he took
the Emperour Prisoner, and delivered him to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army in the
year MDCXLIV. This unfortunate Prince being thus betrayed before he
had raigned full one year, was sent to <hi>Peking,</hi> and there upon the Town
Walls was hanged publickly in a Bow string, which kind of death the
<hi>Tartars</hi> esteem most noble. The pretended Son to the Emperour <hi>Zunchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
(whether he were true or false,) run the same course of fortune, when
they had discovered him being kept still in Prison: for they did not onely
put to death all those which belonged to the Imperial Family of the <hi>Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minges</hi>
by Consanguinitie, but after a diligent search extirpated all they
could find, which belonged to them even by Affinitie; for it is a custom
in <hi>Asia,</hi> if any one conquer a Kingdom, to root out all that belong to the
Royal Family.</p>
                  <p>After this, they divided their Army into two parts; the one they sent
to conquer the Mediterranean Provinces of <hi>Kiansi, Huquang,</hi> &amp; <hi>Quang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tung,</hi>
which are all of a marvellous extent; the other, like a swift Torrent,
over-run all,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> run to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Hangcheu.</hi>
                     </note> till they came to the very Walls of the renowned and vast
City of <hi>Hangcheu,</hi> which is the head City of the Province of <hi>Chekiang.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this City the principal fugitives of the Army of <hi>China</hi> were retired; and
those not only of the common Souldiers, but many great Commanders,
and Prefects; where they resolved to chuse a new Emperour called <hi>Lovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:64464:153"/>
of the ancient Family of <hi>Taimingus:</hi> But this Prince would never as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the Title of Emperour, but contented himself with the Title of
King; thinking his fall would be lesse, and his death not so bitter, as if he
fell from the Throne of an Emperour: but yet to the end to animate
them to fight with more vigour than they had done heretofore, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
them to take that Title when they had re-gained one Imperial City.
He had not reigned three dayes (a shorter space than their personated
Kings use many times to reign in their Tragedies) but the <hi>Tartars</hi> arrive;
Which the fugitive Souldiers seeing, &amp; thinking by this pinch of necessity
to force their pay from the King and City, refused to fight before they
had received their salary. It was on this occasion, that King <hi>Lovangus</hi> his
heart, being not able to bear such a desolation of the City, of his people
and subjects,<note place="margin">King <hi>Lovingus</hi> love to his Subjects.</note> as he foresaw, gave such an example of his Humanity and
Piety, as <hi>Europe</hi> never saw; for he mounted upon the City Walls, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon his Knees to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Captains, begged the life of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
<hi>Spare not me</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I wil willingly be my Subjects victime;</hi> &amp; having
said this, he presently went out to the <hi>Tartars</hi> Army, and was taken. This
Illustrious testimony of his love to his Subjects had not wanted a reward
to Crown so Heroick an Action, if it had met with a generous Soul,
like that of <hi>Alexander</hi> or of <hi>Caesar.</hi> When they had the King Prisoner,
they commanded the Citizens to shut the Gates, and keep the Walls,
least either their own, or the Kings Souldiers should enter the City; and
presently they fell upon the Kings men, whom they butchered in a most
cruel manner, but yet the water destroyed more, than their Swords or
Arrows; for many cast themselves headlong into the great River of <hi>Cian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thang,</hi>
which is a League broad, and runs neer the City; others leaping
and overcharging the Boats in the River were presently sunck;<note place="margin">Many of the Kings Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers drowned.</note> others fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away full of fear and confusion, thrust one another at the River side
into that unmerciful Element; and by all these many thousands perished.
The <hi>Tartars</hi> wanting boats to passe this River,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hangcheu</hi> is taken.</note> having thus expelled or
killed the Souldiery, they returned Triumphant to the City, where they
used neither force, nor violence; by which means this noble City was
conserved, whose beauty, greatnesse, and riches, I hope to describe else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
not by hear-say, but by what I saw, in the three years space I lived
in it, from which I lately came into <hi>Europe.</hi> This City of <hi>Hangcheu</hi> hath an
Artificial Channel or Dike to pass by water to the Northern parts of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>
This Chanel is onely separated by the high part of the way like a
Causeway from the River, which as I said, runs on the South part of the
City. The <hi>Tartars</hi> therefore drew many Boats out of this Chanel over
the Causeway into the River <hi>Cienthang,</hi> and with the help of these Boats
they passed the River without resistance, and found the fairest City in all
<hi>China,</hi> called <hi>Xaoking,</hi> prone enough to submit to their victorious Armes.
This City in bignesse yields to many others, but in cleannesse and comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it surpasses all: it is so invironed with sweet waters as a man may
contemplate its beauty by rounding it in a Boat; it hath large and
fair Streets paved on both sides with white square stones, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of them all runs a Navigable Chanel, whose sides are garnished with
the like ornament, and of the same stone there are also built many fairs
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64464:153"/>
Bridges and Triumphant Arches; the Houses also, (which I observe no
where else in <hi>China</hi>) are built of the same square stone; so as in a word, I saw
nothing neater in all <hi>China.</hi> They took this Town without any resistance,
and so they might have done all the rest of the Southern Towns of this
Povince of <hi>Chekiang.</hi> But when they commanded all by Proclamation
to cut off their Hair,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chineses</hi> defend their Hair.</note> then both Souldier and Citizen took up Armes, and
fought more desperately for their Hair of their Heads, than they did for
King or Kingdome, and beat the <hi>Tartars</hi> not only out of their City,
but repulst them to the River <hi>Cienthang:</hi> nay forced them to passe
the River, killing very many of them. In truth, had they past the River,
they might have recovered the Metropolis with the other Towns:
But they pursued their victory no further, being sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
that they had preserved their Hair, resisting them only on the
South side of the shore, and there fortifying themselves. By this means
the conquering Armes of the <hi>Tartars</hi> were repressed for a whole year. But
the <hi>Chinois</hi> that they might have a Head, chose <hi>Lu Regulus</hi> of the <hi>Taimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
Family for their Emperour; who would not accept therof, but would
be only stiled, The Restorer of the Empire. In the mean time the <hi>Tartars</hi>
had sent for new forces out of <hi>Peking,</hi> with which they left nere a Stone
unturned, that they might get over the River <hi>Cienthang:</hi> but all was in vain,
The drooping affairs therfore of the <hi>Chinois</hi> now breathed again, nay, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gathered together more Forces, they promised themselves greater
victories. But the ambition and emulation of rulling frustrated all their
hopes. For the Commanders, and Presidents which fled out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Chekian</hi> into the Country of <hi>Fokien,</hi> carried with them one of
<hi>Taiminga's</hi> Family, called <hi>Thangus;</hi> and this man they chose King in the
Country of <hi>Fokien,</hi> which confines with <hi>Chekiang.</hi> This Prince preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the King called <hi>Lu,</hi> should yeeld up his right to him, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had but a few Cities under him, and also because he was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
removed from the Imperial Race, than he was. But King <hi>Lu,</hi>
pretended he was Proclaimed by the Army, before him, and failed not
to set forth his victories over the <hi>Tartars,</hi> By which two contentions,
the <hi>Tartars</hi> kept the Crown; for these two Royalets, would never yeeld
to one another, nor so unite their Armies, as joyntly to represse the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.</hi>
Since therefore this petty King <hi>Lu</hi> had onely eight Cities under his
command, whose Contributions were not able to maintain the necessary
pay of his Army, he never durst venture to passe over the River, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
only to defend himself. But the <hi>Tartars</hi> sought all means possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to get over this River, yet they durst not venture to passe in Boats, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
King <hi>Lu</hi> had many ships, and good store of Artillery which he had
caused to be brought from Sea. But the <hi>Tartars</hi> felicity, and prosperous
fortune, overcame this difficulty: for, as it happened, that year being
dryer than ordinary, this River towards the South, where it runs betwixt
high Mountains, and is deprived of the flowing of the Sea, had lost much
of its depth;<note place="margin">The Tartars passe the River, and recover the City <hi>Xa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

might make the greatest show; and withall I placed the picture of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

demanded of me whether I would with a good will change my <hi>China</hi>-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
and cut off my hair. To which I readily consented; and so he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me to be shaven there in his presence; and I telling him, that a shaven
head would not so well suite with a <hi>China</hi>-Garment, he pluk't off his own
boots, and made me draw them on, put his <hi>Tartar</hi> bonnet on my head, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
me at his Table, and accommodating me with his Passe, dismissed me
to my ancient quarters in the noble City <hi>Hancheu,</hi> where we had a
stately Church and Colledge: In the siege of <hi>Kinlna,</hi> the <hi>Tartars</hi>
by reason of great Guns which continually plaid upon them,
and by the wise conduct and courage of their noble Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
suffered many and great losses; insomuch as he forced them to pitch
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64464:154"/>
their Camp further from the City; But at length they also brought Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
from the chief City of the Province, by which they made so many
breaches in the Walls, as these being in a manner dismantled, they found
entrance; and burned and sacked it with all imaginable Hostility. The
Governour blew up himself and all his Family with a Barrel of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in his own Pallace, least he, or his, should fall into the Enemies
hands.</p>
                  <p>The Province of <hi>Fokien</hi> is invironed with the bordering Countries of
<hi>Quamgtung, Kiansi,</hi> and <hi>Chekiang;</hi> from all which it is separated by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
Chain of Mountains which are in breadth of three dayes journey
to passe over; and withall, so full of ragged and ruggy Clifts, and obscure
Vallies, as they make the very Paths horrid, dark and obscure at Noon
day. Insomuch, as without any exaggeration, they may well be parallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
either to the Grecian Straits of <hi>Thermopolis,</hi> or to the <hi>Asian</hi> ruggy and
strait passage of <hi>Taurus.</hi> These places might have been easily defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
if they had but placed a few Clowns, to repel the Enemy, or crossed
the wayes by any incumbrances; but the very imagination of
a <hi>Tartar</hi> was grown so terrible to them, as they fled at the very sight of
their Horses; leaving therefore these Mountains wholly ungarnished, the
<hi>Tartars</hi> found a passage,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> take in <hi>Fokien</hi> very easily.</note> but so very painful, and full of difficulties, as they
were forced to leave much of their Baggage behind them; and lost many
of their Horses, in those fearfull precipices; but by this meanes they took
the Province of <hi>Fokien</hi> with as much ease, as it might have been defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
for they hardly spent as much time in taking it as a man would doe to
walk the extent of it. The King himself named <hi>Lunguns</hi> (which signifieth a
Warlike Dragon) shewed himself a fearful Sheep, flying away with a
good Army of men, if that word rightly can be applyed to a numerous
multitude that had no hearts; but his flght served him for nothing; for the
<hi>Tartars</hi> following him with their swift and nimble Horses,<note place="margin">King <hi>Lunguus</hi> slain.</note> shot all this
flock of silly Sheep to death with Arrows. It is thought the King himself
was involved in this Massacre, for he never appeared, nor was heard of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
                  <p>Now because the whole Province submitted it self voluntarily unto
them without any resistance, it did not only suffer little from the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
but they had many choise and select Souldiers out of it; and having thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
recruited their Army, they made another irruption into the Countrie
of <hi>Quamgtung;</hi> and its worth remarking, that the other <hi>Tartarian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
who, when the Army was divided (as I related before,) had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to subdue the Mediterranean Countries,<note place="margin">The Provinces of <hi>Quamgtung</hi> is taken.</note> with the same felicity and
expedition passing victorious through the Provinces of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Kiangsi,</hi> entred also on one side of this Countrie of <hi>Quamgtung,</hi> whilst
the other came in by <hi>Fokien</hi> upon the other fide; and because the Town of

So the poor Country of <hi>Quamgtung</hi> oppressed by a double victorious
Army, was quickly over-run &amp; subdued. After this, one of these victorious
Armies, enriched with all the rarities of <hi>China,</hi> was called back to <hi>Peking,</hi>
but yet they left a Garrison in every City, assigning in the name of the
King of <hi>Tartars</hi> both Civil and Martial Officers, for the Countries Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:64464:155"/>
The happie successe in taking the impregnable Province of <hi>Fokien,</hi> is
attributed by wise men, (to whose judgement I also submit) to a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and hidden cause, which I will briefly relate. There was at this time
a famous and renowned Pyrat called <hi>Chinchilungus;</hi> this man was both in
the Province of <hi>Fokien,</hi> of which we are treating; he first served the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghese</hi>
in <hi>Macao;</hi> then he served the Hollander in the Island called <hi>Formosa,</hi>
where he was known to all strangers by the name of <hi>Iquon.</hi> After this he
became a Pyrat, but being of quick and nimble wit, he grew from this
small and slender fortune, to such a height and power, as he was held ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Superiour or equal to the Emperour of <hi>China;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A famous Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in <hi>China.</hi>
                     </note> for he had the Trade of
<hi>India</hi> in his hand; and he dealt with the <hi>Portugese</hi> in <hi>Macao;</hi> with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
in the <hi>Phillippins;</hi> with the Hollanders in the Island <hi>Formosa,</hi> and
new <hi>Holland;</hi> with the <hi>Iaponians,</hi> and with all the Kings and Princes of
the Eastern parts in all manner of rich commodities. He permitted none
to transport the Wares of <hi>China</hi> but himself or his, to whom he brought
back the riches and the Silver of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Indies;</hi> for after he once rather
extorted, than obtained pardon of the King of <hi>China</hi> for his Pyracies, he
became so formidable, as that he had no lesse than three thousand Ships of
which he was Lord and Master. Now was he contented with this fortune,
but aspired privately to no lesse than to the Empire; But because he knew
he never should be accepted of the Prefects and people, as long as there
was any of the Imperial Family of the <hi>Taiminges</hi> alive, he hoped by the
<hi>Tartars</hi> means to extinguish them wholly, and after this was done, then
he resolved to display his Banners and Ensigns in so pious a cause, as the
driving out the common Enemy from the bowels of the Kingdom; and no
doubt but under this pretext, they would all have followed, helped and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
adored him, as their Saviour. It was therefore evident that he had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
correspondence with the <hi>Tartars;</hi> and that he favoured them for his
own profit; And that which made the businesse more suspicious was, that
at that time when the <hi>Tartars</hi> made their irruption into <hi>Fokien,</hi> he was then
declared Lord Marshal of the Kingdom, and all the Generals, Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Souldiers, were either of his affinity, or wholly at his Command
and Obedience. And therefore it is no wonder, if the <hi>Tartars</hi> found an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
admittance into the Country of <hi>Fokien;</hi> of which they presently made
him King <hi>Pingnan,</hi> (as much as to say; <hi>Pacifier of the South</hi>) and they added
many other Dignities,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> deceive the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, and take him prisoner by meer Art.</note> and Offices of trust, that they might more specious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
illude him; for either they knew his aspiring mind, or else his great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and authoritie was suspicious and formidable to them; but yet all the
while that the General of the <hi>Tartars</hi> remained in <hi>Fokien,</hi> they never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
the least diffidence in him, but both with favours, courtesies, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
and honours, they studied how further to ingage him, and promised
him the Government of many more Provinces. He made himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
secure of the Government of all the Southern Provinces; but all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
quite contrary to his expectation; for when this General of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
who was observed as a little King, was to depart to <hi>Peking,</hi> the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
was for all the Officers of the Kingdom to conduct him, for some
part of his journy, to give him an honourable farewell; which last duty of
Civility, <hi>Iquan</hi> could not handsomely avoid, nor indeed, had he any reason
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64464:155"/>
to be diffident in him; so as he left his Navie in the Port of <hi>Eocheu,</hi> and
accompanied the Royolet with great splendor and magnificence. But when
he came to take leave, and demand Licence to return, the General of the
<hi>Tartars,</hi> invited him a long to <hi>Peking,</hi> where he promised him yet greater
honours from the Kings own person, to reward his Merits. He endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all imaginable impediments, to excuse this journey, but nothing
was accepted, he was forced, by their kindnesse, to accompany them to
<hi>Peking;</hi> and so he was taken by Art, who by Arms seemed Insuperable.
He is yet detained in Prison in <hi>Peking,</hi> because his Brothers and Kindred
hearing of his Captivitie, presently seazed on the Fleet; with which they
have much infested <hi>China,</hi> as we shall touch hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the other Army which had passed the Mediterranean
Provinces of <hi>Huquang,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> overthrow <hi>Quangsi.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Kiansi,</hi> and <hi>Quamgtung,</hi> invaded the Country of
<hi>Quangsi.</hi> But here it was that the Arms of the <hi>Tartars</hi> which hitherto were
held invincible, were shewed to beweak, &amp; where they least expected op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
there they found a stop to their conquests. It happened that in this
Province of <hi>Quangsi</hi> the Vice-Roy, called <hi>Khiu Thomas,</hi> was a Christian;
and also all the <hi>Militia</hi> of that Country was commanded by <hi>Ching Lucas,</hi>
whose family for five Generations has served the Emperours of <hi>China,</hi> with
as much constancy and fidelity, as they did Christ. These two having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
many together, which fled from all parts into <hi>Quangsi,</hi> after the
<hi>Tartars</hi> had taken many places in the Country, overthrew the <hi>Tartarians</hi>
in a set Battail; and passing into the confining Province of <hi>Quamgtung,</hi> they
recovered all the Western part of it. After this, that they might have a
head to fight for, and who might command and govern them in all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences,
and withall, to draw the minds and hands of the <hi>Chineses</hi> to the
common defence of the Country, knowing that in the City of <hi>Queilin,</hi>
which is the head City of <hi>Quangsi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iungley</hi> made Emperour of <hi>China.</hi>
                     </note> there was one of the <hi>Taiminges</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
living, who was Nephew to the Great <hi>Vanleius,</hi> they elected him Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and called by the name of <hi>Iungley.</hi> This Prince fixed his Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
seat in the noble City of <hi>Chatking</hi> in the Province of <hi>Quamgtung,</hi> and
hitherto has fought several times with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> with good successe.
And in this Princes Court, the chief Euncuh called <hi>Pang Acbilleus,</hi> is the
greatest favourite, and a great Servant of Christ, whom he hath long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
sincerely to worship, both by word and deed; for, to propagate
Christianitie, he has ever maintained a mission of Jesuites about him, by
whose painfull endeavours many have embraced the Faith of Christ. And
amongst others the very Mother of this Emperour, his Wife, and his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Son,<note place="margin">The Heir to the Empire becomes Christian.</note> Heir of the Empire, called <hi>Constantin,</hi> did all imbrace Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
May this Man by the praiers of all Christians prove another <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
to the Empire of <hi>China.</hi> The Emperour himself is not averse from
Christianitie, but hitherto he hath defer'd his Baptism, but yet he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Wife to send a Father of the Society, to do homage to the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick,
as all <hi>Europe</hi> has heard. God of his goodnesse grant him that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
which may redound to the universal good of <hi>China,</hi> and Gods grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
glory.</p>
                  <p>But it was not only in <hi>Quangsi</hi> that the <hi>Chineses</hi> began to resume their
courage,<note place="margin">Theeves infest the Province of <hi>Fokien.</hi>
                     </note> but in the Province of <hi>Fokien</hi> also, for no sooner was the <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:64464:156"/>
Army called back to <hi>Peking,</hi> but a petty Heathen Priest broke out
of the Mountains of <hi>Fokien,</hi> with a band of seditious fellows, and subduing
the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Garrisons took the fair City of <hi>Kienning,</hi> and many others
from their subjection; and others which lay lurking in the Mountaines
following his example, recovered also many other Cities; about which
time also the friends and Kindred of the Captive <hi>Iquon</hi> did extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
the Sea, and making descents upon the Land, vexed the Province ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
about the Quarters of <hi>Siuencheu,</hi> and <hi>Changcheu.</hi> At this time a
chief Governour of the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> Vice-roy of two Provinces was at
<hi>Cheksang;</hi> who hearing of these commotions came presently by night in
great haste with all the force he could make, towards the Mountains of
<hi>Fokien;</hi> for he with reason feared lest they should take possession of the
Passages of those places, which if they had done, the whole Province
had been re-gained. But when this Vice-roy, called <hi>Changus,</hi> found the
Mountains and Passages clear, &amp; no opposition made in such difficult pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he then proclamed himself victorious, and his enemies persidious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels:
wherefore coming without resistance into the Country,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Changus</hi> the Commander of the <hi>Tartars</hi> besieges <hi>Kien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> in vain.</note> he besieged
the City <hi>Kienning,</hi> which was defended by <hi>Vangus.</hi> This Siege held some
weeks, but he never could take the place by force, and therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lost many of his men by assaults, he judged it best rather to block up
the place afar off, than to besiege it so close and neer. But yet by this,
he hindred other forces from joyning with <hi>Vangus,</hi> so that he was not
strong enough to sally out upon them.</p>
                  <p>When the noyse of these commotions came to <hi>Peking,</hi> the Emperour
presently sent a new supply to appease these tumults; and this fresh Army
comming to joyn with the other,<note place="margin">It is at length taken and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</note> brought the City to great streights; but
yet they could not win it, til at length they found means by a rare inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to transport their Canons over the Mountains upon Porters Shoulders,
by which means they dismantled the Town, and put all whatsoever to
the Sword, to the number of thirty thousand persons, as my own
friends writ unto me; and not content with this, they set fire on the Town,
and brought it all to ashes, by which means, the stately Church erected
by the Christians for the service of God, was also consumed by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
flame; yet the Priests that served in that Church got out miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
as <hi>Lot</hi> did out of <hi>Sodom;</hi> which name was appropriated to this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by reason of that infamous vice. This City being taken, it was no
hard matter to recover the Countrie; for some fled to save themselves in
the Mountains, others ran to the Sea, and so when this new Army had
pacified all, they were called back to <hi>Peking;</hi> where it is not amisse to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the policy which the <hi>Tartars</hi> use in the Government and ordering of
their Army: They are ever calling back some, and sending out others; in
which proceeding they aim at two things; first to keep the Countries in
awe and subjection, by seeing variety of Troops continually passing up
and down; and secondly, to provide for the poorer sort of Souldiers; for
the wealthy Souldier is called back to recreat, and ease labours, and the
poor Souldier seeing his Companion grown rich, takes heart and courage
to run the same course upon hopes of the like good fortune.</p>
                  <p>Yet for all these preventions and cautions, their Empire was not so
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:64464:156"/>
established, but by frequent rebellions it was often indangered; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
by one Rebellion, which now I will relate, which shaked shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the foundations of the new Empire. The Kingdome of <hi>China</hi> is of so
vast an extent,<note place="margin">How the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> dispose their Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> as it is a businesse of main importance, to distribute judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
the Armies and Garrisons. Now because the <hi>Tartars</hi> alone cannot
suffice to furnish both, they are forced to use the help of the <hi>Chineses</hi>
themselves, although they have a speciall care never to leave or place ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Commander or Souldier, who is a Native, in the same Country; yet
this care could not exempt them from several Treasons, and Rebellions;
though they distribute &amp; order their <hi>Militia,</hi> with great circumspection;
for the chief Commander or Governour resides in the Metropolitan Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whom all inferiour Officers obey. This man maintaines alwayes
a compleat Army, which he commands to march, when he hears of any
risings. Every City has also their own proper Governour, with a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
number of Souldiers, but those for the most part are <hi>Tartars,</hi> and
these are <hi>Chines.</hi> But all this Politicall, and well-established Government
could not defend them from Traitors amongst themselves. The first man
that did revolt from them was one <hi>Kinus</hi> Governour of the Province of
<hi>Kiangsi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Kinus</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</note> This man was born in <hi>Leaotung,</hi> and because it is a Country that
borders upon <hi>Tartary,</hi> the King commonly most confides in the Natives
of that Province. It happened I know not how, that this Governour, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of some corruptions, and Avarice of the Visitor of the Country, had
some contests with him, which grew by little and little to a secret hatred;<note place="margin">The hatred betwixt the two Prefects disturbs the Country of <hi>Kiansi.</hi>
                     </note>
and although they both dissembled their private malice, as usually they
do in <hi>China,</hi> yet at length the flame broke out to the ruin of the Country;
for being the one was Governour of the Armes, and the other of Justice,
there was a necessity of often meetings, &amp; feastings also. It happened once
that whilst they were feasted with a sumptuous Banquet, they were also
entertained by a pleasant Comedy; in which the Actors were attired with
the habits of <hi>China,</hi> which were more comely and fairer than those which
the <hi>Tartars</hi> use; upon which occasion <hi>Kinus</hi> turning himself to the Visitor
said, <hi>Is not this habit better, &amp; graver than ours?</hi> This innocent speech was
interpreted by his corrival Judge, as if he had contemned the Edict about
changing of Habits, and expressed too much love to the <hi>Chines</hi> Garments,
before those of the <hi>Tartars;</hi> and of this he sent an Expresse to advertise
the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>But the Governour <hi>Kinus,</hi> had corrupted a Secretary, which served
the Lord Chief Justice; who gave him intelligence of all that passed in
word or deed in his Masters House. And as soon as he had notice that this
Letter was sent to the Court, he presently dispatched those, who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
the Packet; which the Governour having read, went presently
armed to the Judges Palace, whom he suddenly killed. Then presently he
with the whole Province revolted from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and with the great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of all the <hi>Chineses,</hi> he submitted himself to <hi>Iungley</hi> the new elected
Emperour. One only City called <hi>Cancheu,</hi> which was governed by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted
<hi>Tartar,</hi> refused to submit; which was the whole, and only cause,
that the <hi>Tartars</hi> did recover the two Provinces <hi>Kiansi</hi> and <hi>Quamtung;</hi> both
which Provinces revolted at the same time with their Commanders, and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64464:157"/>
both submitted also to the new elected Emperour.<note place="margin">Many places revolt from the <hi>Tartar.</hi>

of <hi>Quamgtung</hi> at that time, who resolved to joyn his Forces with <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and so to cast the <hi>Tartars</hi> out of the Empire; which it is believed they
might have effected, if the Governour of <hi>Cancheu,</hi> which is the Key and
entrance into four Provinces, had not cunnigly undermined all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
and intentions. But this man hearing that <hi>Lihuzus</hi> had revolted, and
marched to joyn his Army with <hi>Kinus,</hi> dispatched to him this deceitfull
Letter,<note place="margin">The deceipt of the Governour of <hi>Cancheu.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>I have not hitherto submitted to</hi> Kinus, <hi>because I knew his forces were
not equal, nor able to resist the</hi> Tartars: <hi>But seeing thou, most renowned and
valiant Captain, beginnest also to march against them, my hopes concerning them
are at end, I am thine, and imbrace thy cause; whensoever thou shalt come, or send,
I will render my City to thee or thine.</hi> But in the mean time he sent to all the
Governours in <hi>Fokien,</hi> to send him secretly all the possible succour they
could raise altogether. <hi>Lihuzus</hi> having received the Letter marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, cheerfully, and confidently; But though he found the Gates
of the City open, yet he was furiously repelled by the <hi>Tartarians</hi> oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which unexpected accident so astonished his Souldiers, as many of
them perished, and amongst the rest it is thought himself was killed, for
he was never heard of after.</p>
                  <p>This reverse and crosse fortune did much disturb the progresse of the
Emperour <hi>Iangley's</hi> affairs; though <hi>Kinus</hi> in the mean time had many sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
victories over the <hi>Tartars;</hi> for when the chief Governour of all the
Western parts of <hi>China,</hi> who had placed his chief Seat in <hi>Nanking,</hi> had
gathered great Forces to represse his aspiring mind, yet he was severall
times routed &amp; overthrowne by him; and if <hi>Kinus</hi> had pursued the course
of his victories, he might have come to the very Walls of <hi>Nanking;</hi> but
he was sollicitous of the City of <hi>Cancheu,</hi> which obliged him to a retreit;
for neither was it safe for him to leave an enemy behind him, nor could be
receive victuals from the Emperour <hi>Iungley,</hi> but by <hi>Cancheu,</hi> which is the
natural descent of the River; and therefore when he heard of <hi>Lihuzu's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
he presently besieged that City with his whole Army; But whilst he
was besieging this City, there came, unfortunately, a new Army of <hi>Tartars</hi>
from the Imperiall City of <hi>Peking,</hi> which had order to recover this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Kiangsi;</hi> and therefore <hi>Kinus</hi> was forced to raise his Siege to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their entrance by the Northern parts of the Country; And at first ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a vast Army, and used to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> warfare, he fought both va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly
and happily; but not being able to sustain any longer their redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
violent assaults,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Kinus</hi> besieged by the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                     </note> he was forced to retire for his security to <hi>Nanchang,</hi>
the chief City of that Country; which City the <hi>Tartars</hi> durst not venture
to take by force, but resolved to reduce it by a long Siege; for which end
they gathered together a Company of Country Clowns to make a large
and spacious Trench round about the City to the River, and there they
placed Ships, so as no Provision could possibly enter. This City of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang</hi>
is great and extremely full of inhabitants, besides the multitude of
Souldiers which defended it at that time; so as although <hi>Kinus</hi> had made
great Provision for a Siege, yet after some moneths he came to great want
and pennury; and yet he held it out though many dyed, expecting stil some
succours from the Emperour <hi>Iungley,</hi> which could not be sent; because
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64464:157"/>
the Souldiers of <hi>Quamgtung</hi> could never subdue the City of <hi>Chancheu,</hi> by
which his succour was to passe; wherefore <hi>Kinus</hi> being brought to great
extremity, expressed his mind to his Souldiers in these words, <hi>There is no
further hope, (my faithful Companions) but in our own valour and strength, we
must force our way through the</hi> Tartarian <hi>Army by dint of Sword; be couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and follow my example.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Kinus</hi> breaks out of the City.</note> And having ordered all affairs, he suddainly
made a Sally out of the Town upon their Trenches; where, though he
found a vigorous opposition, yet, with great difficulty, he passed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
their Trenches, by which means he saved himself and his Army, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
killed many <hi>Tartars;</hi> for it is constantly reported that <hi>Kinus</hi> with a
good part of his Army lives in the Mountains, expecting there some good
occasion to renew the War.</p>
                  <p>He being thus escaped,<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Nanchang</hi> is destroyed.</note> the <hi>Tartars</hi> pillaged the City, and put all the
Citizens to the sword; for it is the <hi>Tartars</hi> custom to spare all Cities which
submit to them; and to those which have made resistance before they be
taken, they are more cruell; but they never spare or pardon those Cities
which revolt after they have once been taken. In this Slaughter they killed
the two Priests which there assisted the Christians; and their ancient and
fair Church was burned in the City. After this, the <hi>Tartars</hi> easily recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole Country, and having appeased all, and left new Garisons in
all places, the Army returned victorious to the Royal City of <hi>Peking.</hi> In
the mean time this Court prepared new Armies to reduce <hi>Quamgtung</hi> with
the other Provinces which acknowledged <hi>Iungley</hi> for the Emperour of
<hi>China;</hi> for the Tutor to the young King of <hi>Tartary,</hi> finding the defections
and rebellions in the Southern parts to be very frequent, resolved to give
those Quarters over to some Tributary Royolets,<note place="margin">Three Kings created with as many Armies against <hi>Iungley</hi> the Emperour of <hi>China.</hi>
                     </note> the better to contain
those Countries in their duties; wherefore in the year MDCXLIX. he sent
three Armies, consisting partly of <hi>Tartars,</hi> and partly of <hi>Chineses,</hi> under
three Tributary Princes, to govern these Provinces with absolute power
and Dominion; one of these was King of <hi>Fokien,</hi> another of <hi>Quamgtung,</hi>
and the third of the Province of <hi>Quangsi;</hi> but with this condition, that first,
of all they should joyn their Forces to recover the Country of <hi>Quamgtung,</hi>

now having seen the Rebellions of the South, let us look a little back
on the Rebellions in the North against the <hi>Tartars</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>In these Northern parts the <hi>Chineses</hi> shewed their desire of Liberty as
much as they had done in the South; where the Commanders though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown,

marched out with five and twenty thousand men; which was no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Army if they had been as couragious, as numerous: He put out
a Proclamation, in which he challenged the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and threatened them
all extremities; and to the <hi>Chineses,</hi> he promised all liberty and freedom;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64464:158"/>
and upon these hopes, many Towns and Cities admitted him very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<hi>Sigan,</hi> the Metropolitan of the Country, was the only place able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

changed this Tyrannical Counsel. But he commanded under pain of death,

Language, <hi>Hoo Manzu,</hi> (as much as to say) <hi>O good Barbarians;</hi> for so the

this action, is unknown, and therefore I conclude, that these Northern
revolts produced no other effect, but the spoyl, Rapin and Plunder of all
those Quarters, as it had produced the like, in the Southern parts. The
<hi>Tartars</hi> having happily overcome all difficulties hitherto, fell into another
by their own insolency;<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> insolencies produced great danger.</note> from the year MDCXLIX. the Emperour of
the <hi>Tartars,</hi> being now grown up to mans Estate, desired to Marry the
Daughter of the King of <hi>Tayngu,</hi> who is Prince of the Western <hi>Tartars,</hi>
hoping by this match, to conserve the friendship of him, whose Forces he
feared; for this end he sent his uncle to him, who was King of <hi>Punang.</hi>
This Prince passed by the impregnable City of <hi>Tartung;</hi> which as it is the

The Women of this City are held the most beautifull of all <hi>China;</hi> and
therefore it happened, that some of the Embassadours followers did ravish
some of them; and also carried away by a Rape, a Person of quality, as she

carefully as if they had carried the richest Treasures they possessed, but in

with a new recruited Army of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> in which he obtained so noble,

trembling; for by this means victorious <hi>Kiangus</hi> had gathered so vast an
army, as he counted no lesse than a hundred and fortie thousand Horse, and
foure hundred thousand foot, all men having recourse to him, to defend
their Country against the <hi>Tartarian</hi> army; and therefore <hi>Amavangus,</hi>
Tutor to the Emperour, thinking it not fit to commit this businesse to any

the second is Red; the third is Black; the fourth is Yellow; and these

their Arms and Horses ready for any expedition;<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> Banners.</note> so as in one half hour they
all are ready; for they blow a Horn just in the fashion of that, which we

are ready in a moment to follow their Ensign, which a Horse-man carries
tied behind him, though commonly none but the Commander and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
knows whither they go: this profound secrecy in their exercise of
War, has often astonished the <hi>Chineses:</hi> for many times, when they thought
to oppose them in one part, they presently heard they were in another
Quarter: and it is no wonder they are so quick, for they never carrie with
them any Baggage, nor do they take care for Provision: for they feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with what they finde, yet commonly they eat Flesh, though half
rosted, or half boyled; if they find none, then they devour their Horses,
or Camels: but ever when they have leasure, they go a hunting all manner

bring up for that end,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> delight in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Field, they beat up all the wild Beasts into a circle, and drive them into so
narrow a compasse, as that they can take as many as they please, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
the rest. The earth covered with their Horse-cloath is their Bed, for
they care not for Houses, and Chambers; but if they be forced to dwell
in Houses, their Horses must lodge with them, and they must have many
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64464:159"/>
holes beaten in the Walls; but yet their Tents are most beautiful, which
they fix and remove with such Art and dexterity, as they never retard the
speedy march of an Army. Thus the <hi>Tartars</hi> train their Souldiers to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

                  <p>Out of all these Ensignes <hi>Amavangus</hi> chose the choicest men to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

to follow the three Royalets which he dispatched to the South, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to take as many out of the severall Garrisons through which
they passed, as might supply this defect. But although <hi>Amavangus</hi> had
so gallant, and such a flourishing Army, yet he never durst give Battail to
<hi>Kiangus,</hi> lest he might seem to expose the whole Empire of the <hi>Tartars</hi> to
the fortune of one Battail;<note place="margin">

                     </note> So that although <hi>Kiangus</hi> did frequently offer
him Battail; yet he ever refused to fight, expecting still to hear what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Western <hi>Tartars</hi> would make to his Proposition of his Nephews
Marriage; for he had sent a Legate to that <hi>Tartarian</hi> King with pretious
gifts, as well to demand his Daughter for the Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> as to
desire him to afford no succour to the Rebel <hi>Kiangus:</hi> The precious gifts
of Gold, of Silk, of Silver, and of Women, obtained whatsoever he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
and therefore <hi>Kiangus</hi> seeing himself deserted of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> that
he might provide as well as he could for his own affairs, returned to the
City <hi>Taitung,</hi> of which he soon repented himself, when it was too late;
for <hi>Amavangus</hi> calling in an innumerable number of Pezants, in the space
of three dayes, with an incredible diligence, cast up a Trench of ten
Leagues compasse, which he so fortified with Bulwarks and Ramparts,
that in a trice he blocked up that City. Then did <hi>Kiangus</hi> see his errour in
granting them leasure to draw their Trench, which he knew would debar
him from all manner of Provision. And therefore being enraged with
anger, as he was a man full of mettal, and a great Souldier, turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to his Souldiers, he said, <hi>If I must dye, I had rather dye by the Sword, than
by Famine;</hi> and upon this marched out presently to the Enemies Trench
with his whole Army. Here it was that both the parties fought most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately,
the one to seek his Passage, the other to hinder his Advance; so
as the fortune was various, and the victory doubtfull, untill an unlucky

His Souldiers seeing him dead, partly ran away, and partly submitted to
the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who received them with all courtesie and humanity; for they
had cause enough of joy, to see they had escaped the danger of losing the
Empire, and that they had conquered so formidable a Commander. But
yet they Plundered the City <hi>Taitung,</hi> and burned the City of <hi>Pucheu,</hi>
where the Church of the Christians also perished. From hence the <hi>Tartars</hi>
returned to <hi>Peking,</hi> where I saw them enter overladen with Riches and
triumphant Laurels; But <hi>Amavangus</hi> pursued his journey to the Western
<hi>Tartars;</hi> where he ratified his Nephew <hi>Xunchius</hi> his Marriage, and
brought back with him an infinite Company of Horse from the <hi>Tartars</hi> of
the Kingdome of <hi>Tanya.</hi>

                  <p>In the mean time, the three Royalets which went to the Southern
Kingdomes, to pacifie those unquiet Provinces, tooke their journey by
the descent of the River <hi>Guel;</hi> and when they passed through that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64464:160"/>
which the Emperour had given the <hi>Tartars</hi> to inhabit, and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
after he had expelled the <hi>Chineses</hi> for their Rebellion, most of these
Pezants, being wholly ignorant of tilling and manuring the ground, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
never been used to mannage a Spade or a Plough, but their Swords;
these men, I say, desired earnestly these Princes, that they might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
them in these Wars, and in their expeditions; Two of these Princes
rejected their Petitions; but the third called <hi>Kengus</hi> without any consent
or order from the Emperour, listed them amongst his own Troups; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they joyfully changed their rustical instruments into weapons
for war; when the Emperour heard of this proceeding, he sent word to <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
to dismiss them; but he pretended various excuses, and did neglect the
Emperours orders. He therfore commanded the supreme Governour of all
the Southern Quarters who resides ever at <hi>Nanking</hi> either to take <hi>Kengus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
or cause him to be slaine. He presently cast about how to compasse the
Emperours command with all secrecy, &amp; received the three Royolets with
all sorts of divertisements, of Comedies, Banquets, &amp; the like pleasures, as if
he had received no distastful order from the Emperour. And when the day
was come that they resolved to prosecute their journey by the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Kiang,</hi> the said Governour contrived his businesse so, as he met
them again in the River, and under pretence of taking his last farewell, he
entertained them nobly with a Royal feast, and in as Royall a Junck;
which in <hi>China</hi> are so magnificent, as they resemble rather some gilded
Palaces than floating Vessels. In this Princely Ship he entertained these
Princes in all jollity and mirth, untill their Army had advanced a good
way before, and then he declared to <hi>Kengus</hi> the Emperours order; who
presently promised all submission, and to returne to <hi>Nanking</hi> with him, if
he would onely permit him to go to his Ship, which expected him in the
River, to order some little affairs of his own; which being granted, he no
sooner got into his Ship,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Kengus</hi> hangs himself.</note> but, knowing he could not avoid death by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans hand, he chose rather to be his own executioner; and so hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself. Yet for all this, the supreme Governour in the Emperours
name, granted to this Mans Son the same Dignity and Province which
had been conferred upon the Father; and thus the three Royolets joyning
again, having passed <hi>Nanking</hi> and <hi>Kiangsi,</hi> came at length into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Quamtung,</hi> to carry on the War against the Emperour <hi>Iung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley;</hi>
and at their first entrance, they took many Cities, which durst not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the strength of their Armies; onely, the City of <hi>Quangcheu</hi> resolved
to try its fortune and strength.</p>
                  <p>This City of <hi>Quangcheu</hi> is a most rich and beautiful place, environed
with large waters; only the Northern Gate joines to the Continent, on all
other sides it is entrable only by boate. In this Town was the Son of the
Captive <hi>Iquon</hi> whom I mentioned before; besides, there was a strong
Garrison to defend it, and amongst others many fugitives from <hi>Macao,</hi>
who were content to serve the Emperour <hi>Iungly</hi> for great stipends; and by
reason the <hi>Tartars</hi> had neither Ships, nor skill to govern them, and that
the Town had both the one and the other, it is no wonder if they endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
almost a whole years Siege, having the Sea open for their relief; the
<hi>Tartars</hi> made many assaults, in which they lost many men, and were ever
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64464:160"/>
beaten back, and vigorously repelled. This courage of theirs, made the
<hi>Tartars</hi> fall upon a resolution of beating down the Town Walls, with
their great Cannon, which had such effect, as in fine they took it the 24. of
<hi>November</hi> MDCL. and because it was remarked that they gave to one of
the Prefects of the Town, the same Office he had before, it was suspected
it was delivered by Treason.<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Quang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the City, and the sackage endured from the 24. of <hi>November</hi> till the 5. of
<hi>December,</hi> in which they neither spared Man, Woman or Child; but all
whosoever came in their way were cruelly put to the Sword; nor was
there heard any other Speech; But, <hi>Kill, kill these barbarous Rebels;</hi> yet
they spared some Artificers to conserve the necessary Arts, as also some
strong and lusty men, such as they saw able to carry away the Pillage of
the City; but finally the 6 day of <hi>December</hi> came out an Edict, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
all further vexation, after they had killed a hundred thousand men,
besides all those that perished severall wayes during the Siege. After
this bloody Tragedy, all the Neighbouring Provinces sent voluntarily
their Legates to submit, demanding mercy, which they obtained by the
many rich presents which were offered. After this the Royalet marched
with his Army, against the City <hi>Chaoking,</hi> where the Emperour <hi>Iungley</hi>
held his Court; but he knowing himself far inferiour in Forces, and
unable to resist, fled away with his whole Army and Family, leaving the
City to the <hi>Tartars</hi> mercy.<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Iungly</hi> flyes.</note> But whither this Emperour fled, is yet whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and from thence I was commanded to go for <hi>Europe,</hi> by those whom

the adjoyning Province called <hi>Quangsi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to give the Reader a little touch how the <hi>Tartars</hi> stand affected
to Christianity; in the Metropolitan City of <hi>Quangcheu,</hi> which (as I
now related) was utterly destroyed, we had a stately Church, and there
was a venerable person, who had the care and superintendency of all the
Christians,<note place="margin">The Author of the Relation of <hi>China.</hi>
                     </note> whose name was <hi>Alvarus Semedo</hi> a Jesuit; this Man they took
&amp; tyed hand &amp; foot for many dayes, and threatned to kil him every houre,
unlesse he would deliver the Christians Treasures; but the poor man had no
Treasure to produce; so as he suffered much, till at length the King heating
of his case, took pitty of his venerable gray Heirs and comely Person, and
gave him not onely his life and liberty,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartars</hi> offer a Church to Christians.</note> but a Bible, and a Breviary, together
with a good summe of Money for an Almes; and finally a House to build a
Church for Christians; and this is lesse to be wondred at from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
heretofore he had been a Souldier under that famous <hi>Sun Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
whom I mentioned before, where he knew what belonged to
Christianity, and also had seen the Jesuits in his Camp, from whence he
fled to the <hi>Tartars.</hi> Nor is it onely this <hi>Tartar</hi> that favours us Christians,
but in a manner all the rest do love, honour, and esteem those Fathers,
and many have imbraced our Religion, nor do we doubt but many more
would follow their example, if we could enter <hi>Tartary,</hi> as now it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting,
where doubtlesse many great things may be performed, for the
reducing of that Nation to the Faith of Christ; and perchance God has
opened a way to the <hi>Tartars</hi> to enter <hi>China,</hi> to give Christianity a passage
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64464:161"/>
into <hi>Tartary,</hi> which hitherto to us hath been unknown and inaccessible.</p>
                  <p>About this time also they made War against the Kingdome of <hi>corea;</hi>
who of late years became also Tributary to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> upon condition
that they should still conserve their Hair and Habits:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Corea</hi> revolted from the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.</hi>
                     </note> but now the <hi>Tartars</hi>
would needs constrain them to conform themselves to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and therefore all that Kingdome revolted from the <hi>Tartars;</hi> but my
departure hindred me from knowing since what has passed.</p>
                  <p>But all these glorious victories were much eclipsed, by the sorrowfull
death of <hi>Amavangus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amavangus <hi>dyeth.</hi>
                     </note> which happened in the beginining of the year
MDCLI. He was a Man to whom the <hi>Tartars</hi> owe their Empire in <hi>China,</hi>
and such an one as whom both <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Chineses</hi> loved and feared, for
his prudence, Justice, humanity, and skill in Martial affairs. The death
of this Potentate did much trouble the Court; for the Brother to this Man
called <hi>Quingtus,</hi> would needs pretend to the Government of the Empire,
and of the young Emperour <hi>Xunchius;</hi> but both the <hi>Tartars</hi> &amp; the <hi>Chineses</hi>
resisted his claime, alledging, that, being of sixteen year old, he was able to
govern the Kingdom himself; &amp; in conformity to this opinion, all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
deposed the Ensignes of their Offices, refusing ever to receive them
from any, but from the young installed Emperour <hi>Xunchius.</hi> To which
Constancy the King <hi>Kuintus,</hi> Uncle to the Emperour, prudently yeelded,
lest he should exasperate the minds of many, and raise greater troubles
in the Empire.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot doubt, but the death of <hi>Amavangus,</hi> must needs endanger
the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Empire, and bring all their affairs into great disturbance; for
they will hardly find a Man so beloved, feared, and expert in all
Military Discipline and Government as he in effect shewed himself to be;
but time wil teach us, what will become of all, for since his death we have
no certainty of any relation.</p>
                  <p>Now let us turne the threed of our discourse as I promised here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and consider the fortune and success of the other Great Brigand, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Changhienchungus,</hi> to let the Reader understand how the <hi>Tartars</hi> did
invade, not onely the Mediterranean and Oriental parts, but also the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
Quarters of that vast Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>But before I begin to speak of this monster of nature, I must ingenious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confess,<note place="margin">Changhien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chungus <hi>a cruel Tyrant.</hi>
                     </note> I am both ashamed, and also touched with a kind of horrour,
to declare his villanies, both in respect they seem to exceed all belief, and
therefore I may perchance be held to write Fables; as also because it is no
grateful thing to make reflections on such Subjects; yet I may sincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
that I have in my hands a long relation of all his Acts, written by two
Religious persons, who were then in the Province of <hi>Suchuen</hi> to exercise
their Functions, which Country was the Theater of all his Brutalities,
which I shall relate; and because I judge these two persons to be of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted
Faith, I judge therefore that a mortal Man might arrive to this
pitch of wickedness and inhumane Cruelty. I therefore gathered out of
that relation, what I here relate; which is nothing else but a vast Masse of
such abominable Cruelty, as I doubt not even the most mildest Reader
wil take the Authour to be no Man but some horrid wild Beast, or rather, if
no more execrable name occurres, some Devill trans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vested in our humane
Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:64464:161"/>
This monster, like a wild Bear, entred into divers Provinces, filling all
with Rapin, Death, Fire and Sword, with all other imaginable miseries;
for he had a mind to destroy all, that so he might have no enemies, or leave
any alive that might revolt from him, but only content himself with his
own Souldiers; and oftentimes he spared not these. But the Province of
<hi>Suchuen,</hi> where he usurped the Title of a King was the chief Theater of
his barbarous crueltie; for after he had afflicted and vexed the Provinces
of <hi>Huquang</hi> and <hi>Honan,</hi> and part of that of <hi>Nanking</hi> and <hi>Kiangsi,</hi> he entred
the Province of <hi>Suchuen</hi> in the year MDCXLIV. and having taken the
principal Citie called <hi>Chingtu,</hi> in the heat of his fury he killed a King of
the <hi>Taimingian</hi> Race, which here had established his Court; as he hath done
also to seven other Grandees of the same family. These were the Preludes
of the Tragical Acts,<note place="margin">He kils divers Princes.</note> whose Sences I go about briefly to describe, that so
<hi>Europe</hi> may see, what a horrid and execrable thing an unbridled and armed
crueltie appears to be, when it furiously rageth in the darknesse of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie.</p>
                  <p>This Brigand had certain violent and suddain motions of furious cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and maxims drawn from the very bowels of vengeance its self; for if
he were never so little offended by another, or suspected another to be
offended with him, he presently commanded such to be massacred; and
having nothing in his mouth but murder and death, he often for one single
Mans fault destroy'd all the Family, respecting neither Children, nor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with Child; nay many times he cut off the whole Street where the
offender dwelled,<note place="margin">For one offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he puts all to death.</note> involving in the Slaughter, as well the innocents as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents.
It happened once he sent a man post into the Country of <hi>Xensi,</hi> who
being glad he was got out of the Tyrants hands, would not return; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
this imaginary injury, he destroyed all the Quarter of the Citie in
which he dwelt, and thought he much bridled his fiercenesse, that he did
not wholly extinguish all the Citie. To this I adde another unhumane Act,
about his hangman, whom it seems he loved above the rest, because he
was crueller; this man dying of a disease, he caused the Physician who had
given him Physick to be killed; and not content with this, he Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
one hundred more of that Profession to the Ghost of his deceased
Officer.</p>
                  <p>He was affable and sweet towards his Souldiers; he plaied, banquetted,
and feasted with them, conversing familiarly with them; and when they
had performed any Militarie Action, with honour and valour, he gave
them precious gifts of Silks and Monies; but yet many times he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
some of them to be cruelly put to death before him upon very small
cause, especially such as were of the Province of <hi>Suchuen</hi> where he raigned;
(whom he intirely hated, because he thought they did not rejoyce in his
Royal dignitie.) Insomuch as he hardly ever did any publick Action, which
though it began like a Comedie, yet had not in fine, the sad Catastrophe
of a Tragedie;<note place="margin">His hatred to the people of <hi>Suchuen.</hi>
                     </note> for if, walking out, he did but espie a Souldier ill clad, or
whose manner of Gate or walking was not so vigorous or Masculine as he
desired, he presently commanded him to be killed. He once gave a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
a piece of Silk, who complained to his fellows of the poornesse of the
piece, and being over-heard by a spie, (of which he had a great number)
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64464:162"/>
who presently acquainted him with what was said, he presently comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, and this whole Legion which were of two thousand men, to be
all Massacred.</p>
                  <p>He had in his Royal Citie some six hundred Prefects, or Judges, and
men belonging to the Law,<note place="margin">He cuts off a Legion for one mans fault. He kils many City Officers.</note> such as managed the principal Offices; and in
three years space there was hardly twentie left, having put all the rest to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
deaths for very slight causes; He caused a Sergeant Major which the
<hi>Chineses</hi> call <hi>Pingpu,</hi> to be flea'd alive, for having granted leave to a <hi>China</hi>
Philosopher, without special order, to retire a little to his Country House.
And whereas he had five hundred Eunuchs taken from the Princes of the
<hi>Taimingean</hi> Family, after he had put their Lords to death; he commanded
all these to be cruelly put to death; onely because one of them had presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to stile him,<note place="margin">And he killed also the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs.</note> not by the Title of a King, but by the bare name of
<hi>Changhienchungus,</hi> as if he then were no Theef.</p>
                  <p>Nor did he spare the Heathenish Priests, who sacrificed to their Idols.
These sort of men, before he came into this Country, having feignd many
crimes against the Priests, which preached the Faith of Christ, had raised
a bitter persecution against them; which God of his goodnesse did turn so
much to their good, as they had permission to teach and preach publickly
the Law of Christ. But after this Tyran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> came into the Countrie, the
chief of these Heathenish Priests was apprehended for some words let fall
against him, and in the presence of the Fathers, who by accident were then
at audience with the Tyrant, he was beheaded; And although they had
learned of Christ to do good for evill, yet knowing the phrenetical anger
and fury of this monster, who used to punish those that interceded, with
the punishment of the offender, they durst not make any motion for the
least favour. It is true, this cruel Beast loved these Fathers, and would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
converse with them, whom he experienced wise and learned, and he
would often call them to the Palace to entertain him in discourse; but they
knowing well his precipitous anger, went ever prepared for, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
death; and indeed they were thrice deputed to death; and a fourth time
escaped also by Gods particular providence, as we shall relate in time and
place. But he was not contented with the death of one of these same Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
Priests, but having got together about twentie thousand of the
same profession, he sent them all to hell, to visit their Masters whom they
had served. And then he would applaud himself, as if he had done a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Heroical Action, saying to them, <hi>These men would have taken away your
lives;<note place="margin">For one mans fault he kils twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</note> but Thiencheu,</hi> so they call God, which signifies the Lord of Heaven,
<hi>has sent me to revenge your cause, &amp; inflict due punishment upon these wretches.</hi>
He would often confer also with the Fathers of Christian Religion, and
that so properly, as a man would take him for a Christian. He praised, and
highly extolled the Religion of Christians, which he well understood,
partly by the conferences which he frequently had with the Fathers, and
partly by reading their books, which for the Instruction of Christians they
had writ in the <hi>China</hi> language; &amp; hath often promised to build a Church
to the God of Christians, worthy of his magnificence, when he once came
to be Emperour of <hi>China;</hi> and indeed all the works he erected were ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
splendid and magnificent; but he polluted them all with the blood of the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:64464:162"/>
Workmen; for if he found they had but committed the least errour, or the
least imperfection, he presently put them to death upon the place.</p>
                  <p>On the North part of the Country of <hi>Suchuen,</hi> where it confines with
the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi> lies the strong City called <hi>Nanchung,</hi> which though
it be seated in the County of <hi>Xensi,</hi>

                     </note> yet in respect, it is both so strong and
of so great an extent, it is held to be the Key of both the two Provinces.
The Tyrant endeavoured by all industry to make himself Master of this
important place, as being a convenient passage to the rest; wherefore in
the year MDCXLV. he levied a vast Army, consisting of one hundred
and fourscore thousand men, all Natives of the Countie of <hi>Suchuen,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those of his own, which had alwaies followed him. He sent before
this numerous Army, which besieged the Town a long time, but found so
rigorous resistance, that they began to be weary, and about fourtie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of those Souldiers of <hi>Suchuen</hi> revolted to the Prefects which govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the be-leagured Citie; by which means the Army was constrained to
return to the Tyrant, without any memorable Action: and he being en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with anger to see them retire, commanded all the rest of the Souldiers

Butchery lasted four daies; in which slaughter he commanded many of
them to have their skins pulled off, which he filling with straw, and sowing
on the head, commanded to be carried publickly and visibly into the
Towns where they were born, so to strike more terrour into the hearts of
the inhabitants; and after all this, yet he had such a malitious hatred against
this Country, that he never ceased to vex and torment it, even when it was
in a manner left desolate. Many unexpert persons, without head or guide,
did take Arms against him, but he quickly dispersed them, being wholly
unexperienced in Military Discipline; others that were wiser, leaving the
City, retired into the Mountains, which were in a manner the onely men
who escaped his fury.</p>
                  <p>After this he called all the Students of the Country to be examined
for their degrees, promising to give those honours, to whomsoever should
deserve them best; and the <hi>Chineses</hi> are so bewitched with the desire of
these dignities,<note place="margin">He kils all the Students.</note> that they did not conceive the perfidious Stratagem of
the Tyrant. There appeared therefore in the publick Hall deputed for
that Ceremony about eighteen thousand persons; all which he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Souldiers to massacre most barbarously, saying; These were the
people who by their cavilling sophisms, sollicited the people to rebellions.</p>
                  <p>I have a horrour to relate so many unhumane slaughters, and yet I see
my self over-whelmed with new ones; for what an addition is it to all his

and then to kill them? This was so resented by many, as they
rather chose to kill themselves, than to undergoe so infamous and publick
an opprobry to their honesty. I forbear to relate more of such detestable
and execrable examples, lest I offend the ears and minds of the Reader by
such abominations.</p>

Let us therefore suppresse these impurities, and passe to what happened
in the year MDCXLVI. when the <hi>Tartars</hi> entred into the Province of
<hi>Xensi</hi> to give him Battail, so as he was forced to go out to meet them, And,
to the end he might leave the Country behind him with more security,
he resolved to cut off all the inhabitants, (except those which inhabited
the North-East Quarters by which he was to passe, and therefore must
needs reserve these Creatures to assist and furnish his Army with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries;
and therefore he deferred their death to another time.) First
therefore he commanded all the Citizens of what quality or condition so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that did inhabit his Metropolitan City of <hi>Chingtu</hi> to be bound hand
and foot, which was done by a part of the Army, which he had called in;
and then riding about them, (which vast multitude is related to have been
above six hundred thousand Souls,) he viewed them all with lesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionthan
the cruellest Tygre would have done; whilest in the mean time,
these poor victims with lamentable crys,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>He</hi> kils 600000 <hi>in the City</hi> Chingtu.</note> which penetrated the very vault
of Heaven, and might have moved a heart composed of stone or Rock,
holding up their hands, begged of this outragious Tyrant to spare the
lives of his innocent people. He stood a while Pensive, like an astonished
and amazed Creature; so as it seemed to be an imperfect <hi>Crisis,</hi> wherein
humane nature struggled a little with those bowels, and that heart which
was composed of all cruelty; but presently returning to his beastly nature,
<hi>Kill, kill,</hi> saith he, <hi>and cut off all these Rebels,</hi> upon which words, they were
all massacred in one day out of the City Wals, in the presence of this bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
monster. Those Religious persons, which were there, the Fathers of
Christianity, resolved to make their addresses for the Tyrant to save their
converts lives; and though all men judged it a desperate attempt, yet they
obtained the lives of those they claimed. So as they distributed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at the City Gates, and as their Clients passed bound to the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
they mercifully unbound their Shakles, and rescued them from
death. By which occasion also they performed another acceptible Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to God, in Baptizing an infinite number of Children, which the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
willingly permitted, so as the horrid and execrable cruelty of this
Tyrant proved as advantagious to these little Angels, as <hi>Herods</hi> slaughter
did to the Blessed Innocent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>They write,<note place="margin">Many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Baptized.</note> that in this massacre there was so much blood spilt, as
made the great River of <hi>Kiang,</hi> which runs by the City, to increase and
swell visibly; and the dead Corps being cast into the River, and carried
downwards to the other Cities, did denounce unto them, that they were
to expect no better Treaty from this Tyrants hands. And it quickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
true, for he dispatched his Army to the rest of the Cities, and killed
all that he could lay hands on; and thus this Tyrant did bring that popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Province of <hi>Suchuen</hi> into a vast wildernesse. After this, he mustered
all his Souldiers in a Field, which in every City of <hi>China</hi> is deputed for
that end, and is called by the Natives <hi>Kioochang;</hi> in this place, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
himself thus unto them, <hi>I hope by your valour to obtain the Empire of
the world, when I have expelled the Tartars; but I desire to see you yet quicker
and nimbler than hitherto you have been; you all know, to free you from all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
and heavy luggage, how I sunk threescore Ships full of Silver in the River
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:64464:163"/>
of</hi> Kiang; <hi>which I can easily recover, to reward your pains and merits, when I
shall once have obtained the Empire;</hi> (he had indeed sunck the Ships, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Ship men, to conceal the place;) <hi>but there remaines yet a greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance,
which retards much our journey, and all our enterprises, which is
your Wives, which are a heavy burden to you all; Therefore now put on a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
resolution; There will not be wanting other exquisit Women, when we are
come to possesse the Empire; and although as Emperour I ought to have some
Prerogative, and make a difference betwixt you and my Royall person, yet I am
content in this, to give you all a leading example,<note place="margin">He kils all the Souldiers Wives.</note> which may serve as a President.</hi>
After this Speech, of three hundred handsome and beautiful Maids, which
he kept for his voluptuous pleasures, he onely reserved twenty to serve
his three Queens, and commanded all the rest to be killed upon the place.
The Souldiers presently followed the example and command of their
cruel Tyrant, and cut off the heads of innumerable innocent Women, as
if they had been their mortal enemies.</p>
                  <p>Having now no more men in the Province of <hi>Suchuen</hi> to put to death,
he turned his fury and hatred against the Cities, Houses and Palaces: for
whereas he had built himself a very stately and magnificent Palace in the
City of <hi>Chingtu,</hi> he consumed that, and with it, a great part of that noble
City with fire; besides he cut down all Trees and Woods, that they might
profit no man. And thus (as he said) having purged his Army, he match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on into the Province of <hi>Xensi</hi> to meet the <hi>Tartars,</hi> but as he marched,
if he found any man remaining alive, he commanded him to be killed.
And not content with all this, if he espied any Souldier which marched
either too far before, or too far behind, though the fault were never so
little, he killed him presently. He killed all his sick or weak Souldiers, that
they might be delivered (as he said) out of so miserable and ruined
a Country. I suppresse many more passages of his cruelty, because I will
hasten to the Catastrophe of this Tragedy.</p>
                  <p>He was no sooner entred into the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi> but one of the
Emperours Uncles meets him with five thousand <hi>Tartars,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He burned his Palace in the City of <hi>Ching<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,</hi>
                     </note> the Body of
the Army marching after him; five Horsemen are sent out before the
Army (as usually they do amongst the Tartaes;) who if they be well
received of the enemy, they take it as a sign of Peace and submission; but
if they receive any Act of hostility, then the Army marcheth up to sight.
These Horsemen were espied by the Tyrants Scouts; who presently
brought him Tydings of their approach. But he laughed at the news,
and jestingly asked them, If the <hi>Tartars</hi> had learned to fly. He
drove at that time, many persons bound before him, which he intended
to massacre, and amongst the rest two of the Jesuits, for asking leave
to returne into <hi>Suchuen,</hi> which was the Country they had undertaken
to convert to Christianity. But the suddain death of this Arch-brigand
delivered them all from the imminent danger; for at the same time came
in his chief Commanders, assuring him the <hi>Tartar</hi> was upon him; upon
which news, he being of a bold and couragious humour, burst out of
his Tent, and without either head-piece or brest-Plate, snatched up a
Lance, and went out with a few, to view the enemy. The foresaid five
<hi>Tartars</hi> presently assaulted the Tyrant; and the first Arrow was shot,

all Men; and who from the base condition of a raskally Theef, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to take the Sacred Title of King and Emperour. The head
being down, the <hi>Tartars</hi> easily seized on the body of his Army; many
of the Souldiers submitted to them, others were killed, others ran away;
and the poor inhabitants of the Province of <hi>Suchuen</hi> received the <hi>Tartars</hi>
as their Saviours.<note place="margin">The Province of <hi>Suchuen</hi> is made subject to the <hi>Tartars.</hi>

so, that he lost more Men in marching than in fighting; upon which
he was accused of great negligence in governing his Army; and being
of a generous nature, he thought he deserved high praise, but no blame,
and therefore he took his <hi>Tartarian</hi> Cap, and scornfully trampled
it upon the ground, (which is the greatest sign of indignation, which
they can expresse;) upon which fact he was committed to a Prison pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

But he scorned to be the first of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Family, which should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

in which year I was sent to <hi>Europe,</hi> by those that may command me.
In which relation if there be nothing else worthy of admiration, yet it
seems wonderfull to consider, that in seven years space they conquered
more ground, than an entire Army could have walked through in the

if I made a private relation, of publick use<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I resolved to draw out
this little ensuing Narration from those Letters written in severall years.</p>
                  <p>The Empire of <hi>China</hi> is how grown to a more fixed and setled Estate,
since the death of <hi>Amavangus</hi> Uncle to the Emperour: to whose expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in invading that Empire and Vigilance in conserving it, the <hi>Tartars</hi> owe
their happy successe.</p>
                  <p>But yet, the opinion framed of him after his death, was far different
from the authority and power he carried in his life; for no sooner was the
exercise of governing by his death devolved into the hands of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
called <hi>Xunchi;</hi> but that this Emperour, though a youth in years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his raign by the approbation of all estates and orders, with such matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of judgement, and councel, as he seemed to surpasse the gray and hoary
heads of his wisest Counsellors. He was no sooner enthroned, then he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
a strange ripenesse of judgement, and severity of Justice joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
for having discovered his Uncles wicked counsels and designs,
and traced the obscure track of his abhominable vices, which were hid du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his life: he did so much resent those detestable Acts, as he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his body to be digged up, and his magnificent Sepulchre to be beaten
down; which kind of punishment amongst the <hi>Chineses</hi> is held to be the
greatest that can be inflicted; being taught by their Religion, to carry all
veneration and respect to the tombs of dead persons. The Carcasse being
dragged out, they first beat it with Clubs, then they scourged it with
Rods; and finally, cutting off the head, they made it a spectacle to all cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
opprobies. Thus the splendour of his Tomb, was brought to dust;
and fortune paid him after his death, the disgrace she owed him in his life.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:64464:165"/>
He punished also all the Officers and Prefects, which were privie to his
councels; putting some to death, and depriving others of their dignities.
Amongst all which I find the fortune of General <hi>Fung</hi> to have been very
various: who though he be no Christian, yet being a singular friend, and
protector of our society, and particularly known to my self, I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
to hear him restored, to his place and dignity, after his discovered
innocency. In the mean time the Emperour <hi>Xunchius,</hi> growing up to mans
estate, and solicitous to propagate his honour to his posterity, resolved to
accomplish his long intended Marriage with the Daughter to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the Occidental <hi>Tartars:</hi> In which action, the <hi>Tartars</hi> imitate the
<hi>European</hi> custom; for they take a Lady of some like illustrious blood or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent;
But the Emperours of <hi>China</hi> seem little to value the nobility of blood,
but select the pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if she be but graced with beauty; In so much, as the Wife to the late
Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> was Daughter to a man, that got his living by making
straw Shoos. So King <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>asuerus</hi> raised a poor Captive maid to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
with him in his Royal Throne: which kind of custom happily the
<hi>Chineses</hi> drew from the <hi>Persians,</hi> or the <hi>Persians</hi> from them. But to return
to the subject that caused this little digression. The Emperours Wedding
was performed with a Pomp and splendor proportionable to such an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
nor was there any magnificence wanting on the Spouses part; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fashion of the Nation, she came accompanied with whole
Armies of men, and so many Troops of Horse, as they seemed innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
nature seeming to have framed the riches of the <hi>Tartars</hi> more for warlike
affairs, than for pleasure. Nor is this infinit multitude of Horse incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
for I my self have seen eighty thousand Horse, all at one time, sent
as a present from the Occidental <hi>Tartars</hi> to the King of <hi>China.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which boundlesse power of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> as it cannot be contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
any limits, so also it hath lately broke out into the Province of <hi>Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tung,</hi>
which they have wholly subdued; and out of that, like an impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Torrent, they ran into the Province of <hi>Quangsi;</hi> which they likewise
have conquered to their Empire. So as the King of <hi>China</hi> called <hi>Iungley,</hi>
with his chief favourit the Eunuch, called <hi>Pang Achileus,</hi> who profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
Christianity, were feign to fly to the Confines of <hi>Tunking,</hi> being in a
manner excluded the whole Empire. In so much as a friend of mine
writes out of the Province of <hi>Fokien,</hi> that the King <hi>Iungley</hi> fearing to fall
into the <hi>Tartars</hi> hands, was feign to leave the Land, and fly to Sea. Neither
have we any news of our Father <hi>Andrew Xaverius Koffler</hi> who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Court of King <hi>Iungley,</hi> having had the happinesse to have Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
his Queen, his Sonne, and his Mother, with many others of that
Court.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, whilst one <hi>Cung,</hi> a Royolet amongst the <hi>Tartars,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
the Province of <hi>Quangsi,</hi> the <hi>Colaus,</hi> who was Governour of the
Country, and a Christian, fell into the Enemies hands; and the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
hoping by rewards and promises of dignities, to win the submission of this
so gallant a man, and so eminent a Philosopher, abstained three daies
from any cruelty, or ill usage toward him; But he scorned to prefer his
life before his allegance and fidelity to his King; and therefore lost his
head.</p>

                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:64464:165"/>
But yet, this generous Action was admired and honoured by those bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Souls, who presently erected a magnificent Tomb, in memory of so
honourable an Act; for although the <hi>Tartars</hi> sollicit the <hi>Chineses</hi> to revolt
from their Prince, yet they honour and praise such as shew themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to him; And this memorial of him, I owe as well to the singular
friendship he was pleased to contract with me, as also to his eminent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
of which I my self &amp; the whole Church of Christians in <hi>China,</hi> were
both Spectators and Admirers, for the space of twenty years. He was Born
in the Province of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> in the City <hi>Changcho,</hi> being called <hi>Kiu Thomas,</hi>
a Name most worthy of eternal Memory.</p>
                  <p>During the saccage of these Provinces, news arrives from the Country
of <hi>Suchuen,</hi> (which the notorious Brigand called <hi>Changhienchungus,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for his strange cruelty and abhominable villanies, had so wasted,)
that it begins again to be shaken with severall tempests of War; &amp; though
he seemed to be quite destroyed in the last Battails, yet from thence
doth appear again new trouble and vexation to the Empire.</p>
                  <p>The Province of <hi>Fokien</hi> also begins to grone under the same miserable
condition of War; for the Reverend Father <hi>Peter Canevary</hi> Native of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua,</hi>
writes out of the City <hi>Changcheu,</hi> which was besieged the 30. of <hi>March
1652.</hi> that <hi>Quesingus,</hi> having made a descent from his Ships into that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
hath overrun the whole Country, taken some Cities and Towns, and
carried on the War with great terrour to the Inhabitants. Insomuch as the
<hi>Tartarian</hi> Commanders keepe themselves, and their Army in their Forts,
and other places of strength, not daring to appear in the field to oppose
him; but yet he said they expected new forces and Succours from <hi>Peking;</hi>
by which they doubt not, but quickly to subdue him.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Quesingus,</hi> who now vexeth this Province of <hi>Fokien,</hi> is Son to the
famous Pyrate <hi>Iquon</hi> or <hi>Chinchilungo</hi> whom the <hi>Tartars</hi> imprisoned by a
slight, as I recounted to you in my former History.</p>
                  <p>And to let you know what I further heard from some passengers of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
who in the month of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1653. were cast, in a Ship of <hi>China,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coasts of an Island called <hi>New Holland;</hi> whither I had been brought
before by their Barks, and Souldiers, as their Prisoner; These men rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that a great Army of <hi>Tartars</hi> was arrived, to subdue <hi>Quesingus;</hi> whose
Commander thought it fit to joyn Art to his Force; and therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a handfull of men, to charge the <hi>Chinese</hi> Army, and presently by
feigning flight, to retire to more advantageous and surer places. In the
mean time, he had placed a number of Horse in a deep valley behind a
Mountain, towards which Quarters the fugitive Troops retired. This
flight gave courage to the <hi>Chinese,</hi> and the desire of victory, made them
venture so far from the River <hi>Chang,</hi> where their ships lay at Anchor, as
they found themselves environed by the <hi>Tartars</hi> Army. This desperate
condition which excluded the <hi>Chineses,</hi> from returning to their Ships,
caused a very great, and bloody slaughter, in which there perished above
80000 of the <hi>Chineses</hi> Army; Whilst <hi>Quesingus</hi> a spectator of this sad acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the Mast of his Ships, as they relate, was heard to say, that he
would once more try his fortune against the <hi>Tartars;</hi> but if she proved
again adverse unto him, he then would submit, and shave his Hair, like a
<hi>Tartar.</hi>

Concerning the present state of Christian Religion, being at <hi>Brussels</hi> this
last <hi>Iunse,</hi> in the year 1654. I received letters from <hi>China;</hi> in which they
gave me notice, that the Father Jesuits, were very favourably treated by
the <hi>Tartars;</hi> yea better than before; that they permit free exercise of the
Christian Catholick Religion, through all their Kingdoms, granting them
leave not onely to enjoy their ancient Churches, but also liberally contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
to build new ones; so, by the goodnesse of God, that which enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged
others, proveth gain to them. But I reserve all particulars to a
