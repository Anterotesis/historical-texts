            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

if alſo it wold haue lyked them to haue taken that labour: yet I
truſt I haue ſo done, that it may be comforth to the readers &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rers / 
or at the leſte: I haue gyuen occaſion to ordre to amend and
performe that I rudely and barbarouſly, ſet forward. Surely (my
lorde) the chyefe cauſe of this my labour was: for that I thought
this boke ſhulde be moche profytable to the readers and edefyeng
to all that wolde diligently hear it, And to ſay the treuth: I know
no thynge more comfortable to man, For amonges all the exercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that helpe the ſpirite to obteyne the loue of god / and ſpecially
to hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wolde begyn &amp; vſe a ſpiritual lyfe: no thynge is thought
always more frutful, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the continnal meditacion of the paſſion
of our lorde god Ieſus Chriſt, for the exercyſes of all other ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
meditacions may be reduced and brought vnto this. As by
an example, If a man deſyre to bewayll and weape for his vices
and ſynnes for his vnkyndnes and vilenes / if he couit to purge &amp;
amend his negligence &amp; defautes: he ſhall fynde none more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and redy meane to pricke hym forwarde to his intent: than
to remembre the moſt innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t death and paſſion of his redeamer:
that is to conſyder what bitter paynes he ſuffred for man: to ſpare
and kepe man from payne eternall wherafter Iuſtice he ſhulde
haue rather dampned man for his ſynnes, And here man may ſee
both the Iuſtice and alſo the mercy of god. Man may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyder in
hym ſelfe the great mercy of god: in that god wold forgyue and ꝑ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don
hym of his ſynnes. He may alſo perceiue the iuſtice of god: in
his owne ſynnes, whiche god dyd correcte &amp; punyſſhe accordyng
to iuſtice in hym ſelfe, bycauſe he wold nat ſuffre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnpuniſhed,
And thus in this meditacion man may fynde how to weape and
mourne for his ſynnes: for the which the ſon of god was bet / wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyd
and crucified, and all that god ſuffred: to cure man of his ſyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
&amp; kepe hym from eternall payne. Here may alſo man bewayle
<pb facs="tcp:8175:3"/>
his owne vnkyndnes, conſyderyng how vnkyndly he rendreth to
ſo faythfull a louer: ſo many yuell dedes contrary to goddes plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure,
and alſo dayly contemptes and deſpyſynges: for his tendre
loue and kyndnes and for his manyfolde gyftes which man day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receyueth of hym. Morouer this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templacion of the death of
Chriſt indureth man both to hope and to fear, wherby he may be
releaued of two temptacyons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or if the enormitie of his ſynnes
moue any man to diſpaire: he hathe here in this exerciſe wherby
to put away his ſynnes, and to make ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for them, he hath
here wherof to redeme hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blode &amp; deth of his lorde god,
&amp; therfore he nede nat to feare his ſynnes, if he ſo ordre hym ſelfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
he dye with Chriſt, dye (I ſay) from ſynne and ryſe in a new lyfe.
And on the other parte, it man be vexed by preſumpcion or vayne
lyghtnes and myrth without the fear of god: he hath here how to
abate his vayne myrth, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyderyng how that heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſhyt from
the moſte holy frendes of god by many yeres ye aboue .iiii. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
yeres, and how that the glory of god was denyed to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or at
the leaſt differred, by ſo many yeres vnto the tyme that our lorde
and ſauiour Ieſus whiche neuer dyd ſynne: ſuffred death for our
ſynne, ſo that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may come to that glory but by payne, &amp; thus
ſhall mannes vayne myrth be put downe. If peraduenture man
be dull and ſlouthfull to all goodnes: where ſhall he haue a more
ſpedy remedy to pricke forwarde his dulnes: than to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſydre how
his lorde god moſte pure &amp; innocent man, ſuffred ſo greuouſe pay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
for hym. Some man wold peraduenture exerciſe him ſelfe in
his owne knowlege and ſo to come to meknes. But I pray you
where ſhall he haue a better occaſion therunto, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ponder and
way the difformite and great difference of his owne ſtudy and la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour
and ſhortly the ordre of his hole lyfe: and of the labour &amp; lyfe
of Ieſus Chriſt, that is, remembre man howe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie thy lyfe is
to his wyl &amp; p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceptes / how vnlike to his vertues / how farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his
enſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how frayle thou art &amp; redy to fal, how vnſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
in all thy good purpoſes, how vnredy or rather loth to folowe
thy lorde, howe vnapte to all goodnes, As euery man may dayly
ſe in hym ſelfe. Forthermore, if ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold be enflamed to loue god
where may he haue better help than by this exerciſe, for if it be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to rendre loue for loue, and the loue of god was neuer more
openly ſhewed to man than in his redemption, that is in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and death of our redeamer Chriſt Ieſus: it is than manifeſt
<pb facs="tcp:8175:3"/>
that by this remembraunce of his paſſion: a man is moſte ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
excited and moued to loue god. And if man deſyre to be pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
forward in that loue: let hym remembre the benefites of god
which be as ſignes &amp; tokens of his loue, And theſe benefites moſt
euidently appere in his paſſion, as ye ſhall more clerely ſe in this
boke. At laſt, if man deſyre that all his lyfe be continuall and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petuall
prayer / and that he wold haue his herte euer lyfted vp to
god, and his deuotion or feruour euer renewed: he ſhal neuer get
it more eaſly than by the remembraunce of the lyfe and paſſion of
his lorde god, for there he may haue in euery worde / acte / behaui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>our
and paine that Chriſt ſpake / dyd / vſed / and ſuffred: how to be
compuncte and ſory in hert / &amp; how to be conforted in ſpirite. For
in the conſyderation of them, now he may wepe by compaſſion,
Now by gyuyng thankes: he may haue ſwete affections, Nowe
he may deſyre to be confourmed vnto hym, and to his wyl, Now
he may labour and wyſſhe to be holly transfourmed into hym.
Thus may man go from one exerciſe vnto an other to auoyde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſnes / 
and ſo euer to be i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prayer. And ſhortly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, there
is no kynde of ſpirituall exerciſe: but that it may be founde in the
lyfe &amp; paſſion of Chriſt, or els by moſte pleantuouſe fruyte it may
be reduced and applied to it. And this ſhall better appere in the
fyrſt parte of this boke the thyrde ꝑtycle. Nowe my lorde I haue

that Abraham dyd gyue that mooſte tender calfe to the thre
men to eate: doeth ſignifie that god the father of heuyn, dyd giue
his onely begotten ſonne, mooſt tender and mooſt innocent, and
full of all vertues and grace, to the dethe of the croſſe for our ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
And that thre men dyd fede therof, doeth ſignifie that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
trinitie, the father, the ſonne, and the holy gooſt were fed and
ſatiſfied for our tranſgreſſion by the paſſion of Chriſte: whiche
before that paſſion were hungry and redy to take vengeaunce / &amp;
to punyſſhe vs for our ſynnes. And here now we may ſe the great
ſwetenes and pleaſaunt confort of this figure. Here by Abraham
is vnderſtanded god the father / and by the mooſt tender calfe, is
ſignified the ſonne of god / and by theſe thre men, is ſignified the
holy trinitie / and yet the father and the ſonne be nat dyuers god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:
but one god. For though they be diſtincte perſons, and eche
of them is god: yet the thre perſones ben but one god in trinitie
of perſones. And ſo I ſay, in this figure appereth the meruelouſe
and ineſtimable ſwetenes that is gyuen vnto the ſoule that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
ſercheth this figure. For where as god in hym ſelfe was
hungry and deſirouſe to do iuſtice vpon vs for our ſynnes: he of
his infinite benignitie and goodnes, dyd and ſhewed that iuſtice
<pb n="xxxiiii" facs="tcp:8175:42"/>
into hym ſelfe, or vpon hym ſelfe / for els ſurely that iudgement of
iuſtice had deuoured &amp; diſtroyed vs / yf it had fallen vpon vs / for
there was no pure man that might ſaciate and ſatiſfie that hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gry
appetite of god: but onely the ſonne of god and man / that mooſt
tender calfe, whom god the father dyd make redy to meate. That
is, he put hym to ſuffre all affliction, diſpiſinges, mockes, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges,
and mooſt cruell dethe: to ſatiſfie his hungry appetite / 
for the great iniury and inobedience that we dyd vnto god. What
is that? Bicauſe we offended hym: ſhuld he ſo iudge &amp; conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pne
him ſelf / &amp; ſo ſuffre paine for our ſynne? He was offended by vs / &amp;
that nat withſtandyng, he was iudged by vs, in vs, and for vs.
And ſo Chriſte, beynge one perſon in two natures / that is, bothe
god and man. He was offended in his godly nature, as god / and
iudged or condempned for our ſynnes in his manhode: So that
the godhede was offended / and he in his manhode ſuffered. And
bycauſe in one perſone he was bothe god and man: therefore we
may truely ſay that we dyd offende hym / and yet he ſuffred for vs / 
and ſo he was bothe offended, and alſo iudged and condempned.
And that is more to be marueiled / after the dethe of this calfe / the
ſonne of god, where as we were worthy to want all his confort &amp;
goodnes / for aſmuche as we had condempned hym and put hym
to moſt ſhamefull dethe: this mooſt benigne and mercifull lorde,

                  <p>Wherefore in all theſe thynges, his herte is onely pleaſed in that,

whan ſo euer any temporall buſynes is exercyſed in that temple:
it is a greate ſynne &amp; dyſorder. For the creature is put in the place

               <p>The ſeconde is, the inordinate vſe of temporall goodes, &amp; thin-circumſpecte

great agony / and therfore he prolonged his prayer. And in this
prayer for his great agony: his ſwet was as droppes of bloode
runnynge downe from his body into the erthe. Here do our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
<pb facs="tcp:8175:70"/>
ſay, that whan our lorde Ieſus Chriſte dyd ſo prolong his
prayer: his moſt holy hert was greatly enflamed / &amp; ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all his hole body moſt holy &amp; moſt innocent. In ſo moche, that
thrughe that greate feruour of prayer, and his exceſſyue loue and
mooſt feruent deſyre that he had to ſuffre and to dye for our helth.
And of the other parte, thrugh the vehement angwyſſh and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that he had in his manhode in the remembraunce of his mooſt
greuouſe paynes and ſhamefull dethe that he ſhulde ſuffre / and
thrugh the ſtronge reluctacion and ſtryuynge of ſenſualitie, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
abhorrynge that dethe, and therfore myghtely fyghtynge
agaynſt it: for theſe cauſes (I ſay) the poorys of his body were
open, and ſo flowed out the blood for his ſwet. That vehement
angwyſſhe and exceſſyue loue conſtreyned the bloode to cum out
of the vaynes agaynſt nature (as Bede ſayeth) in ſo moche that
many droppes of blood ranne downe by his clothes and fell vpon
the erthe.<note place="margin">Suꝑ Luca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> li. 6. ca. 89.</note> The loue of god in the herte of Chriſte, dyd ouercum
in that agony his natural feare and the feare of his manhode / and
ſo the bloode of Chriſte ſo quyckened and conforted by this loue:
was ſtyrred and moued, as yf it wolde haue cum all furthe of the
body at that tyme, thrugh that exceſſyue loue / as yf he wolde nat
or might nat haue abyden the tyme of his dethe appointed whan
all that blood ſhulde be vtterly ſheddyd. And ſo (I ſay) thrughe
this vehement loue: the droppes of blood dyd iſſue and fall from
the vaynes of his body. And as the inwarde cauſe of ſwet (after
naturall phiſiciens) is the naturall hete, diſſoluynge that is hote
and moyſt in the bodye: ſo the ſupernaturall cauſe of this bloody
ſwet myght be the feruent hete and burnynge of his exceſſyue loue
redowndyng from the herte of Chriſte into al his hole body there
diſſoluynge the vaporouſe moiſture. Phiſiciens alſo ſay, that
it is poſſible that a man may ſwet naturally thrugh the veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of loue. In lyke maner, as our doctours ſay, Chriſte ſwet blood
aboue nature thrugh his vehement feruour of charitie / for tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
more he approched to his dethe: the more he burned in loue for
the feruente deſyre of our helthe. O, how bytter and paynefull
was this dethe of Chriſte in it ſelfe: ſythe the onely imaginacion
therof dyd ſo greatly chaunge thorder of nature: for it drew from
all the partes of his bodye, droppes of bloode: as yf he had ſwet / 
whiche blody ſwet ſhulde ſignifie and note to vs the helthe of his
miſticall body / that is, the catholicall chyrch. Hereto ſayth ſaint
Bernarde: By the erthe moiſted with the bloody ſwet of Chriſt:
is ſignified that erthely men ſhulde be redemyd by the bloode of
<pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:8175:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſte. By the whiche blood alſo he ſhulde reduce vnto lyfe, all
the worlde ded in ſynne. Woo be to that wretchyd hert, that wyll
nat be moiſted and made ſofte with this blood or ſwet. Beholde
thou wretche the great tribulacion of this moſt mylde, gentyll, &amp;
louynge herte, in what angwyſſh it was: whan all his bodye on
euery parte ſwet blood. O thou my ſtony herte, quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and breke in pecys, and moyſt thyne iyen with blody teres / 
for as thou mayſt ſe, thy creatour and maker is all wet in bloode
for the / and that with ſuche plenty: that it ranne downe vpon the
erthe. And ſurely, his body outwardly wolde neuer haue bene ſo
wet with bloode: yf his herte inwardly had nat ben broken with
ſorowe and heuyneſſe. Therefore the prophete ſayeth in the
perſone of Chriſte:<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. It Hier. 23. B.</note> 
                  <hi>Contritum eſt cor meum in meipſo.</hi> My herte
is broken within me. The herte of our mooſte louynge Ieſus
thus inwardly broken or cut: the outwarde ſkynne alſo was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken / 
ſo that his blood myght abundantly flow out vpon the erthe.
And this bloody ſwette was very naturall and true bloode of the
mooſt pureſt body of Chriſte. But as we ſayd before, it was nat
ſhed naturally / for it is agaynſt nature, to ſwet blood.

                  <hi>Amice, non facſo tibi iniuriam.</hi> O
frende, I do vnto the non iniurie or wronge. And here now at

And ſo wolde Chriſte haue don (after all doctours) yf he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned

But this is your hour and tyme graunted vnto you to take

For ſythe it is paynfull to euery man that is put in captiuitie / for
as moche as thereby his libertie is taken from hym, and he put in

he is in bondage and thraldome. Alſo his libertie of operacion is

               <p>For theſe cauſes (as ye may perceyue) it is moche paynefull for a

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſyxt article, is the byndynge of our lorde. For the
Iues, after that they had taken Chriſte: they bounde
hym ſo harde and ſtrayte: that (after ſaynt Anſelme)
the bloode ſprange out of euery fynger ende vnder the
nayles. They bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de his bleſſyd handes behynd hym / 
they caſt hym downe vppon the erthe, as he before had caſt them
downe by his godly power. Moreouer they dyd trede vpon his

hym by the necke and throte: that he was nygh ſtrangled, yf god
had nat preſerued hym for a tyme, that he ſhulde ſuffre more and
greater paynes after this tyme. They bounde hym for thre cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Fyrſte, that he ſhulde nat eſcape theyr handes. For Iudas
bad them holde hym faſt, and lede hym warely. Secondely,
for they intendyd to ſley hym. For it was a cuſtome amonges the
Iues, that whom they iudged worthy dethe: he ſhulde be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
and ſo preſented to the preſident and iudge. Thyrdly, he wold
be bounde for a miſterie, for bycauſe he cam to lawſe and delyuer
them that were bounde with the bondes of ſynne, and alſo thoſe
that were bounde as pryſoners in Limbo patrum: therefore he
wolde be wylfully bounde as a thefe, thoughe he were all inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and without ſpot of ſynne. Our fyrſt father Adam dyd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myt
theft, what tyme he ate of thapple that was forbydden hym / 
for whoſe ſyn all mankynde was taken and holden by the deuyll
as theuys. For whoſe ſatiſfaction Ieſus Chriſt wolde be taken
as a thefe / though in hym ſelfe he be incomprehenſible. Alſo he
wolde be bounde: whiche cam to lawſe them that were bounde.</p>
               <p>And they bounde hym with thre ropes or bondes. One about his
handes. The ſeconde, about his necke. And ſum do ſay that that
was a chayne of yron. And the thyrde, about his myddell. And
theſe be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repreſented in the ornamentes of the preeſt at his maſſe.</p>
               <p>The fyrſte, by the maniple vpon his arme. The ſeconde, by the
ſtole in his necke. And the thyrde by the gyrdell. O my mooſt
dere beloued Ieſu, the very true vyne. Who is he that doeth nat
ſe and conſyder the bondes wherewith this oure vyne tree was
bounde? He was bounde with ſeuen bondes. The fyrſte (ſayeth
ſaynt Bernarde) I trow, was his obedience, whereby he was
<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:8175:76"/>
obedient to his father, vnto the death of the croſſe. He dyd alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey

                  <hi>Venit Nazareth: et erat ſubditus illis.</hi> Ieſus

the houſe of Annas.<note place="margin">Capi. 18. E.</note> As it is in the goſpell of Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And this ledynge was moche laborouſe and payne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to Chriſte. Alſo it was rebukefull and violent.
It was violent: for he was led with a great cumpanye of armed
men and theyr captayne with them. It was alſo rebukefull to
Chriſte, for he was led with his handes bounde as a thefe or an
euyll perſone.<note place="margin">Ioh. 18. C.</note> And ſo the Iues ſayde to Pilate: Yf this perſone

we wolde nat haue delyuered hym to thy handes and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.
This ledynge was alſo laborouſe, paynfull, and ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to hym. And that bothe to the herte inwardely, and alſo to the

ſo many rebukes and reprouynges, bothe in worde and in dede,
as thoſe mooſte cruell Iues dyd vnto Chriſte at that tyme &amp; le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge.
That ledyng was alſo paynfull to his body. For though
he wente wylfully with them: yet they drewe hym with a rope,
they thruſt hym &amp; droue hym forwarde / and oft tymes they thruſt
hym downe and ranne ouer hym / and ſo drewe hym thorughe the

ſayd: I am nat. The wordes of this mayden myght ſeme more to
be ſpoken for compaſſyon of Chriſte, and to admonyſſhe Petre to
bewarre of ſuche compeigney as was then within in the courte,
rather then to betraye Petre, for ſhe ſe hym verye fearfull, he was
ſo afrayed that he denyed Chriſt to be his maiſter. The miniſtres
and ſeruauntes ſtode at the coolys or fyre and warmed themſelf,
and Peter ſtode amonges them. And then a nother mayden ſaid:
This felawe was with Ieſu, and the compeigney that was there
ſayd / truely he is one of them,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. G</note> for he is a Galilee, that is a man of

myght no longer abyde in derknes, for the lyght of the mercyes

after this had euer in vſe &amp; cuſtome to ſtande in prayer and wepe
from the fyrſt cocke crawe: vnto the ſonne ryſynge, in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of his thryſe denyenge of Chriſte. Alſo he bare alwaye
with hym a ſudarie, to wype awaye the teares that continually
fell from his eyen for his ſynne. And for the ſame ſynne he wepte
ſo moche, that his face ſeamed to be aduſte and burned with the
teares. And therfore he deſerued to haue forgyuenes both of his
ſynne &amp; of the payne due for his ſynne. This threfolde negation
of Petre, was no lytel payne vnto our ſauiour Ieſu, for it greued
hym very moche to heare &amp; ſe howe his owne chefe apoſtle, whom
he had ordred to be called a ſtone, wherupon he wolde founde and
buylde his churche, to ſe hym (I ſay) ſo openly and ſo ſhamefully
thryſe to denye his own mayſter Chriſt, &amp; that at the voyce of one
mayden or woman. And note here that as a woman was the firſt
<pb facs="tcp:8175:82"/>
mouer of man vnto ſynne, ſo a woman compelled the firſt prynce
and prelate of Chriſtes churche to denye Chriſte openly, ſo that
by this exemple the infirmite of Petre myght more clerely appere
to hym ſelfe. And this is it that we ſayde in the .ix. article, that
Chriſt ſuffred in the houſe of Annas, the denyeng of Petre which
was ſhamefull to Petre and moche paynfull to Chriſte, and that
for .vi. cauſes. Fyrſte for the multitude of people that were then
preſent, for he denyed Chriſte in the byſſhopes palace, where as
was at that tyme, moche people gathered, and therfore this ſynne
was moche more greuous, than if it had ben done in a pryuate
and ſecrete place. Secondly, it was the more ſhamefull to Petre / 
for his ſlaknes in folowynge Chriſte, for he folowed a farre of / 
thoughe before he had ſpoken and made his boſte that he wolde
rather dye then denye hym. The thyrde cauſe was the vylenes of
the perſone that moued the queſtion vnto Petre, for it was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

which was ſo moche the more to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rebuke of Petre, that he wolde
denye his lorde god, at theyr queſtions. Fourthly for Petre ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and lyghtly denyed Chriſt at one worde of a pore and vyle ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt.

The ſeconde was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſpecte and beholdynge of Chriſte. And the
thyrde was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remembraunce of the wordes that our lorde ſayde
to Petre at the ſupper the ſame nyght, that was that Petre ſhulde
denye Chriſt thryſe that nyght before the cocke crawe. Our lorde
ſuffred Petre to fall for our example, that no man ſhuld preſume
of hym ſelfe, ſeynge that the prynce of thapoſtles dyd fall. And
alſo that no man ſhuld diſpeyre, ſyth that Petre after ſo greuous

Ieſus kepte ſilence to them that were not worthy his anſwere:
the more Cayphas the biſſhop beynge in greate furye / prouoked

This adiuracyon Cayphas ſpake of a falſe craftie and diſceytful
mynde and not for to knowe the truthe.<note place="margin">Suꝑ Mat. 26.</note> And therfore ſaynt Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom
ſayth: Cayphas dyd adiure Chriſt by the lyuynge god, that
for the reuerence of the name of god: he ſhulde anſwere and ſpeke

bounde hym as a thefe worthy deth. And now they examyn hym
not to knowe the truth / but rather to fynd ſome occaſion in hym
wherby they myghte accuſe hym vnto Pylate as worthy death.
And this adiuracyon was a greuous ſynne in Caiphas, for it per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyneth
not to the inferiour ſo to coniure the ſuperiour without
a reaſonable cauſe / to ſay the treuthe. This notwithſtandynge
Chriſte for the reuerence of the name of god wherwith he was

                  <p>OF this article we maye lerne howe we ſhulde be crucified
with Chriſte bitwixt two theues. For as Ieſus was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
and .ii. theues with hym: ſo morally our ſpirite noted by
Chriſt: ſhuld be crucifyed bitwixt .ii. theues y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the fleſſhe &amp; the
worlde. The fleſſhe is to be crucifyed: as the thefe on the right
ſyde.<note place="margin">Gala. 5. D.</note> And herunto ſaynt Paule ſayth: <hi>Qui Chriſti ſunt: carnem
ſuam crucifixerunt cum viciis:</hi> They that be verye true chriſtians
haue crucified and ſubdued theyr fleſſhe and ſenſualitie with all
vyces. The worlde is to be crucified as the thefe on the left hand.
And therfore ſaynt Paule ſayth:<note place="margin">Gal. 6. D.</note> 
                     <hi>Nichi mundus crucifixus eſt: et
ego mundo:</hi> The worlde is crucifyed to me and I to the worlde.
Theſe theues thus crucified in vs: our ſpirite is crucified with
Chriſte in the myddle,<note place="margin">Ibidem. cap. 2. D.</note> ſo that it maye ſaye with ſaynte Paule:
<hi>Chriſto confixus ſum cruci: viuo autem: iam non ego: viuit vero in

myne own lyfe: for Chriſt liueth in me: and in his life I do liue.
And here note that the left thefe was crucified: but not ſaued / for
he continued in his infidelitie. So the worlde though he be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed:
yet he is not ſaued: for he remayneth in his miſerie and
wretchednes. The fleſſhe is crucified and ſaued with the ſpirite,
for after the generall reſurreccyon: it ſhalbe glorified with the
ſoule.<note place="margin">Luc. 23. F.</note> And therfore Chriſte ſayde to the ryghte thefe: <hi>Hodie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum
eris in paradiſo:</hi> This day thou ſhalbe with me in glorie.
And farthermore note here that the croſſe wherupon our fleſſhe
is crucifyed: is the rigor of diſcipline or ſharpnes of penaunce,
and this croſſe hath .iiii. branches or partes, that is: watche / 
abſtinence / harde or ſharpe wearynge clothes / and ſharpe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukynge

is the pouertie of ſpirite, and this croſſe hath alſo .iiii. ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes:
that is the contempte of worldlye glorie / the contempte of
mony / of our countrie / and of our kynſfolke. The croſſe of the
ſpirite: is the feruour of deuocyon / and his .iiii. armes / be theſe
hope / feare / loue and ſorowe, hope is the parte that is vpwarde,
feare is downwarde, loue: of the ryght ſyde, and ſorowe: of the

And truelye ſo it is: For he that doth wronge or euyll vnto an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that ſo noble a bodie ſhuld be ſo ſhamefully entreated, as though

a godly and a pitiouſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tencion bitwixt them. And at laſt though

reaſon of the long enduryng of the ſame for the eclipſe of the ſon

it can nat take away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyght of the ſon from all partes of the erth,

that figure or commaundement was the cauſe that Chriſt bonys
or legges ware nat broken: but contrary wiſe / bycauſe that god
had ſo prouided that no bone ſhuld be broken in Chriſt: therfore
it was commaundyd and keapt in the paſchall lambe that was a
figure of Chriſte. Secondly it was to ſygnifie a thyng in the
miſticall body of our ſauiour Chriſte, that is, that the bonys of
this miſticall body, which be the perfite men, ſhuld nat be broken

in body / that ther body is taken and put to priſon and paynes: yet
in mynde and good maners they be neuer ouercum nor broken.
And therefore they brake nat Chriſtes legges. But one of the
ſawgiours with a ſpeare dyd thruſt Chriſt to the hert, and furth
with there cam out watre and blode. This man was claled Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,

wicked man, but afterward he was conuerted and dyed an holy
martyr. It is ſayd that his ſyght was very feble, and as the blode
ran downe by the ſpeare from the hert of Chriſte by chaunche it
toched his yen: and furthwith he had his ſyght clerly, and ſo he
beleauyd in Chriſte, lefte his ſawgiourſhyppe, and enſtructe by

without that gret difficulty &amp; hard paynes of his paſſion? Yes he
myght haue done it without payne, if it had ſo pleaſed hym. But
he wold rather do it with his great iniurie and payne: to wyn the
loue of man and to gyue hym many and great cauſes of loue. For
this great difficultie and greuouſe paynes that he ſuffred for our
redemption ſhuld moue that perſon to gyue hym thankes, which
lityll regardyd the werke of his creaſion, bicauſe it was done ſo
eaſly. What (thynke you) ſayd the vnkynd man, of his creacion? I
was create and made lyghtly and frely, without any payne or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of my creatour and maker, he onely ſpake the worde: and I
was creat, as al other thynges ware. So the wicked vnkyndnes
of man lytyll regardyng the werke of his creaſion: ſhewed there
matter of vnkyndnes: where he ſhulde haue taken cauſe of loue.
But now the mouth of thoſe wicked men be ſtopped. For now it
is more clere than the lyght, what payne and labour thy lord god
had (o vnkynd man) for thy redempcion. Of a lorde: he becam a
ſeruant, where he was riche: he was made poore / he beyng god:
toke vpon hym a mortall body, and the ſon of god: deſpiſed nat /

from the croſſe: as halfe deed. Third cauſe, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forſayd women
thought that the bodie of Chriſte was then liyng in his ſepulcre,
and therfore they wold haue anoynted (as of old cuſtom haue ben
vſed) his bodie, to preſerue it frome corruption where as this
gloriouſe virgyn knewe that it ſhuld neuer corropte, and that he
was riſen from death to life immortall, or els ſhortly ſhuld riſe.
And therfore ſhe went nat with them. But ſhe ſat in a ſecret place
alone very feble and weake in all the powers of her bodie, for ſhe
had greatly tormentyd her ſelfe with great ſorowe / watche and
abſtinence, from that tyme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe hard ſay that her onely and dere

vpon her tendre breſte. And thus (I ſay) very feble ſat alone in
contemplacion and prayer and alſo weapyng for thoſe miſteries
and paynes that her ſon had ſuffred. And as ſhe was thus in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
and ſwete teares of deuotion: ſodenly her ſon Ieſus cam and
apperyd to her in moſt white clothes of glorie and in the newnes
of his reſurrection, beautiouſe and gloriouſe, with a glad and
louely chere comfortyng his deſolate and heuy mother. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with
ſhe knelyng downe worſhipped hym, and then riſyng vp:
with teares and vnſpeakable ioy embraced hym and then all the
bitternes of her ſorowe was torned in to ioy and comforth. After
this they both ſetyng to gether: our Ladie beſily and curiouſly be
held hym in his face handes and feet and in al his bodie, whither
he had the printes and ſygnes of his woundes / ſearchynge and
aſkyng whether all his paynes and ſorowe were clene paſte and
gon from hym. And he ſayd, yea my worſhipful mother all my ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
and paynes be now paſt and gon, and ſhall neuer retorne
agayne to me. O with how great ioy (thynke you) was then that
bleſſyd Lady repleat? When ſhe ſe and beheld her ſon immortall
and impaſſible and nat onely that he ſhuld liue euermore: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that he had the perpetuall dominion ouer heuen and erth and
all creatures in them. And ſo they louyngly and pleaſantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynyg
and talkyng to gether: made a great ioyfull paſch, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempne
feaſt. And though of this fyrſt aperyng vnto his mother
there be nothyng written in the goſpels: yet we do godly beleaue / 
that Ieſus fyrſt appered vnto his mother Mary. For ſo it was
<pb facs="tcp:8175:160"/>
conuenyent as doctours don ſay that he ſhuld ſo do, and that he
ſhuld fyrſte conforth and glad his mother by his reſurrection,
which louyd hym aboue all other perſones. Alſo bycauſe ſhe had
more ſorow of his death than any other had: it was ſeamyng and

that daye brought agayne by our ſauiour Ieſus vnto the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

worlde, for therunto they ware predeſtinate. And note wele here / 
that the predeſtination of god is nat the neceſſarie cauſe of thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation.
For the predeſtination of god is euer condicionally, that
there is no thyng predeſtinate but vnder ſom co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion, as it was
predeſtinate that the worlde ſhulde be ſauid: but that was by the
death of the ſon of god and by the watre of baptiſme, ſo that they
wold receyue it and liue therafter. Alſo all good and iuſte men be
predeſtinate to glorie eternall, yet with this condicion, if they
contine we in true fayth / charitie / humilitie or meknes, pacience
mercie / pitie, with other vertues &amp; the operacion of them, whom
our lord doth predeſtinate to life euerlaſtyng, he ſeeth &amp; knoweth

with charitie and good werkes. &amp;c. he ſhall nat com to the end of

the condicion therof. Therfore do nat ouermoch attend and truſt
to the predeſtinacion of god which thou knowes nat: but rather
attend to the wordes of god, which thou heris, and knowis. For
as god is true, and can nat be chaungeable: ſo his wordes be true
and can nat be chaunged.<note place="margin">Ca. 33. C.</note> But let vs here, what be thoſe wordes
