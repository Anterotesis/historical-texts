            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>By</hi> RICHARD BAXTER.</p>
            <p>Who earnestly beseecheth Rulers, and Clergy, not to Divide,
and Destroy the Land, and cast their own Souls on the dreadful
Guilt and Punishment of National <hi>PERJVRY,</hi> Lying, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
Covenanting to Sin against God, corrupt his Church, and
not Amend, nor by Laws or blind Malignity, to reproach faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Ministers of Christ, and Judge them to Scorn and Beggery,
and to Lie and Die in Jails as Rogues, and so to strengthen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness,
Popery and Schism, and all for want of <hi>WILLING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS</hi>
and <hi>PATIENCE</hi> to <hi>READ</hi> and Hear their just De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
while they can spend much more time in Sin and Vanity.
The Author humbly begs that he and his Books of unconfutable
Defence of a Mistaken persecuted Cause may not be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
against them for such great and wilful Sin to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>IT is agreed on by all real Christians, that Man being made
an Intelligent Free Agent, not under bruitish necessitating
Determination by Objects, is governed by God by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
way of Law; that is by the Signification of his Ruler's
Will, making his Duty, and not by meer natural or forcible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And it is agreed that GOD himself is his only absolute
Universal Ruler, and his Laws given in Nature and by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
are the only Universal Laws, which no Humane Power
can abrogate or dispense with: And that Kings and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
are his Ministers for Mens good, and have no Power
but from him, and none against him or his Laws; and that it
is not Man but God, by whom we must all be judged to everlasting
Reward or Punishment: And therefore that all men must obey
God before Men, and must not fear them that can but kill the
Body, but him who is able to cast both Soul and Body into Hell.</p>
            <p>And it is agreed on by all Sober Christians, that therefore as
Subjects must use their own Reason as discerning Self-Governours,
to Iudge who is their King, and who is a Usurper, and what
Actions are commanded or forbidden by Man's Laws; so must
they first and chiefly use their own reason, to judge discerningly
what Actions are commanded or forbidden by God, and must do
accordingly whoever is against it. This Iudgment is commonly
called <hi>Conscience;</hi> which if it err not must be followed, but if
it err, it must be rectified: for then it is not God indeed that
is obeyed: for God's Law changeth not as Conscience doth:
yet to go against such a Conscience is Sin, because it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively
to go against God, while the Man thought this had been
God's Will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59333:3"/>
On Supposition of this certain truth, all that ever I yet read
that Condemn the Nonconformists, and Preach for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and Ruine, do confess, that If <hi>any one thing required
of us as necessary to our Ministry or Communion be Sin,
our Nonconformity is but our Duty; and all the whole
Ministry of</hi> England, <hi>on whom this was imposed by the Act
of Uniformity on</hi> Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tholomew-Day, 1662. <hi>were bound in
Conscience to have been Nonconformists:</hi> (Whether also to
bave all ceased to Preach the Gospel, I leave to their Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.)
This being the Confession of all that Silence us, and
send us to Gaols, and call out for our utter Extirpation,
I know no shorter or likelier way, to stop all this burning
Wrath, and end our Mischievous Dissentions, than to try
whether no one thing required of us be <hi>Sin.</hi> Forty of the
things required of Ministers, and Twelve of those required of
the Laity, in all Fifty two, I have proposed to Examination,
not as accusing the Laws or the Conformists, whatever I think
of them; but only rendering briefly the Reasons of our own refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals.
And Forty three Points in which many falsly suppose we
Conform not (and some may perhaps be found that do not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to them all) I have first instanced in, as being such as we
oppose not, nor are any Parts of our Nonconformity.</p>
            <p>If all the Iustices and Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> who cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us, and prosecute us as intolerable Sinners, for our fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these as Sin, have impartially tryed all these Points, and
Reasons, or yet will do, and can find no Sin in any one of the
Fifty two, and it prove so indeed, I must say that all the Two
Thousand Ministers that in 1662. were Silenced, were as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
and strangely blinded Men, as most in the World that
are true Christians; that after all their Study and Prayers,
they should affright themselves into so calamitous a State,
against all the reason of their Worldly Interests, as well as
against the welfare of the Church, and their Duty to God:
2. But I must say, past doubt, that the accusing Clergy are
deeply guilty of it, who these Twenty one years have no better
<pb facs="tcp:59333:3"/>
answered the Reasons of our fear, nor used more Wisdom and
Charity for our just Conviction. For our Consciences are of
such a temper, as will not be convinced with a Scorn or a
Iail, nor take all Writings or Words as satisfactory, that are
poured out with supercilious Confidence, and called <hi>Satisfactory</hi>
by the Self-esteeming Authors.</p>
            <p>I am told by divers, That I have written enough already
on these Subjects, were it only my <hi>first and second Plea for
Peace,</hi> my <hi>Treatise of Episcopacy,</hi> and that <hi>of Concord,</hi>
and my <hi>Apology for our Preaching.</hi> And they say, You must
expect to do no good, nor so much as to be read by Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
much less with Diligence and impartial Willingness
to know the Truth; but contrarily to be <hi>hated,</hi> and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of some odious Crime, and laid in Iail, among Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
till you die; and a Prison will be more grievous to
one in your pain and languishing than to another. On the
other side, I have been long importuned to give an account
of the Reasons of our Nonconformity: I have by Bishops been
reproved for not doing it: Lords and Persons of great Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
have been perswaded, that we keep up a dangerous
Schism in the Land, to the cherishing of Discontents and
Sedition, only for things which we confess to be indifferent,
and no Sin: the Laws accuse us: The numerous Addresses of
Counties, Cities and Corporations, revile us as the Nurses of
Rebellion: No small number of Preachers plead for our Ruine
on the same Supposition, and tell the People that it is no
Sin that we stick at, but Humour, Pride and Faction make
us disobedient Schismaticks without any reason for what we
do. The Iails are fill'd with Nonconformists: Nine Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are now in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and many more in other Places.
And almost all of them Mulct and Fined in far more than ever
they were worth. Their Goods and Books taken by Distress:
They are fain to fly or abscond that are not in Prison: Their
Wives and Children in Distress and Want: They are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Iustices unworthy so much as to be summoned to
<pb facs="tcp:59333:4"/>
Answer for themselves before they are judged, or to be heard
Plead their own Cause, or to know and question their Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
and Witnesses; But as I my self was Distreined of all
my Goods and Books on five Convictions before ever I heard
of any Accusation, or saw a Iudge, so is it with many others,
and more. In a word, Lords, Knights and Clergy-men take
us for unsufferable Persons in the Land, unfit for Humane
Society, Enemies to Monarchy, Obedience and Peace, and
Corporations promise to choose such Parliament Men as are
for our Extirpation. And all this is for our Nonconformity,
which they all confess to be our Duty if it be any Sin that by
the Impositions is required of us.</p>
            <p>And if so small and easie a task as proving one or many
such Sins required, would recover the Charity and Iustice of all
these Men, and save themselves and the Land from the guilt
of Prosecuting and Oppressing the Innocent, and Condemning
Men for Obedience to God, and driving conscionable and
loyal Persons out of the Land, or overwhelming them with false
Accusations, because of other Mens Treasons or Sedition, is not
he that will forbear his Part and Duty in so dreadful a Case,
a greater Sinner than he that when the City is on fire, will not
do his best to quench it; or that will not put out his hand
to save a Friend or Child in fire or Water, for fear of some
trouble to himself?</p>
            <p>I did in my first <hi>Plea</hi> for <hi>Peace,</hi> only name the Matters
which we dare not Conform to, and durst not give the Reasons
of our Fear and Nonconformity: Whereupon many since have
importuned me for those Reasons, as without which I could not
expect that Men should understand our Case. Why should I
deny this? Is it through despair that Rulers and Clergymen will
not regard Reason, or will not bear it, but answer it with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
or Prisons? That is to accuse them of such Injustice, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness,
and Inhumanity as I must not accuse any of that
do not by open practice accuse themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59333:4"/>
Is it lest I should suffer by them? My Life and Labours have
been long Vowed to God: He hath preserved my Life, and
succeeded my Labours above forty Years, by a continued course
of remarkable Providence, beyond my own and other Mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.
What he hath thus given me, is doubly due to
his Service; which hath been still so good to me, that it hath
made even a painful life, a continual pleasure. He never failed
or forsook me: I dare not ask any longer life of him, but for
more and longer Service. And if my Service be at an end, why
not my Life also? If I refuse his Service, I invite God to cut off
my Life: And what Service else can I now do? I have neither
leave nor strength to Preach. I have these fourteen Months
been disabled so much as to go to any Publick or Private Church,
or hear a Sermon. My Body with pain and languid feebleness
is a daily heavy load to me. I suffer more by it every day, than
from all my Enemies in the World. And shall I be guilty of
the heinous Sin of the Omission of my Duty in a time of such ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and crying Necessity, to save so calamitous a Life, which I
am still looking when it endeth? Is not a Prison as near a Way to
Heaven as my own House? I will not do as those Christians that
<hi>Cyprian</hi> writes to Comfort, who were greatly troubled at Death,
because they died not by Martyrdom. But I take a Death for so
publick and pressing a Cause of <hi>Truth, Love, Innocency</hi> and
<hi>Peace,</hi> to be a more comfortable sort of Martyrdom, than theirs
that were Burnt in <hi>Smithfield</hi> for denying the <hi>Real Presence,</hi>
and such like; and if God will so end such a painful Life when
Sickness and Natural decay is ready to end it, I hope he will
teach me neither to repine, nor to be utterly unthankful.</p>
            <p>And as to the uncertainty of success, He that observeth the
Wind shall not sow; God must be trusted to bless our Work
while we Plant and Water; It's my part to do my Duty,
and God's part to give success: I commend my self living
and dying into the hands of my Creator and Redeemer, and
end this Preface in the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 20. 23, 24.
<hi>Bonds and afflictions abide me: But none of these things</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59333:5"/>
               <hi>move me, neither count I my life dear unto my self, so that
I might finish my course with Joy, and the Ministry which
I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testifie the Gospel of the
Grace of God.</hi>

            <p>WE have been so abundantly convinced of the Seditious
and Rebellious Practices of the Sectaries and Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
who through the Course of above One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years since we were first infested with 'em,
have scarce afforded this unhappy Kingdom any interval of rest
from their Horrid Treasons, as that we must esteem 'em, not
only the open Enemies of our Established Government, but to
all the common Principles of Society and Humanity it self.
Wherefore, that we may prevent their Horrid Conspiracies for
the time to come, and secure (as much as in us lies) our most
Gracious KING and the GOVERNMENT from the Fury and
Malice of 'em, we resolve to put the Severest of the Laws (which
we find too Easie and Gentle, unless enlivened by a vigorous
Execution) in force against 'em.</p>
            <p>1. We Agree and Resolve, in every Division of this County,
to require sufficient Sureties for the good Abearing and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Behaviour of all such as we may justly suspect, or that we
can receive any credible Information against, that they have been
at any Conventicles and Unlawful Meetings, or at any Factious
<pb facs="tcp:59333:6"/>
or Seditious Clubs; or that have by any Discourses discovered
themselves to be disaffected to the present Established Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
either in Church or State; or that have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
or Publishers of any Seditious Libels; or that shall not
in all things duely conform themselves to the present Established
Government.</p>
            <p>2. Because we have a sort of False Men, and more perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
than professed Phanatiques, who either wanting Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to appear in their own shape, or the better to bring about
their Treasonable Designs, privately Associate with, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Seditious Clubs of the Sectaries, and with them
Plot heartily against the Government; and yet, that they may
pass unsuspected, sometime appear in the Church with a false
shew of Conformity, only to save their Money, and the better
to serve their Faction: that we may (if possible) distinguish
and know all such dangerous Enemies, we will strictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
all Church-wardens and Constables, at all our Monthly
Meetings, to give us a full account of all such as do not
every Sunday resort to their own Parish-Churches, and are
not at the beginning of Divine Service, and do not behave
themselves Orderly and Soberly there, observing all such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Ceremonies as the Laws enjoyn: And that they likewise
Present unto us the Names of all such as have not received the
Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper in their own Parish-Churches
Thrice in the Year.</p>
            <p>3. Being fully satisfied, as well by the clear Evidence of
the late Horrid PLOT, as by our own long and sad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
That the Nonconformist Preachers are the Authors
and Fome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ers of this Pestilent Faction, and the implacable
Enemies of the Established Government, and to whom the
late Execrable Treasons, which have had such dismal effects
in this Kingdom, are principally to be imputed, and who by
their present obstinate refusing to Take and Subscribe an Oath
and Declaration, <hi>That they do not hold it Lawful to take up
ARMS against the KING, and that they will not endeavour
any Alteration of Government either in Church or State;</hi> do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
enforce us to conclude, that they are still ready to
engage themselves, (if not acutally engaged) in some Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Conspiracy against the KING, and to invade and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb facs="tcp:59333:6"/>
his GOVERNMENT: wherefore we resolve in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Parish of this County, to leave strict Warrants in the hands
of all Constables, for the Seizing of such Persons. And as an
encouragement to all Officers and others, that shall be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in the apprehending of any of them, so as they may
be brought to Justice, we will give and allow Forty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as a Reward, for every Nonconformist Preacher that
shall be so secured. And we Resolve to Prosecute them,
and all other such Dangerous Enemies of the Government,
and common Absenters from Church, and Frequenters of
CONVENTICLES, according to the Directions of a Law
made in the Five and Thirtieth Year of the Reign of Queen
<hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> Entituled, <hi>An Act for the keeping Her
Majesties Subjects in due OBEDIENCE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> That we may never forget the infinite Mercies of
Almighty God, in the late Wonderful Deliverance of our
Gracious KING, and his Dearest BROTHER, and all
His Loyal Subjects, (who were designed for a Massacre)
from the Horrid Conspiracy of the Phanatiques, and their
Accomplices; and that we may perpetuate as well our own
Thankfulness, as their Infamy, that the Generations to come
may know their Treachery, and avoid and never trust men
of such Principles more; and also, that we our selves may
perform our publick Duty to Almighty God, before we
enter upon the Publick Service of our Countrey: We Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Resolve, and Agree, with the Advice and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Right Reverend Father in God, our much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
and Worthy Lord BISHOP, to give and bestow
for the Beautifying of the Chappel in the Castle of <hi>EXON,</hi>
and for the erecting of decent Seats there, Ten Pounds:
And we will likewise give and continue Six Pounds to be
paid yearly to any one of the Church of <hi>Exon,</hi> whom the
said Lord BISHOP shall appoint, to read the DIVINE
SERVICE, with the Prayers lately appointed for the
day of Thanksgiving on the Ninth of <hi>September</hi> last, and to
Preach a Sermon exhorting to OBEDIENCE, in the said
Chappel, on the first day of every general Quarter-Sessions
of the Peace held in the said Castle, to begin precisely at Eight
of the Clock in the Morning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59333:7"/>
And may the Mercies of Heaven (which are infinite) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
protect our Religious and Gracious KING, his Dearest
BROTHER, and every Branch of that ROYAL FAMILY;
and may all the Treasonable Conspiracies of those Rebellious
Schismaticks be always thus happily prevented.</p>

            <head>THE
True CASE
OF THE
English Nonconformity. In a DIALOGUE between
A Silenced MINISTER and a LAWYER.</head>
            <head>CHAP. I. The Introductory Conference.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lawyer.</speaker>
               <p>SIR, the danger of the Kings Dominions by our Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Contentions about Religion, possesseth the
observers with just indignation; but all know not
on whom to lay the blame; some lay it on the Bishops, and some on
the Nonconformists, and some on both: I am unwilling to wrong
any; but when I think of our danger, and hear that it is but Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and things indifferent for which you break the Law, and
make a Schism in the Church, and weaken us by divisions; I cannot
but think you deeply guilty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Minister.</speaker>
               <p>How long have you so judged?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>These twenty years, ever since you were put out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Did you ever by Reading and Conference with those that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59333:10"/>
you censure, acquaint your self truly with their Case.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I have seen some of your Books, but I have not talkt much of
these matters with any of you, but I read and hear from the Doctors
of the Church what you are, and what you hold.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Will you take us to be the just reporters what they are
and hold?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>No, you are Adversaries and partial.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And are not they as much so to us? Is not every man fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to profess his own Faith than his Adversary is? And have you
done well to judge before you heard and tryed? Shall Judges do
so on the Bench? Have you not all these years, continued guilty
of false judging and uncharitableness, and that against a great
number of the innocent? And if you every day prayed for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
but as you forgive, even an enemy and real injury, what
have you done all this while in condemning the guiltless?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Why have you not in Writing given the World just satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
if you are guiltless? What sin have you proved to be in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
required of you? I see no such proof.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You know what penalties the Law layeth on any that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave
the Common-Prayer Books, and that all are Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<hi>ipso facto,</hi> that do but affirm any thing to be against Gods
Word, in any Office of your Church Government, in any Word
or Ceremony in your Liturgy, <hi>&amp;c. Can.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. And you
know what follows Excommunication here. And you know that
till of late years the Press was shut up to us: But have you seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
read and studyed what is written by us? I my self have
told you; 1. In a Book called <hi>A Plea for Peace,</hi> what things they
be which Nonconformists take to be sinful in Conformity, and
how great and hainous the sin is which they fear; and what sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is unlawful and what is necessary. 2. In a full Treatise
of Episcopacy I have shewed what Episcopacy we are for, and
what we are against, and why, and what Antiquity held here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
and what we have to say to most of the Learned Men that
have written for that Diocesan form, which we cannot approve
3. In an Apology, I have proved it our duty to Preach, though
forbidden, as far as we are able, and mens necessities require it.
4. In a second <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> I have fully given the World an
account of our Doctrine, of Magistrates Power and Subjects
Duties in matters Civil and Ecclesiastical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. In a <hi>Treatise
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59333:10"/>
of Church Concord,</hi> I have fully proved that the Primitive simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in things divine, few, plain and sure is the only possible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Universal Christian Unity and Concord. I know not of
any one of these that are Answered, or any thing like an Answer
to them written, save that to some part of the first, some meer
impertinent noise was made by some one that is confuted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>We that have other Employment have not leisure to read so
many tedious Writings: Tell us your Case in a few words if you
would have us understand you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Did you get your skill in Law by so easie and so short a
Study? Or is any kind of Knowledge so easily got, where Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
hath drowned the matter in contradicting words. You
know that it is multitudes of Volumes that are written on the
other side: And it's impossible to Answer them all in a few words:
And if they be unanswered, they will say, we have done nothing.
But had you as seriously studyed but one or two of these Books,
<hi>(e.g.</hi> my first <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> and <hi>Treatise of Episcopacy)</hi> as you
do Law Books, I scarce think you would have been long unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
But if indeed you have no time to hear, read and study,
say also you have no time to know or judge: And no more cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
what you know not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>How comes your Case to be so little understood if you have done
so much to open and justifie it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You may know by your self. 1. Men study their own
matters in which they feel themselves concerned; and as for ours
they think they are not much concerned to know them. 2. At
least not at the rate of any hard and diligent study, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
love nor necessity leads them to. 3. Most are strangers to
us, even they that dwell near us, and converse not with us.
4. The rather because that as we are out of the rising way, and
are under publick discountenance, and banished from Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and much from converse with men of publick place and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
so our familiarity is become fearful, lest it brings those
that are familiar with us into suspicion. 5. And they converse
with those that through Ignorance or Malice do describe us and
our Cause and Books, as they would have all men think of us;
and it is not good manners or safe to contradict them. And so
the notice of our Mind and Case must be received, not from us,
but from our accusers. Do you observe this method in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59333:11"/>
minister-Hall.</hi> 6. And how much interest can byas mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
common experience too easily tells us: They that are
uppermost seldom want applauders, nor dejected men accusers.
Every School-boy can tell you out of <hi>Ovid. de Trist. Dum fueris
foelix multos numerabis amicos: Nullus ad amissas ibit amicus opes.
Aspicis ut veniunt ad candida tecta Columbae: Accipiet nullas sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida
turris aves.</hi> A few serious Believers that look for a more
righteous and important judgment after death, do not lose the
treasure of Truth and Innocency in Shipwrack, it being as near
them as themselves: But <hi>caetera fortunae non mea turba fuit.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But if there be no cause, how come you to be so odious to
others?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If you that dwell in <hi>England</hi> cannot answer that your self,
when you have taken a survey of the quality and lifes of them
that hate us, and them that they hate, and of their distinct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
and motives, I will not answer it to you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But whence is it that Clergy-men of the same Profession so
much disagree?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The former answer shall serve to this: Whence is it that
the Clergy by disagreement about <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Superiority</hi> have
broken the whole Christian World into that state of doleful divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
in which in <hi>Asia, Africa</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> it lyeth to this day?
If you know not read the History of the Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Which part of you soever is guilty, the guilt must needs be
very hainous, when the Preachers of the Gospel of Love and Peace,
so hate each other, and perswade all to do the like, and will not let
the World be quiet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt but Love and Concord are so great <hi>Duties</hi> and
<hi>Blessings,</hi> and there is so much of Satan in the contrary, that you
can hardly aggravate the guilt too much. If it were better for
that man that offendeth or stumbleth one of the least, that he had
never been born, or he had been cast with a millstone about his
neck into the Sea; what a case are these Church Pastors in that
tear the Church, and Preach down Love, and harden thousands
in Ungodliness and Cruelty, and endanger the loss of Religion to
the Land.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>If I knew which of you had done most for Love an Peace,
and least against them, I should know to whom to impute our
troubles.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59333:11"/>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>We justifie not our selves, and we leave others to their
judge: We have deserved worse from God, than we have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
But we must say; 1. That we impose not our words,
our books, our forms, our different rites on any, nor would do,
by violence, had we power: We put no Oaths, Subscriptions,
Convenants, Professions or Practices doubtful upon any: To them
that tell us we did so in former times, we still say, let them use
no other so but those that used them so, and we are satisfied: I
know not six in <hi>England</hi> of all the present Nonconformists that
did so: We are not for Silencing or Imprisoning them, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
them to worship God: In 1660 we motioned no change
of Church Government, which should take down any of their
Lordships Maintenance or Episcopal Power, but only Arch-Bishop
<hi>Vshers</hi> Draught of the antient Episcopacy, and thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
what the King then granted in his Declaration of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Affairs. 2. We never craved Preferment of them, but
leave to serve Christ and his Church in the Office which we were
Vowed to. We certainly knew what impediments hindered the
desired Unity, and what divisions must needs follow were they
not removed, which by others they might easily have been, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cost or danger. We Pleaded, we Wrote, we Petitioned, and
Beg'd for Peace, even for that which the King had granted: And
what could we do more? Since then above twenty years we have
laboured as we could, sometime to few, and sometime to more;
and have patiently lived upon Charity, and suffered—I need
not tell you what.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But why could not you Conform to the Law as well as they?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. Can men believe what others list because they bid us?
Is there nothing that you or they would refuse if it be but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you? What use have we for a Law of God then? If
we must disobey it as oft as we are bid, that were to renounce
God, and all Religion and Salvation. And we have not our own
understandings at command; we have offered them our Oaths
these twenty years, that we would obey them in all, except at
the rate of sinning and damnation.</p>
               <p>2. And if we had done as they did we must have profest our
Assent and Consent to all things contained in and prescribed by a
Book which we never saw: For so did we suppose above seven
thousand men, the Book not coming out of the Press till about the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59333:12"/>
day that they were so to Assent to it, <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. so that no doubt
they did it on an implicite trust in others; except the few that
were in or near <hi>London:</hi> This fully shews that, though almost all
the nine thousand or more Ministers that were in possession when
the King came in, did before conform to the way of the Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and not to the Common-Prayer Book, yet there was a great
latent difference between the seven thousand that conformed, and
the two thousand that did not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But seeing all the stress lyeth upon the question, Whether it
be only things <hi>Lawful, indifferent</hi> or <hi>good,</hi> which you refuse, or
any thing which God forbiddeth: I pray tell me plainly, what it is
that you take to be sinful in the Conformity required? And what it
is that you would have as necessary in its stead.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you on these Conditions; 1. That you pardon
me for repeating here what I have already written. 2. That you
bring not your self a Conscience so laxe as will take nothing for
sin, which men use to make light of, though God forbid it, and
then think that our Consciences should be as wide as yours.
3. That we may premise the things <hi>presupposed as agreed on.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. II. The things presupposed as agreed on.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>WHat are the Agreements which you presuppose?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>These following.</p>
               <p>1. That God is the Absolute Soveraign Ruler, and hath made
in Nature, and in the Sacred Scripture, Universal Laws for the
whole Church and World: And that Kings are His Subjects and
Officers, and have no Power but what He giveth them directly
or indirectly, and therefore none against Him; no more than a
Constable against the Sovereign Power; and that he and all men
are bound to obey Gods Lawes, whoever are against it or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot deny this, without denying God to be God, and the
Law of Nature and Scripture to be His Law and Word.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>II. That next to his Government, God in order of Nature
and Time made <hi>Self-Government</hi> and <hi>Family-Government</hi> before
the Government of Republicks, Kingdoms or Cities: And that
publick Polity hath no Authority to abrogate <hi>Self-Government</hi> or
<hi>Family-Government,</hi> but only to over rule and use them for the
common good and safety.</p>

                  </gap>.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>III. That it belongs to <hi>Self-Government</hi> to discern by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whether the Commands of Men be against the Commands of
God or not, which we call <hi>Iudicium discretionis,</hi> by which all
men must guide their actions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Shall every man be a judge of the Law, whether it be just
and good? How unfit are the vulgar to judge of Lawes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>They are no publick judges to decide the case for other
men, nor doth their judgment restrain or bind the Magistrate;
nor if they judge amiss will it justifie themselves, or suspend the
execution of the Law against them. But if they must not have
the foresaid discerning judgment to guide their actions, it will
follow; 1. That they are not governed, nor must obey as Men
by Reason and Free-will, but as Brutes. 2. That Kings have
Absolute Power against God, and must be obeyed in all that they
command, <hi>e. g.</hi> if it be to curse or blaspheme, or renouce God
or Christ, to command the Subject to live in Murder, Adultery,
Perjury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so to abrogate the Law of Nature. 3. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that there is no God (that is, a Supream Ruler) but the
King. 4. And I pray you tell me what you will have the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
do in case of Usurpation or Competition for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as between the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster, Iane</hi> and
Queen <hi>Mary, &amp;c.</hi> when one saith <hi>fight for me,</hi> and the other <hi>fight
for me.</hi> If the Subject have not a judgment of discretion to know
which is his rightful Sovereign, the King must be forsaken? He
that will stand to the command of another, must judge who his
Commander is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>And will you have Infants and Idiots judge of their Parents
commands? Or Children in their minority.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. Infants and Idiots have not the use of Reason, and so
far are to be ruled by force as Brutes: And Children in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
as they are short of reason. But 2. If they come to reason,
and the King command them one thing, <hi>(e. g.</hi> what Church to go
to.) and their Parents the contrary, would you not have them
judge which they must obey. 3. Much more if Parents should
command them to sin against God, to Steal, Lye, Murder, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme,
and Curse the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> surely they must judge as far
as they are able.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot deny it, proceed in your presuppositions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>IV. That no men have power to command us to damn our
Souls, or to do any thing that tendeth to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>None will deny you that; but perhaps some things may cease
to be sin, and dangerous if commanded.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>None can dispense with the Laws of God, but we grant
that some things that are unlawful by some accident or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
may become a duty when commanded, when the good of
Obedience, Order and Concord therein, weighs down against the
accident: It may be a sin to go on Warfare before one is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and a duty when he is commanded. It is a fault in a
Servant to go before he is sent, and a duty after.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>If they do not, our Case will soon be decided. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
many deny it. The <hi>Iansenists</hi> name you many Jesuit Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists:

that Lying is any sin when it is profitable, and wrongeth none; as
in a Physician to fice down a Medicine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>And what have you to say to the contrary?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I must not stay to dispute all such matters with you: I
have fully answered it in my Catechisme on the Ninth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Briefly this may satisfie you: No ones private good must
be sought by a means that would destroy all Humane Trust and
Converse: But if you give men leave to lye when they think it
needful or harmless, it will destroy all Humane Trust and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse:
For almost all will think their lyes are profitable. And
we have had Learned, Moderate Conformists that have trusted to
this Argument, and openly defended it: If Knaves would take
my Purse, I may defend my self with my Hands: <hi>Ergo,</hi> If they
would deprive me of my Maintenance and Ministry, I may defend
my self with my Tongue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>And how do you answer them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>That no man must defend himself by means which will do
more hurt than his Ministry or Life is worth: But to let men
loose so to lying is such; and more forbidden of God than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence:
And sin ever doth more hurt than good.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>VI.</hi> We may suppose also that Perjury is unlawful, and would
much more destroy all Mutual Trust, and consequently Humane
Converse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59333:13"/>
VII. And we may suppose that he that either commandeth or
perswadeth others to be prejured, or that openly justifieth their
perjury, by telling them that it is no perjury, or no sin, is guilty
of their perjury.</p>
            <p>VIII. And we suppose that to draw whole Churches and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
into perjury, by force, perswasion, example or justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, and telling them that they need not repent of it, is one
of the hainousest sins that man can commit, except making it the
very Mark or Stigma without which none may be Magistrates,
Ministers or Freemen.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>No one I hope will deny any of this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>IX. We presuppose that all Vows, Oaths, Covenants,
Professions, imposed by Superiours, must be taken in that sence
in which they any way expound them, without forcing them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a laxe or an over-rigid interpretation: But if they do not
otherwise expound them, they must be taken in the sence as those
words are commonly used and understood, by such as treat of the
subject which they belong to.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>You have so cautelously exprest it, that I cannot contradict
you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I must not be tedious in writing the same things oft. If any
doubt whether our expositions of Oaths and Subscriptions be not
over-strict or rigid, I pray read the words of Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi>
cited by me in the end of my first <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> and know that
we stand to his rules of exposition.</p>
               <p>X. We may suppose that, seeing repenting and amending is
the condition of forgiveness, to make a Covenant in any sin that
we will never repent and amend, is so heinous a crime, as is next
to the renouncing of Pardon and Salvation: And in National guilt
and danger deliberately to Covenant that we will never endeavour
any amendment of the Nations sin, is next to begging Gods Curse
on the Land; <hi>e. g.</hi> If a man were a Fornicator and Perjured, and
the Land commonly guilty of the same, he that would make a
Bargain or Covenant, and that deliberately, that he will never
amend, nor ever endeavour to amend the Land or any other—
What would you think of that mans case?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What should I think but that he is a Monster and miserable
Wretch? But what's that to us? I hope there are none such in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59333:14"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> that worse than Witches, would sell themselves and the
Nation to the Devil.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I pray over-run me not in the application: I do but tell
you what I suppose we are agreed in: I shall tell you after why
I speak it.</p>
               <p>XI. I also suppose that bare Possession proveth not a Bishop or
Pastors right to the place and power which he claimeth: Nor is
any disseized of his right by being disseized of separable accidents.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>That's true: But what use you'l make of it I know not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>XII. Lastly, I must desire you to remember, that as we
profess to stick at nothing but sin against God (and not things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
as we are slandered), so if <hi>but one</hi> of all the imposed
Acts of Conformity be certainly sinful, and if but <hi>one</hi> of all the
Arguments which I shall use do prove it so, not only the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
that were ejected were bound to be Nonconformists, but
also all the English Ministry, and the Act of Uniformity (if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
be sin) did vertually, though not actually, turn out all
the Clergy at once, because all were bound rather to resign than
sin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>The truer and more dreadful the consequence is, the hardlyer
will I believe the antecedent, till I needs must.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You cannot expect that we affirm it: For 1. We know
how cautelous we must be in meddling with the case of other
men: Let them judge themselves who are called to it. 2. And
I told you before what the Law threatens, and the Canons, against
them that affirm any of the impositions to be sinful; much more
that shall so deeply accuse the Laws. 3. But sure no Law or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
forbiddeth men to fear sinning against God themselves, nor to
tell the World what it is that they fear, and why they dare not do
it, without accusing any other.</p>

               <p>BEfore I tell you wherein our Nonconformity doth consist,

Soci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ians, if not Papists, outwardly Conform: Yet we charge
not their errours on the Church; and so on the other side. But
those that were called by the King, and one another, 1660 and
1661, to treat of Concord, and that Assembled at <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi>
and elsewhere about it, did openly make known their minds: And
I think they meddled not against any of these things following, by
any accusation of them as sinful.</p>
               <p>I. They never denyed the Lawfulness of a form of Prayer or
a Liturgy: Though some falsly so accuse them.</p>
               <p>II. They denyed not the soundness of the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi>
contained in the form of the English Liturgy, in the main: They
though it a good Book, and the making of it a great Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and honoured the excellent men that made it; but they
thought it not such as could not or should not in any thing be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
or that all might say was without fault.</p>
               <p>III. They thought not the <hi>Imposition</hi> of it a reason sufficient
to prove it unlawful for them to use it were there no more.</p>
               <p>IV. They offered to use it when amended, and if that could
not be had, they told you in their Reply, their purpose rather to
Communicate in the use of it than not at all, and to have used all
the lawful part themselves if they might be suffered in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
places and Ministry on such terms.</p>
               <p>V. They never accused the use of <hi>Holy dayes,</hi> as dayes of
Thanksgiving to God, for giving such Holy Apostles to the
Church, and whose memory we honourable commemorate.</p>
               <p>VI. They never accused our <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
but only the <hi>casting Godly</hi> persons from Communion for
not using it, when they take it to be sin. About the <hi>Kneeling</hi> the
old Nonconformists were not of one mind; some thought that
every <hi>objectum motivum</hi> of Adoration was forbidden that was a
Creature: But others said that every Creature in the World may
be such an object: Our Meat is <hi>objectum motivum</hi> when we pray
for a Blessing on it. If I see the Relicts or Picture of a Friend
that I wronged while he was alive, I may well be moved by it to
beg pardon of God. All his works must move me to adore and
praise him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But we may not make any Image <hi>objectum termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum,</hi>
or <hi>ad quod,</hi> to which we direct our Divine Worship, as
a Medium of our sending it to God. The only great difficulty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59333:15"/>
about this is from the argument of scandalous hardening the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
that live among us: Though indeed our Doctrine avoideth
that scandal.</p>
               <p>VII. They never accused the Ceremony of laying the hand on
the Book, and kissing it in taking an Oath.</p>
               <p>VIII. They never spake against the Ring in Marriage.</p>
               <p>IX. They meddled not with the Surplice, Tippet, Hood, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet,
Cope, but only the casting men out of the Ministry that
dare not use them, thinking them unlawful: Though we justifie
them not.</p>
               <p>X. They accused not all significant use of the Cross, but only
that in Baptism it seemed to have all or most of the nature of a
Humane Sacrament of the Covenant of Grace, as it is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Liturgy and Canon.</p>
               <p>XI. They spake not against Episcopacy, as it is a presidency
among and over Presbyters differing in Degree, and not in Office,
called ORDER, and that in a Church of the lowest Species.</p>
               <p>XII. They opposed not Arch-Bishops as over many such Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Bishops, nor Diocesans, as Arch-Bishops ruling but by
Gods Word.</p>
               <p>XIII. They said nothing against Metropolitans, Patriarchs,
Lay-Chancellors, Commissaries, Officials, Surrogates, Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Officers of the King, appointed to do nothing (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Sacred Ministry, if they be Clergy-men) but what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to Magistracy.</p>
               <p>XIV. They said nothing against any promise of Obedience to
them only in the capacities, and in the exercise of the power fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
               <p>XV. Much less did they ever oppose or question Swearing to
the King, according to the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy:
And I with divers others also being (for some ends) entered as his
Chaplains in Ordinary, took also that Oath of Fidelity which the
Kings Houshold Servants take.</p>
               <p>XVI. We never were for any dishonouring of Kings by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Excommunications, much les by Subjects or Forreigners,
whom Kings never choose to be their Pastors; but only in case of
necessity, for such a denyal of Sacramental Communion to them,
as Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Fortura Tor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> plead for;
which is but to forbear our selves a sinful act.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59333:15"/>
XVII. We never pleaded for any Elders (or Chancellors) pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Keys, who are but Lay-men.</p>
               <p>XVIII. We never held that Magistrates are bound to add their
force by the Sword, to the censures of the Church as such, and
to punish men more because the Church hath by Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cast them out, or because they are not reconciled.</p>
               <p>XIX. We never thought that things indifferent do become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to us, because the Magistrate commandeth them.</p>
               <p>XX. We never held that the Scripture is a particular Rule,
commanding every accident and circumstance about Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship,
but only a general Rule (requiring all to be done in Love
and Peace, and to edification, and decently, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> in those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
which must be some way determined, and God hath
left to variable Humane determination: Such as are Time, Place,
Utensils, Translations, Sections, Metres, Tunes, Methods and
Words in Preaching and Prayer, Habit, Gesture, and many
such.</p>
               <p>XXI. We never held it unlawful to do one of these actions,
though it were by mistake unlawfully commanded; <hi>e. g.</hi> If the
Rulers prescribe a Time, Place, Metre, Tune, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unfit, if it
be not so bad as to overthrow the ends and use of the Worship,
the fault of the Commander will not disoblige us from the duty of
obeying. And whereas some argue, that <hi>no man hath authority
to sin,</hi> ergo, <hi>we are not bound to obey that which is no act of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:</hi>
I answer, Rulers have authority to command that which
is good, though not in a faulty manner; and when we cannot do
the good without the faulty manner, it is their fault and not ours:
<hi>e. g.</hi> If an inconvenient Time, Place, Text, Tune, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
the Union and Concord which is held by agreeing in those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Modes is necessary: He that will not joyn in them cannot joyn
in the Worship. So that we obey the Ruler or Guide as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminer
of the means of Concord, which is necessary, and not
<hi>sub ratione erroris,</hi> as <hi>misdetermining,</hi> though in that which is
<hi>misdetermined.</hi> If a Master bid his Servant go at an unseasonable
time about his work, it's his duty to go at that time. We never
pray without some fault in the manner, and yet must rather do it
so than not at all. The mistaken Ruler <hi>bids us not sin:</hi> It's <hi>his
sin</hi> to choose a mis-circumstance; and it is not his <hi>own action</hi> that
he <hi>bids us do,</hi> but ours: And its to us a lawful circumstance,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59333:16"/>
because necessary to Concord, and commanded though mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly.</p>
               <p>XXII. We never held it unlawful to joyn with a Church or
Minister that hath some faults, both Personal and in their acts of
Worship; as if all that joyned were guilty of all the faults there
committed: No not though we knew before hand that some false
Doctrine would be uttered, or fault committed: Else we must
separate from all the world, and all from us.</p>
               <p>XXIII. We never thought it a duty to separate from every
Church, that culpably neglecteth Discipline, and hath open wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men therein: If we be not guilty of it, and cannot lawfully
live in the Communion of a more obedient reformed Church.</p>
               <p>XXIV. We never judged needless affected singularity a duty,
but judge it best in lawful things for Concord sake to Conform to
the custom of the Churches where we live or come.</p>
               <p>XXV. Though we think not that men may command us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
our Neighbours Souls by scandal, yet when disobedience to
a Rulers Law is like to do more hurt than the scandal taken at it
comes to, we are for avoiding the greater hurt.</p>
               <p>XXVI. We never separated from any tolerable Parish Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
or Churches, as if they were no true Ministers or Churches,
nor perswaded any so to do, nor to take the Communion of such
Churches for unlawful to us, either occasionally or constantly,
when we can have no better without more hurt than benefit to our
selves and others.</p>
               <p>XXVII. We hold it unlawful to reproach all Churches that we
see to be faulty; but it is our duty to keep peace with all.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. VVe hold mental distant Communion in Faith and
Love, with many Churches that by imposing sin do deny us local
Communion.</p>
               <p>XXIX. Though I here tell you once for all, that I justifie not
all that I can thus bear with, yet we can submit by peaceable si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to many abuses in a Church, which we dare not subscribe
to and approve, and use also passive Obedience where active is
unlawful.</p>
               <p>XXX. VVe are not against God-Fathers and God-Mothers, as
used of old; that is, when the Parents are the Covenanters for
their Child, and their Death or Apostasie is feared, for others to
promise if they dye or apostatize to take care of the Child; or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59333:16"/>
for any Adopters or Owners to do it that take the Child as theirs.</p>
               <p>XXXI. VVe are so far from being against true confirmation, as
it is the taking persons that own their Baptismal Covenant, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
into the number of adult Members and Communicants,
that we desire it (and have written for it) as a chief means of the
true Reformation of all our Churches in the Land.</p>
               <p>XXXII. VVe differ not in Faith or meer Doctrine from the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it's in the Thirty Nine Articles, but only
in One new Article, put into the new Liturgy, of the <hi>Salvation
of Baptized Infants,</hi> as <hi>undoubtedly certain by the Word of God,</hi>
without any exception, if they then dye.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. VVe are not against reading the profitable part of the
<hi>Apocrypha,</hi> as other Humane VVritings may be read, sufficiently
distinguished from the word of God.</p>
               <p>XXXIV. VVe are for Corporal VVorship, as a due expression
of Spiritual: And we are against all undecent expressions in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Preaching, and all undecent Habits, Gestures or Actions.</p>
               <p>XXXV. VVe blame not the Liturgy for extending the words of
Charity and Hope as far as there is any reasonable ground, in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
Absolution and Buryal.</p>
               <p>XXXVI. VVe are not for mens invading the Ministry unordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but believe that Senior Pastors or Bishops are ordinarily the
regular Judges of the fitness of Candidates for the Ministry.</p>
               <p>XXXVII. VVe are not for unlimited Toleration: But that the
Rulers justly distinguish in Law and License; 1. The approved,
whom they must own and maintain. 2. The tolerable, whom
they must tolerate. 3. The intollerable, whom they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
from doing hurt.</p>
               <p>XXXVIII. VVe are for making true Religion as National and
extensive as may be; and for a National Church; 1. As the asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
Community of Churches in a Nation is so called. 2. And
as they are all accidentally united under one Christian Soveraign:
Though we abhor the casting out all that be not of our opinion and
measure, and that cannot submit to all that I here enumerate,
which I and others of my mind can submit to.</p>
               <p>XXXIX. VVe are so far from desiring to draw people from the
Parish Churches into Conventicles, that we would keep up the
honour of them to the utmost of our power, as knowing how
greatly the countenance and maintenance of Rulers conduceth to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59333:17"/>
the furtherance of Religion; and that the publick Religion will
be the common and National Religion; and most will be there:
And if the Protestant Religion were reduced to Tolerated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,
Popery would possess its place, and become National,
and soon withdraw even private Toleration, as we see in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XL. VVe are not for Preaching when we are forbidden, where
there is not a real and evident need of our Labours.</p>
               <p>XLI. VVe believe not that the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenant, or any other
doth oblige us to Sedition, Rebellion, Schism, or any sin; nor
doth disoblige us from any Obedience due to any Superior.</p>
               <p>XLII. VVe refuse not the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath, or any such, because
it is an obligation to obey our Rulers in Lawful things, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it restraineth us from resisting Authority; for we give as
much to Humane Soveraignty, and confess as much obedience due
to them from Subjects, 1. As any Text of Scripture speakes:
2. Or any General Council, save what they give to the Pope and
his Vassals. 3. Or as any Confessions that we know of, of any
Christian Churches agree in. 4. Or which Lawyers, Politicians,
and Historians, Protestants, Papists or Heathens agree in, as far
as we are acquainted.</p>
               <p>XLIII. VVe are not against the use of Synods or Councils, nor
against Princes using their advice for such Laws <hi>circa sacra</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to them to make: VVe believe Councils should be used as
far as the common good and Communion of the Catholick Church
requireth it; though no Foreigners have Jurisdiction over us.
And we hold that if they agree of any thing conducible to the
common good, though their agreement be not a <hi>Law,</hi> but a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi>
yet the general command of keeping the Unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the bond of peace, obligeth all to hold such concord for the
ends sake, that have no special reason against it.</p>
               <p>In these Forty three things we oppose not conformity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>And if yet after all this Agreement we must be destroyed by
divisions, the heavy Curse of God is on us, and will surely fall on
them that are the causes of it, who ever they be.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. A brief enumeration of the things imposed
on us which is the matter of our Nonconformity.</head>

               <p>DO you know what it is that we are required to conform to?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I know it is to use the Liturgies, Ceremonies and
submit to the Bishops, as your Governours: I know no more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And yet dare you become our Judge? If you are no more
exact and just in matters of Law, your Clients must pay for it?
Before I come to handle the particulars, I will set together here the
things required of us; and how much of them we refuse, I will
tell you when I try them, and give you our Reasons against them.</p>
               <p>I. Whereas few of the Nonconforming Ministers were at Age,
and Ordained till Diocesans were put down in <hi>England,</hi> and were
Ordained by an Assembly of Senior Pastors, which were then in
possession of the Power, and had many years the Approbation of
the whole National Assembly of Divines at <hi>Westminster,</hi> before
they were admitted to any Incumbency; none of these may now
exercise their Ministry unless they be Re-ordained by Diocesans.</p>
               <p>II. No man can be Ordained by them, and admitted to any
Cure, that will not take the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience</hi> (as
they call it) and in his Ordination Covenant to obey his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
               <p>III. No man must Preach the Gospel by the authority of his
Ordination and Office, till moreover he have got a Licence from
the Bishop to Preach: and till he have got that Licence to Preach,
he may not take upon him to Expound in his own Cure, OR
ELSEWHERE ANY SCRIPTURE OR MATTER OR
DOCTRINE, but shall only study to read plainly and aptly
without glossing or adding, the Homilies already set forth, or
hereafter to be published by lawful Authority. <hi>Can.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p>IV. No man may be Ordained, or be a Licenced Preacher,
or Catechize who doth not subscribe these words, <q>
                     <hi>Ex animo,
That</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> of Common-Prayer, and of Ordaining of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Priests and Deacons, containeth in it nothing contrary
to the Word of God, and that it may lawfully be used, and
that he himself will use the Form in the said Books prescribed
in publick Prayer and administration of the Sacraments, and
no other.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59333:18"/>
V. No man is to be Ordained a Minister, nor have any place
or Benefice or Cure, that doth not openly and publickly before
the Congregation declare his unfeigned Assent and Consent to the use
of all things in the said Book contained and prescribed in these
words and no other. [I <hi>A. B.</hi> 
                  <q>Do here declare my unfeigned Assent
and Consent to all and every thing contained and prescribed
in, and by the Book entitled, The Book of Common-Prayer,
and Ordaining.</q>] And every Lecturer also; the first Lecture
and every Month must publickly and openly declare his Assent
to, and Approbation of the said Book, and to the use of all the
Prayers, Rites and Ceremonies, Forms and Orders therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
and prescribed.</p>
               <p>VI. By this all must Assent and Consent to this Article of Faith
or Doctrine. <hi>[It is certain by the Word of God that Children which
are Baptized, dying before they commit actual Sin, are undoubtedly
saved.]</hi> Not excepting any, though the Children of Atheists, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
or Sadducees.</p>
               <p>VII. We must Assent and Consent, that at publick Baptism,
persons called Godfathers and Godmothers, who take not the
Child for their own, do in the name of the Child Covenant with
God, without the Parents, who are forbidden to be Godfathers
or Godmothers, or to speak one word, nor must be urged to be
present; nor may the Godfathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> speak one word but what
is written in the book. And they are there not only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
for the future, but to profess in the Name of the Child at
present [I renounce them all] (the Devil, World and Flesh)
and <hi>[All this I stedfastly believe]</hi> and (to be baptized) <hi>[This
is my desire]</hi> and for obedience <hi>[I will.]</hi> And these Godfathers
also engage as their parts and Duty, to see that <hi>[this Infant be
taught so soon as he shall be able to learn what a solemn Vow, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and Profession he there made by them:</hi> And that <hi>they call on
him to hear Sermons, and chiefly that they provide that he may learn
the Crede, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Tongue, and all other things that a Christian ought to know
and believe to his Soul's health, and that the Child may be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
brought up to lead a godly, and Christian life].</hi> All this these
three persons must promise as before God and the Church, but
the Parent is not only excused from any such promise, but forbid
it by the Canon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59333:18"/>
VIII. We must Assent and Consent to refuse to baptize the
Child of any godly Christian, who bringeth not his Child to be
baptized with such undertaking Godfathers; either because he
can get none that will seriously promise him to do what they
must Vow to do, and so dare not draw them into sacrilegious
perfidiousness, or because he thinks it his own part to enter his
Child into God's Covenant, and thus to promise for its Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IX. We must Assent and Consent to sign the Infant with the
transient Image of the Cross</hi> [In token that hereafter he shall not
be ashamed to confess the Faith of Christ crucified, and manfully to
fight under his Banner, against Sin, the World, the Devil, and to
continue Christs faithful Souldier and Servant to his lives end.
<hi>Which the Canon farther expounds thus</hi> [To dedicate them by
that Badge to his Service, whose benefits bestowed on them in Baptism
the name of the Cross doth represent] [an honourable Badge whereby
the Infant is dedicated to the Service of him who died on the Cross.]</p>
               <p>X. VVe must Assent and Consent to Baptize none publickly
without this Sign, but to deny Christendom to all that dare not
receive it, and their Children.</p>
               <p>XI. VVe must Assent and Consent to reject all that dare not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it Kneeling from the Sacramental Communion of the
Church.</p>
               <p>XII. VVe must Assent and Consent to a false Rule to find out
<hi>Easter</hi>-day for ever, in these words; <hi>[Easter-day (on which the
rest depends) is always the first Sunday after the first full Moon,
which happens next after the one and twentieth day of</hi> March.] The
common Almanacks tell you it is often false.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XIII. VVe must Assent and Consent to use words at the Burial
of all, except the</hi> Vnbaptized, Excommunicate and self-murtherers
<hi>which plainly pronounce them saved,</hi> viz. [For asmuch as it hath
pleased Almighty God to take to himself the Soul of our dear Brother
here departed.] <hi>And</hi> [we give thee thanks, for that it hath pleased
thee to deliver this our Brother out of the miseries of this sinful world.]
<hi>and</hi> [that we may rest in him, as our hope is this our Brother doth.]</p>
               <p>XIV. VVe must Assent and Consent to read publick Lessons out
of <hi>Iudith, Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon, Tobit,</hi> and other Apocryphal
books, from <hi>Sept.</hi> 28. till <hi>Nov.</hi> 24. every day, except some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Lessons interposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59333:19"/>
XV. VVe must Assent and Consent to all the mistranslations of
the Psalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not only use them (which we refuse not)
but subscribe that none of them are contrary to the word of
God.</p>
               <p>XVI. We must Assent and Consent to admit none to the holy
Communion till <hi>[such time as he be Confirmed, or be ready and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to be Confirmed]</hi> that is, by Bishops in the English method.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XVII. We must Assent and Consent that</hi> [such ornaments of the
Church, and of the Ministers thereof, at all times of their ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall be retained in use, as were in this Church of <hi>England</hi> by
that authority of Parliament in the Second year of <hi>Edward VI.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVIII. We must Assent and Consent to give an <hi>account within
fourteen</hi> days of every one that we keep from the Sacrament, to
the Ordinary. And that the <hi>Ordinary proceed against the offending
person according to the Canons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. We must publish all such Excommunications and Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
as are according to the Canons decreed by Lay Chancellors.</p>
               <p>XX. This binds us to consent and publish the Excommunication
of all that <hi>affirm that the Liturgy containeth any thing in it that is
repugnant to the Scriptures]</hi> And the Oath of canonical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
binds us to such publication, if it be commanded us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXI. And we are both these ways bound to publish all Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,</hi>
ipso facto, <hi>(if commanded) who</hi> affirm any of the Rites
and Ceremonies such as may not be approved and used lawfully.</p>
               <p>XXII. And all that say any of the Thirty Nine <hi>Articles</hi> in any
part may not be subscribed, though it be but about Traditions or
Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>XXIII. And we must, if required, publish all, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
who say the Church Government by Arch-Bishops,
Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons, and the rest that bear Office, is
against God's word.</p>
               <p>XXIV. We must, if commanded, publish all Excommunicate
who affirm that the <hi>Form and Manner of Making and Consecrating
Bishops, Priests or Deacons containeth any thing in it that is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the word of God.</hi> (Though it assert that the Bishops and
Priests are distinct Orders, which even in K. <hi>Aelfrick's</hi> days the
Church of <hi>England</hi> denyed.)</p>
               <p>XXV. We must publish them Excommunicate who affirm that the
Nonconformists may truly take the name of another Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59333:19"/>
and that any assemblies of Subjects not allowed by Law, are true
and Lawful Churches.</p>
               <p>XXVI. No Minister must wittingly administer the Sacrament
to any but such as Kneel, nor to any of the foresaid depravers of
the Liturgy, Ceremonies, Orders of the Church, <hi>&amp;c. Can.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>XXVII. None of other Parishes are often to be admitted to
Communion.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. All Ministers that repent of Conforming must be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
excommunicate and deposed at last, <hi>Can.</hi> 38.</p>
               <p>XXIX. We must give the Sacrament to none that go for it
from unpreaching Ministers, but must send them home, <hi>Can.</hi> 57.
Nor must Baptize their Children.</p>
               <p>XXX. Ministers must not be suffered that wear not the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,
<hi>Can.</hi> 58.</p>
               <p>XXXI. No Minister must refuse or delay to Christen any Child
that's brought to the Church to him on Sundays or Holydays to
be Christened, without exception of Atheists or Infidels Children.
<hi>Can.</hi> 68.</p>
               <p>XXXII. No Minister may keep any Fast in publick or at pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Houses, or be present at any (on what necessity soever) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Bishops License for it under Hand and Seal, or the Laws
appointment.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. We must if commanded publish all Excommunicate
that affirm that the Sacred Synod is not the true Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by representation; or that deprave it as a faction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXXIV. No man was to be ordained or suffered in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
for twenty years that did not subscribe thus</hi> [I do declare that
I do hold that there lies no obligation on me, or on any other person
from the Oath commonly called the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi>
to endeavour any change or alteration of Government in Church or
State.]</p>
               <p>XXXV. All Nonconformists must swear that they will never
endeavour any alteration of the Church Government, or else be
banished five miles from Corporations and all places where ever
they preached since the Act of Oblivion.</p>
               <p>XXXVI. All Ministers must subscribe and Nonconformists
swear that they abhor the Trayterous position of taking Arms by
the Kings Authority against those that are Commissioned by him.</p>
               <p>XXXVII. We must assent and consent to the damnatory sentence
in the Creed called <hi>Athanasius's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59333:20"/>
XXXVIII. Every Minister consenteth to say the Morning and
Evening Service every day in the year, not being lett by sickness
or other urgent cause.</p>
               <p>XXXIX. Ministers must concur to force the unwilling Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
to the Sacrament, or else to Excommunicate and ruine them.</p>
               <p>XL. If we dare not Conform for fear of sin we must forsake
our Ministry to which we are Ordained and Vowed, and give
over Preaching the Gospel what ever need there be, and must also
remove our dwelling from all places aforesaid.</p>
               <p>These are the parts of Ministers Conformity.</p>
               <p>Lay Mens Conformity is as followeth;</p>
               <p>I. They must trust their Souls with the Pastoral oversight of
those, and only those as their fixed Pastors, whom Patrons will
choose for them, and Bishops institute: Though the Conformists
accuse many Patrons of such hainous sins, as speaketh them unfit
for so strange a trust, besides those that are Papists, and Bishops
say they have not power to keep out the unfit.</p>
               <p>II. They are not only hereby deprived of the exercise of Self-Government
for the saving of their own Souls, but of due Family
Government for the safety of Wife and Children, and Servants,
and must not bid them choose better Pastors.</p>
               <p>III. They are forced to forbear Communion with all Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,
and to separate from all others besides Conformists,
though they account this Schismatical separation.</p>
               <p>IV. When God commandeth them <hi>[If thy Brother trespass
against thee tell him his fault between thee and him; if he hear not
tell the Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And with Drunkards, Railers, Fornicators,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>not to eat.]</hi> They are forced to have Communion with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
where no such Discipline is exercised, nor can they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
any such duty, and to lose all the benefit of this Christian
Order and Discipline, none being so much cast out as Conscion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Dissenters.</p>
               <p>V. Conscionable care to obey Gods Law is greatly discouraged
and made a dangerous thing, while it must be mens utter ruine to
deny Conformity, even in a Ceremony, to men, when it's done for
fear of sinning against God.</p>
               <p>VI. They are to be deprived of Baptism and <hi>Christendom</hi> for
their Children, if they dare not use the foresaid way of God-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as described.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59333:20"/>
VII. They are also to be unchristened if thinking our Crossing
is used as an unlawful Humane Sacrament, they dare not receive
it as a dedicating Badge of Christianity.</p>
               <p>VIII. If they think Kneeling at receiving the Sacrament an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
hardening the Papists, they are denyed Communion.</p>
               <p>IX. If any dissent but from Confirmation, Organs, Kneeling
at the Rails, taking a Reader or unfit man for their Pastor, they
must not be received to Communion by a Conformist in another
Parish.</p>
               <p>X. All the Land is engaged (Ministers, Vestries, Corporations
and Militia) by Oaths or Covenant never to endeavour any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Government in the Church.</p>
               <p>XI. They are all engaged to abhor the position as trayterous,
of taking Armes by the Kings Authority against any Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him in pursuit of such Commission.</p>
               <p>XII. All Corporation Government and Trust is confined to
them that declare that there is no obligation on them or any other
from the solemn Covenant or Vow, not excepting so much as to
oppose Schism, Popery or Prophaneness, to defend the King, or
repent of sin, though these be Vowed.</p>
               <p>I have now told you what Conformity is, in Ministers and
People.</p>

               <p>YOV have named a great number: But I doubt whether all

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I told you that if <hi>any one of them</hi> (imposed) be sinful,
Nonconformity is a duty, which all the Ministers in <hi>England</hi> were
bound to.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What sin can you find in Re-Ordination?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I must first state the Controversie before I argue it.</p>
               <p>1. The word <hi>[Ordination]</hi> may signifie either the first Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Ordination to the Ministerial Office as such, by which a
man is separated from the Laity to Gods Ministry: Or else, a
<hi>Mission</hi> on some particular Ministerial work, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
were sent abroad, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. Or a Minister may be sent to
<hi>America, &amp;c.</hi> Or else a fixed appointment to some one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church or Flock, which is done here by Presentation, Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59333:21"/>
and Induction. It is neither of the two last that we speak
against. They may be often done: But its only the first.</p>
               <p>2. The word <hi>[Ordination]</hi> may signifie; 1. That Moral acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by which a man is made a Minister of Christ, which is, his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Contract with Christ, exprest by his Consent, and by the
Ordainers investing action: This is it which we mean in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
which may not be done twice. 2. Or it may signifie
the meer words of the Ordainers and Ordained, which make up
the said Moral action. We deny not but the same words repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
may make up one Moral Ordination: If the Bishop by tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
repeat them twice or thrice: Or if they should to satisfie men
of divers Languages that are present, be first spoken in <hi>English,</hi>
and after in <hi>French,</hi> or when some that doubted require it, should
go over them again; all this is but one Ordination.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>How prove you that our Bishops intend any more, when they
say, it is only to satisfie the Law, that you may be capable in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. That it is not a meer <hi>relation to some particular cure</hi> that
they mean, is undenyable: 1. Because they call that by the name
of Institution and Induction, and not of Ordination. 2. Because
they never ordain any over and over upon removals. 3. Because
the words of Ordination in the Book tell it us.</p>
               <p>2. That they do it not as a <hi>Repetition</hi> of the same valid Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is past doubt. 1. Because the same repeated by the same
men will not serve. 2. It is to be done, again ten or twenty
years after the first. 3. He is to be fined in an hundred pound that
administreth the Sacrament without it. 4. He is taken for no true
Minister without it, which cannot be true of a bare repetition of
words: No reasonable men would lay so much on that.</p>
               <p>3. It is undeniable that they take men for <hi>unordained,</hi> and no
Ministers till they ordain them: 1. Because they all disown <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordaining;</hi>
they know that the Canons called the Apostles, and
the whole antient and later Church condemn it as like Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistry;
and no one Bishop in <hi>England</hi> will not renounce it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its certain that they take the first Ordination for null. 2. And
they have so declared their judgment in many words and writings,
and in the Act of Uniformity, it is plainly intimated in the penalty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>And what harm is there in being twice Ordained?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. <hi>Ad hominem</hi> I need not dispute it? All the Bishops dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59333:21"/>
it as unlawfull, so that we have their confession.</p>
               <p>2. It is the same fault as Anabaptistry. If they be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
why make you such a noise against the Anabaptists. To
be twice made a Christian, and twice made a Minister is of
the like kind.</p>
               <p>3. It is something causelesly to cast our selves under the
Censure of all the Church that hath been against it, and to
be condemned by them.</p>
               <p>4. It is a plain prophanation of God's holy name, and of a
great and holy Ordinance, by Lying and taking God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s name
in vain. For they are said to be <hi>now admitted to the Office,</hi> and
<hi>this day to receive it,</hi> and God is told that they <hi>are now called
to it.</hi> And all their Examinations and Answers imply that
they were no Ministers before, and the Bishop saith <hi>[Receive
the Holy Ghost, for the Office and work of a Priest now committed
to thee by the Imposition of our hands]</hi> which all imply it not
done before. And in so sacred a contract with God, to
lie to him, and prophanely abuse his name, and the holy
Ghosts, and the Duty of Prayer and Praise, is tremendous.
Be not deceived God is not mocked.</p>
               <p>5. It is a confederacy with Corrupters and Usurpers, that
arrogate and appropriate valid Ordination to themselves, and
a confirming all their injury to posterity, that all that shall
hereafter imitate them may be encouraged, by alledging our
<hi>Re ordination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. It is a hainous injury to all the other Reformed Churches
as if we degraded their Ministers and separated from them all
as no Churches. For one part of them have no Diocesans,
and the rest have Bishops, that at the Reformation were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by Presbyters.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>It is contrary to one of the Articles of our Religion,</hi>
23. These we ought to judge them lawfully called and sent, which be
chosen and called to this work, by men, who have publick authority
given to them in the Congregation to call and send Ministers, <hi>&amp;c.
But in other Countries, Presbyters have publick authority,
given them. And Art.</hi> 36. The book of Consecration doth contain
all things necessary to such consecration and Ordaining. <hi>But it hath
nothing for</hi> Re-ordaining <hi>those before Ordained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59333:22"/>
8. It is a plain condemnation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
which hath professed Communion with the Reformed abroad,
as with true Ministers and Churches of Christ. And we are now
told that to communicate with Schismaticks induceth the
guilt of Schism.</p>
               <p>9. It introduceth Anabaptistry, or utter confusion into the
Nation, leaving men in doubt whether for fourteen years the
people had any true Baptism (while it's a controversie whether
Lay-mens Baptizing be valid, and Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> maketh all men
to be out of any Covenant-title to Salvation that have not
the Sacraments from a Minister that hath successive Episcopal
Ordination) And all Christians must question whether they
have not so long here lived out of the Church of Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Ministery and Communion.</p>
               <p>Do you think that none of these nine Reasons prove Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
sinful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But because the Bishops deny it, let me hear your proof that
the former Ordination here by Presbyters is not a nullity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I. <hi>Ad hominem,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath, as I said,
judged the like valid in the Reformed Churches, by holding
Communion with them. I cited a great number of Bishops
and Doctors in my <hi>Christian Concord.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But they say that <hi>necessity differeth their case from ours
here;</hi> And even Doctour <hi>Sherlock</hi> tells you that if God make neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity;
necessity will make Ministers: But ours Schismatically pull'd
down the Bishops and now disown the very Order.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>There is a satisfactory concession in these words, but
the accusations are made up of falsehood and deceit.</p>
               <p>1. Archbishop <hi>Vsher</hi> and others that thought the Ejectors of
Episcopacy were guilty of Schism, yet maintained that their
Ordination was valid: He told me how he pleaded it to the
King.</p>
               <p>2. Do they think that <hi>Salmasius, Blundel</hi> and all others that have
written more against our Prelacy than the English, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of it against their wills by necessity.</p>
               <p>3. What necessity can they pretend to the <hi>Hollanders, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetians,
Geneva, Embden, Bremen,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>
heretofore? might they not have had Prelates when they
would.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59333:22"/>
4. Was not the necessity far more notorious to those that I
now plead for. They lived in a Land where Episcopacy was
cast out, and kept out by a potent Army. I think there were
but four or five Bishops alive when it was restored.</p>
               <p>5. It is false that they cast out the Bishops. Those Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that joyned with the Parliament to cast them out, were
Ordained by Bishops, and therefore are none of the men that
we are speaking of: These that were Ordained by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were then young men at School, or in the Universities.
And what are other mens actions to them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But they are of the same mind and party.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Are you a Lawyer, and do you accuse men in the
Temple without naming them, and bringing proof of their
guilt. <hi>Noxa caput sequitur,</hi> should all the Clergy be called
guilty if <hi>Sibthorp,</hi> or <hi>Manwaring,</hi> or <hi>Heylin</hi> were proved so?
what error you accuse them of, prove and punish them for no
other.</p>
               <p>6. But I prove that the Bishops themselves made other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
necessary. Because they would Ordain none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sinful subscriptions and conditions, which must not be
yielded to: If you can prove the terms lawful on which they
Ordain, I shall trie your skil anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. I farther prove the Ordination in question valid, thus,</hi>
Where there is a true notification of God's will that this person shall be
a Minister of the Gospel, there is no want of validity in his Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
But those here ordained by Presbyters might have such a true
notification of God's will—<hi>Ergo, The major is plain; Because</hi>
God's will <hi>and</hi> Man's consent <hi>are the</hi> fundamentum <hi>of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
therefore nothing can be wanting to it's being and
validity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Minor is proved. Those men that have laudable abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and willingness, and the consent of a people in true ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and the approbation of a National Assembly of Learned
Divines (of which many Bishops were called to be members)
and the investing Ordination of the gravest Senior Pastors,
that were then to be had, had a true notification of God's
will that they should be his Ministers. But such were these in
question. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59333:23"/>
                  <hi>III.</hi> The way of ordination, which was valid in the Primitive
Church is now valid.—But such is that in question. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Minor; The Ordination of such Pastors as were
but the Rectors of single Congregations, was it that was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
in the Primitive Church. But such is that in question.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> labours to prove that in Scripture time
there were no other Bishops or Presbyters but the single Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of single Assemblies: Mr. <hi>Clerkson</hi> hath fully proved, and
I more fully in my Treatise of Episcopacy, that for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty years, if not much more, there were no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches bigger than our Parishes. A Bishop then was
but the chief Parish, or Congregational Pastor, who guided
it with his Assistance. And such are all our Incumbents (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in great Towns) who have Chapels and Curates and
Lecturers to assist them. And <hi>Grotius de Imper. sum. Pot.</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that really the chief Pastor of a Church is a Bishop, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they call him. But I have so largely proved in my Treatise
of Episcopacy, pag. 231, 232, &amp;c. that our questioned Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers
were scripture Bishops, and that those now called
Presbyters Ordained long after, that I must not repeat the
same things here again.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Those that are in Orders may confer Orders: Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis
est Ordinare,</hi> as <hi>Vsher</hi> was wont to say; As Physicians
make Physicians, and Philosophers make Philosophers, and
Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation propagateth the Species: And our Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
to this. 1. In that Presbyters must concur in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
by Imposition of hands, which is an act of authority
and collation. 2. In that the Convocation hath a <hi>greater
power,</hi> even Canon making; and that Convocation consisteth
half and more of Presbyters, and the Canons Excommunicateth
all that deny it to be the represensative Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Presbyters have the power of Order</hi> (as Bishop <hi>Carlton de
Iurisdict.</hi> proveth it commonly acknowledged) <hi>equal with Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi>
pag. 7. And the Church of <hi>England</hi> in King <hi>Aelfrik</hi>'s
time <hi>(ad Wolf.</hi> in <hi>Spelman,</hi> pag. 576. l. 17.) <hi>Affirm</hi> that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Presbyters are but one Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> Those may ordain validly whose Ordination is more warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than that of Roman Bishops <hi>(for our Bishops own theirs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59333:23"/>
as valid and ordain them not again when they turn Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants):</hi>
But the Presbyters that Ordained here fourteen years, did
it more warrantably than the Roman Bishops. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Papists Ordain men to a <hi>false Office;</hi> to be Mass-Priests:
But the said Pastors ordained none but to the same
office that Christ instituted.</p>
               <p>2. The Papists have their power of Ordination from the
<hi>Pope,</hi> whose own power and office in <hi>Specie</hi> is a false Usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But it is not so here, where the ordaining Pastors were
lawfully called.</p>
               <p>3. Papists Ordination enters them into a <hi>false Church in
Specie</hi> (a pretended catholick Church headed by the Pope);
but our Pastors entered them into no Church but Christs.</p>
               <p>4. Papists make them take sinful <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> before
they Ordain them. But these Pastors (at least that imposed
not the Covenant) did not.</p>
               <p>If yet any will nullifie the Reformed Churches and Ministry
and their Ordination, and not the Papists, we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what their Mind and Communion is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VI. That</hi> Ordination is valid which is less culpable, than many
Diocesans: <hi>But</hi> such is that in question. Ergo,</p>
               <p>To the proof of the Minor (which only needs proof here).</p>
               <p>1. Some Diocesans here have been Papists (as <hi>Godfrey Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
of <hi>Gloucester)</hi> and divers have pleaded for and owned a
<hi>Forreign Iurisdiction,</hi> which the Oath of Supremacy ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jureth.</p>
               <p>2. I have fully proved in the said Treatise of Episcopacy
that the Office of Pastors of single Churches is more warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than our Diocesans who are the sole Bishops of many
score or hundred Churches.</p>
               <p>3. The said Presbyters (at least who medled not with the
Covenant) imposed <hi>no unlawful condition</hi> on the Ordained, as
too many Bishops have done.</p>
               <p>4. Many Bishops plead the derivation of their power from
<hi>Rome:</hi> And what theirs is I shewed before.</p>
               <p>But because I must not write a Treatise on this one question,
you may read it done copiously and unanswerably by <hi>Voetius</hi>
against <hi>Comel. Iansenius de desperata Causa Papatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I add one difference more. The Ordainers and Ordained
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59333:24"/>
in question, had the consent of the Flocks and neighbour
Ministers; but the said Bishops come in by the Magistrate
without the consent or knowledge of the Flocks, and so do
the Ministers usually whom they Ordain. And what the
ancient Church thought of this, abundance of Canons shew.
I'le now cite but one, <hi>Concil. Nic. 2. Can. 3. Omnem Electionem
quae fit a Magistratibus, Episcopi Presbyteri vel Diaconi irritam
manere ex canone dicente, siquis Episcopus secularibus Magistratibus
usus, per eos Ecclesiam obtinuerit, deponatur &amp; segregetur, &amp; omnes
qui cum eo Communicant. Oportet enim eum qui est promovendus ad
Episcopatum ab Episcopis eligi, quemadmodum a sanctis patribus
Nicaenis decretum est in Can. qui dicit [Episcopum oportet maxime
quidem ab omnibus qui sunt in provincia constitui.</hi> And many
Councils nullifie their Episcopacy that come not in by the
election or consent of <hi>Clergy and People,</hi> which <hi>ad hominem</hi> is
somewhat to them that urge such Councils against us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I confess your reasons seem unanswerable, at least as to the
case of necessity, which I am convinced was the case of those that
were ordained when there were no Bishops to whom they could have
access, or no place in the Ministry without Presbyters Ordination,
and who then durst not be twice Ordained: And for Churchmen
that must be strictly Religious to suffer on such terms I cannot speak
against. But we secular men think these too little things to suffer
for.</p>

               <p>1. We do not question the duty of <hi>obeying the King</hi>
and all his Officers, governing as Magistrates by the power
of the Swords which the King may commit to them. If
Bishops or Lay Chancellors be made <hi>Magistrates,</hi> we will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
them as such: And therefore when they summon us, we
appear and answer, because the King authorizeth them. And
many Non-conformists have defended the taking the Promise
as supposing that the Word <hi>[Ordinary]</hi> signifieth only the
Judge of a Court set up by the King as Supream Governor by
the Sword in matters and over persons Ecclesiastical as well
as Civil, according to the true sence of the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</p>
               <p>2. We do not refuse to promise and swear due Obedience
to such as are our Lawful Pastors, ruling the Church by the
power of the Keys according to the Word of God: Though
we think that requiring such Oaths is an irregularity in them,
against the ancient Canons, and a farr higher presumption
than the Independents Covenant.</p>
               <p>3. We do not deny a patient and quiet submission to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59333:25"/>
persons and acts of Government, not owning their sin
our selves, and doing no evil at their command.</p>
               <p>But these are the things which we are not satisfied in.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>Obedience</hi> hath essential Relation to the <hi>Laws and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
of those that we obey: And the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are
the <hi>Laws</hi> by which they openly profess to Rule the Church:
And therefore they call it the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience,</hi>
that is, of obeying the Church Government according to
the <hi>Canons;</hi> And when we know the <hi>Canons</hi> before-hand, we
know what Government and Obedience is meant. And we
swear fraudulently if we take not the Oath in the sence of the
<hi>Imposers:</hi> And they commonly tell us, that this is the meaning
of <hi>[Due Obedience],</hi> and if <hi>Godly Admonitions,</hi> or <hi>[in licitis &amp;
honestis]</hi> be put in, that doth but suppose that Obedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Canons</hi> is <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>licitum &amp; honestum,</hi> and not
that we are left to choose which Canons we will obey. All
Bishops I doubt not will stand to this Exposition of the
sence.</p>
               <p>Now there are abundance of things in the Canons which
we think to be greater sins than we think meet to call
them.</p>
               <p>II. We know that the Rule of the Bishops is by <hi>Chancellors
Courts</hi> and other such, where Lay-men exercise the Church
Keys, by Decretive Excommunications and Absolutions:
which wise men think to be sacrilegious Usurpation, and a
Prophanation of a dreadful part of Christs Government:
And Lawyers and Civilians tell us, that the word <hi>[Ordinary]</hi>
signifieth the appointed <hi>Ordinary</hi> Judge of the <hi>Court,</hi> and so
that we swear or Covenant to obey <hi>Lay-Civilians using the
Keys.</hi> And <hi>[other chief Ministers]</hi> can mean no less than all the
Archdeacons, Officials, Commissaries, Surrogates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom
we covenant to obey; not in civil things or the <hi>circa Sacra</hi>
belonging to Magistrates, which we refuse not, but in the
exercise of the <hi>Church Keyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. They that think they have fully proved that Diocesans
Ruling many hundred Churches without any Bishops under
them, are an Office <hi>in Specie</hi> contrary to Gods Word, and
the practice of the Primitive Church, and that it corrupteth
or excludeth true Church Discipline, do think it a sin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59333:25"/>
by an Oath of Allegiance or Obedience to them, though
they live peaceably under them.</p>
               <p>IV. They that think that by Scripture, and Reason, and
Universal Church Customs and Canons, they are no Bishops
or Pastors that come in by Magistrates without the Election
or consent of the Flocks and Clergy, think that to swear
Obedience to them is to be guilty of their Usurpation.</p>
               <p>These four be the things refused in this Oath and Covenant
of Obedience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>And what have you against obeying according to the Canon?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I. You may gather it from the foregoing enumeration
of the Canonical Impositions: Many things of a heinouser
nature than Liturgies, Ceremonies or things Indifferent.</p>
               <p>1. We dare not obey an Order for Excommunication ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the 4th. Canon, against any man that affirmeth
that the Book of Cammon-Prayer containeth any thing in it
that is repugnant to the Scriptures. Judge that by the proof
that I shall anon give.</p>
               <p>2. The same I say of the Excommunication in <hi>Can. 5, 6,
7,</hi> 8. and many others, which are after to be particularly
mentioned.</p>
               <p>3. And there are many things in the Canons which we
dare not <hi>practice,</hi> and therefore dare not swear Canonical
Obedience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>That Oath doth not oblige you to approve of all that is in the
Canons, no more than a Iustices Oath to execute the Laws doth bind
him to approve of, or execute every Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>We would not be guilty of an over rigorous Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But had it been in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when the
Six Articles, and other Lawes for Murdering Innocents were
on foot, and were actually expounded by Execution, I would
not have been one of the Justices that should have sworn to
execute them. Though a Justice be not bound to approve
every Law, he is bound in the main to execute them in his
place; And if he know that the Imposers of his Oath did
mean, that he should in a special manner execute <hi>e. g.</hi> the
Laws against Protestants, he should not take that Oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their sence. Our Canons make these things fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
their principal part, as you may see by putting
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59333:26"/>
them first with that strange penalty of Excommunication
<hi>ipso facto.</hi> And indeed it is no small part of the whole Book
that we dissent from.</p>
               <p>II. But moreover we dare not promise or swear Obedience to
our Ordinaries, till we know that Lay-men governing by the
Keys are not those Ordinaries. I have consulted Lawyers, and
some say that only the Bishop is meant by our <hi>[Ordinary];</hi> But I
think they are but few that say so. And indeed we are bound to
believe the contrary, because terms of Art or Science are
to be understood according to the use of the men of that Art
or Science. But men of that profession commonly call other
Judges of their Courts our <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> besides the Bishops: So
doth <hi>R. Cousins</hi> in his Tables and others.</p>
               <p>2. And <hi>other Governing Ministers</hi> whom we must obey, are
mentioned in the Ordination Covenant also besides our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries.</p>
               <p>Our Reasons against this are these.</p>
               <p>1. It is unlawful to confederate with Sacrilegious Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers
of a great Ordinance of God, in stablishing and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising
that Sacrilegious Prophanation.</p>
               <p>But to Covenant or Swear Obedience to Lay-men in usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the power of the Keys of Decretive Excommunication
and Absolution, we fear is such; and as to the Minor the
reason of our fear is, if it be Sacrilegious prophanation for
a Lay-man to usurp the other parts of the Pastoral Office,
then it is so for him to usurp the power of the Keyes. But
the Antecedent is confest, as to the Sacraments and the charge
of ordinary Teaching and Guidance of the Flocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Ad hominem.</hi> If the Bishops take it for Usurpation in
Presbyters to exercise this power, supposing it proper to
themselves, they must judge it much more so in Lay-men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>The Lay-men do it by the Bishops Authority and in his Name;
and so he doth it by them: His Name is to the Excommunications.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. The Chancellors have their Commissions from the
King, which the Bishops cannot alter.</p>
               <p>2. If it be so it is the worse.</p>
               <p>1. That the Bishops name should be abused to a Sentence,
when he never heard or tryed the Cause. If this be against
the Bishops Will, it is a forgery; if he <hi>consent,</hi> it seems he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59333:26"/>
trusteth his Conscience in the Chancellors hands, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth
all at a venture that the Chancellor Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth,
though he know not whom nor why, which is against
the Light of Nature, and the common Justice of the World.</p>
               <p>2. And it is contrary to the nature of the Pastoral Office
to execute it by men of another Calling: Either it is proper
to Bishops or not; if not, Presbyters or Lay-men may use
it; if yea, then none, may be deputed to use it, that are not
Bishops. If the Keys and not the Sacraments may be used by
Lay-men, then the use of the Keys is not proper to Pastors,
but only Sacraments. But no man can give a just reason why
Lay-men may not give the Sacraments as well as use the
Keys.</p>
               <p>Yea indeed the Sacramental administration cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the Pastoral Office if the Keys be not: For the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se of
the Keys is to Judge who shall be admitted to Sacramental
communion: and if only <hi>Delivering</hi> and not <hi>Iudging to whom,</hi>
be proper to the Pastor, then he is but a carrier or cryer and
Executioner of Lay-mens Judgment, perhaps lower than the
Deacon. Barely to say over the words and do the action,
is but an outward Ministration, and no act of Power at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But it is not the Chancellor but the Surrogate that Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. Ask those that have been much among them, how oft
they have heard a Lay-Civilian say at once, <hi>[I admonish you, I
admonish you, I admonish you, I excommunicate you].</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Hypocrisie is but an aggravation of Sin: The Lay-man
decreeth the Excommunication, which is the judicial act;
when they use a Surrogate Priest, it is but as a hireling Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to pronounce the Decree, to mock the Church with a
Formality.</p>
               <p>3. If indeed it be the Priest that Excommunicateth and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth,
when no Bishop is there, then they confess that the
power of the Keys is not proper to a Bishop, but may be
validly used by a Priest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But what have you against swearing Obedience to the Bishops
themselves, supposing the Canons were materially Lawful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>III. We have nothing against a peaceable submission to
them, if they were proved all Usurpers. For my part, when I
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59333:27"/>
think how the High Priests were made (out of a wrong line,
by <hi>Roman</hi> power and purchase, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> in Christs time, and how
much he was for submission to them, and a use of all that
was good and lawful, done by those bad unlawful intruders,
it resolveth me to regard <hi>bare Possession,</hi> so far as our own edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and the common peace requireth. But as Christ was
a Nonconformist to the Pharisees vain Traditions, so he was
so far from <hi>swearing Obedience</hi> to these Usurpers, that he oft
plainly and vehemently reproveth them. Many, for the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
publicum,</hi> which is <hi>Suprema Lex</hi> and <hi>finis regiminis,</hi> did
live in quiet submission to the Usurpers of <hi>civil power</hi> here, who
yet would never have <hi>sworne</hi> obedience to them or justified
their Usurpation.</p>
               <p>That the frame of Diocesans as the only Bishops is unlawful
<hi>tota specie,</hi> I have so largely proved in my Treatise of Episcopacy,
that I must not here repeat it, as long as the Diocesan party
by not answering it seem to grant it. I have proved,</p>
               <p>1. That this Diocesan <hi>Species</hi> destroyeth the old <hi>Species</hi> of
particular Churches, turning the Parishes into <hi>no Churches,</hi> but
parts of a Diocesan Church while they make a Bishop essential
to a Church.</p>
               <p>2. That they set up a false <hi>Species</hi> instead of it, <hi>viz.</hi> A
Church <hi>infimae speciei,</hi> which hath many score Parishes, if not
many hundred in it, without any <hi>under-Bishop</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>3. That it deposeth the <hi>old species</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi>
both, which were [to every Church of the lowest species] a
Bishop with his Presbyters <hi>ejusdem ordinis</hi> (if they could be
had) so that many score or hundred Bishops are put down, on
pretense of setting up Episcopacy.</p>
               <p>4. And they set up both Bishop and Presbyters of a humane
unlawful sort instead of those deposed, <hi>viz.</hi> Arch-bishop <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fimi
ordinis,</hi> over a thousand or hundred Carcasses of Churches:
and half Presbyters that have not the power of the Keys, nor
are of the same Order with the Bishops.</p>
               <p>5. That they <hi>deposed</hi> Christs true <hi>Church Discipline,</hi> and
made it as <hi>impossible</hi> as for one School-master alone to govern
all the Schools in a Diocess, or one Physician many hundred
Hospitals, or one Mayor many Hundred Corporations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any School-master (but an Usher or Monitor) or any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,
or any Mayor or Justice under him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59333:27"/>
6. That they have set up a false humane Discipline (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
described) instead of Christ's, which they have taken
down. And all this we dare not justifie by a confederacy
by Oath.</p>
               <p>IV. And we think that the fourth thing which we stick at
needs no other reason; suppose the species of Diocesans were
of God's appointment, and only the numerical Bishops usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
we can submit and live peaceably, but we cannot swear
obedience to them. They plead more than we for the power
of ancient Councils, and Canons. I have elsewhere fully
proved (as <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> hath done, and Mr. <hi>Clarkson,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and many others) that many great Councils
nullified the Episcopacy of all that came in without the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or consent of the Clergy and Flocks: And we our selves
cannot conceive how any man can be the Pastor of those that
consent not; though we can easily conceive that Dissenters
may oft be <hi>obliged to consent</hi> when they do not; so may a Son
or Daughter be obliged to obey their Parents in consenting
to Marry, such as Parents choose for them, when yet it is
no marriage till that consent. How few in a Diocese ever
know of the Bishops Election till it's past, and how few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
I need not tell. We can submit to these, but not <hi>swear
Allegiance</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>V. And in all the foresaid cases, we have another disswasive.</p>
               <p>1. It is so much of the King's Prerogative that all Subjects
must swear Allegiance and Fidelity to him, that in almost
all Nations it hath been thought dangerous, to make the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
also swear obedience to every Justice or inferior Officer,
lest it should make them too like Kings. 2. Lest the Subjects
should be entangled between their Oath to the King, and their
Oaths to all these Officers, in case of the Officers contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the King's. 3. Lest so many Oaths should make that
Government a snare to the conscientious, which should be
for their ease and safety. 4. Lest so much swearing make
Oaths contemptible, and bring in perjury, and endanger the
King, who should by our Oaths be secured.</p>
               <p>2. And I have elsewhere named many Councils, and Canons
which prohibit Bishops this practice of making the Clergy
swear fidelity to them, and have condemned it, as of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59333:28"/>
consequence. And they that are for <hi>Councils</hi> should not
engage us causelesly <hi>against them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The present Impositions greatly stop us, till we better
know what it is that we must do. We have cause to make
a stand, when we are all sworn <hi>[never to endeavour any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Government of the State]</hi> which we readily obey,
and yet seem to be called to do that which we are told by some
is an alteration of it: That is, the making of our present
species of Archbishops, Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons, yea
Chancellors, Officials, Commissaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as unchangeable a
part of the Government as Monarchy it self is, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
the King to make any alteration in them.</p>
               <p>For set all this together and consider, 1. All the Clergy
is bound or sworn to obey both Bishops and every Ordinary.
2. The Canon <hi>ipso facto,</hi> Excommunicates every man that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
that the Church Government under his Majesty by
Archbishops, Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons and THE REST
THAT BEAR OFFICE in the same, is repugnant to the word
of God; so that all the Lords and Gentlemen in <hi>England</hi>
that have affirmed that the Government by the Keys as used
by Diocesans over hundreds of Churches, or by Archdeacons,
Lay Chancellors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is repugnant to God's word, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<hi>ipso facto</hi> Excommunicate, how far they are capable of
being Parliament-men I know not: but I suppose if in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
they shall affirm any such repugnancy they are Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate;
and without the Act of King and Parliament no
alteration can be made. 3. And now to fix them all, the
Kingdom is sworn never to endeavour any <hi>alteration in the
Church Government:</hi> viz. In the <hi>Corporation Act,</hi> the <hi>Militia Act,</hi>
the <hi>Vestry Act,</hi> the <hi>Oxford swearing Act,</hi> after the <hi>Act of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</hi>
And is not every Chancellor, or Archdeacon, or
Bishop now made as immutable necessary a part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as the King?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>You speak ignorantly for want of acquaintance with the Law:
Do you think King and Parliament oblige themselves. It is only
particular subjects out of Parliament that they oblige.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I. But when the Parliament is dissolved, are they not all
particular subjects save the King. And are they not all then
hereby bound? And do you think that it was the meaning of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59333:28"/>
Act that they who swear never to endeavour alteration, may
yet endeavour it, if they be chosen Parliament men? I will
manifestly disprove it. All these Oaths do joyn the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Church and State</hi> together: Yea, and put the <hi>Church-Government
first,</hi> as if it had the preeminence. But it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the meaning of the Oath, that the Parliament may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to alter <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which is the <hi>State-Government:
Ergo,</hi> it meant not that they may endeavour to alter <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi>
or <hi>Church-Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. But suppose it be as you say, They that know the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thing called the <hi>Church of England</hi> know that their Writers
openly maintain that the Obligation of the Canons depends not
on the Parliament, save only as to the <hi>forceable execution</hi> of
them, but on the authority of the <hi>Church</hi> as a Society em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
by Christ: And therefore that King or Parliaments
at least may be Excommunicated by them as well as others.
All are Excommunicate men that do but call their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sinful.</p>

or <hi>matter any where?</hi> Doth it not come near to an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical
prohibition of Religion, may they not tell their people
the meaning of <hi>Baptism,</hi> or the <hi>Creed,</hi> or <hi>Lord's-Prayer,</hi> or
<hi>Commandments?</hi> May they not teach their own Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
these. If a <hi>Priest</hi> may not do it, much lesse the Laity
and Vulgar.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>The meaning is not, against expounding to their children or

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Can the Church of <hi>England</hi> tell such a meaning no

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59333:29"/>
not his House or his Neighbour's House <hi>elsewhere:</hi> If they can

               <p>2. But suppose that <hi>[elsewhere]</hi> speak only of Churches,
you know that other Canons forbid them Preaching in private
houses.</p>
               <p>3. And what a Priest is that who must be forbidden to
teach the people in the Church: or there to tell Children the
meaning of the Catechism? How like is this to the <hi>Moscovy</hi>
State?</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>

               <p>And are such fit to be made the Teachers and Guides of the

and when they have done forbid him to do any more than
read to them a Physick Book of their making? Is it not an
ability to teach men, at least the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christianity,
Essential to a Minister? Do they not then make <hi>No-ministers</hi>
and call them <hi>Priests,</hi> if they ordain men that cannot Teach

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>It is so: but if that only will qualifie one for the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
one may be a Priest that knows no more than an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
or Atheist: and if Reading will qualifie men for a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,

them accordingly.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But you know that when the Land came out of Popery, we

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And you know that these Canons were made in K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s
days long after that, and that they are now continued as the
Church Laws: Did our last Convocation alter them? It is
such excellent men as the world is not worthy of <hi>(Ames,
Bayn, Parker, Hildersham, Dod,</hi> &amp;c.) that have been forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to Preach, whilest these that could not preach were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
and inducted. It is only the present things that I am
speaking of.</p>
               <p>2. And though men of mean abilities, if tolerable, may
be tolerated, yet men that want <hi>essential</hi> qualifications should
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59333:30"/>
not be made Ministers; but if bare Reading be necessary,
they may Read as Lay-men.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore that as making such Priests and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
is a sin in them, so to obey them by omission of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
teaching, for want of a Licence from the Bishops
would be sinful Conformity in any true Minister of Christ
if he live where his Ministerial work is necessary. And to
forbear all Expounding any matter, or doctrine, save by Reading
our Homilies, is sacriledge and perfidiousness, and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inhumanity.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Negatively, 1. We blame nothing in it that is good:
And I take it for a good Book, in the main, but not faultless.
As you said of the Canon of allowing Readers, so say I of the
Liturgy; it was better immediately after Popery than it is
now, that is, it was more congruous, and was a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and we honour the Book and their Memory that
made it.</p>
               <p>2. We do not think that there is any such faultiness in it, as
maketh it unlawful to joyn in the publick Worship, and
ordinary Communion, with the Church where it is used, We
honour them as true Churches of Christ.</p>
               <p>3. I do not think it unlawful to read the ordinary Lords
day Service, when the publick good requireth it, and we can
have no better without greater hurt than benefit: Our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
being most against the by-offices, especially of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
and Burial.</p>

                  </gap>, 1. We think it unlawful to Covenant to <hi>use no other
Forms</hi> in publick Prayer. II. And unlawful to <hi>subscribe and
declare that it is faultless.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. For the first we have these Reasons. 1. The Bishops
themselves by the King's order, do upon special occasions of
Fasts and Thanksgivings, prescribe, impose and use other Forms?
and we must not covenant to disobey them. 2. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Ministers have and do in the Pulpits before Sermon use
other Forms: And so break this Covenant themselves.</p>
               <p>3. It belongs to the office of a Pastor, as well to word his
own Prayers as his own Sermons: And it is sinful to renounce
so much of the work of the Office which we are vowed and
ordained to.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>These instances are a clear exposition of the Canon, and shew
that by <hi>[no other Form]</hi> they intended not to exclude other Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayers,
or other Forms, prescribed by the Bishops.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. If the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> here also can speak
no more intelligibly, than by <hi>[no other Forms]</hi> to mean
only <hi>[till the Bishop prescribe it, and except your own daily Form
in the Pulpit]</hi> I would they would leave us to God's own Laws,
and not take on them to be necessary interpreters of its great
difficulties. If such men forbear that <hi>expounding,</hi> which they <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
others</hi> till they will do it better, the loss will be the less;
Scripture speaketh plainlier than this.</p>
               <p>2. But <hi>who</hi> giveth this exposition? To expound the Law
by a common obligatory Exposition, is proper to the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers:
He that maketh the words maketh not a Law if he
make not the sense; Judges make not the sense but decide
particular Cases by it as they understand it. The Canons
are made by the <hi>Convocation,</hi> which he that denyeth to be
the Representative Church of <hi>England,</hi> is Excommunicate.
The Pulpit Preachers, nor the particular Bishops are not the
<hi>Convocation,</hi> and therefore have not power to expound their
Canons, by any Common obligatory exposition; much less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the express words. Which way most of the Clergy went
under Bishop <hi>Parker, Grindal</hi> and <hi>Abbot,</hi> is well known: And
yet now they are so far from being taken for the Expositors
of the Churches sense, that they are openly scorned, as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
fautorer of Puritans, and those of their mind called <hi>Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizers.</hi>

II. But it is the second, that is the <hi>Trojan</hi> horse whose
name is Legion, I mean that hath many more evils in the
belly of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that we must profess that the three Books,
Articles, Liturgy and Ordination are so utterly faultless that
there is <hi>nothing in them Contrary to the word of God, and that we
Assent and Consent to all contained and prescribed</hi> in and by them.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>God's word is perfect and forbids the least faulty
errour, or defect. If we had never seen the Book, we know
that men made it, and that every one that made it had igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
error and sin, and can a <hi>perfect faultless</hi> volumn be made

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. I shall prove that that is not true. 2. That if it were
true it no whit amends the matter, nor maketh it lawful to
us.</p>
               <p>I. It is not true: For. 1. The words of the declaration are as
expresly <hi>universal</hi> as man can speak: And the foregoing words
<hi>[to the use]</hi> do speak but <hi>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fine,</hi> and the words of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<hi>de mediis:</hi> And all Lawyers agree that when the <hi>title
of</hi> a Law expresseth the <hi>End,</hi> that limiteth not the sense of
the words of the Law, because the <hi>Means</hi> may be larger than
the <hi>End.</hi> As the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act of Confinement is in the title to
<hi>keep Nonconformists</hi> from Corporations; And yet Lawyers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
that it extendeth also to <hi>Conformists,</hi> if one of them should
but once preach in a Conventicle. The Parliament and Prelates
thought that the way to secure the <hi>Vse,</hi> was to oblige them to
<hi>Assent and Consent to all in the Book contained and prescribed:</hi>
1. Therefore they ty all to declare in that <hi>same form of words,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59333:31"/>
and to add <hi>no other,</hi> least they should make any exposition
that limits them. 2. And the word <hi>Assent</hi> signifieth an Act
of the understanding, which must have Truth for its object.
3. And it is after exprest by the word <hi>[Approbation]</hi> whereas
a man may use that which he doth not <hi>approve</hi> of.</p>
               <p>2. Oaths, Covenants and Professions must be taken in the
most usual proper sense, unless another be exprest to be the
Imposers meaning; which is not here done, and the words are
most universal and without exception.</p>
               <p>3. And to put all out of doubt, the Parliament expounded
themselves. 1. At the making of the Act, this was debated,
and reasons given against the limited expressions, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.
2. Since then a new Act against Conventicles being
made, it was moved in the Lords House, that seeing Non-conformists
were thus far forbidden private worship, they
should be so far invited to Conformity, as that a Proviso
might be added to this Act, that the Declaration in the Act
of Uniformity should be understood to oblige men but to the
<hi>Vse</hi> of the things required: and the Commons rejecting that
<hi>Proviso,</hi> it came to a debate or conference between the two
Houses, where the Commons gave their reasons against that
sense and proviso: In which the Lords acquiesc't. Though
I was not present, the Parliament-men that were, reported this,
and I never met with man that contradicted it, or questioned
the truth of it.</p>
               <p>II. But if it were otherwise, it were to us never the better.
For, 1. It were an ignorant reproach of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to say that they have put any thing in their Liturgy
which is of <hi>no use.</hi> This will Include every syllable. They
themselves tell you in their Prefaces, what use the very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender,
and every other part are of. The use of the Articles
of Faith and Doctrines is our <hi>understanding,</hi> assent and belief
of them in order to Love and Practice. The use of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the Rubrick is to oblige us to obedient practice, and
so of all the rest. And to <hi>Assent, approve and Consent to every
thing contained and prescribed</hi> practically, even to the use of
them, is more than a bare speculative assent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Wherein lyeth the sin of such a Declaration?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. In general it is incredible, as I said before, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59333:32"/>
of the matter, and the Authors together: The Book
of Articles, Liturgie and Ordination are a big Volumn, and
contain great variety of matter, and that high and mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
The Authors were every one of them men of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that had ignorance, error and sin: And operation excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not power. Who dare say that any Sermon, or Prayer
that ever he maketh, hath nothing in it but what he may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and consent to: Much less so great a Book.</p>
               <p>2. The Articles which must be subscribed as faultless, say
<hi>Art. 15. [Christ alone is without sin—But all we the rest (though
baptized and born again in Christ) yet offend in many things, and
if we say that we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth
is not in us]</hi> And <hi>Art. 21. [General Councils. For as much they be
an Assembly of men whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and
Word of God, they may err, and sometimes have erred, even in
things pertaining to God].</hi> And are our Convocation more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
than General Councils? The Church must be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
in humility; and is it humility to say, we Bishops and
Priests having written three Books; he shall not preach
Christ's Gospel that will not declare that there is not a word
in them that is faulty, or repugnant to God's word, and will
not assent and consent to all therein.</p>
               <p>3. The Papists hereby scandalized, do scorn us, and say,
The question is not now of an Infallibility, or a Judge that
all must assent to. It is but <hi>who</hi> this <hi>Infaliible Iudge is:</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the Pope and a General Council, or the <hi>English</hi>
Convocation, which is liker to be of greater authority and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility;
we require no greater assent and consent of you to
the Canons of the Universal Church, than the State and
Church of <hi>England</hi> require to their Books.</p>
               <p>4. This seemeth to us to let the Articles, Liturgie and
Ordination Book above the Bible. 1. God himself hath not
made the assent and consent to every thing contained and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the Bible necessary to Salvation, or to the Ministry.
1. There are divers Books in our Bibles whose Divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
many have questioned, who yet were not for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded.
The Apochryphal books are yet controverted by men
tolerated on both sides. There are hundreds of various Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
where no one is necessitated to determine for this or that.

Translations are all faulty, being the work of faulty men:
And no wise men will declare that this or that or any Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation

God. And are our Bishops Books more faultless?</p>
               <p>5. It is a sin to Confederate with and Encourage such auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

<hi>Morley</hi> and Bishop <hi>Gunning</hi> yet living, whether this was the
sence, and I will take their answer.</p>
               <p>2. Then <hi>[Assent</hi> and <hi>Contained]</hi> had been put in in vain and
to deceive, if <hi>[Consent</hi> and <hi>Prescribed]</hi> signifie as much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. That it is a <hi>New Article</hi> of Faith. 2. That it is
arrogant and divisive, making a grand Controversie one Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

that declareth such assent. 4. It is a dangerous adding to the
Word of God.</p>

               <p>It is most expresly made such: What is an Article of

               <p>But how do you prove it to be new?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Because it was never made for us before; you have the
affirmative: If you say it was ever before, prove it. It's not
in the Bible, it's not in our 39 Articles, nor Creed.</p>

               <p>Are not the old words of the former Book to the same sense?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all: If they were why did the New Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alter them? The old words plainly signifie no more than
this that <hi>Infants baptized have all ex parte ministri,</hi> and may be
saved without Confirmation, Exorcism, Chrysme, Spittle,
Salt, Milk and Honey, and such other additions, supposing
him <hi>ex parte sui</hi> under the promise of Salvation, that is, to be
the seed of the Faithful: Though I verily believe that after
the making of the Common-prayer Book, our Canon-Makers
in <hi>Bancrofts</hi> dayes began to warp towards a worser sence.
But our Defenders of the Liturgy expound it as I say; and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59333:33"/>
the tenor of the words may tell the Reader that they meant
no more.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Tell me first where it is that your Controversie lyeth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I. Negatively, 1. It is not whether the Infant Seed of
one believing Parent should be Baptized: This is agreed on.</p>
               <p>2. It is not whether those may be dedicated to God as our
Children and baptized, who are Adopted, or any way made <hi>our
own Children,</hi> as <hi>Abrahams</hi> bought and born to him in his house
as his propriety were. Though we cannot say <hi>we are certain
of this,</hi> yet we will not contradict them that say they are.</p>
               <p>3. It is not whether Hypocrites Children have not so
far a right to Baptisme <hi>Coram Ecclesia</hi> as that the Minister
ought to baptize them if it be justly demanded.</p>
               <p>4. It is not whether there be a certainty of the Salvation
of all the baptized Infants of true faithful Christians, that
die before actual sin: Though all good Christians are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of this: yet with the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> we hold that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
have no just cause to doubt of it.</p>
               <p>5. It is not whether they may not be good men that think
all baptized ones absolutely in a state of Salvation. None of
these are the Controversie.</p>
               <p>II. But it is 1. Whether all Infants without exception that
be baptized, are saved if they then die.</p>
               <p>2. Whether this be certain by the Word of God.</p>
               <p>3. Whether all that be not undoubtedly certain of it, should
be no Ministers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But it is not said <hi>[All Infants],</hi> but <hi>[Infants]</hi> indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. There is no place of doubting of their universal
sence. For an <hi>Indefinite</hi> term <hi>in re necessaria</hi> is <hi>equal to an V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal.</hi>
And they except the unbaptized from Christian
Burial.</p>
               <p>2. It is <hi>Baptized Infants as such</hi> that they speak of, and
that under no other Character, nor with the least exception.
And a <hi>quatenus ad omnes valet argumentum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Canon commandeth Ministers to baptize <hi>all Infants
without exception that are brought to them on any Sundays or Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi>
to be <hi>baptized</hi> after the Manner of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59333:34"/>
4. <hi>I have spoken with the Bishops that brought in and
promoted this Article, and they own the</hi> universal <hi>sence, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the true form of Baptisme; and say, that as any</hi>
man hath right to take up an exposed Infant in the streets and take
it in, so hath any one to bring the Child of a Heathen, Infidel,
Atheist or Sadducee to baptisme.</p>
               <p>5. If they had meant it only of <hi>some</hi> baptized Infants and
not all, they knew the Non-conformists were of the same
mind; and then they would have told us, what sort they
mean.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I. And why may not an Article of Faith be newly declared?
we have not read the Fathers? It may not be unknown to them: And
I have heard that they are for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The most ancient Churches were so much employed in
baptizing the adult Converted from Infidelity, that we read
little or nothing expresly and particularly what they did about
Infants in Baptisme: They baptized none at age without
a serious Profession of true Faith and Repentance and holy
Dedication to Christ: They used to keep these as Learning
Catechumens long before they baptized them, save in case of
necessity near death. Therefore they had their set-times of
the year for baptizing (two or three times) as our Bishops
have now for ordaining. And after all this strict preparation,
they pronounced the baptized in a state of Salvation, but it
was only on supposition that he was a sincere penitent cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
Believer. Even <hi>Hildebrand</hi> (Pope <hi>Greg. 7.)</hi> in his
time concludeth that baptisme saveth none that dissemble or
have not the Faith and Repentance which they profess: which
the Papists do ordinarily confess, and Protestants much
more.</p>
               <p>And as for Infants, the Ancients compelled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not Christians
themselves to baptize them, but left them to their own
choice. <hi>Tertullian</hi> is for long delay till-they understand, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Cur festinat innocens at as: Greg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nazianzene</hi> would have
them stay at least three years: In danger of Death they alway
hastened: <hi>Augustine</hi> and many others that had Christian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
were not baptized till at Age. And they took Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
Infants, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, to be not unclean but holy, and would
receive others brought by such as adopted or owned them as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59333:34"/>
Pro-parents. But it was never the judgment of the ancient
Churches that all Heathens or Infidels Children have right
to Baptisme and Salvation if any will but offer them to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.
Much less that it is certain by Gods Word that all
such are saved.</p>
               <p>2. Articles of Faith are all contained in the Scripture, and
that is not new; therefore nothing that is new can be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith; nor can it be said to be newly declared which
was there from its beginning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>II. And why call you it arrogant and dividing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Because it presumptuously condemneth the Reformed
Churches and the Christian World, determining that to be so
certain by Gods Word, that none should doubt of it that will
be a Minister, when the Christian World is of many several
opinions about it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What be those Opinions about it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1. Some hold that the Covenant being the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
saving Covenant that is made to the faithful and their
Seed, and their Children expresly called <hi>Holy,</hi> they are all in
a state of pardon and salvation before baptisme, and baptisme
doth but celebrate and invest them in it before the Church;
and solemnly seal their Covenant right. And that this sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
right is given only to the seed of the sincerely faithful,
or at most to those that have such Pro-parents, though the
Seed of Hypocrites must be received by the Church, that know
not mens hearts. And this I take to be the Truth.</p>
               <p>2. Some others hold that this right to Salvation belongeth
to them that have Grand-fathers and Grand-mothers or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Ancestors that were truly Godly Christians.</p>
               <p>3. Some hold that it belongeth to all the Seed of professed
Christians how bad soever the Parents be.</p>
               <p>4. Some hold that it belongeth only to the Children of true
Believers that are baptized, but not to the unbaptized.</p>
               <p>5. Some hold that it belongeth to Hypocrites Children that
are baptized, but not to the unbaptized.</p>
               <p>6. Some hold that it belongeth to all baptized ones if they
have God-fathers that profess Christianity.</p>
               <p>7. Some hold that it belongeth to all baptized by a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Minister, for the Faith of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59333:35"/>
8. Some hold that it belongeth to none that by Baptism
are taken into any Congregation guilty of Heresie or
Schism.</p>
               <p>9. Some hold that it belongeth to all that are baptized by a
Minister who is ordained by Bishops that have uninterrupted
Canonical Succession, and not to others.</p>
               <p>10. Some hold that the Baptisme of a Lay-man or a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
may be effectual to the Salvation of such.</p>
               <p>11. Some Conformists hold that all Infants in the World
are saved, baptized and unbaptized.</p>
               <p>12. The most of the Papists hold that the baptized are
saved both from the pain of <hi>Sense</hi> and of <hi>Loss,</hi> but the
unbaptized are saved from the pain of sense only, but not
of loss; and so have neither Joy nor Sorrow.</p>
               <p>13. Many wise Men hold that Salvation is certain
according to the first Opinion to the Seed of Sincere
Believers, but that we have no certain notice at all,
what God will do with all the rest (baptized or unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized).</p>
               <p>14. Many think that God hath a certain number of
Infants Elect whom he will save, and will cast away
the rest, but that no man can know who they be;
though the Faithful may have some uncertain hopes for
their Children more than others, but no Promise.</p>
               <p>15. Some think that the Common state of Infants in
the Life to come is utterly unrevealed and unknown
to us.</p>
               <p>I do not say that none of these opinions should be disclaimed:
But among all which Learned, godly men of all Countries hold,
to say he that is not <hi>certain</hi> of <hi>some one of</hi> them as God's word
is unmeet to be a Minister is dividing arrogance, of men that
overvalue themselves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>III. How then can you make good your charge of falsehood?
May it not be true among many false ones?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I make it good two ways; men must say they are <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
that are not <hi>certain.</hi> 1. No man can be certain that God's
word saith that which it doth not say: But God's word
doth not say directly, or by consequence that all baptized
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59333:35"/>
dying Infants are undoubtedly saved. He that saith there is
such a word, let him produce it.</p>
               <p>It is suspicious that these same men that subscribe, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is necessary to Salvation, but what is contained in the
Scripture, or may be proved by it, would impose this belief
on us, and never tell us so much as by a Marginal citation
of any one text of Scripture where it may be found. All that
ever by talk I could hear of them is, <hi>Gal. 3. 26, 27. Ye are
all the children of God by faith in Christ Iesus, for as many of you
as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.</hi> As if they
would have us believe. 1. That all Atheists and Infidels chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
have <hi>faith in Christ Iesus</hi> if they be but baptized. 2. Or
that all the <hi>Galathians</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to were in a state of
certain Salvation, when it is apparent that he spake to the
adult, whom elsewhere he saith he feareth lest he have bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on them labour in vain, and as bewitched men, they had
disobeyed the truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Or that all that put on Christ Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally
by Profession and Baptism were in a state of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
salvation, even <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> How commonly when
they confute the Separatists, that alledge the titles of <hi>Saints,
holy, children of God, &amp;c.</hi> given to all the Churches by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
do they themselves expound it of a sanctity of <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
and <hi>Relation</hi> as distinct from a saving state of Grace, as
to many of the visible members of the Church. And must we
now believe that the <hi>visible</hi> and the <hi>invisible</hi> membership are of
equal extent. If this prove that all the baptized adult have put
on Christ savingly, and have right to Heaven, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the universal Church that hath ever believed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and it will be good news to all worldly hypocrites:
But St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>It is not the putting away the filth of the
flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience to God.</hi> And he told <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Magus</hi> that he had no part in that matter, not for apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy,
but because his heart was not right in the sight of God.
And sure it is no streight gate by which men enter into a
state of Salvation, if all the hypocrite flagitious sinners are
in it, that will but be baptized.</p>
               <p>But if this Text say not that all adult hypocrites bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
so dying are saved, much less doth it say it of all the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59333:36"/>
children of them, and of all Infidels that are baptized. Is
this to give us proof of <hi>undoubted certainty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They alledge also <hi>Mar. 16. 16. He that believeth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
shall be saved,</hi> what then. <hi>Ergo,</hi> all Infants that are
baptized, that neither believe, nor are the seed of believers
shall be saved. This is a new Gospel, and no proof that the
authors of it say true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another is</hi> Ioh. 3. 3, 5. Except a man be born again of water
and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. <hi>Doth
this prove that all are born again of the Spirit that are
baptized? Is this proving by God's word.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What is your other proof, that it's a false profession of them
that declare Assent to this Doctrine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>2. It is this. He that saith a thing is <hi>undoubtedly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
by <hi>God's word</hi> which <hi>God's word contradicteth,</hi> doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
speak falsely. But so doth he that maketh this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
               <p>That God's word <hi>contradicteth</hi> it, I have proved so fully
in my two Disputations of original sin, and my Treatise
of Infant Baptism, and <hi>Methodus Theologia,</hi> that I must not here
repeat it, <hi>viz.</hi> by abundance of plain Texts that appropriate
the Covenant-blessings to the Faithful and their Seed, and
exclude or curse the seed of the wicked, at least as out of
the Covenant of God: I will now repeat but one. 1 <hi>Cor. 7.
14. Else were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> If the
children of Infidels are not holy but unclean, they have no
right to the promise of Life, or to the Seal and Investiture
by Baptism. But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>I know Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> will have Holiness here to be nothing
but <hi>[the Church useth to baptize such on presumption that they will
be educated to Christianity:]</hi> and <hi>uncleanness</hi> to be but <hi>[the
Churches use to refuse such,</hi> supposing they will <hi>not be so educated.</hi>
And so that the Seed of the Faithful have no special promise of
pardon and life. But, 1. I have as aforecited and to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi>
proved many such promises to the Seed of the Faithful,
which Divines should not unthankfully like Anabaptists deny.</p>
               <p>2. And I ask such Doctors what baptism doth for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
at present and on what account? Doth it put them
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59333:36"/>
in a present right to Salvation? If not, why are they at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
baptized, when God instituted no baptism but one, which
is for signification and investiture in the <hi>present remission of sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi>
And so saith the Liturgie: And if so then on what account
is an Infant saved? Is it meerly because another undertaketh
to teach him hereafter? No man can undertake that he shall
believe or live. If he could, that would but prove that he
shall be pardoned when be believeth and not before. And
if all Infants, whom any Christian will undertake hereafter
to teach, though they never <hi>live</hi> to be taught, or will never
<hi>believe,</hi> be by this put into a present right to Salvation, a
stranger's undertaking of meer teaching upon utter uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of life and success, is supposed to have such a promise
which yet these Doctors deny to be made on the accounts
of their own parents interest in Christ and them; and his
dedicating them to Christ. And if these promising Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
be meer Lyers, the Child is supposed to be baptizable
and savable by it.</p>
               <p>But if they say that the right to Salvation comes, <hi>ex opero
operato,</hi> by meer baptizing, whether the Child have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
or not, I answer, that a prophanation of God's ordinance
is not a saving act: God hath said no such thing, but that
the Children of Infidels are <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>unholy,</hi> and doth not
say except some body will baptize them. And why should
not the Church baptize as many Infidels Children as they
can catch up, though none undertake for them, if baptizing
them do certainly save them if they so die.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore that seeing no man can be certain that
all the baptized Children of Heathens, Infidels, Jews, Atheists
or Diabolists are in a state of Salvation, God never promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it, but saying the contrary, whoever professeth this <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
certainty,</hi> speaketh falsely, that which he hath not.</p>

               <p>This is to jest with holy things? To be <hi>certain</hi> is to

doth therefore affirm that he knoweth it to be so, and is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59333:37"/>
                  <hi>subjectively certain,</hi> if he mean that it is evident and certain
to <hi>others</hi> and not to him, it's a contradiction: for if he know
it not to be certain he cannot tell that another doth.</p>

               <p>1. I have proved that no man is certain of it, 2. Judge
by all the rest of their wisedom, whether every Youth that
comes for Ordination from the Universities, be so much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
than we, that they are certain of this which we think
uncertain or false. Judge by their other qualifications, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the seven thousand Ministers that declared their assent
to the Book before they ever saw it, are like to be certainer
than the two thousand that were cast out: And are they
certain of this that are uncertain of many great and weighty
truths through ignorance?</p>
               <p>3. Yea many Conformists and Papists, say that <hi>Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi>
cannot be proved by Scripture, but by Tradition. And
can Ten thousand Ministers then be certain by <hi>Scripture</hi> that
baptized Infants are saved? How gross a contradiction is
this?</p>
               <p>4. And judge farther of the credit and modesty of such
men: some Divines say that Faith it self hath not evidence,
and that he that doubteth of Christianity and the Life to
come may be saved, if his belief of it be but strong enough to
make him trust and prefer it before all this world. And I
hear their greatest Divines say that few would be saved if
none but they that are <hi>undoubtedly certain</hi> of the Life to come,
and of the truth of the Gospel should be saved. And yet all
must be cast or kept out of the Ministry that will not affirm
that they are more certain of a <hi>hard Controversie</hi> if not of an
<hi>untruth,</hi> than Christ requireth us to be of our very Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>

upon them. How terribly are false Prophets threatned that

by God's word that they are undoubtedly</hi> saved, and when they

M.</hi> I. Negatively, we are not at all against the
old sort of <hi>Patrimi,</hi> Susceptors, or Sponsors that were used
at Baptism in the ancient Churches; though we think it but a
prudential thing, and not of necessity to Baptism.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>At first, the adult were themselves Baptized: for their
Children had no right till the Parent was a Christian. And
for three hundred years Christians were under Heathen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution;
in which some forsook Christ for fear by apostasie,
and others died while their Children were in Infancy, who
were thereby exposed to desertion, or to Infidel Education.
Wherefore to secure the Education of these Infants, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sceptors
that joyned with the Parents as their Seconds. 1. Did
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59333:38"/>
testifie their opinions of the Parents, as serious Christians,
not like to apostatize. 2. And did promise that if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
either die or apostatized, they should undertake the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Education. But if the Parents were dead already, they
undertook to Educate the Child themselves as their own. But
they were Sponsors for no Infidels Child, unless they first
adopted him, or took him for their own.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>And what doth our Godfathers differ from this, for which you
take them to be sinful, or not approveable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The difference is so great, and maketh so great a change
in our Christening, as I am loath to name to you. 1. With
us godly Christian Parents themselves, are forbidden to be
Godfathers with the rest, and to speak one word, much more
to profess that they dedicate them in Covenant to Christ:
Nor must the Minister urge the Parent to be present: lest his
consent seem necessary.</p>
               <p>2. The Godfathers and Godmothers are neither tyed to
bring the Children of Christians only, nor only such as they
take for their own; but without difference may bring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of any Atheists, Sadducees, Jews, Infidels, or open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Christ and godliness, without taking them for their
own.</p>
               <p>3. They personate the Child in promising and professing
in his name, without authority so to do.</p>
               <p>4. They do not only promise what the Child shall do hereafter
but they at present profess that the Child by them, or they
personating it, do Believe, renounce sin, and desire Baptism:
As if the Child were bound to do this by himself or by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>5. Godfathers too commonly covenant for the future Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Child, themselves to do it or cause it to be done,
which they neither ever purposed to perform, or ever made
the Parents believe that they intended; and so make Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nening
a perfidious Vowing, or Covenanting with God: These
are not things indifferent, I think.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>1. How prove you that the Parents may not be prime cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters,
or Sponsors for their own Children? Are not they obliged
to get Godfathers and Godmothers for them? who are supposed to
come by their procurement? And doth not that signifie their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to what these are to undertake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59333:38"/>
                  <hi>M.</hi> It signifieth only that the Law constraineth them to
let their Children be baptized, to avoid their own punishment,
and to get others to enter them into the Christian Covenant.
But not that they either are Christians, or consent to that
Covenant themselves, either for themselves, or Children. For</p>
               <p>1. Known Atheists, Infidels, and Sadducees that deny Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
are bound by the Law to get Godfathers for their
Childrens Baptism, as well as Christians; and such cannot be
supposed to covenant for them with Christ themselves. The
Sixty eight and Sixty nine Canons command Ministers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
no Child that is brought, nor to refuse or delay to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
in private in case of danger who ever desireth him to
do it.</p>
               <p>2. The Twenty nine Canon saith <hi>[No Parent shall be urged
to be present, nor be admitted to answer as Godfather for his own
Child: Nor any Godfather or Godmother shall be suffered to make
any other answer or speech than by the Book of Common-Prayer is
prescribed in that behalf]</hi> The Parent may say what he will to
God in secret. But at the Christening of his Child, if he
should but say <hi>[I believe God's promise to the faithful</hi> and their
seed: <hi>I do devote my Child to Christ, and engage him in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
or I promise to educate him to Christianity]</hi> he breaketh the
Canon, and goeth against the Churches Law. I did before
the Bishops at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> 1661. put the case to them, thus
without fiction: An Infidel of my Parish that useth openly
to talk against the Scripture and Life to come, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
inconveniencies, resolveth to send his Child to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized;
and I must not refuse it by the Law: Hath the Child
right to Baptism, and is it undoubtedly saved? Dr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson</hi>
in the Chair answered, <hi>nemime contradicente,</hi> that if he
brought him with Godfathers according to the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> I need not doubt it. But there were but two in
the Parish that openly declared themselves to be of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and those two being his familliers are likest to be the
Godfathers. If the Child have not Right for Infidel Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
sake, how can Infidel neighbours, called <hi>Godfathers,</hi> give
him right.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But the Canon saith that the Godfathers shall be only such as
have received the Sacrament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59333:39"/>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Alas none are forwarder than these to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and laugh at it, and say they will obey the Church.
Yet I doubt not but a faithful Parent may be present if he
will, and may tell the Godfathers in private, that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
shall signifie his devoting act; and when the Priest spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to the Godfathers, he may bow his head whether the
Priest will or not, to signifie that act of his. But this is
nothing to the sense of the Church, nor to our Assent and
Consent to their exclusion of the Parent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I confess it sounds to me as unnatural. But what is your other
reason against our sort of Godfathers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. My second Reason is, that it is a prophanation of
this great and sacred Ordinance, to invest those in the
visible state Christianity (and Salvation pretendedly) that
have no right to such investiture, so they have but Godfathers
they are to baptize the children of any Jews, or Heathens,
or open enemies to Christ, as well as of Christians; which is
a manifest prophanation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What is the fault of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. It supposeth a <hi>false Doctrine,</hi> that Infidel Children
are within the Covenant, and may be baptized as well as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
which in the Books aforecited, I have fully disproved.</p>
               <p>2. It is a dangerous adding to God's word and worship.</p>
               <p>3. It is a deceiving of mens Souls as to childrens state, to
make them believe that their children dying when baptized
are all saved, how bad soever the Parents be</p>
               <p>4. It is a dreadful belying of God, and prophanation of
his name, if men shall in the name of God pronounce pardon
and salvation to those whom he never gave them to.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But God will not punish the Children for their Parents sin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Not those that see their fathers sins and forsake them,
and live not as their Parents did: and that's all that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith for such. But if you will read my two foresaid
Disputations for Original sin you will see it fully proved that
God punisheth Infants, because they are the guilty, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
seed of guilty and corrupt Parents. Do you believe our
Church Articles and yet deny original sin? If Infants have no
guilt and sin what need have they of Baptism, or of a Saviour?
If they have need of both, sure it is for no actual sin done by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59333:39"/>
them, was not the World lost for <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin? Was not <hi>Cain</hi>'s
posterity cursed for his sake? Were not all the Infants of
the old World, and all the Infants of the <hi>Sodamites</hi> burnt
with fire from Heaven, and the Infants of the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
and <hi>Amalakites,</hi> &amp;c. killed for their Parents sin. Did not
Christ tell the Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. that all their Forefathers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
should be punished on that Generation? The Jews
knew this that said, <hi>His blood be on us and on our Children.</hi> Our
Liturgy saith, <hi>Remember not Lord our offences nor the offences of
our Forefathers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. And yet I tell you, that it is for their <hi>own sin</hi> that the
seed of the wicked perish, sin is made their own, when soul and
body were for guilty corrupt Parents, made such by themselves.
I do not say that God imputeth their Parents infidelity to
them. But this infidelity is the reason of their not being
delivered from their own original guilt. If Rebels forfeit
Life and Estate, and so their Children live in beggery, and
the King offer to restore Father and Children, if the Father
will thankfully accept his grace: If the Parent refuse this,
his Children will be beggars. Not because the King punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them for their Fathers fault, but because he first deprived
himself of the Estate which he should have left them, and
next because he refused to deliver them. If a Father will
set the Pox on his children, and after refuse a Physician that
would cure him and them, the Physician doth not punish the
children.</p>
               <p>All Scripture and Nature tell the world that it is so deep
an interest that Parents have in children, as being causes of
their very essence by Communication from their own essence,
and it is so natural a power that Parents have over their
children, that it should seem no strange thing to Christians, or
Infidels, that God maketh a very great difference between the
seed of the faithful and of the Infidels and wicked: And its
strange that any men should rather lay their title to pardon
and salvation upon a meer neighbour or stranger that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
is a wicked wretch himself, than on the Parents of the
child.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But will God save children for their Parents Faith?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59333:40"/>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If he destroy Infants for <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, do you think that
Justice is so much more extensive then Mercy, that he will
shew no mercy for Parents sake? But the case is this, Christ
the Second <hi>Adam</hi> hath merited pardon and salvation to be given
conditionally to all: Not absolutely, for then all would be
saved: What the condition is to the adult, we are agreed,
<hi>viz.</hi> Faith and Repentance and Dedication to Christ by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
consent: And do you think that Infants pardon and
salvation hath no condition? If none, than all Infants are
saved; if any condition, what is it? 1. Is it barely that they be
<hi>baptized</hi> without any right but what all have. This is an
injurious fiction, God never said it: And its an unreasonable
imputation on God, as if he would save thousands meerly for
<hi>water and words,</hi> and comdemn thousands that had not the
opportunity of these. And it is certain that Christians ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dream'd of this absurd opinion, or else godly Emperours
would have forced Baptism on the children of all their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Subjects, and would where their conquering Armies came
in Charity have catcht up their children and baptized them. And
Bishops and Doctors would have taught and intreated them so
to do. To make meer baptising alone the condition of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
salvation, is to lay Heaven on such a ceremony quite
out of the Infants power, as would but tempt the rational
Infidels to deride Christianity. No sober men lay a childs
<hi>Estate</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> on such a thing.</p>
               <p>2. If there must be some condition of Right to Baptism
antecedent to it, what is it. 1. It is not actual faith in that
Infant, that understands not? 2. It must then be some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
act or nothing? If anothers, whose should it be so
likely as the parents from whom the Children have their
essence? Whom nature hath taught to take them as almost
parts of themselves; and so hath the custom of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and who are obliged above all other to provide for
them, and whose will in their Infancy disposeth of them
till they come to have a rational will of their own (in act:)
And Scripture from end to end confirmeth this.</p>
               <p>But besides this you know not whither to look for a title-conditione,
unless to some Pro-parent, whose the child is,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59333:40"/>
upon the Parents Death or Resignation. For 1. If you say
it is the Faith of the <hi>Church</hi> (as some) that giveth the Child
Title, what Church mean you? The Universal, or National
or Diocesan or Parochial. And how doth the Church give
right to Pardon and Life to Infidels Children. If it be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>volendo,</hi> as if Heaven were at their Will, why do they not
sit at home, and make a deed of Gift of Heaven to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
at the <hi>Antipodes</hi> and of all the World: If it be by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
them, I shewed before that Baptism meerly as such,
doth it not. And if it be the Will of the Baptizer they must
mean the Priest, Deacon or another: And to say that these
are the Terms of Infant Title to Baptism and Salvation, that
if the Priests will they shall be baptized and saved; or else
not, seemeth a New Gospel.</p>
               <p>2. But it seems with us it is the God-fathers that give them
Title, else the Church could save them when they will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Godfathers: And if so, where is the proof of it, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Reason, that God will accept and save Infants because
a meer Neighbour will bring them to be baptized, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
to bring them up well if they live. It is supposed
that these Sponsors own not the Children, and how come
they then to have the power to be their Representatives,
and to dispose of their Souls?</p>

               <p>Where is that deed of Gift to be found. It is not a
Forgery? He hath made a Covenant to the Faithful and their
Seed. But where hath he said, I will save all Infidels Children,
if any Priest or Christian will but Baptize them? He that said
<hi>Go to the high-wayes and hedges and compel them to come in,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
the Refusers, and required none but perswading com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion:
And its Parents that have power of their Children.
He that can believe to day that God hath made a Gift of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to all Infants that any body will baptize, may easily
believe to morrow that he will not cast away the rest meerly
because no Carrier will bring them in, or because no body will
wash them and say over them the words of Baptisme. God

               <p>I have told you while I opened the former. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonate
the Child without Authority: And it is a great doubt
whether the Covenant and Baptisme were not a meer Nullity,
did not Parents besides the Laws of Conformity some way
signifie their own Agency therein. If any Neighbour should
make a Covenant in the name of your Child, binding him at
Age to Marry an Heiress, who hath a Lordship to her Portion,
would this either oblige your Son, or give him any present
right to her or her Estate?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>If the Donor or person empowered Consent, it giveth a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
right, which becometh Actual when he marrieth her; and so
here if God consent its so far valid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>God hath given Christ and Life conditionally to all
before they believe or are baptized: But all must not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be baptized: This is not <hi>Actual Right,</hi> and so such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
have no right by this Rule, till they believe in Christ.
But Baptisme is an actual Marriage with Christ, and its a
Mockery where neither Party doth consent. Christ doth not
consent: for he hath made no Promise but to the faithful and
their Seed. Let them that affirm more, show it. The Infant
doth not consent, having no Will of his own in Act, and the
thing being done by one that had no power to personate or
oblige him. And he may say, It was no act of mine, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
or Legally.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Any one may accept a gift for another, and bind him to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
which if he refuse he forfeits it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If the Donor give it on those Terms, it's true. And if
you can prove that God hath made his Covenant Gift of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and Salvation to all the Seed of Infidels, Atheists and
Wicked Men, on Condition that any body will but Accept it
in their names at present, and bind them to accept it at Age,
it will then I confess prove a valid act of Charity: And I see
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59333:41"/>
not but why some good man should say <hi>[Lord, I accept of Christ
and Salvation for all the Infants on Earth, and I bind them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it when they come to Age; and I hope the meer want of washing
shall not deprive them of that which I have power to accept for them]</hi>
I never heard of valid contracts made for Infants by any one
that will but pretend to personate them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Thus you would make rebaptizing necessary, if such Baptism
be a nullity.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. Not to any whose Parents, though besides the Laws
of Conformity own their agency, and dedicating their own
child to Christ, which I hope is the case of most, custom
through God's mercy teacheth them better than the Canons
and Common-Prayer-Book.</p>
               <p>2. And I think not to any other, whose Parents in Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and themselves at Age do own the Covenant, and think
that it was valid Baptism. For to such the end of Baptism
is attained. If it were no Minister, or were one unautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
that baptized him, it would not be a meer nullity as
to the ends, if by mistake it were supposed well done. <hi>Factum

               <p>What is your fourth Objection against our way of Baptism?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>That in personating the Child, they say that they (and
so he by them) doth at present <hi>Believe, renounce, desire,</hi> &amp;c.
falsely intimating that <hi>Infants are bound at present to do this
by another:</hi> And yet the same men plead that God doth
not accept him for the Faith of his Parents; As if his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
Faith were his, and not his <hi>Parents:</hi> when as God
requireth no Faith, or Repentance of Infants, but only that
<hi>[They be the Seed of penitent Believers, devoted to Christ.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in the Catechism it is said that</hi> [Repentance and Faith
are required of persons to be Baptized.] <hi>(And Repentance and
Faith have a promise of Life) and that Infants</hi> who cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
these are Baptized because they promise them by their Sureties,
which promise when they come to Age themselves are bound to perform.</p>
               <p>Where note that the former Book had <hi>[They perform them
by their Sureties]</hi> They perceived that having said <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Repentance</hi> are <hi>requisite:</hi> Infants they saw must <hi>have at present</hi>
what is <hi>requisite</hi> at <hi>present:</hi> And they knew that they had
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59333:42"/>
them not themselves; and so were fain to hold that the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
Faith and Repentance was theirs, and a performance of that
required condition. But our new Bookmakers saw that this
would not hold, and so they say, <hi>Though Faith and Repentance
be required of persons to be baptized, yet Infants are baptized because
they promise them by their Sureties to be hereafter performed;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the former errour by a greater, or a double one.
1. Granting that Faith and Repentance are pre-requisit, and yet
confessing that Infants have neither, of their own or Sureties
imputed to them; and yet are to be baptized: 2. Or making
a <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>future Faith and Repentance</hi> to be <hi>present Faith</hi> and
<hi>Repentance.</hi> 3. Or like the <hi>Antimonians</hi> that say, all that are
Elected to believe hereafter are justified before they believe,
so they imitate that; though Faith and Repentance be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<hi>in baptizandis,</hi> yet God at present will justifie and save all
that have it not in infancy, because they promise it hereafter.
All plain contradictions: as if they said, it is requisite in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to be baptized, and it is not requisite.</p>

               <p>Alas, the worst is yet behind. The common Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
that is committed under the name of Godfathers Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
Vows and Covenants: Baptism is one of the greatest
actions of all our Religion and Lives. Our rising from Death
to Life; our visible new Birth, our solemn Covenanting
with God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost: Our solemn
Translation from darkness to light, and from the power of
Satan unto God, that we may receive remission of Sin, and
inheritance among the Sanctified: What more holy, great and
venerable action can be done by mortal man, than to enter a
solemn Covenant with God and our Redeemer, in which we
wholly give up our selves to him, and Covenant for a holy
Life, and are to receive the pardon of all sin, and the
gift of Grace, and right to Everlasting Glory: And if men
turn this great Ordinance which is the Summ of all our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59333:42"/>
into perfidiousness and mockery, how heinous sin must
this needs be?</p>
               <p>And here let us consider, I. Who these Godfathers in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
usually be. II. What they do, III. How they perform
what they Vow and undertake.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> They are usually some of the Parents Friends.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>They are usually such as these: 1. The poor that have
no rich Friends do sometimes intreat a poor neighbour to do
the office, and sometimes hire any man that will do it: Which I
never knew tell in <hi>London,</hi> by begging they made me understand
that men do it as Labourer's work for their wages: About half a
Crown is the ordinary pay of Beggers, or very poor Folks
Godfathers. But the Poor and Middling sort do use to try some
rich Friend or Neighbour; if they have any such, in hopes of
some small gift; some give us for the Child a Shilling, some
half a Crown, some a silver Spoon. The Richer sort seek to
persons rather above than below their Rank, in expectation of
a piece of Plate, or some such bigger gift. And in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Princes are Godfathers to Children whom they never
see, nor perhaps the Land of their nativity: And with us it is
very often some that dwel not very near, who oft sevre as Proxy
to stand in their place, and they only give the expected gift
and bear the name.</p>
               <p>II. What they are to do, I told you before, 1. To personate
the Child, and take on them to say as in his name <hi>[I believe,
I renounce, I desire]</hi> when they are <hi>three</hi> and the Child but one,
and so three persons by fiction represent <hi>one,</hi> and say that <hi>He
doth</hi> that which <hi>he doth not,</hi> either, <hi>per se vel per alios.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>They Vow or promise solemnly to do all the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
named. Ch.</hi> 4. Numb. 7. <hi>viz.</hi> To see that the Child be taught
as soon as he shall be able to learn what a solemn Vow, Promise
and Profession <hi>he made by</hi> them; and that they call on him to hear
Sermons, and chiefly that they provide that he may learn, the Creed, the
Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments in the Vulgar Tongue, and
<hi>All other things</hi> that a Christian ought to know and believe to his
Souls health, and that he be virtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>usly brought up to lead a Christian
and Godly life. <hi>All this they solemnly undertake to God and
the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:59333:43"/>
III. And so far are they usually from performing it. That 1. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet knew one Parent that expected any such thing from
them, or that ever seriously asked them, Do you understand
what you are to promise? and do you resolve to do it.</p>
               <p>2. I never in all my life knew one Godfather that made the
Parent before hand believe that he intended any such thing.</p>
               <p>3. If he had, it's not credible that three persons should all
intend to educate one child of another man's, and perform it?</p>
               <p>4. Nor did I yet ever know to this 68th. year of my age,
one Godfather that before adopted the child, or took him for
his own, and took him home with him, unless he was a Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
and did it as <hi>such</hi> and not as <hi>Godfather;</hi> much less could
all three do it.</p>
               <p>4. Nor did I ever to this day know one man or woman
that performed this which all three undertake. A very few I
have known that will ask <hi>How doth my Godson,</hi> and say, <hi>you
must be a good Boy and learn your Book,</hi> and perhaps give him a
piece of Silver: But usually they never look after them.</p>
               <p>I confess with shame that I have been Godfather to four;
to one when I was a Child and knew not what I did, but
thought, it was only to be a Witness of Baptism. And to
three more when I was twenty three years of age; of all
which I agreed beforehand with the Parents to be but a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that they should stand there themselves as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers
and signifie it. Two of these I never saw since; a
third now dead, I never saw since his Infancy till a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he dyed, and the fourth never since till that lately he
came a begging to me.</p>
               <p>I confess one Bishop told me once that he knew one or more
that had performed this Vow, so did never I, who have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in many parts of the Land. Those that perform it not,
sure are guilty of heinous perfidiousness; as breaking so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
a Vow to God. And if this be so common in <hi>England</hi>
that to this Age I could never know of one performer, is not
the case doleful and dreadful; that the Nation should by such
perfidiousness be made Christians?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But this is the Parents or Godfathers fault: what's this to
the Minister, or to your Assent and Consent?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59333:43"/>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If it be not nothing to the <hi>Canons</hi> and to the <hi>Liturgy,</hi>
it is not nothing to him that must <hi>Assent and Consent to all
things in that Liturgy, and must swear Canonial obedience.</hi> And
1. Do you think that the Nation can so commonly live in
this sin, and the Church Governours and Orders be innocent
in it. Can those Canons and Orders be blameless that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more opposition, let such perfidiousness go to our
Christening? Can the medicine be laudable that so many mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
in the use of it?</p>
               <p>2. By the Canon all men are constrained to get some God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
and they can force none that is unwilling.</p>
               <p>3. No <hi>Conscionable</hi> persons will <hi>Promise and undertake</hi> that which
they never purpose to perform. I never in all my life met
with one godly man, that if you opened all the undertaking
plainly to him, would say seriously, <hi>I am resolved to do all this?</hi>
but would refuse the office when he knows it is expected.</p>
               <p>3. If there be hundreds or thousands in a Parish that are
grosly ignorant of the nature of Baptism, and what they do,
or that ere Atheists, Infidels, wicked men not Excommunicate,
the Minister can not deny to take them for Godfathers, if
they did but ever once receive the Sacrament. And to this
68th year of my age, I never knew one Godfather, or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
questioned or refused by any Minister.</p>
               <p>4. If the Parent can get no man to stand, he shall be ruined
for it, as not bringing his Child to be Baptized according to
the order of the Church.</p>
               <p>5. Rich men will not give up their Children to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's
propriety or education. Poor mens Children none
will take. And is it lawful to Assent and Consent to such
orders of Baptism as cherish this?</p>
               <p>If Parents were the undertakers we might urge them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
<hi>But from such others who can expect it.</hi>

3. The Godfathers and Godmothers only are to speak and
covenant; without which it is no Baptism: Meer washing
without Covenanting is no Christian Baptism, so that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> doth make <hi>Godfathers essential</hi> to it. And
what it is to <hi>add</hi> to the <hi>Essentials</hi> of so great an Ordinance of
God as was instituted by Christ's own mouth, for so high an
use as our Espousal to himself; judge you. 4. The Canon to
which all must subscribe, saith <hi>[that he himself will use the form

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. Did I not before tell you why? 2. Suppose they
scrupled it through mistake? shall every mistake or errour of
Parents deprive the child of Baptism? I'll tell you why I
dare no more <hi>Assent and Consent</hi> to this, than I dare consent
to cut off a hand or foot of every such child.</p>
               <p>1. Baptising is Christening, and dare I causelessly deprive
a Soul of visible Christianity?</p>
               <p>2. They themselves make it an <hi>Ascertaining means</hi> of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the forementioned Rubrick sheweth. And would
they have us shut Infants from Salvation for nothing? yea
they seem to confine Salvation only to the baptized, while
they conclude that they are saved <hi>as baptized ones,</hi> and except
the unbaptized from Christian Burial: The best can be but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59333:44"/>
to leave them as without any promise of life from Christ:
And how can we believe that God will give them that which
he never promised them. And shall I damn souls for want of
a humane unnecessary, if not corrupt invention.</p>
               <p>3. It is against the interest of Christ and the Church? shall
I make a Covenant to rob Christ and the Church of visible
Members for nothing? Murthering Infants is death by God's
Laws and mans? And Innocents day is one of the Christmas
Holy days. And is it a thing indifferent for me and all the
Ministers of the National Church, to make a solemn bargain
that we Assent and Consent to keep out all from the Church
and from the Covenant (and in their sense the hope) of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

               <p>Many a hundred in my time. The Law refuseth them,
and it is in vain for the Parents to send them to a Minister
who they know hath solemnly covenanted to reject them.
Hundreds have been baptized by Nonconformists, because
the Church refuseth them.</p>
               <p>2. And as to their compelling men to get Godfathers I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
1. Those that think it a sin will not obey that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,
but rather suffer. 2. If any yield against conscience
to escape suffering, such compulsion doth but drive them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
damnation. 3. But those that yield to it by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
do but seem to do it, and do it not: For they agree
before hand with the Godfathers, to represent them, and
speak in their names, and to be themselves no undertakers.
Though all this is very hard shifting.</p>

Canons and subscribe to all this, are the sharp condemners
of Schism and Anabaptistry. 1. What is Schism, if this be not,
causelessly to keep out so many from the Church? And have

not the Anabaptists a far more excusable pretence to deny
the baptizing of Infants, than this in question is: The case
is of great difficulty to them, and it is Christ's will that they
doubt of. But here is no difficulty? And these men set the
will and devise of man against Christ, who said <hi>Forbid them
not,</hi> and <hi>was Angry with those that forbad them to come to him.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, no doubt; for our Church holdeth that there are but two,
and disowneth the five Roman Sacraments. And yet I think most of
them may be called Sacraments, especially Ordination, and Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
(and so may the Kings Coronation) but not Sacraments of the
Covenant of Grace.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Let us now enquire. 1. What a Sacrament of the
Covenant of Grace is. 2. Whether our crossing be not such.</p>
               <p>I. The Romans used the word <hi>[Sacraments]</hi> for an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
obliging covenanting ceremony: especially for the Act of
soldiers ceremony by binding themselves to military relation
and fidelity to their captains. A Sacrament of the covenant of
grace is an outward visible Act or ceremony; by which we oblige
our selves in covenant to Christ as our Saviour, promising fidelity
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59333:45"/>
and by which we are told by Christs ministers, that his Grace
is signified which is given by his Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Catechism indeed saith</hi> [It is an outward and visible sign
of an inward and spiritual grace, given to us, ordained by Christ
himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to
assure us thereof.]</p>
               <p>But it's obvious to any man of reason, that the words <hi>[Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by Christ himself]</hi> signifie not a Sacrament as such, but
<hi>[as Divine]</hi> distinct from humane. Else it were impossible for
man to be guilty of making false humane Sacraments: If they
should make more, just such as Baptism and the Lords Supper,
they would be no sinful Sacraments, if none be Sacraments
but Christs.</p>
               <p>If there be all these things, there is a Sacrament of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace falsely instituted by man. 1. If there be an
outward visible sign. 2. If both the purchased and conveyed
Grace of the Covenant of Christ be signified by it. 3. And
so signified as to be an instituted means of conveying it. 4. If
it be a sign obliging the covenanting person to his Covenant
duty. 5. And if thus it be a symbol, or badge of the Order
professed.</p>
               <p>I. The outward visible sign is crossing, or the transient
Image of a Cross, made by one that acteth as a Minister of
Christ by his pretended Commission, and received in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
by the baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. The thing signified is both the work of Redemption
purchasing grace, and grace given by that purchase: Both
these are fully expressed</hi> Can. 30. [The holy Ghost by the mouthes
of the Apostle did honour the name of the Cross, so far that under it
he comprehended not only Christ crucified, but the force, effect and
merits of his death and passion, with all the comforts, fruits and
promises which we receive or expect thereby: The Church of <hi>England</hi>
hath retained still the sign of it in baptism, following therein the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
and Apostolical Churches, and accounting it a lawful outward
ceremony and honourable badge, whereby the Infant is dedicated to
the Service of him that dyed on the Cross, as by the words of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer
book may appear] <hi>which words are</hi> [we receive this
Child into the Congregation of Christ's Flock, and do sign him with
the Sign of the Cross, in token that he shall not be ashamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59333:46"/>
the faith of Christ crucified, and manfully to fight under his
banner against sin, the world and the devil, and to continue Christ's
faithful Souldier and Servant to his lifes end. Amen] <hi>And in the
Preface of Ceremonies</hi> [They serve to a decent order, and godly
discipline, and such as be apt to stir up the dull mind of man to the
remembrance of his duty to God by some notable and spiritual significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereby he may be edified.]</p>
               <p>So that the thing signified is Christ crucified with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of his Cross, and the Grace of edification by stirring
up our dull minds by the moral causality of the cause, and
binding us to constancy to Christ.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But moral causing by objects works not on Infants.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>True, no more doth washing in water, and yet this
is used for the benefit of the Parents at present, and of Infants
when they are at the use of reason. Indeed Christ by his own
Sacrament giveth Right and Relative grace, which he will not
do by mens inventions.</p>
               <p>III. But man plainly appointeth the Cross to work this grace
by way of exciting signification.</p>
               <p>IV. And it is expresly made man's covenanting sign, by
which he bindeth himself to covenant fidelity; that he will
not be ashamed to confess the Faith of Christ crucified, and
manfully to fight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The whole duty of the covenant on
man's part is promised hereby.</p>
               <p>V. And the Canon tells you it is a dedicating Sign and Badge
of our profession.</p>
               <p>So that I see not what is wanting to a Sacrament, as far as
man can make one, by presumption, which we cannot consent to.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But it's said that Baptism is perfect without it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>So it is without the Lord's Supper; and yet that is justly
added: It saith not that mans covenanting with God is perfect
without it: For it seemeth a Sacrament of man's added to that
of Christ, to tie men faster to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Ancient Christians did use the Cross without scruple.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. It is not all use of the Cross that we speak against;
but using it as a Sacrament of the Covenant, and badge of
Christianity: The King would not take it well if Subjects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to make a new Badge of the Order of Knights of the
Garter, and add it to the Garter and the Star. To shew by an
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59333:46"/>
action as well as by a word to scorning Heathens that they
were not ashamed of a crucified Saviour, might be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
that this. And they foresaw not to what abuse it
would be after turned.</p>
               <p>2. But suppose we mistook in these our fears of sinning. 1. Do
you think that the case hath not difficulty enough to excuse a
man for fear of sinning?</p>
               <p>2. And do you think that for such fear, and not acting
against them we deserve to be cast out as heinous uncapable
delinquents?</p>

               <p>BUT the practice of Crossing is disputable, and I lay
not so sharp a censure on them that differ from us in

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Their excuse is, that Crossing being lawful, the Refusers are
disorderly Schismaticks, and they and their Children (as theirs) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of Baptism. They say it is not they, but you that are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusers.

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. They know that it is not Baptism but Crossing that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused:
And if they will not administer one without the other,
they are the refusers. If one refuse the Papists Exorcism, Salt,
Spittle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they will not baptize without it, do they
not deny to Baptize, unless one will receive all these? If
God will justifie them for rejecting all that think it a sin to
receive their Crossing, then it is not them to whom it is to
be imputed. But can that be true?</p>
               <p>1. Christ that instituted Baptism, ordained the conditions
of it, and the qualifications of such as shall be baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
and <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. He that believed was to be Baptized. <hi>Act.
28.</hi> If thou believe with all thy heart thou mayest: No, saith
the Canon you shall not, though you repent and believe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
also you will take the covenanting Badge of the Cross. Is
not this to alter the terms of Christ's Covenant and Sacrament,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59333:47"/>
and directly to contradict his very fundamental Law of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity?
<hi>Baptize all that are made disciples,</hi> saith Christ, and <hi>all that
repent and believe:</hi> No saith our Convocation, <hi>baptize none of them
that will not take the transient Image of a Cross, for their farther
obligation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Do you that think it is necessary to Christianity and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>know</hi> that this <hi>Federal Crossing</hi> is lawful? if you affirm it, you
must say the same of all ceremonies of the same importance, and
so must make a hundred new Articles of Faith, even of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and such little things, and make them all necessary to
Christianity and Salvation? And is not this to make a new
Gospel, Christianity, and Church, and to turn Christ's easie
Yoke into a worse than the slavery of Pharisaical Traditions?
And is not this to shut all, or almost all men out of Heaven?
No one on earth doth know that this, and all such ceremonies,
and inventions of men are lawful: And must every one know it
that will be a Christian, or have his child made one? Or must
we all (as necessary to Christianity) believe all such things
lawful if the Clergy do but say they are? And what if the
Clergy in one Land say it is, and in another, say it is not:
Must both be believed? Have wise Bishops no fitter penalty to
enforce their usurping Canons by, than denying Christendom
and Salvation? One would think it should be enough for the
Preachers of humility to say, <hi>[We are so wise that he that differeth
practically from us in that which we call an indifferent ceremony, and
he calls a sinful corruption of baptism, shall be punished as much as
Swearers, Drunkards and Fornicators be, or shall be made a slave
with his Children]</hi> without denying them <hi>Christianity and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
But the best is, all cannot keep men out of Heaven
that boast of the power of the Keys; and there is one Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>This quibble served mens turn that were resolved it

by inconveniencies, and name only flat sins which the Liturgy
required; we gave them in a Catalogue of eight. This was

               <p>The sin lyeth in what I before said about refusing Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.
1. It maketh new terms of Church Communion.</p>
               <p>2. It contradicteth Christ's appointed terms, which require
all Christians to receive each other in Love and Concord:
And <hi>Paul</hi> expresly decideth such cases, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, and 15. <hi>Receive
one another as Christ received us to the Glory of God.</hi> Will Christ
that receiveth them to pardon, grace and endless Glory, own
these Rejecters and Condemners? Or will he not say, In as
much as ye did it to one the least of these my brethren, ye did
it to me? And who is he that condemneth, when it is Christ
that justifieth.</p>
               <p>3. They shall answer for depriving Christ's Members of
their right, as truely as if they oppressed Widows, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
and turned them out of their houses, and inheritance.</p>
               <p>4. They shall answer for Schismatical tearing the Church
by their Engines.</p>
               <p>5. And for usurping a needless and hurtful dominion over
mens faith, and consciences by their Church Legislation.</p>
               <p>6. And for using that office which is made for the edifying
and comfort of the Faithful, to drive conscience and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God out of the world, by making doubtful, ensnaring
impositions, and then persecuting and rendring odious all that
dare not obey them for fear of sin, while they bear with the
Rabble that hate serious godliness, and encourage them by
preferring them in their communion.</p>

               <p>But what pretence have any against Kneeling?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. It is not a necessary point of Salvation or communion,
and therefore if they err they are not therefore to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate,
unless you will Excommunicate all that have
errour and sin, that is, your selves, and every living man.</p>
               <p>2. They have the pretence of real fearing that it is a sin
to differ in the Gesture from Christ's administration, thinking
that a Table gesture was intended by him to signifie his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-Feast.</p>
               <p>3. They fear breaking the Second commandment, which
is against corporal seeming to worship as Idolaters do though
the heart mean better; and so against symbolizing with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59333:49"/>
and against scandalous hardening them in their sin:
Because Papists are known to kneel to the Bread as unto
God and worship it. And these Papists live among us, and
are now hoping to set up their Idolatry. Though for my
part I think that the publick Doctrine of the Church, takes
off this argument of Scandal, yet it is such as very Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and holy men think valid: as you may see in Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s
Letters, and many others.</p>
               <p>4. And <hi>ad hom<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>inem,</hi> I see not what the Excommunicators
can say for themselves, while they condemn all of Schism
that obey not General Councils, especially the four first,
and that differ from the Universal Churches customes: And
yet the very first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and divers after forbid all
Kneeling in adoration on any Lord's day in the year, and on
any weeks day between Easter and Whitsunday. And all the
Ancients assure us that this was one of the chief ceremonys
that the Church then called Universal agreed in. And it
was never put down by any other General Council, but at
<hi>Rome</hi> grew out of custome by degrees, and that not till a
thousand years after Christ as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> confesseth. And
shall these same men that cry up the Church and the Laws
of Councils Excommunicate those that obey them as
Schismaticks, and pass for the followers of the Church them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
               <p>In a word, I dare no more cast godly Christians from Christs
Sacrament, for fearing least Kneeling in Receiving be a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizing
with Idolaters contrary to the Second Commandment,
than I durst turn Widows and Orphans out of their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
for not speaking the same language, or wearing the
same fashions as I do.</p>

               <p>God's Service is all to be done with holy Reverence, and
if the Book of <hi>Tobit</hi> and some others be guilty of so many
gross falsehoods, as Protestants have and do still accuse them
of, I fear both to use them as Lessons in the place of God's
Word, lest it be prophanation, and also to subscribe, or
declare my Approbation of the Calender, and that use, lest
I be guilty of the sin of all the Ministers in <hi>England</hi> that so
use it. And it's dangerous to seem to tell the people that
so many books are God's Word that are not such: For they
understand not the Greek word Apocrypha, and every Reader
at least that is not Licensed to Preach, is forbidden by the
Canon to expound even that one word to them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The work was an excellent good work: But the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
(it seems for want of skill in the Hebrew) followed
the Septuagint Greek translation, which hath these and many
such defects.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Sure it is lawful to use and follow the Septuagint, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles

               <p>1. The Apostles some times use it, and sometimes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Hebrew against it, and sometimes neither. 2. But
to Use it is one thing, and to Justifie it is another thing.
It was in common use in the time of Christ and his
Apostles, and they used that in speaking to the people,
which use made intelligible and acceptable. And we scruple
not using it: But all the works of Man are imperfect, as
Man is: And why must we subscribe that there <hi>is nothing in
it contrary to the word of God?</hi> When as every mistake in it
is contrary to it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I will subscribe to the truth of all that is in the true
Copies of the Original, if there by any such: And I will
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59333:53"/>
subscribe that the various Lections in those Copies that
we have, are not the failing of the Holy Ghost, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
nor are such as leave us in just doubt of any neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Truth? And I will subscribe to the Translation so
far as it agreeth with the Original. But I will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
that any Translation is perfect or faultless<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to
this or that Hebrew or Greek Copie, as if in every word
or Lection it certainly agreed with the Autographs. And
why should men make snares for the Church, by imposing
Professions, that any mere man's works are perfect, when all
mortal men are confessedly imperfect? Is it not enough peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to use them, and to profess that all the word of God

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>ME thinks you that have written a Book for Confirmation should

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I told you that I am so far from scrupling the true use of
Confirmation, that I think it is the want of it that is the greatest
corruption of the Church of any outward thing that I remember.
But you must note, 1. That it is the English way of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that we speak of. 2. And that it is not the thing it self,
but the denying men Church-Communion that neither have it,
nor desire it, which we here dissent from.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What mislike you in the English way of Confirmation?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I must first tell you how the case stands in matter of fact:
1. When Christ sent forth Preachers, he endued them, not all,
with equal Gifts and Power: Tho' most had some extraordinary
Gifts and Inspiration, it was made, tho' not proper to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
yet for the most part their priviledged above all others, that
the Holy Ghost was given to those on whom they laid hands, for
miraculous acts; especially sudden speaking of Tongues not learnt,
and Prophesying; tho' the gift of Sanctification necessary to
Salvation was given to all true Believers, by whomsoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <p>2. When the Apostles were dead, and these miraculous Inspri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
grew rare first, and then ceased (unless in some very rare
instance) yet the ordinary Pastors continued the Custom after
Baptism, to lay on their hands as for the giving of the Holy
Ghost. As they did also the Ceremony of Anointing the Sick,
which had been used for miraculous Cures.</p>
               <p>3. The dead Ceremonies of <hi>laying on of hands</hi> for the Holy
Ghost, and of <hi>Anointing,</hi> being used without the <hi>Power</hi> and former
Effects, somewhat else must be though on to keep up their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
And as to that now in question, first they added more
to the Ceremony of it, and Anointed the Person with Oyl, and
made the sign of the Cross on him, thereby to signifie his being
Anointed with the Holy Ghost, and fortified thereby to follow
a Crucified Christ thro' Sufferings. And when it was seen that
the Holy Ghost was not thereby given for Miracles, they thought
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59333:54"/>
that he was given in a double degree for Corroboration: And
some thought that he was not given at all in Baptism, (that did
but wash away guilt) but by Confirmation after.</p>
               <p>4. Hereby Confirmation got the name of a Sacrament (as
Anointing the Sick also did) and was used presently after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
for the most part; and the Ceremonies of it were made
more pompous, and it was appropriated to the Bishop, for the
most part; or if Presbyters did it, they must use no Ointment to
Anoint and Cross them with, but what the Bishop made by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and blest, to make it holy: And because he could not go
himself to the Sick, the Presbyters must fetch all their Ointment
for this also, ready made and hallowed from the Bishop.</p>
               <p>5. When Infants were Baptized, they thus presently Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them also, and called it their Chrysm and Confirmation, till
then he was taken but for a half or imperfect Christian, that was
only Baptized and not Confirmed.</p>
               <p>6. Popery having turned most of Christ Ordinances into a dead
Image, used these called Sacraments, to keep up a Ceremonious
shew of Religion, and to keep up the power of Bishops in that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
way.</p>
               <p>7. When Reformation prevailed, the Papists seven Sacraments
were examined; and only Baptism and the Lords Supper found
to be Christs Sacraments of the Covenant of Grace: <hi>Ordination</hi>
to be the Ministerial Sacrament of Orders, or Consecration to
that Office. <hi>Matrimony</hi> to be a common Domestick Sacrament of
Marriage: <hi>Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Extream Vnction,</hi> to be abusive imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Antient Miraculous Acts: And <hi>Pennance</hi> to be some
expressions of Repentance made more necessary than indeed they
were, and Arbitrarily imposed by mans invention to keep up the
Dominion of Ambitious Priests over the Souls of deluded men:
Tho' at first only introduced by meer Direction of Ministers to
men of troubled Conscience, shewing what restitution and repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the hurt they had done by sin were necessary, and what
expression of their Repentance was most fit.</p>
               <p>8. Hereupon the Reformers cast away the Sacraments of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
and <hi>Extream Vnction,</hi> and reduced the four first to their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
State and Use: and the abused way of <hi>Confirmation</hi> they
cast off, but some desired to make an advantage of the name, for
another end and duty of great moment, which had been neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the great corruption of the Church. And the Church of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59333:54"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> attempted to do this, reserving as much of the Antient
Form as possibly they could.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Adult</hi> were of old Baptized before Infants, and never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a most solemn personal Profession of Faith and Repentance,
and absolute dedication to Christ. And that this might be done
with the greatest weight and resolution they were usually taught
as Catechumens till they came to understanding and resolution,
before they were admitted to Baptism. Their Infants some brought
to Baptism, and some delayed till they came to Age, all being
left at liberty, and neither Adult nor Infant driven to Baptism,
nor accepted till it was desired. But as Prelacy grew up
to Dominion, all were forced to be Baptized in Infancy;
and at last such growing up in ignorance, were all taken
for Christians, while few knew what Christianity was, or
what it was to be Baptized, or what was there promised on
their part, or on Christs. And when these came to have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
they were Baptized and bred up as their Parents were, and
Christianty for the most part turned into meer Name and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
the Persons being mostly ignorant of its Essentials.</p>
               <p>This corruption of the Church seemed to many to come only
from Infant Baptism; whereupon they turned Anabaptists, and
taught that men should not be Baptized till they seriously and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
professed their own Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p>But wiser men saw that we must not deny Infants their Church
state and right because of mens abuse, and their neglect of other
Duties: Baptism is one thing, and Personal Confession and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
is another. It is the Omission of these at Age, that hath
corrupted the Church, and not Infant Baptism, which entreth
them but into a Church state suitable to their infancy. They need
not repeat Baptism which they had; but to manifest actual Faith
and Repentance which in Infancy they had not. That which
should be done, is to make their Transition into the Communion
of Adult Christians to be a <hi>serious, solemn work,</hi> and not a delusory
Ceremony. That those Baptized in Infancy may learn what they
did, and what Christianity is, as to our Faith, Duty &amp; Hopes: And
when they come to true resolution, to own the Baptismal Vow,
and as solemnly renew it themselves, as others made it for them.</p>
               <p>The English Reformers therefore did retain the Ceremony of
Imposition of Hands, and the appropriation of it to the Bishop,
and the name of Confirmation, and stretcht the use of the Sign
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59333:55"/>
(Imposition of Hands) to the utmost that they durst, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of applying it to Infants they made it the owning of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
Covenant, and appointed Catechizing to go before it, and
call for a solemn performance of it. And were it used as a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sober owning of the Baptismal Covenant indeed in an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
serious manner, for transition into the State of Adult
Communicants, it would be the greatest means of a true Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and of Union with the parties that now differ about
Church order, that can be used.</p>
               <p>Divers of the highest Episcopal Divines write as earnestly for
this as any of us: Especially Mr. <hi>Elderfield</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and
yet were it to prevent our continued division, and our ruin, there
is no hope of obtaining it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Why, what hinders if all sides desire it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>It is desired as <hi>Holiness</hi> is desired; seriously by the serious;
reservedly, and by halves by the half Christian, and only the
<hi>Name, Image</hi> and <hi>Ceremony</hi> by the gross Hypocrite, who hateth it
at the Heart, because it is above him, and against his carnal mind
and interest.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is here made impossible to be done any otherwise
ordinarily than as a Ceremony. For 1. The Diocesses are so
vast that the Bishop cannot do this and other his Offices for the
hundredth part of his undertaken Flock. Suppose this Diocess
have but five or six hundred thousand Souls (for when an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand died the last Plague, I hope it was not above the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ixth part:) Do you think that the Bishop is able (did he work
as hard as any Nonconformist) to confirm six hundred thousand
Persons, or the twentieth part of them, or the hundredth, in that
serious manner as belongs to the binding of a Soul to Christ in so
solemn a Covenant.</p>
               <p>It becometh me not to inquire whether Bishops be men that
are for so much seriousness in Christianity themselves, and so
much labour to attain it: Some are far better than others: You
know them as well as I. But I must say 1. That as far as I can
learn there is not one of an hundred confirmed at all.</p>
               <p>2. All the thousands that are unconfirmed live in the Parishes
as reputed Christians, and may come to the Sacrament when they
will.</p>
               <p>3. I never knew one Minister of all that Covenanted it, to
keep one man from the Sacrament for not being Confirmed, or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59333:55"/>
not being desirous of it; nor one Neighbour that ever was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
on this Point, whether he were Confirmed, or were ready
and desired it.</p>
               <p>4. Some few elder Votaries to the Bishops perhaps may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in it; but what a mere running Ceremony it is usually made,
I need not tell you. I have formerly said, that I was at 15 years
of Age Confirmed my self, by Bishop <hi>Morton</hi> (one of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned'st
and best Bishops that ever I knew) and we ran thither
from School, without the Minister's knowledge, or one word
from our Master, to tell us what Confirmation is; and in a
Church yard in the Path-Way, as the Bishop past by, we kneeled
down, and laying his Hands on every Boys Head, he said a few
words, I knew not what; nor did any one of my School-fellows,
as far as I could perceive, know what he said; nor know what
Confirmation is, any more than to have the Bishop's Blessing:
nor were we ask'd by him, or any, whether we stood to our
Baptismal Covenant, save only by saying by rote the Catechism
to our Master: nor did I see any one make any more than a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of it.</p>
               <p>When the Bishops were down, I saw it made a serious Work
by divers Ministers, who instructed Young Men till they found
them seriously resolved for Christ, and then taking the best of
Confirmation and Penitence, caused them publickly before the
Congregation to profess their Faith and Repentance, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the Covenant they made in Baptism to Christ. And were
it made the work of Godly Ministers to do it, or to prepare Men
personally for it, and not make it a Game for Boys, much good
might be done by it.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59333:56"/>
Here is an outward visible sign of <hi>an inward and spiritual Grace
given to them,</hi> said to be done in imitation of Christ's Apostles,
<hi>as a means whereby they receive the same, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thereof;</hi> (as the Collects with it shew) which is the Catechisms
Definition of a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>2. They that are against our Diocesan sort of Prelacy, dare
not seem to own it, by coming to them for Confirmation, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to them.</p>
               <p>3. Those that think that a great and holy Duty is made a mere
Mockery to delude Souls, and corrupt the Church (while every
one in <hi>England</hi> that will but take this Ceremony, is pronounced
to God in Prayer to be <hi>[Regenerate by the Holy Ghost, and all their
Sins forgiven them;]</hi> these dare not joyn themselves with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaners
in their delusory way.</p>
               <p>Be these Scruples just or unjust, while the same Persons are
willing to own their own Baptismal Covenant, understandingly
and seriously before the Church and their own Pastors, and to
know those that labour among them, and are over them in the
Lord, and esteem them in Love for their Works sake, and to be
at Peace among themselves, I dare not for scrupling this Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san
Ceremony, cast them from the Communion of the Church of
Christ. And therefore I dare not Approve of the Order that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
it, nor Assent and Consent to it, nor Subscribe that it is
not contrary to the Word of God.</p>

the Canon enumerating the Ornaments now, we suppose the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

a solemn Covenant-Consent, to the use of those things that we

               <p>I told you before that, 1. Some of the Ordinaries are Lay-Men,
sitting in Corners to Decree Excommunications and Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
proper to the Clergy. And we ought not to consent to
the guilt of this.</p>
               <p>2. Other Ordinaries are single Presbyters that have no Power
of the Keys from Christ over their Brethren, and over a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Churches.</p>
               <p>3. Other of the Ordinaries are Diocesans over Hundreds of
Churches that have no Bishops of their own under these. And
we ought not to own any of all these.</p>

               <p>If we should accuse to the Ordinaries all that we ought to
keep away, it will utterly destroy our Ministry. 1. We are
bound to keep away all that desire not Episcopal Confirmation.
2. All Ignorant Persons that are unready to be Confirmed. 3. All
Atheists, Infidels, Hereticks, scandalous Sinners, and that live
in malice to others (much more to the generality of Godly Men.)
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59333:57"/>
4. All the Nonconformists whom they call Schismaticks, that
Kneel not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in a Parish of 30000 or 40000 in <hi>London,</hi>
it's well if of all these sorts there be not many Thousands. And
2. The Ordinaries Courts are full of other Work: And in the
Countrey they are oft far from most Ministers. 3. Ministers
have usually much more Work than they can do at home, and
less Money than they need: And the Prosecution of all these,
and bringing up Witnesses, will take up all their time, and leave
them none for their Studies, or many other Offices at home:
And it will undo them in their Estates. 4. It will make the
People so much to hate them, that their Preaching will do little
good. 5. And when they know all this, none of the Ministers
will practice it, as Experience tells us; and so they will all live
in the breach of the Covenant which they made; and when to
get a living they have falsly professed Consent to all this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
and Prosecution, Self-love will not suffer them to do what
they consented to.</p>

               <p>2. We would have no Lay-men, or forced Ordinaries to do

convincing them by Gods word of sin, and of Gods

               <p>1. We ought not to consent to so great a corruption of its

but by the Bishop of the place, or Arch-bishop, after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and publick Revocation of such his wicked Error.</q>]
And when this Excommunication is sent from the Ordinary to
the Minister, you heard he must publish it twice a year.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>And what have you against this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Do I need to tell you? 1. Judge by this with what Face
the Prelates call us <hi>Puritanes</hi> or <hi>Catharists,</hi> as if we pretended to
perfection, and to be without sin. And whether it be not they
that are far liker to the <hi>Catharists.</hi> We confess that the best of
our Prayers, Preaching or Works hath somewhat in them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Word of God: For Gods Law is perfect, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
sin in <hi>matter,</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> or <hi>end,</hi> or <hi>degree,</hi> is repugnant to it.
Far be it from us Pharisaically to justifie any Book that ever we
write as if we had no sin in it. But these men that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do not only justify a large Volume
of Forms, Orders, Rubricks and Kalenders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but also force
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59333:58"/>
all other men to justifie it all as sinless; and he shall be no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
that will not do it, nor a Christian Member of the Church
that denieth it: As if the perfection of their works were an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Creed, and necessary to Salvation to be believed. Is
not this Puritanism, Pharisaical, and Justification of Works?</p>
               <p>2. Judge by all that I have in this Book cited, whether there
be <hi>nothing at all</hi> in their Books that is repugnant to the Word of
God. If I have made it past all modest denial, then what a
dreadful thing is this Renunciation of Repentance? when Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is the condition of the pardon of all our sin, even that
which cleaveth to our Worship of God. But they that tell the
World that their Works have no sin, yea and force all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to stand to that justification, do in a very high degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Repentance: Yea they not only forbid all men to call
them to repent, or to amend any sin that is in their Book, but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
them as wicked that do it.</p>
               <p>3. I told you before, that this Excommunicating <hi>ipso facto,</hi> is in
it self, a prophane subversion of the very nature of true Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
which supposeth due means to convince the Person
that his words or deeds are sin, and that of an intollerable degree,
and that he be heard speak for himself, and be admonished and
earnestly perswaded to repent; and not Excommunicated till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this he continue impenitent. But here men are Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
for saying that there is somewhat faulty in mens works,
and that before ever they are heard speak for themselves, or ever
told of their sin, or called to repent: I before referr'd you to
what <hi>Spalatensis de Rep. Eccles.</hi> hath written to prove the great
sinfulness of such Excommunicating. Bishop <hi>Ier. Taylor</hi> writing
against it, yet feigneth this excuse, that it must be understood
but of the <hi>Minor Excommunication.</hi> But <hi>Excommunication</hi> it is;
and I do not think that they can make any good sense of their
distinction of <hi>Major &amp; Minor Excommunication;</hi> unless it be that
the <hi>Major</hi> declareth men to be no Christians, and the <hi>Minor</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be <hi>scandalous Christians,</hi> not cut off from the Catholick
Church, but only for the present suspended from being owned,
while they are under patient tryal whether they will prove impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
or not, that shame may drive them to Repentance. But
this Suspension is properly called Excommunication. But both
of them require a just tryal.</p>
               <p>4. It is a heinous injury and injustice to Excommunicate and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59333:59"/>
Ruin men for Truth and Duty. He that robbeth them by the
High-way, doth but take their Money, and doth not also accuse
them falsly, and make their duty to be their sin. Doubtless he
that will take all that I have because I do my duty to God in
Praying or Preaching, doth me more wrong than he that will
take all without accusing me.</p>
               <p>5. It is a publick turning Christs Ordinance against himself,
and serving Satan by it, to make faithful Christians odious in the
World, as unworthy to live in humane Society, out of Jayls, if
they do but exhort others to repent. If a man but know and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
the least sin in their Books of Service, he must be condemned
of wicked Error, and Drunkards, and Whore-mongers; and
Perjured Rogues, do seem to be no worse than he.</p>
               <p>6. If it were an Error to say that their Book is not faultless,
yet it can never be proved an Error of that magnitude and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
as to deserve Excommunication <hi>ipso facto:</hi> For all men on
Earth have Errors worse than that; and so by proportion they
virutally or consequentially Excommunicate all men.</p>

               <p>Whatever he may be in Cases unknown to him, and which
he was not bound to know, I will not believe you in a known
or knowable Case. If I had been commanded to Crucifie Christ,
to Stone <hi>Stephen,</hi> to burn the Martyrs; I do not believe that I
could have done it without the guilt of Murder. Else you may
make a Man's command to Justifie the Execution of any Murder
or Injustice in the World.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But you may shift off such wicked Excommunications, and
leave the Publishing them to your Curate.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. I may not draw another into such heinous Guilt, nor
connive at his doing it in my Charge.</p>
               <p>2. There are but few Country Ministers that have Curates.</p>
               <p>3. If I do it not, I am guilty of it if I declare my <hi>Consent</hi> to
Accuse all such within <hi>fourteen days,</hi> that the Ordinary may do it;
and to Covenant and Swear Canonical Obedience to him.</p>
               <p>4. What can be more pernicious to the Church of God, than
to cast good Men out of it, and dismember Christ's Body, and
lay those in Jayls as unsufferable wicked Men, whom Christ
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59333:59"/>
takes for his Members whom he will save; and all this for tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Prelates that their Book is faulty, and desiring any amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their work: while Swarms of flagitious Men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
and by this encouraged to scorn at Conscience and fear
of Sinning, and to take their wicked lives to be better than the
Godly Conversation of those that are used far worse than they.
Thus Christ foretold his Apostles, that they should be cast out
of the Synagogues. But as he found and saved the healed Man,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. whom the Pharisees had cast out; so he will own and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Flock, and take their wrong as done to him.</p>

               <p>I confess it sounds harshly to lay so great stress on every Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of the Church, as to Excommunicate every one that Calleth
any one of them unlawful. What could be said more of the Ten
Commandements, or the Creed? If it be a <hi>wicked Errour</hi> to mistake
about a Ceremony, or to account a Cope or a Pair of Organs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
the Lord have Mercy on us, what a Case are we all in by

               <p>Yet 1. The Articles and our Ordination-Vow oblige us to
believe and teach that nothing is necessary to Salvation, but
what is contained in the Scripture, or certainly proved by it.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59333:61"/>
And that General Councils, and all Men are fallible: And sure
they are very near to Infallibility, who are so Infallible about

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You may easily know what, by what is already said;
1. I have fully proved as aforesaid in my Treatise of Episcopacy,
that if Episcopacy were never so certainly of Divine Institution,
this Form of Diocesan Prelacy deposeth <hi>quantum in se,</hi> the old
Church Form, the old Episcopacy, the old Presbytery, and almost
all true Discipline, and in stead of each, sets up that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Word of God. And must we all confederate to
maintain this Church Corruption; and all agree to renounce Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
or any Conviction tending to Repentance?</p>
               <p>2. I have told you what it is for Lay-men and Courts to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Decretive Power of the Church Keys, and for single
Priests and Officials to rule all the Clergy and People as under
them; And for our Prelate to undertake to be the sole Bishop
over many Hundred Clergy; And then to Govern <hi>per alios,</hi> in a
secular manner, even by Lay-men, that do that in his Name
which he knows not of, and this in order to Gaols and Ruine.
If all this be agreeable to God's Word, what is contrary
to it?</p>
               <p>3. I have told you what it is to make every Church Officer so
necessary, as that it should be Excommunication to say Any one
of them is sinful, when as Learned good Men as most the
World hath, have written to prove almost all of them sinful
corrupt Inventions of Arrogance; and that it's far worse for Men
to presume to make new Forms and Offices of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than new Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>4. The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> condemned the Oath called the
<hi>&amp; caetera</hi> Oath in the Canon of 1640. And the late long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 1662. never restored it, nor any since. And was it not
formed according to this Canon? What's <hi>[&amp;c.]</hi> but <hi>[And the
rest that bear Office therein] (reliquos ad ejusdem gubernaculum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutos)</hi>
For my part, tho' I have oft read over <hi>Cousins</hi> Tables,
and the Canons, I do not yet know and remember all the Church
Governing Courts and Offices? How many there be besides the
Bishop, the Chancellors Court, the Arches, the Prerogative
Court, the Arch-deacons, Commissaries, Officials, Surrogates,
I know not. And are every one of these become as necessary to
be taken for lawful as the twelve Apostles, or the Articles of our
Creed. For my part I am far from thinking that those Bishops
and Doctors should be Excommunicated or Damned, who by
Faction are drawn to deny the Ministry and Churches that have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59333:62"/>
not Prelatical Ordination and Government; and shall all be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
that think as ill of Civilians Excommunicatings?</p>
               <p>5. I have told you what it is for every Lord, Knight and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
that doth but say, that any of these Church Governing
Offices are against the Word of God, to be <hi>ipso facto</hi> an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
man. And for the people to be put to question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they may chuse them for Parliament men? and whether they
may sit in Parliament while Excommunicate?</p>

               <p>A great deal. In sum, it is unrighteous, oppressing and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
to cast out all Persons from the Church of Christ, who think
that nothing is faulty in the <hi>Book</hi> of Ordination, or in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
or Practice there expressed: And we dare not curse those
that Christ doth bless; should we do this for a Benefice, in what
should we differ from the sin of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who loved the wages of
unrighteousness? whose iniquity and madness his Ass rebuked,
saith St. <hi>Peter, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 15. Yea, shall we not be far worse than
he, that for an House full of Silver and Gold could not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Word of the Lord, and did not curse but bless Gods
people? And it is not proud malignant Tongues reviling Gods
Servants, and calling their Opinions wicked <hi>Errors</hi> that will
make Christ disown his Members, or will warrant <hi>Balaam</hi> or us
to curse them. O how unlike is this to the Spirit and Ministry
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59333:62"/>
of Christ! for Prelates and Priests to curse, and cast out the
Children of God, for saying that they go against his Law.</p>

               <p>I am anon to tell you that. But if there were nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But if every man have leave to accuse the Orders of the Church,
what Order can be maintained?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. Leave modestly, to express dissent in a doubtful case
may stand with Order. 2. If men do it disorderly, there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Penalties besides <hi>ipso facto</hi> Excommunication: Every breach
of the peace is not Rebellion, nor punisht with Death.</p>
               <p>But I'll tell you briefly what may occasion good men to say
that their Ordinations are sinful.</p>
               <p>1. In that they thereby obtrude Pastors on the Churches upon
the bare choice of a Patron, without or against the peoples
wills.</p>
               <p>2. In that they professedly ordain such as their Canon forbids
to Preach or Expound any Doctrine.</p>
               <p>3. In that they determine that Bishops, Priests and Deacons
are three distinct Orders, which yet is an undetermined Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
among even the Learnedst Papists. And must we damn,
and cut off men for that which the very Papists leave at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?</p>
               <p>4. In that they ordain men to an Office which Scripture mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no mention of. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> saith, that it cannot be proved
that there were any Presbyters subject to Bishops in Scripture
times, nor any but Bishops: None that had not power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and the Keys; nor any Bishops of a multitude of Churches
and Presbyters, both which are here ordained.</p>
               <p>5. In that they Swear Obedience to Arch-bishops and their
Sees; and make Priests Covenant Obedience to their Ordinaries,
as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>If a godly man do as <hi>Bucer</hi> did to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, as
you may see in his <hi>Scripta Anglic.</hi> and desire some of these faults
to be amended, doth he deserve to be cast out as an impenitent
wicked man for this? when they that will say, all's well that the
Bishops do, may live quietly in open vice or ungodliness. As
Dr. <hi>Sloughton</hi> saith, <hi>If you strike a Schismatick, and Christ find a
Saint lye bleeding, and you be to answer for it, I would not be in your
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59333:63"/>
case for all your wealth.</hi> If you must kill a Fly on the Forehead of
a Child of God with a Beetle, or a Butchers Axe, you shall not
use my hand to give the blow. If <hi>Chrysostom</hi> would rather have
his hand cut off than give the Sacrament to a wicked man, tho' a
Prince; I will rather have mine cut off than reject a Saint, or
my Tongue cut out than curse Christs Members, lest he say I
cursed him in them.</p>

groan. But suppose them quite mistaken; if a weak mistaken
Christian may be a true Christian, tho' faulty, why may not a
mistaken Congregation be a true Church tho' faulty? I hope no
man of Protestant Faith and Charity will take the Errors of such
as they describe for worse than the Papists; and yet how many
have written (tho' confusedly) to prove the very Church of

latter; for no man ever yet owned that Principle, that it can be

wills. For many hundred years the Orthodox did it justly; and
afterward when some did it unjustly, the culpability made it not

receiveth it not kneeling, or that is guilty of any of the foresaid
Points of Dissent, unless he confess his fault, and promise to do
so no more. So that here the Minister is to be himself the prime

               <p>In some cases it may, when Persons straggle
without cause: But there is frequent need that will justifie it as a
Duty: Parish Bounds are a humane Order for conveniency;
but the benefit of an able faithful Minister, and the choice and
use of such where they may be had, is of Divine Appointment,
and a matter of far greater weight. The Canon supposeth Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
that neither can nor may be suffered, to Preach or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
any Doctrine: If a Neighbour Parish have an able Teacher,
must he drive away poor hungry Souls that seek his Consolatory
Communion and Help? If Parishes that are bound to maintain
their own Poor, suffer any of them to be in danger of perishing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59333:64"/>
by cold or hunger, a Neighbour Parish tho' forbidden by men,
is bound by God to relieve them in distress: Every Christian is
related to all the Catholick Church, and as he hath need, hath
right to the Communion of Saints, out of his Parish.</p>
               <p>In <hi>London,</hi> where some Churches have excellent men, if a
Lord or Gentleman live in a Parish where a Patron hath set over
them, one that Preacheth not sincerely but railingly in strife,
contention, or gross Error, why may not such a man go to a
Neighbour Church? And why must that Neighbour Minister re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
him? When yet our Antagonists in this case, maintain that
the Catholick Church, being but one, every Christian must Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
in every place where he hath occasion: And that a
Diocess is the lowest sort of Church, of which Parishes are but
parcels: And consequently a man never separateth from his
Church, that separateth not from the Diocesan.</p>

               <p>IF Subscribing prove a Sin, (of which I am past doubt)
this Canon commandeth the Excommunicating Men for
repenting of Sin. Whereas Christ's Law of Excommunication
is to Excommunicate none but for not repenting of Sin. Are
not these two very contrary? And do you think that Christ will
stand to such an Excommunication? or disown them that are
thus cast out? Some Mens abuse of Excommunication is such, as
if at last, if all their Canons be executed, they would tempt
Men to doubt whether they live like Christians, because they are
not Excommunicate; and would make it a good argument,
<hi>[He is cast out of the Church for Conscience sake:</hi> ergo, <hi>it is a good
sign that he is a Man of Conscience.</hi> Or as if they were but fulfilling

skilful Physicians. And no man should deny himself the benefit
of such that can lawfully have it, nor should starve his Soul in
Obedience to Canons. If Preaching, and that soundly and
skilfully, be as needless as such men pretend, why did Christ
Preach, and send out Preachers? and why did <hi>Paul</hi> so dreadfully
charge <hi>Timothy, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. to <hi>Preach the Word, and be instant

Elders, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. to imitate him that taught them publickly
and from house to house, day and night with tears. And why
do the Prelates make every Priest Covenant in their Ordination
to instruct the People out of the Scripture, and with all faithful
diligence to Minister Doctrine, and teach the People with all
diligence to observe God's Commandements, and to use both
publick and private Monitions and Exhortations, as well to the
sick as the whole, within their Cures, as need shall require, and
occasion shall be given. Why do they Ordain them all to be
<hi>faithful Dispensers of the Word of God?]</hi> Is all this done by mere
Reading that which a Woman or a Boy of 12 years old can read

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. Other Canons also forbid them oft to Hear in other
Parishes. 2. If my Need and God's Law oblige me to choose a
better Pastor than that ignorant Reader, tho' in another Parish;
is it not fit, and my Duty to Communicate with him that I
justly take for my Pastor?</p>
               <p>Moreover, I must tell you, that when an Ignorant Fellow ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
on him the Sacred Office which he is unfit for, and so liveth
in the constant Sin of omission, and of Prophanation of Holy
Things, and of betraying Souls, I take it to be a Sin to harden
and encourage such a bold Presumer in so great Evil, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
People that need better to be content with such a Pastor;
Tho' I determine not whether he have the Essentials of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
and tho' I doubt not but the Sacraments are no nullities
to them that take him for a true Minister.</p>
               <p>And yet I must add, that there are some Abilities Essential,
without which no Man is truly a Minister of Christ: And this
Essential Ability, as certainly reacheth to the work of Teaching,
as to Administring Sacraments: He is not worthy the Name
of a Minister that denies this: I would not strain this Necessity
over high: But I say, that he is no Minister that wants Essential
Ability: And if the Papists and their Emissaries would make
the People believe that all not ordained by Prelates are no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and that such excellent Men as <hi>Blondel, Chamier, Sadeel,
Dalle,</hi> and all such abroad are none, I think them more excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
who take him for none that cannot Preach, and must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to Expound any Doctrine. If it were for want of Tongue
and Voice he could not read: If it be for want of Knowledge,
can that Man be by Office a Teacher of Christian Doctrine that
knoweth it not, and cannot teach it? and cannot do that for
his Flock that every Parent and Husband should do, whom the
Children and Wives are commanded to learn of.</p>

               <p>2. When none must be delayed that are brought to Church,
the Minister cannot so much as enquire whether the God-fathers
know what Christianity is, or are Christians, or Jews, or Infidels.
Or whether ever they received the Lord's Supper; which the
Canon makes necessary.</p>

they know which is the Church real. And this they tell us not,
either as to Matter or Form. 1. Whether the Church real be
only the Clergy, or also the Laity? Whether the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
Nobles, Gentry and Commons, be all Represented in
the Convocation? If yea, by what Law or Power? And may
we say that King and Parliament do what these do? What need
they then after to confirm their Canons? And they that hold the
Church Laws bind in Conscience as such before King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
confirm them, will bring King and Parliament under their
Obedience, if not Excommunication. But if they pretend not
to represent the King and Laity, they falsly exclude them from
being part of the Church.</p>
               <p>2. They are utterly disagreed <hi>de Forma</hi> what the Church of
<hi>England</hi> is: either it hath an Ecclesiastical constitutive Soveraign
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59333:67"/>
Power, or not. If not, it is not an Ecclesiastick Body Politick.
And of late their disputing Doctors, plainly confess that it hath
no such specifying <hi>Summa Potestas,</hi> and so is formally no Political
governed Church. The King's Government of it by the Sword,
which none deny, they say, is but an <hi>Accident</hi> of it, and not Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to the Church. And so in sum, it is but a meer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
or a voluntary Confederacy of many Churches, that
make no unifying Politie. And that is, to be a Church only in
a loose and not proper sence, as the Assembly at <hi>Nimegen</hi> was a
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>3. I doubt not but Thousands of L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y-Men, and many Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Ministers, are true Parts of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
And therefore that the Convocation represented our part, only
of that Church.</p>
               <p>4. If they be but a Community, they can make no Laws; but
only Contracts: Laws are only the Acts and Instruments of
Rulers. Therefore we owe no Obedience to them as being no
Commands of Rulers, till the Civil Power make them Laws:
save as particular Pastors may make them Laws to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Flocks.</p>
               <p>5. If they make them obligatory Church-Laws as the Acts of
the Convocation, then it seems the Representative Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth
the Real; and the Presbyters in Convocation exercise a

               <p>Here craftily in a Parenthesis, they put in the King's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and if they mean only his Obligation on us, no one of us
denieth it: But because their disputing Doctors take that but as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59333:67"/>
an Accident, we may say, that the Papists themselves are oft
put to say, that General Councils bind not the absent, till they
receive them; And the <hi>French</hi> long received not the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> nor many Churches other Councils.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The 141st (for so many Church-Commandments we
have, God's Ten being but a little part of our Religion) is,
<q>Whoever shall affirm that the Sacred Synod assembled as
aforesaid, was a Company of such Persons as did conspire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
against Godly and Religious Professors of the Gospel,
and that therefore both they and their Proceedings in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Canons and Constitutions in Causes Ecclesiastical by
the King's Authority—Let them be Excommunicated and
not restored,</q> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here again we doubt not of the King's obligatory Power:
But what the Persons and their Works were, I think a Point
that Christians may differ about, and not deserve Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
It seems they could foresee what Men would judge
of them: and no wonder, tho' they had not the Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.
I am none of their Judge, but leave God's Work to
himself: But I must say, that this Book of Canons doth no
whit increase my esteem of Council, of Prelacy, of Humane
Canons or Clergies Laws, nor of the particular Bishops and
Clergy that made them. And that I will neither publish such
Excommunications, nor promise or swear to do it: Tho' I
know that stretching pretences satisfie some Men; like theirs
that own the name of <hi>Sacred</hi> to that Synod, because <hi>Sacrum quod
sanctum, simul execrabile signat,</hi> A professed and relative Sanctity
may be granted them.</p>

               <p>1. I thought you had desired to know why we conformed
not for the twenty years past. 2. I suppose that the like is still
imposed on others, in the Corporation Act, the Vestry Act, the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59333:68"/>
Militia Act, and the Marrow of it still imposed on us in the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>First I'll tell you what we have not against it, because we
are commonly here falsly accused.</p>
               <p>1. It is none of our Controversie whether this Oath or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was unlawfully made and imposed both on the people and the
King; we deny none of this.</p>
               <p>2. It is none of our Controversie, whether there be not some
part of the Matter of it that is unlawful: We deny not that.</p>
               <p>3. It is none of our Controversie, whether it was not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
taken: We justifie not that as to our selves, tho' we are not
judges of the sin of King and Lords, and others whom we have
no Calling to condemn.</p>
               <p>4. It is none of our Controversie, whether this, or any other
Covenant or Vow do bind us to Rebellion, Sedition, or any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Act; we renounce all such Obligation.</p>
               <p>5. Yea, we hold that neither this, nor any other Vows of our
own, can prevent any Obligation that the King hath Authority
to impose upon us, in things great or small; else men might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Magistrates to rule them, and exempt themselves from Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
by Vowing before hand not to obey.</p>
               <p>6. I add for my self, that I hold my self bound by this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to nothing, which I had not been bound to if I had never
taken it. For I never thought that by Vows we may make new
Religions or Laws to our selves, but only bind our selves to that
which God doth make our Duty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Where then is the danger or sin that you fear?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I. As to the Obligation of the Vow on my self.</p>
               <p>II. As to the Obligation of it on all others.</p>
               <p>III. As to the Matter of altering Church Government.</p>
               <p>1. I am neither so blind, wicked or singular, as to deny the
common Doctrine of Casuists, Protestants and Papists; that tho' a
Vow be both sinfully imposed, and sinfully taken, yet it bindeth
<hi>in materia necessaria &amp; licita:</hi> Yea, that if part of the matter be
unlawful, yet it bindeth to that part which is lawful. Else a
Knave might exempt himself from the performance of all his
Vows, by foisting in some unlawful matter, or by making them
in an unlawful manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:59333:68"/>
Therefore if there be any thing that is necessary or lawful in
that Vow, I believe that I am thereto bound.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>So Rebels that think it lawful to rebel, will say that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
binds them to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>So he that thinks Gods Law doth bind him to Murder or
Rebellion, will plead Gods Law for it: But doth it follow that
Gods Law bindeth him to that or to nothing?</p>
               <p>It is not mens false sayings that make or prove such Obligation?
He that will say that Gods Laws, or the Kings, or the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
binds him to sin, must be punished for his Sin and Lie, and
yet all just Obligations stand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But you are bound before by other Obligations to all that is good
in it, and not by the Covenant?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>That's an inference contrary to Reason and Christianity;
Can a Man of any Reason once dream that a Man may not have
many Obligations to one and the same Duty? or that the second
Oath binds not to it because the first did? you vowed your self to
Christ in Baptism, and you renew the same in the Lords Supper:
Are all the latter null, because the first is valid? What if you
many times Swear Allegiance to the King? Do none of these
bind you but the first?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>II. But do you think that endeavours to alter Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is any of your lawful or necessary Matter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You know that there is a Law that maketh it a <hi>praemunire</hi>
penalty, to say that the Covenant bindeth one to endeavour any
alteration of Church Government: And why then will you put
such a question to me? All that I will say is this, that as I say not
that any one is bound to it by this Covenant; so I am not so good
a Casuist as to be able to justifie and acquit all other men from all
such Obligations. Let them look to themselves, for my part
I will be no voucher or surety for their indemnity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>III. This brings up to the other part of your Reasons; and why
may you not say that none is so bound?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. Because God never made me a Casuist to determine the
case for all men in three Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>2. Because it is a new and monstrous thing for one private man
(yea many thousand private men) to be forced to such an Office
and Undertaking: Every man must answer for himself before
God and Man: <hi>Noxa caput sequitur.</hi> If I were commanded to
be surety for everyman in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59333:69"/>
the Peace or good Behaviour, I should think it a piece of as pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
injustice as most ever the World knew. But if I must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to answer for all their Souls, in a case where thousands
of Learned men have been of the contrary mind, I'll first think
how to answer for my own.</p>
               <p>Yet as to that part which I am certain of my self, I do not scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
it. I dare subscribe that the Covenant bindeth no man to be
False or Rebellious against the King, or to endeavour to alter our
Monarchy, or to deprive the King of any of his Rights; nor to
endeavour to change any part of Church Government which
Christ hath instituted for continuance in his Church. And is not
this enough?</p>
               <p>But whether our Diocesan frame, as distinct from that which
Arch-bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> called the Primitive Government, be change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
or whether none of their Courts, and Lay-mens power of
the Keys be changeable, or ought to be changed? And whether
no man may endeavour it in his place and calling? I think a man
may be saved without knowing. And I think, if you ask a man,
if King and Parliament should change the Office of an Official, a
Commissary, a Chancellor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or should set up a Bishop in
every Market Town, is it a sin against God? or is it unlawful to
obey them? or if it be lawful to do it, and any of them Swear
to endeavour it in his place, is he bound to perform that Oath?
If to all this a man say, <hi>I cannot tell, I am not Learned enough in
Law and Divinity to resolve such cases; but I am resolved my self to
live in Loyalty and Peace.</hi> I would ask any man that hath not
put off humanity, whether that man be fit to determine the case
for all other men in three Kingdoms, and to be a voucher for
all their Souls in a case that he understandeth not himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> How doth this make you a Voucher for their Souls?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. The case is of exceeding weight: If I should publickly
declare that no man is thus bound by a Vow, and I should prove
mistaken. 1. Then I become guilty of all these mens sin by justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
it as no sin. 2. And I am guilty of cruelty to their Souls in
open telling them that they need not perform their Vows, nor
repent of non-performance. 3. And Perjury is one of the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousest
sins on Earth. 4. And the Perjury of Millions or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is yet one of the grievousest degrees of guilt. 5. And I do
my worst to make God destroy or forsake such a Land. And
what yet can I do worse? I say, if in justifying them I should be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59333:69"/>
mistaken, what a guilt should I incur? And doth Nature or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
bind me to run so great a hazard for so many thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Besides, he that will be a Casuist must know all the case:
there are hundreds and thousands put upon these decisions, that
being then Children, knew not who made the Covenant; nor
how it was imposed or taken, and many that know not what it
is, and never saw it.</p>
               <p>And there are thousands, if not millions, that took it, whose
Faces I never saw, and know not what moved them, nor in
what sence they took it; and Casuists say, that if a man mistake
the Imposers sence, he is bound to keep it in the sence that he
understood it when he took it, if a lawful one; especially if the
Imposers had no Authority, or their sence was doubtful.</p>
               <p>And it is not uncharitable for me to think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat none of the
Kings Compounding Lords or Clergy that after took it, did take
it in a sence which they thought found? And must I tell them
all that none of them is bound to keep it in that sound sence?</p>
               <p>I will not run the danger of having thousands in judgment to
suffer for Perjury, and saying, This man declared that it was no
sin. If they are all Innocent, what need they my justification,
when they stand or fall by the judgment of God. If they prove
guilty, my declaring it no sin, will not acquit them, but condemn
my own Soul by tempting them to impenitence. I do not say that
they are obliged by this Vow herein, nor I will not say they are
not. There are many matters first to be known, if we agree in
point of Doctrine; and I know that it's an easie thing for confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
men to multiply words to prove all lawful in this Oath, and
to Swear that it is rebellious Hearts that cause our doubtings:
(and so say the Papists of the Protestants) But whatever they
say or threat, I will not by their confidence and talk be drawn,
to cast my Soul into so great a hazard. All men are not so bold
in such things as some.</p>

no Government shall have any security by your Oaths: The
words are contrivedly as universal against all endeavour as can be
spoken.</p>
               <p>2. But I'll presently confute you undeniably.</p>
               <p>You know <hi>Church and State</hi> Government are conjoined in the
Oath, and the Church put first. Will you say as to <hi>State Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
that the meaning only is, That <hi>I will not endeavour to
depose the King, or alter Monarchy by Rebellion, or any unlawful
means,</hi> but only by lawful means; if you do, you'l soon be told

               <p>But the meaning is only, that you will not endeavour to alter
<hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and not all other Offices and Courts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>This is as palpable a falsification as the former: For
1. The words are a most express abjuration of <hi>endeavouring any
alteration of Government</hi> at all. And if you take the word <hi>[Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration]</hi>
strictly, it more commonly signifieth a change of <hi>Quality</hi>
or <hi>Manner,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>Essence.</hi> But if you take it largely, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
both.</p>
               <p>2. And I appeal to any mans Conscience whether that was, or is
the Bishops sence: Go ask them, My Lords, <q>If I endeavour but
to reduce Diocesans to every Corporation, &amp; to take down your
Lordships, and great Revenues, and your Chancellors Courts,
and all the rest of your Humane Officers, will you take it for
no breach of my Oath? and I warrant you they will soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:59333:70"/>
3. Yet I shall fullier convince you: The Bishops and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are of the mind of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And the Canons
do most fully speak the Churches mind. And the Seventh Canon
before cited, when it makes it <hi>ipso facto</hi> Excommunication to call
the Church Government sinful, tells you, that they extend this
to <hi>[Arch-bishops, Bishops, Deans, Arch-deacons, and the rest that
bear Office therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. And I believe if you should say that I take my Oath to bind
me from endeavouring no change of the Government of the
State, but only of the <hi>Essence of Monarchy,</hi> you would quickly
feel the Error of your Exposition.</p>

               <p>Our King is King of <hi>Scotland</hi> as well as of <hi>England,</hi> and he
hath thus declared his sence in the case of the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and
the Reasons of it are considerable. And do you think that it can
be the true sence in <hi>England,</hi> and deserve preferment as to Loyal

               <p>And why will you not Swear never to endeavour any alteration,

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I have read Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet's Irenicon,</hi> and many such Books,
in which I see how great a number of our greatest Divines, as
well Arch-bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> took the Form of Church Government
to be alterable, and not fixed by Christ: And if the Doctor have
changed his judgment, that changeth not the Authority of those
that he citeth.</p>
               <p>2. I have in my full Treatise of Episcopacy told you why I
cannot but wish more than one thing in our Ecclesiastical Courts
and Government changed.</p>
               <p>3. I take it for a matter that deserveth consideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be no change of the <hi>State</hi> Government, to make all the
Church Government unchangeable, and so to disable the King
to change it: And how to reconcile the two parts of the Oath?
And whether if the whole Church Government as fixed, must
thus be Sworn to as Monarchy is, it alter not our Constitution?

4. If the King and Parliament should command Men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
an Alteration, <hi>e. g.</hi> of Lay-Mens Power of the Keys, or
the greatness of Dioceses, I am afraid of being sworn beforehand
to disobey them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But the Parliament meant not to bind themselves herein.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I grant it. (Tho' being Church of <hi>England</hi> men, the 7th
Canon aforesaid maketh it doubtful.) But when they have bound
all the Subjects in the Land, and themselves among others,
when out of Parliament, and when it's <hi>Excommunication</hi> to charge
any of the Church-Offices with Sin; I think the Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is fixed as unalterable. I ask you, Did the Parliament
bind themselves against altering Monarchy, or the Succession? If
they did, then it seems they did so by Church-Government,
when they put it in many Oaths before that of the State. If
they did not, then they have fixed Monarchy no more than
Church-Government by this Oath. Therefore when they bind
all in the same Oath from endeavouring any Alteration of
Church-Government, they shew that they intend the fixing of
it. And tho' some think it leaveth room for Petitioning,
I do not believe that the Law or Oath leave any Men at
Liberty to Petition against Monarchy; which is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</p>
               <p>But my great reason of Non-Conformity herein yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.
If the faults of Church-Government should prove
but the tenth part as great as is feared by many, and said by
those that write about it, what a tremendous thing is it to make
a deliberate Solemn Covenant and Oath, never to endeavour
any amendment of it, nor to perswade any man to repent or
amend.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Germans,</hi> who are reported to be addicted to Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or other Nations to Whoredom or Thievery, should take
an Oath that they will never repent or amend, nor perswade any
other to it, what a case were this?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I confess if the Corruptions of Church-Government should prove
as great Evils, as some conceive, it would be a heinous Sin indeed to
Swear never to repent, or to endeavour to amend it.</p>

Prelatical Government was far worse than all
their Ceremonies and other Corruptions set
together. They thought it a Platform fitted
to exalt Pride and Covetousness, and to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
all ungodliness, and to drive serious Piety
and Conscience out of the Land, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
before mentioned. 1. By the largeness of Dioceses ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Discipline impossible, and so keeping almost all the wicked
in the bosom of the Church, secure from the Power of the
Keys. 2. By putting down all Bishops that should be in all the
large Dioceses, save that one, and restraining all the Parish-Ministers
from true use of the Keys, unless they will be ruin'd
by it. 3. By setting up Secular Courts under the name of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick,
and making it their Employment by 141 Canons,
which are their self-made Contrivances, to hinder and ruine la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
Preachers, and Men of tender Consciences, and to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the contrary sort. 4. By putting the decretive Power of
the Keys into the Power of these Lay-Men. 5. By setting up
Pastors over all the Land without the consent of the Flock, by
the meer Will and Election of Great Men and Patrons. 6. By
driving unfit and unwilling persons to eat and drink Damnation
in the Sacrament. 7. By driving multitudes of good People
from the needful means of their Salvation. 8. By bringing
good Men that grieve for all this, into Odium, for being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it.</p>
               <p>And if this prove the case, I had rather lie in Gaol till Death,
than Swear or Promise never to endeavour that I or any should
repent and amend it. Do you think it not contrary to our
Baptismal Vow, in which we promise Obedience to Christ to
our lives end?</p>
               <p>I read that the <hi>Israelites</hi> were greatly reproved for Worship
in the <hi>High Places,</hi> and that they seldom repented: But I read
not that ever they took an Oath or Covenant never to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to amend: I find that when <hi>Israel</hi> was made to Sin by the
Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> that they went on and amended not:
But I read not that they Covenanted or Sware never to amend.
I find that the Pharisees were heinous Sinners, that by their
Traditions made void the Law of God: But many of them
came to <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism, and professed some Repentance; and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59333:72"/>
tho' obstinacy cut off the Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> I read not that
they drew the Nation into an Oath or Covenant never to
amend. When Christ came to save the World, it was by a
Covenant of Faith and Repentance. And if I should see the
World once confederate in a Covenant never to believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and amend, I should call it the <hi>Kingdom of Satan,</hi> and thence
date our Accounts Chronological, with a <hi>Regnante Diabolo,</hi> as in
<hi>France</hi> they did a while, with a <hi>Regnante Christo.</hi> (of which <hi>Vide
Blondellum).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not say that these old Nonconformists were in the
right, nor that <hi>Bucer</hi> did no whit over-value the Discipline
which he proposed to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth; nor that this
Oath containeth all the foresaid guilt. But I say, If I should
prove so, and venture on it in uncertainty, when the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of so many Parliaments, Lawyers, Divines abroad and at
home are against such kind of Swearing: what a case should I
bring my Soul into? National Oaths, especially such as seem
to me to fix every Church-Office, from the Arch-Bishop to
the Official, if not the Apparitor, as unalterable in the very
Constitution of the Kingdom; even putting them before the
State, are Matters of greater Consequence than to be rashly
ventured on by me: Even the Long Parliament that made the
silencing Acts, restored not the Canon and <hi>Et caetera</hi> Oath of
1640. which bound Men never to consent to such Alteration of
Church-Government, by Arch-bishops, Bishops, Deans and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt of it: For this of not taking Arms against those
Commission'd by him, is but Expository of the former, not taking
Arms against the King. Else Men that fight against his Army may
say, they fight not against the King. And can the King make War
without an Army.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I never heard of many of the Parliaments Army that ever
saw any sealed Commission of those they fought against: and
would that excuse them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>No, because it was notorious that the King owned the War.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Some say No, because it is no Commission, if it be contrary to
the Law. And some say No, because it must be supposed that the
King will grant no Commission contrary to Law. And some say <hi>Yea;</hi>
But when they are contrary, the Commission is to be obeyed against the
Law. And some say Yea; And that the Law is to be obeyed against
the Commission.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>But if you are of so many Minds, how are Doubters resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
what to Swear and what to do?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59333:73"/>
1. If you say, It's no Commission that is contrary to Law,
who shall be Judge when it is contrary to Law? If every
Subject be Judge, it is as easie to Rebel, and say the King's
Commission is illegal, as it is to deny all the Authority of his
Commissions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>The Iudges and Courts must judge what is Legal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If the Judges, yea, or the Parliament shall judge the King's
Commissions illegal, will that make it lawful for the Subjects
to resist them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I dare not say so. Therefore we must come to the later Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the King himself is Iudge, and that it is Legal <hi>eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
because it is his Commission, and that Commissions suspend all
contrary Laws. Tho' I know many abhor this, that would not have the
King's Will to be above all Laws, and Rule to be Arbitrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>But suppose it be so, the Subjects know the <hi>Laws</hi> to be
the King's by Promulgation: How shall they be sure that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions</hi>
are not counterfeit if they be contrary to them? Must
every Fellow be believed that produceth a Commission? may it
not be counterfeited?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>The King's Officers that keep his Seals must be trusted by us,

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. Then the King's <hi>Officers</hi> are set above all Laws and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures,
as well as the King. 2. And why then are Judges
Sworn not to be moved from Justice by the Great or Little Seal?
3. But must we trust every Man that shews a Seal, that he did
not counterfeit it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I confess that the Laws are most Publick and certain Notifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the King's Will. But it's easie to raise more Doubts than the
wisest man can answer.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not possible for two <hi>Commissions</hi> to be contrary? what
if one Man have a Patent for Life to be Lord Admiral, or Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the <hi>Tower,</hi> or the like, and another come with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to put him out and take Possession; which must be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>He that hath the last Commission. The former may not resist
him: For the later nullifieth the former.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not then in the Power of the Keeper of the Seals to
depose the King at his pleasure, by sealing new Commissions to
Conspirators to seize on his Garisons, Guards, Treasure, Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines,

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>It must be taken for granted that the King will give no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

               <speaker>M.</speaker>

               <p>Then the question is, whether it shall be in the Power of

Law Cases, which Lawyers profess to be too hard for them, and
which they are disagreed in as a common Controversie in all
Lands.</p>
               <p>And I pray you, why are Nations so sollicitous to have Laws
for their Security, if a Chancellor be above them all, and by a
Commission may cast them off at his pleasure?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>We do not say the Chancellor may do it, but the King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Doth not the Chancellor keep the Seal? and must we not
take them for the Kings Commissions which he sealeth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>If you know that the Commission be notoriously against Law, you
may suspect that the King consenteth not, and may stay till you enquire of
him whether it be his Act and Will?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>But 1. If one come with a Commission to take possession
of the King's Treasure, Magazines, Garisons; Navy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it by force, may he be resisted by force till the King's
Mind be enquired of? If not, he may depose the King and seize
his Strengths before we can come to enquire of the King. All
have not access to the King. If it were the Garison of <hi>New-Castile,
Berwick, Carlisle,</hi> &amp;c. it will be too late to send to the
King. But if such Commissioners may so long be resisted, then
how can we Swear that <hi>upon no pretence whatsoever</hi> his Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
may be resisted by his own Authority?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:59333:74"/>
2. And if a Highway-man shew a Commission to take my
Purse, he will not stay till I know whether the King consent to
his Commission.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>You stretch the sence of the Subscription and Oath further than
the Parliament intended it. Do you think that if half a Dozen or more
<hi>Irishmen</hi> had come into the Parliament House, and shewed a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
Real or Counterfeit to kill them all, Lords and Commons, that they
would not have defended their Lives with their Swords? And do you
think then that ever they meant to bind all the Subjects against that
which they would do themselves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And do you think that we should all Swear to that which
they never meant to bind us to? Is there any limitation in the
words? Or can any words be devised more to exclude excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
than <hi>[not on any pretence whatsoever.]</hi> But <hi>self</hi> is near men,
and is not so concerned in other mens cases as their own. For
my part, I believe that they meant plainly and universally as they
speak, tho' they might forget their own case: My proof is from
the express words of the Militia Act, where they determine that
neither the <hi>whole Parliament</hi> or part, hath any Power of <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi>
or <hi>defensive Arms</hi> against the Kings Commissioners: Much
less have any single Persons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think that ever they intended to destroy all mens Property,
and defence of Life or Goods, and to repeal all the Laws that bind
Sheriffs by the <hi>Posse Comitatus</hi> to suppress Riots, and to execute the
decrees of the Courts of Iustice for Possessions or Dis-possessions, tho'
any should shew Commissions to the contrary, and to overthrow the Iudges
Oaths.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I can no way judge what they meant, but by what they
did. I find they have <hi>absolutely denied</hi> all <hi>right</hi> of <hi>defensive Arms</hi>
in the Subject or Parliament, and that's all that I speak of: From
whence I must needs suppose, that their sence was, that all men
have Propriety in Estates, Wives, Children and Lives, and that
the King ought to Govern them by Law, and wrong no Man,
and that Judges ought to do right by Sentence, tho' the King
forbid them. And that Sheriffs and Justices must ordinarily
execute the Law: But if the King by force restrain them, or
give Commission to any Subject by force to violate any Law or
Sentence, or to take away any Mens Lives or Estates, it is not
lawful by defensive Arms, for any Sheriff, Justices, or any others
to resist. This is plainly the sence of the Militia Act, and of our
Oaths.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I pray you let us end this tender Controversy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I have yet a few more doubts to be resolved.</p>
               <p>Politicks being the Foundation of <hi>Iuris-prudentia,</hi> I doubt not
but you have studied Politicks: I pray you tell me why all Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
placing a Republick in the predicament of Relation, do
make the <hi>bonum publicum</hi> to be its essential <hi>terminus</hi> in the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Because it is so indeed; it being no <hi>Civitas</hi> or <hi>Respublica</hi> that
is not for the <hi>Common good;</hi> and therefore they make it the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between a King and a Tyrant, that a King ruleth for the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good,</hi> and a Tyrant for his private Ends and Interests.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>But by your leave I think that distinction ill and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
uttered: For every man hath some culpable selfishness;
and also the Kings Self-interest is Lawfully intended: For Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
called Kingdoms being at first Constituted by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
no doubt there was necessary the Consent of both the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
Parties: None can be King against his Will. And do
you think any Man would take a Crown only for the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
without security for his own just Interest, Honour and
Prerogative, without which he cannot well Govern? Therefore
I think that those Politicks too loosly describe Tyranny, by <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interest,</hi>
and can prove no man a proper Tyrant in <hi>Exercitio</hi> (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from an Usurper) but him that seeks the <hi>destruction</hi> of the
<hi>Commonwealth,</hi> whose good he is bound to preserve.</p>
               <p>But I further ask you,</p>
               <p>Do you think the Law of Man, or a Commission can abrogate
the Law of Nature?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>No Man ever affirmed it: For the Law of Nature is Gods
Law; yea his first and most Fundamental Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I will not deny it as to the stable Laws of Nature, tho' I
think that Nature it self hath some mutable Laws, where the
<hi>Nature</hi> of the matter is mutable. But then I would further know,
whether to defend the Life of your self, Wife or Children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
injurious Assault be any part of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Experience resolveth that; what Man will not defend his Life
that can? yea what Beast, or Bird, even the most harmless will not
use such weapons as Nature hath given them, Horns, Feet,
Teeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:59333:75"/>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>But Man hath Reason to rule natural inclinations: And
sure a Malefactor if he could, should not defend his Life against
Justice, I think not so much as by running away: Nor many
single innocent Persons defend their Lives by a publick War,
because a War is more hurtful to the Commonwealth than his
death is: And the Common good is better than a single Persons,
or a fews, and to be prefer'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I next ask, whether the</hi> Body of a Kingdom have by Gods
Law of Nature a self-defending power against its notorious assaulting
Foes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think any man doubts of that? May not the King and
Kingdom defend themselves against Invaders? If one man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Purse or Life against another, a King and Kingdom is more
worth than one man: You can hardly name one principle in the Law of
Nature more undoubted, than that Kingdoms have a right to defend
themselves if they can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And may they not defend themselves, against Usurpers
and Rebels, and Traytors at home, as well as against Forreign
Foes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>To deny that is Treason: How else should we defend the King?
Was not <hi>Jack Straw,</hi> and many a Rebellion lawfully resisted? and did
not the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> Lawfully kill <hi>Wat. Tyler?</hi> and so
of any other in his case.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>But what if the <hi>Irish</hi> took on them to rise by the Kings
Commission, and shew'd a Counterfeit of it, was it lawful for
the Protestants to have resisted them to save their Lives and
Cities?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>They should have sent to the King to know whether that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

               <p>And must we Ignorant Men swear that all these aforesaid
were deceived, and knew less than we?</p>
               <p>Verily Sir, It seems a bold Oath for so great a Number of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
Men as are put upon it, and for us that are unlearned in
the English Laws.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But I doubt all these hard Questions are but raised as dust to

how will you give Security for your Loyalty?</p>

               <p>They that think my Oath Security, take me for so honest,
as that I will not be Perjured. And if so, I have already taken
the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and an Oath of <hi>Fidelity</hi>
as the King's Chaplain in Ordinary (tho' never called to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
it.) And I have fully in a large Volume, called, <hi>A second
Plea for Peace,</hi> declared my Political Principles, which after all
thoughts I stand to; And no one hath given me a word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
against them to this day, after so many years, but some
in meer Malice tell me of my Aphorisms revok't, without taking
notice of this.</p>
               <p>I here repeat that I am ready to engage to the utmost, that I
renounce all Rebellion, Treason and Sedition, and all Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
tending thereto; that I am for as much Power of Princes
and Obedience of Subjects, as any Text of Scripture speaks for,
or as is given or asserted by any General Council, or the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of any Christian Church that I have seen, except what is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the Pope and his Substitutes; And I hold it unlawful to
take Arms at all against the King; that is, against either his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
Person, Rights or Prerogative; or against any lawfully
Commissioned by him, yea, or unlawfully, except in such Cases
as God's Law of Nature, or the King himself by Law or contrary
Command shall bind Men to resist.</p>

you in some Cases to resist: And will not all Rebels plead that
Law?</p>

If Ten <hi>Irishmen</hi> pretend a Commission to Kill all the Parliament

a very good help to them. But the Case is much altered, and
People now have more suitable Helps; and Ministers have so
much other Work to do in their Studies, and with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
every day, and some Prayers to use more suitable to their
Families and Closets, that it must needs be a sinful Impediment
against other Duties, to say Common-Prayer twice a day. If
they were commanded to <hi>Preach</hi> twice a day, every day in the

               <p>We are not for abusive dallying with Covenants about

               <p>The <hi>internal</hi> part is the <hi>first</hi> and chief part of their Duty,
without which the <hi>external</hi> is not their Duty, but their great Sin.
It is the Duty of Heathens to <hi>Believe and be baptized,</hi> but not
to be baptized till they believe. It is the Duty of Candidates
for the Ministry, to get <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> and to <hi>officiate.</hi>
But not to officiate before they get Ability and Ordination.
It is the Duty of every Man to believe the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and to profess that belief: But to say he believeth, when
he doth not, is Hypocrisie and Lying. It is a sloathful Man's
Duty to rise and dress him, and go to his Work; but not
to work in Bed, or go abroad Naked. Men that need Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
must Marry, and then <hi>liberis operam dare,</hi> but not to do
this before they Marry. So Persons that are unfit for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
must be fit, and then receive it, but not before they
are fit. Now if you can force them by a Gaol out of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
unbelief and ungodliness, it will be a very charitable
work: Otherwise you force them upon Sacriledge and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation

Book perswade the Blasphemers and <hi>hinderers of God's
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59333:79"/>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Look over the foregoing instances: Will you make a
Law among Heathens that all shall be baptized, that this may
draw them to believe? Or will you Command all Students to
Administer the Sacraments, that this may draw them to Study

is but say, <hi>Do it, or thou shalt go to Iail.</hi> What need a Saviour,
a sanctifying Spirit, a teaching Ministry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it be so easily

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. It seemeth to make a New Gospel-Condition, or
contradict Christ's. Christ saith, That none can be his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
except he forsake all, and follow him: This Course saith,
Thou shalt be saved by Christ, if thou hadst rather Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
than lose all and lie in Jail. The Sacrament is an Invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delivering of <hi>Pardon</hi> and right to Christ and Salvation; And
none but those that desire them above all the World are capable
of these. And to give them to the forced and unwilling is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Gospel.</p>
               <p>2. It seems to put a Lie on Christ, as if he had ever made any
such gift.</p>
               <p>3. It tendeth to deceive poor Souls.</p>
               <p>4. It forceth them on Sacriledge, Hypocrisie, Prophanation
and Damnation.</p>
               <p>5. It may distract those Persons with terror who are consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of their unfitness, or those Melancholy Christians that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Temptation tremble for fear of taking their own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>6. It polluteth the Church, and confoundeth the Infidels, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens
and <hi>Fideles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:59333:79"/>
7. It thereby filleth the Church with such wicked men as
prove worse Enemies to the godly than those without.</p>
               <p>8. In all Elections the Major part of wicked forced Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants
will carry it, to chuse Ministers like themselves, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Church Matters according to their wicked minds.</p>
               <p>9. Good men seeing this are ready to be frightned out of the
Church to Separation, as men run out of a ruinous House, lest it
fall on their Heads, or fly from a noisome place with loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>10. And then the Crowd that thus get Church possession will
revile them as Schismaticks and Sectaries, and Hypocrites, and
persecute and destroy them if they can.</p>
               <p>Are not all those sad effects of turning a Church into a Prison,
and forcing men to seem to take that which Christ professeth he
doth not give them? And of casting holy things to Dogs, and
Pearls before Swine; and cramming and drenching those with
the Body and Blood of Christ, who have no right till they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and beg it, and can sell all to buy this precious Pearl? We
dare not Assent, Consent or Swear to such a Course as this, nor
publish an Excommunication against such men on this account.
It's an odd thing to cast men out because they will not come
in.</p>
               <p>And I pray you how can Ministers in great Cities and Parishes
perform this Canonical Obedience, to <hi>give in to the Bishop or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
the names of all that Communicated not at</hi> Easter, when they
know not the hundredth part of the Parishioners in some places?
I do believe that in the two Parishes that I last lived in, there are
above fourscore thousand Souls: And is it like that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
know twenty thousand of these? I have been at their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
even at <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> and I never saw five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
there. And if they gave in the names of but twenty or
forty thousand Non-communicants tho' it's like there are nearer
two hundred thousand) in this Diocess, what work would the
Bishop and Chancellor have? Cannot you easily imagine what
their Discipline would be, and how they would exhort each
Person one by one to Repentance, and plead with them for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
and resolve their doubts? Doth not this one thing tell
you what the <hi>English</hi> Diocesan Episcopacy is, that giveth one man
the Disciplining of many hundred Parishes?</p>

               <p>You talk as if you would have a Church of Saints, and seem to
make Religion too serious a business: It is well if we could have a
Church of Civil Men and Peaceable Subjects, that will use Religion
for the Civil Interest, as far as will serve the will of Governors, and
the Common Peace.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>I am sure St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to no Church but such as he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Saints; and I am sure Christ will save none but Saints: An
unsanctified Christian, and a Church not holy, are contradictions
<hi>in adjecto.</hi> Christ came not to set up a meer worldly Kingdom,
and to devise a Religion to serve the Will, Ambition or Interest
of worldly men, nor meerly to promote Civility, Wealth and
Peace. If this be all that you would have, go to <hi>Aristotle, Plato,
Seneca, Plutarch, Cicero,</hi> &amp;c. You need not be Christians for
this. But yet we pretend not to know mens Hearts: It is visible
Saints that the visible Church consisteth of; and with whom we
must have visible Communion. And it is not left to the will of
every Pastor whom he will take for a Saint; for then Churches
would be of as many sorts or degrees, as Ministers strict or loose
Opinions are. But Christ hath himself made the Articles Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to Christian Faith and Practice, and the Baptismal Covenant,
and required us to take those into the Church who seriously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
Belief, and Consent, till they null that Profession by a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Profession or Conversation; which must be proved against any
man before he is rejected: For the Church is not a Society to be
arbitrarily made or unmade, at every Ministers or Bishops will,
but hath from Christ the fixed Laws of its Constitution and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Administration (better than our 141 Canons.)</p>
               <p>But indeed you have toucht our sore: For my part I am past
doubt that we should all live in Peace, and Christian Piety, if all
(yea all Bishops and Priests) were but agreed at the Heart what
it is to be a Christian, and whether the Gospel be certainly true,
and whether Christ be the Son of God, or a deceiver, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be a Life after this, and a Judgment of all according
to their works: Yea, were they but heartily agreed that there
is a God, who is the Rewarder of them that diligently seek him,
and a punisher of the wicked. The dispute seems to me to be,
whether we shall be Christians indeed, or worldly Hypocrites
called Christians; and whether we shall use the Name of God,
Christ and Religion for Christ and Holiness, or for the Flesh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ.</p>

               <p>I doubt some will find Christ more severe, and be less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to endure his Censure than mine, when he shall call some
men to account for turning sacred Names, and Offices, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
against him, to banish Conscience and serious Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
(to say nothing of Veracity, common Honesty and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity)
out of the Church, and turn his House of Prayer into a
place of Merchandise, and a Den of Thieves; and tempt <hi>Turks</hi>
and Heathens to hate Christians for their wickedness, and to fly
from the Christian Church, lest they should lose all Religion,
Trustiness and Honesty, or the Reputation of them: But I speak
not now of our Governours, whom I leave to God.</p>

               <p>THE last part of Ministerial Conformity which I named
to you, is, that if we cannot conform to all aforesaid,
for fear of Damnation, we must cease our Ministry, and must
not Preach Christs Gospel to any more than four besides our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
nor perform any Worship of God with more, (but in
their way) and we must neither dwell nor come within Five
Miles of any (Burgess) Corporation, or any place where-ever
we lived or travelled, and preached since the Act of Oblivion:
Otherwise we must lye in the common Goal.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Doubtless they that made this Law against you, thought you
very wicked intolerable men, and thought your Preaching very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
And indeed so they say of you in the Preface of the <hi>Oxford</hi>

               <p>They do so; and I am glad to find that falseness, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
as such is yet disowned in the World, and that men do
not glory in the very names of them. It is a notable evidence
that there is a Life of retribution, that naughtiness is disowned
by all Mankind, and the worst would be thought and called ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and true, and good; and that the World would not Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
Christ, nor Persecute and Murder his Apostles under the
name of righteous holy men, but under the name of Malefactors,
Enemies to <hi>Caesar,</hi> Breakers of the Law, and Pestilent Fellows
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59333:81"/>
that troubled the Peace, and turned the World upside down.
The Devil himself dare not own the name of Lying, Malignity
and Murder, nor of Persecuting Men for Truth and Goodness,
and Gods Cause.</p>
               <p>And verily it seemeth the Controversie of many in this Age,
whether they that scarce speak of God but in Swearing and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
nor of Religion, but in scorning or threatning the serious
practisers of it, and that savour little but Eating and Drinking to
the full, and Playing, and getting Riches, and hateing all that
are stricter than they, or those that make Gods Law their rule,
and Obedience to him the work of their Lives, and his serious
Worship their delight, and Heaven their hope, and dare not
wilfully sin against God, nor be Perjured or Lie; I say, which of
these be the honester Men?</p>

               <p>1. What mean you by <hi>[our party?]</hi> If you mean Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
to the present Laws of Conformity, you are easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed:
For the Rebellion was over, and the King restored be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the present Conformity was Enacted: And when there was
no such Law, there were no Nonconformists to it, nor any such
Party in being.</p>
               <p>If you mean the old Nonconformists, I answer you.</p>
               <p>1. They were part for the Parliament, part against their War,
and part Neuters.</p>
               <p>2. There was a multitude of Conformist Ministers for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for one Nonconformist: I have oft proved, that there
was at the beginning of that Parliament, not many more Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist
Ministers left in <hi>England,</hi> than were Counties, if so
many. In the <hi>Westminster</hi> As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly there were but seven or eight
Englishmen: Most of the Sermons before the Parliament,
which are now most blamed, were Preached by Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.</p>
               <p>3. Such as kept in, and obeyed the Parliament and Usurpers,
did most of them Conform, of 9000 or 10000 Ministers, there
were but two thousand that Conformed not: And did meer
turning to Conformity manifest Repentance?</p>
               <p>4. But I have oft, and oft said, if they will silence all that had
any hand in Wars, (except the Conformists) and no more, we
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59333:81"/>
will thank them with great joy? For I do not think there are
forty, that I say not twenty, silenced Ministers alive in all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that had any hand in the War against the King. And it's
an odd kind of Justice that should eject and accuse so great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
for other mens Actions.</p>
               <p>5. But if our Doctrine be Seditious, why should not we be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
rather to Preach openly where Witnesses may convict us,
and the Law take hold on us, than in secret to four, where none
can convict us?</p>
               <p>6. And how comes it to pass, that whilst so many hundred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
are hunted and ruined for Preaching, we hear of none at
all punished for any False or Seditious Doctrine? Do those that
watch, accuse and ruin us, want will to find out our false or ill
Doctrine? while I am writing this, the common talk is, two
poor Fellows accused such a one, and two Beggars, or poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that stood at the doors, took their Oaths against such, and
such, and such, many. Warrants granted to distrain for Forty
Pound or Sixty Pound a Sermon, on Ministers and People; the
Citizens Goods seized, and carryed away, their Shops made bare,
many laid in Jayls, and thousands waiting for utter ruin of all
they have; and all this on the account of their Preaching and
Hearing as without the Common Prayer; and not a word among
all these of any False Doctrine spoken.</p>
               <p>7. And Gods great mercy having of late years opened the Press,
the Nonconformists have Printed abundance of their Sermons,
that the World may see what Doctrine they Preached: There
are two Volumes of Morning Lectures at one place, and two at
another, and one Volume of Lectures against Popery. There is
a great Volume of Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi>'s Sermons, and a great one, and

divers of Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> divers of Mr. <hi>Richard Alleine</hi>'s, Dr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> of

               <p>I then gave the World an account in my Book called Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Aphorisms, or a Holy Common-wealth written for Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
by Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi>'s Provocation, what moved me to be on
the Parliaments side; and I know nothing that they have charged

on my Doctrine, but the words of that Book which I revoked
long ago, and some Clauses in my Saints Rest, which I expung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the King came in: And if my later writings (as my
Second Plea for Peace) written purposely to satisfie them of my
present judgment, be not regardable, why do they call me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractations?
And if the Act of Indempnity have done nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our former Actions, all General <hi>Monk</hi>'s Army, and the
rest, such that restored the King, must expect the like reward,
if death deliver them not from mens wrath.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L</speaker>
               <p>But why should you not give over Preaching when you are si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced?
Have not the Bishops power to silence and degrade, as well as
to ordain; or the Parliament at least?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>We doubt not but the Magistrate hath power to hinder
Preachers from doing mischief, and to restrain those that Preach
Rebellion, Sedition or Heresie, or that do more hurt than good:
But not on that pretence, to hinder good, and to forbid Christs
Ministers to Preach his Gospel: Bishops and Senior Pastors are
Investing Ministers of Christ, to ordain fit Men to the Ministry,
and judge of their fitness to that end: And if men prove uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by Apostacy or Heresie, or Perfidiousness, they ought to do
as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did about <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Basilides,</hi> require the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the name of Christ to forsake them. But they have no
power to forbid any faithful Minister to do the Office to which
he is ordained, nor to forbid the people to hear them: And if
they do, their Commands are nullities as to any Obligation to
Obedience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But they that give you the Office may take it away.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>He that giveth it as a <hi>Donor</hi> may, which is Christ, but not
he that only as a Servant delivereth that which his Master gives.
If you send a Servant to deliver a Man Possession of House, Land,
Horse, Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That Servant cannot take it from him at
his pleasure. I do not think that the Priest that Marryeth Men,
can unmarry them when he will: If he could, I think he would
have more work. I scarce think the Patron that giveth one a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
can take it away when he will; which is more alienable
than the Office.</p>
               <p>A man cannot renounce it himself when he will, who hath
some more power of himself than the Bishop hath.</p>
               <p>Do you not know that all are agreed that the Office of the
Ministry is as Marriage, during Life, and not for Tryal or at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59333:82"/>
except in case of Adultery? Therefore the Papists say, that
Ordination maketh an Indelible Character: Of this all Parties
are agreed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But why say you the Ordainers do not give you the Power,
but as Investing Ministers? you are not called immediately by Christ
as the Apostles were; who then doth give it you, if not the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. The Office lyeth in an Obligation to great labour and
great patience as well as in a gift of power. It is a power to
work in a suffering state. And as the Bishop can oblige no man
to this against his will, so neither can he oblige any man farther
than Christ and his own consent oblige him. Therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that neither can he give the power farther than Christ giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it; and the Ordainers and People, and Magistrates have each
their part under Christ, in the conveyance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>How doth Christ give Ministers their Office?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. He maketh a Law that there shall be a Ministry, and
specifieth the Office by describing their work, and the necessary
qualification of the Persons: So that it is not left to Bishops nor
any to alter the Office, nor to admit any uncapable Persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
               <p>2. Next Christ blesseth Mens Preparatory Studies and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and by his gifts and grace doth give them all Ministerial
Abilities.</p>
               <p>3. He maketh them desirous and willing of the Office and
Work in Love to the blessed Effects, and so maketh them Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters.</p>
               <p>4. His Providence bringeth them where their Labours are
really needful.</p>
               <p>5. He moveth the minds of the Flock or Electors to desire,
chuse or accept them.</p>
               <p>6. He commandeth the Ordainers to Approve and Ordain
those that are thus qualified as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>7. He commandeth Magistrates to protect and encourage
them.</p>
               <p>8. He commandeth the Neighbour Church-Pastors to own
them in their Neighbourly Communion. Thus you may see
how Ministers are made by Christ, tho' not without mans Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59333:83"/>
Do you know how God maketh Marriages? 1. He instituteth
the State, and by his Law maketh the Husband the Ruler of the
Wife. 2. He causeth their natural Capacity and Inclination.
3. His Providence acquainteth them with each other. And
4. He moveth them to Consent. And 5. He maketh it the
Ministers Duty to do his part; so that the Husbands power is
of God.</p>
               <p>Do you know who giveth the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
their Power? 1. The King by <hi>Charter</hi> determineth what,
Power, they shall have, and how they shall be qualified, and
how chosen, and how sworn and invested. 2. The Citizens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
choose them. 3. And the Recorder Sweareth them.
Who is it now that giveth them the Power? The King's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
tho' not till they be duly qualified and chosen. The Recorder
cannot depose them again; No, nor the Citizens (who may do
more) unless it be in the Charter.</p>

               <p>But what Sin fear you by ceasing your ministry?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. We fear the guilt of Perfidious breaking of our Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Vow, by which we solemnly obliged our selves to diligent
performing of our Ministry. The Bishops put those of us on
this whom they ordained, who now would force us to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it.</p>
               <p>2. Therein we fear the guilt of Sacriledge, as alienating Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
consecrated to God. And we can judge it to be no better
than Pharisaical Hypocrisie, in them that aggravate the Sacriledge
of alienating consecrated Utensils and Lands, and yet will alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
consecrated Persons, and take it to be well done: whereas
the Lands and Goods are but to serve the Persons who are nearer
to God, while they serve him.</p>
               <p>3. We fear the Sin of Cruelty, Unmercifulness, and the guilt
of Damning Souls. As if we were commanded to forbear
feeding our Children, or the Poor, we should expect to be
charg'd with Murdering them, if they died of Famine, by our
Neglect.</p>
               <p>4. We fear being charged with fighting against Christ, or
as Enemies to his Kingdom, and to his Saving Work: He was so
great an Esteemer of Souls and Holiness, that by the greatest of
Miracles, he came in Flesh to redeem, and sanctifie, and save Men:
And if we starve and betray them to Satan by our neglect, we are
Enemies to his saving Work and Office. And he that condemneth
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59333:83"/>
them that do not feed, and clothe, and visit them, may condemn
us more, if we betray their Souls.</p>
               <p>5. We fear being guilty of serving the Devil, in deserting
and betraying Souls that are our trust: As a Captain that should
desert his Station and fly, or should desert his Garison and Trust,
doth let in the Enemy: Or as Christ saith, <hi>The hireling
fleeth and leaveth the flock to Wolves:</hi> God saith to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Watchman, <hi>Ezek. 33. Their blood will I require at thy
hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. We shall be a Temptation to the People to imitate us, and
forsake the truth, and turn from Christ: For if the Captains fly,
the Soldiers are like to follow. And if we may cease Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Piety, they may think they may as well cease Family and
Private Piety.</p>
               <p>7. We may look for the doom of the sloathful Servant that
hid his Master's talent, and was sentenced to be cast for it <hi>into
outer Darkness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. We cast away our hopes of Salvation by Christ, if we cast
away our Evidence of our Title to his Love: As he charged
<hi>Peter,</hi> three times, If he loved him to feed his Sheep and Lambs;
so the same extends to us: We tell him that we love him not,
when we wilfully deny to feed his Flock.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>The charge is dreadful that</hi> Paul <hi>lays on</hi> Timothy, <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
on us,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 1. I charge thee therefore before God and
the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his
appearing, and his Kingdom; that thou Preach the Word, be instant,
in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering
and doctrine. <hi>When we recite</hi> Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>swords,</hi> Necessity is laid upon
me, and woe unto me if I preach not the Gospel;] <hi>Some are so
vain as to say, that this woe belongs to none but those that
Christ called immediately, as if Men ordinarily called had
no such Necessity. But</hi> Timothy <hi>was not called immediately
by Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. Christ himself hath told us, that he that puts his hand
to the Plow, and looks back, is not fit for the Kingdom
of God: And that the Servant that will be blessed, must
give the Children their meat in season, and be found so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For these Reasons we dare not forsake our Office and
Work.</p>

               <p>That's true: But we must do what we can: Christ fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
his Ministers how they should be used, Hated, Scourged,
Killed, and yet will have them go on to the Death. <hi>When they
persecute you in one City, flee to another,</hi> was his charge; what we
cannot do in one place we may do in another; and if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Preach to more, we must do it to fewer. No Suffering
will excuse us, (much less bare Prohibitions) which do not
disable us.</p>

must we therefore renounce Reason? so false Teachers may

               <p>1. The Supernumeraries that want Benefices, do not help the

               <p>Do you not know that the <hi>London</hi> Churches were burnt
down 1666, and to this day it's but few of them that are built
again: but Ministers preach in small inconvenient Tabernacles:
And those that are built, the Seats are commonly all taken up
long ago, and lock'd up: I heard the last Week an Eminent
Esquire say, that he offer'd Five Pound for a Seat, and could
have none, and he was not able to stand so long with the Lads
in the Alley. People will not let Strangers into their Seats,
when they are Crowded with the Owners: I come into no
Church that hath a competent sober Preacher, that is not full;
Alleys and Seats. And I pray you if ten Thousand out of <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
or <hi>Martins,</hi> or <hi>Giles</hi> would go about the City to seek for
Church-room: 1. How shall they know before hand in what
Churches to find it? 2. When they miss it in three or four, the
time will be over before they find it in a fifth. 3. Few but
strong men are able to stand so long in the Alleys without
Seats. 4. And this supposeth them to be honest thirsty Souls
that have least need; whereas the worser sort that have no such
appetite are the Multitude, who will stay at home if they have
not convenience near them. 5. And the most willing People
will hardly travel far to hear a man rail at them and slander them,
as some do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But what great supply of this defect do your Meetings make?
Are not most of them in the Parishes where there is room? And
are not most of your hearers such as you think have least need?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. As many Meetings are held in the Greater Parishes
as will be endured, and more would be, could they be suffered
at any possible rate.</p>

                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59333:85"/>
2. Those that dwell in the greater Parishes, can go further into
the less, when they know before-hand that they have there room
and hired Seats. The Meetings that have been kept up in the
City Parishes, were as much for others, as for the Parishioners,
and were there continued, because there was till of late the least
disturbance, and gentlest prosecution.</p>
               <p>3. Those that have least need, yet have so great need, as is
more regardable than any bodily want: Souls and Heaven are
precious, and all Men have Sins and Weaknesses and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and all helps possible are little enough to secure our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>4. When godly Persons are at our Assemblies, they take not up
that room in the Parish-Churches which others would have, and
so exclude not others.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But after all your Meetings, there are still as many thousands
as you talk of that go to no Church.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>We are unwilling to be found any Cause of that. The
more need there is, the greater is our guilt, if we neglect what
we can do for the supply.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But what's this to the common Case of Country Parishes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>For my part I would have no silenced Minister preach
where there is not evident need. But the Country alas is not
without need. 1. Some Parishes are so great, that part of the
Inhabitants have more miles to come to Church, than the Aged,
Women, Weak and Children can Travel. 2. Too many have
such Teachers as the people dare, not take for their Pastors,
any more than an Ignorant Quack for their Physician, or one
for their Schoolmaster that cannot read. 3. Some had able
Learned Pastors turned out, and they cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prove that their
relation to them as such is dissolved. 4. Some by the ruining
Prosecutions of the Clergy and Bishops Counsils are cast into
an over-great aversness to them, and will not take such for their
Pastors, as they think have the Teeth and Claws of Wolves.
And will not travel far to seek Figs and Grapes on Thorns
and Thistles. And if these err and be to be blamed, they
are not therefore to be <hi>forsaken,</hi> any more than our Children, if
they cannot eat Cheese, are to be famished and denied all
other food.</p>

But I must refer you to a full Treatise which I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

               <p>Did you not say even now, That small Countrey Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
have no need of us? One Man may serve for two
Hundred or a Thousand, better than for many Thousands.</p>
               <p>2. The Reasons of our Preaching is Men's real need, and
the Churches good: Therefore we are most obliged, <hi>caeteris
paribus,</hi> where there is most need, and most probability of
doing good.</p>
               <p>3. Christ bids us, <hi>When they persecute you in one City, fly
to another:</hi> And the Apostles first planted their Churches in
Cities. If you know the Reasons of these, you know our
Reasons.</p>
               <p>To conclude, whose Service is it, think you, to perswade
2000 such Ministers to give over their Preaching and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry?
whose interest requireth it? Did Christ or his Apostles
ever do or perswade such a thing? But the way to bring us
all to Popery is to disable its chief Adversaries, and to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
all Religion first, that Ignorance and Unconscionableness
may be receptive of a new Form. You must take your Church-Bells,
and break and melt them, if you will cast them anew to
bring them to a new sound and use.</p>

               <p>I have before cited the express words of the Canon:
They must be presented and prosecuted if they come not to their

if it be one that never Preacheth that they go from,

               <p>I take that from them for a great favour, that they drive
us not from all Christian converse, But give us leave to speak
privately with more than the Parish-Priest: But even privately
it must be no Nonconformist, for they cannot be heard at five
Miles distance.</p>
               <p>But will you seriously tell me, 1. Whether most Parish-Ministers
have not so much Work at home, that they have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time to spare for Strangers?</p>
               <p>2. Whether as Men provide first for their own Families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they relieve Neighbours and the Poor; so Ministers will not
think themselves bound to do by their own Parishes? and scarce
afford the scraps to others?</p>
               <p>3. Do you think in Conscience that all Souls, and specially
the most Ignorant have not need of a constant Pastor, and the
help of his Office, as well as of an occasional Discourse with a
Stranger? If not, what have we Parish-Priests for, and why pay

therefore take them for your Physicians or Lawyers? Do you
know the case of our Parishes or not? Tell me what you would
do your self in this case.</p>
               <p>Suppose a poor Sinner is convinced of his great ignorance
and dulness, and sinful inclinations, and strong temptations, and
finds great difference between a clear Judicious, skilful, serious
Minister and others, and yet that the best doth prove too little
for his help: This Man dwells in a Parish where in the Pulpit
he heareth a young Fellow sometime read a Cento of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
shreds, as School-boys make an ignorant Declamation: And
sometimes he heareth him tell them what damnable Hypocrites
they are, and Schismaticks, that scruple any thing commanded
by the Church, and then make long Prayers, and talk religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to hide it: And in Company he hath not a serious word
for a Holy Life, and to prepare Men for another World, but
sometimes reviles <hi>Puritans,</hi> and at best talks of worldly things,
or Opinions or Factions in Religion; and perhaps will be Drunk
and Rant it with the most Prophane. His Parishioner in Doubts
and Trouble of Conscience comes to him for Satisfaction; And
the best Answer he can get is, <hi>[What</hi> Puritan <hi>put these Fears or
Scruples in your head? If you trouble your mind about such matters
you will shortly turn Schismatick or go mad: Trust God, and follow
your Business, and be merry. The Scripture is for Divines, and not
for such as you; It is above your Capacity.]</hi> The Parishioner having
no better Answer, goeth no more: And perhaps an hundred
or a thousand in the Parish have more need of Pastoral help,
than this Man: And in the Pulpit he Preacheth them asleep,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59333:87"/>
or into Laughter, or into hatred of <hi>Puritans;</hi> and out of the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
doth drink, and talk, and live as they.</p>
               <p>2. Suppose these Men hear the Clergy tell why they Silence
and Banish, and render odious such Men as we are: And they
think with themselves, we perceive by this that it is not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
what pastors we have: And if these reviled Men be so bad,
is our Priest any better, or wise or honester, or more to be
trusted?</p>
               <p>3. Suppose these poor people had a Teacher 20 or 10 years
that is now cast out, whose preaching they found to be clear and
edifying, and quickening; that preacht all for Faith, and Hope,
and Love, and Holiness, and Peace, and Heaven; and lived in
exemplary Charity, Piety, and Righteously and Soberly, and
unweariedly taught them with tenderness publickly and from
House to House. And the sense and experience of their Souls
tells them how great the change of their condition is?</p>
               <p>4. Suppose these Men hear the Teacher called <hi>Arminian,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding
Infusions of the Spirit and Grace, and proving that God
worketh on Souls morally by the aptitude of means, and teacheth
and changeth Men as rational Creatures?</p>
               <p>Can you blame this Man if he conclude [My Soul is more to
me than my Life: my Necessity is unquestionable: my Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
what edifieth me is not to be born down by the scorn of a
derider. I am dark and dull, and too bad under the best helps,
but alas profit little by an insipid, sleepy or deriding Speech. As
no man hath power to tie me to marry an ugly-Scold, or to trust
a Fool, or Knave, or Enemy for my Physician; so no man hath
power to deprive me of the needful helps to my Salvation, when

not need of as skilful a Helper, as the Profession of Law

an ignorant Prater, and a skilful Lawyer or Physician? And as I
have more care of my Soul than of my Body, so mens Laws
have less power over it.</p>

               <p>I do challenge oft any to name that Nation under Heaven
out of the Kings Dominions that hath two thousand worthier
Ministers than those that were here silenced, and reviled, and
hunted like Rogues. But I pray you tell me,</p>
               <p>1. Do you know how many, and what sort of men the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
in <hi>England</hi> are that chuse them? The Conformists oft say
that many of them are Simonists: It's well known that many of
them are taken for the famousest Papists in the Countrey. Tho'
they have the wit and faculty to keep off Legal Conviction, or
else to manage their Advowsons by Trustees. And O how well
were it with <hi>England</hi> if none or few of them were Worldlings,
Gluttons, Drunkards, Whoremongers, or Haters, or Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of serious godly men? Is there any Body doubts whether
there be such? And tho' good and sober Lords and Gentlemen
will promote good and sober men, the propagation of the species
is the most natural Appetite; and an evil Tree will bring forth
evil Fruit, and a Hater of Godliness is unlike to chuse a godly
Pastor. And any man that hath Money, be he never so bad or
erroneous may buy an Advowson or Presentation. And must
all p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or Souls have no other Pastors than these men will
chuse?</p>
               <p>And <hi>quo jure?</hi> how came they by a right to chuse Pastors for
all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and? Did God ever give it them?</p>
               <p>The People at first sinfully gave it them, in blind gratitude,
for Building and Endowing Temples. But Mens Grant many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years ago, being sinful, hath no power to bind our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:
Our Fore fathers might give their Lands from their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;
but they could not give away Gods Ordinances, nor the
means of our Salvation. If Patrons might ill dispose of Temples
and Tythes, that's nothing to prove that they may chuse Pastors
for all men against their wills.</p>

               <p>But the Bishops have the power of Institution, and they will keep
out unworthy Men.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. Do they <hi>de facto</hi> keep them out? I told you truly what
a company of ignorant drunken Readers I was bred up under till I
was thirteen years of Age, or fourteen, and what a sort, were
round about us: And yet the Bishops were as good men as any I
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59333:88"/>
know now. Bishop <hi>Morton</hi> was our Bishop. If we are so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agreed in a notorious matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> what Pastors multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of Parishes now have, it's in vain to dispute of any thing
else.</p>
               <p>2. When we have told the Conformists what men are Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
their common answer is, that it's long of the Patrons, and
the Law, that enableth not the Bishop to keep them out: And
that if the Bishop deny Institution to any one that can but say some
account of his Faith in Latin, a <hi>quare impedit</hi> will force him to
Institute him. But whether you will lay it on the Bishops want
of Power, or their Will, it's no relief to the miserable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>And that which the Bishop requireth more to Ordination, is
but a Certificate of a good Conversation; which I never knew
man so Heretical or wicked in all my Life, that could not get
from three Ministers.</p>

               <p>Would you have Patrons turned out of their right?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>No, it is no right of Gods giving to be the sole Choosers of
Pastors for men Souls. There is a threefold part in Ministers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance.
1. To judge who is fit to be by them Ordained: And
this is the Ordainers part.</p>
               <p>2. To Chuse or Consent who shall be the Pastor of Mens
Souls: And this is the Peoples part.</p>
               <p>3. To judge and chuse who shall have the publick Places,
Maintenance, Countenance and Toleration: And this is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
and Patrons part.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But these three may differ, and it's like will do so; how then
shall ever the Churches be provided?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>There is nothing in this World without difficulties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences:
But on so great a Treasure a threefold Lock is
good security; and hath less inconvenience than the way that we
are against. It's like necessity will at last make all consent, (as
the Cities in <hi>Belgium</hi> do in their Government.) But if they should
not; 1. None can chuse who shall be the Pastor of this or that
Church, till the Ordainers consent that he be in general a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in the Church Universal: So that their Consent so far is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</p>
               <p>2. If the Patron offer an unfit Man, and the People refuse
him, he may offer others: If they continue to disagree, it is but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59333:89"/>
let the Patron chuse who shall have the Place and Tythes, and
the People chuse who shall be their Pastor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What confusion will this bring in? Shall one that is no Pastor
have the Benefice? and whom shall the People chuse, and where shall they
Assemble?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If great Men that should keep Gods Order, will obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
break it, it's they that cause the confusion, and inferiors can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
remedy it. But if you will lay by prejudice and have patience
I shall open the case to you.</p>
               <p>I. The Magistrate as the Patron of the Church, must see that
every place have competent Teaching: And over the meer Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens
or Auditors, he may appoint who shall chuse these
Parish Teachers, and to them as such he may give the publick
Place and Maintenance (if Original Dedication to Pastors as
such make it not Sacriledge to alienate it.) And these Teachers
are bound to Preach, Catechise, and do all that's due to Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens.</p>
               <p>II. If these men be tolerable, no doubt the generality of the
People will chuse them for their Pastors, prudence requiring it;
rather than lose the advantage of the Place, and of a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
maintained Ministry.</p>
               <p>III. If intolerable Men get in, or such as the Flock of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants
cannot submit to, it's most like that the People will
for the advantage of the publick Place and Countenance, take
some Neighbour Pastor for theirs, and there Communicate, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Tythes at home.</p>
               <p>IV. If most chuse the Parish Teacher for their Pastor, and a
few Dissenters go to the next Parish Church, the inconvenience
will be comparatively small.</p>
               <p>V. If any number can consent to no Parish Minister near them,
it is but to tolerate their Communion in a place of their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring,
if the Magistrate find their Principles and Conversation
tolerable, and this under Laws of Peace and good Behaviour;
and what harm is in all this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>It seems then you take it for unlawful Conformity to take the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Ministers for our Pastors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>No Sir; tho' any Patron chuse them, and obtrude them,
to whom God hath given no such right, yet if they be fit or tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Men, the convenience of Place, Countenance, Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and Parish Order, will teach Men, as I said, <hi>finis gratiâ,</hi>
in prudence to consent to them. But if such be unfit and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
I will have better, if I can. And I take it for unlawful
Conformity to take all, or any that are intolerable for our
Pastors, because such Patrons chuse them; who I should be loth
should chuse my Servants, my Cook, or my Physician. And it's
unlawful to give away to a Patron, the Churches right of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Consent, if we can keep it.</p>

               <p>II. THE next fault of Lay-Conformity is, That they are

called Patron, and not the Parents, must chuse who shall be
Pastor to their Children when they are at Age; and to what
Church their Family shall go.</p>

               <p>Did not you say before that the King may settle Teachers in all
the Parishes, and force Men to hear them? why then may he not force
you and your Children, and Servants to hear them, as Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I told you that he ought to take care that no Parish want
a fit Teacher, whom the willing may hear. 2. And that the
negligent and unwilling be forced to hear either them or some
other allowed, or justly tolerated Teacher. But I never said that
1. Because the Catechumens may be forced to hear their Parish
Teacher, who are Free-men, therefore those that are Wives,
Children and Servants may be forced to go to one Church, when
the Husband, Parent or Master commands them to go with him
to another. 2. Nor yet that those Masters that are Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,
and not Catechumens, may be forced from hearing their
own Pastors, approved or tolerated. It's enough that they be
forced to hear either. And Men ought not to be deprived of
the due Government of their Families.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Is not the Patron as fit to chuse a Teacher or Pastor for your
Wives, Children and Servants as you are?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>No; 1. A Mans Interest in, and power over his Wife and
Children is earlier and greater than a Patrons is. It is natural,
and by a Law, which no Men have power to abrogate: Self-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Family-government are antecedent to Princes or
States Government, and they have no right to dissolve it.</p>
               <p>2. I shall gain or lose more by the welfare or misery of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
than the Patron will.</p>
               <p>3. Nature hath given me a greater Love to Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and bound me to a greater care for them, than it hath
done a Patron.</p>
               <p>4. I know them better, and therefore know what they need,
and what Teacher and Communion is fit for them, better than a
Patron that never saw them or me.</p>
               <p>5. Supposing that I am allowed to chuse my own Pastor and
Communion, it will be inconsistent with Family-government,
that my Wife, Children and Servants be forced to go to another
place, where I can have no account of them what they do, and
how they behave themselves.</p>
               <p>6. If no Man may justly chuse for my Children a Tutor, a
Trade, a Physician, or Diet, or Cloathing, rather than my self,
(much less a worse when I chuse a better;) nor may impose
Husbands or Wives on them, much less may any chuse for them
against my will and choice, an Office on which their Salvation is
so specially concerned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But if you may force your Wife and Children to what Pastor you
chuse for them, it seems then a Man may be forced to one Pastor,
rather than another: And then why may not the Magistrate force
you, as well as you may force your Family?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You mistake me; I do not say I may force my Family to
any Pastor: I say, if they that are not Communicants but Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens,
may be forced to one Teacher, it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s meeter for me to
force them, than for a Patron or any other.</p>
               <p>2. But as to Communion I will not force them to it at all; nor
to this or that Pastor: But because different Places and Pastors for
Communion, signifieth different minds, and will be a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting
inconvenience to a Family, I will use all my reason and
loving interest in them to bring them all to one place for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
And its very strange if I prevail not; having better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59333:90"/>
to satisfie their reason, and to perswade them, than a
stranger hath; so that such Breaches will be very rare.</p>
               <p>But if I be as injurious to them as some Patrons are, and
would draw them to chuse an intolerable Pastor, or false Teacher,
it is their Interest and Duty not to be perswaded by me to their
hurt.</p>

               <p>What confusion will this make in the World, when all people,
even Wives and Servants may chuse on what Pastor they will depend,
and where they will Communicate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>It were a happy World if you, or any did deliver it from
differences, yea, or confusion. But perfect concord is no where
but where is perfect knowledge, holiness, righteousness and
love. If it breed confusions in the World that every Man chuse
his own Dwelling, Trade, Diet, Cloathing, Wife, Servants,
Travels, Company, Physician, Counsellor, Tutor, Master,
Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so that their Life, Death and Souls be more
in their own power than anothers, there is no remedy: If you
would devise any other Chuser for them of all these, you would
cure that disorder with madness and destruction; who is it that
should chuse all these for all other Men? He that chuseth for
them must answer for them, and must be accordingly saved or
damned for them. If God had appointed some Pope that he
would always make wise and good, to chuse for the Kingdoms
of <hi>China, Pegu, Tartary, Iapan, Sumatra,</hi> and all the rest of the
World, what Religion they should be of, and what they should
love and hate, speak and do, it would have brought the World
to a happy state, if all would stand to that Mans choice: But who
can teach God how to Rule the World, and say, Thou shouldst
have made Man otherwise.</p>
               <p>Will you mark this: Either it is only to <hi>command</hi> Men what to
chuse, or else to <hi>make them chuse</hi> by efficient determination of their
wills; or else to move them by force without or against their
wills, that you would have the World saved from sin and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
There is but these three ways.</p>
               <p>And I. To move them against or without their <hi>wills,</hi> is <hi>natural
motion</hi> or <hi>violent,</hi> and will make none of their actions good or bad
in a Moral sence: <hi>Nil nisi voluntarium est morale:</hi> Thus a Horse,
a Watch, a Ship is governed: And you may lay them in what
order you will, when they are dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:59333:91"/>
II. To make them good by Physical efficient determination of
Mens wills, God can do it and doth not, at least, with most.
Man cannot do it: It's madness to pretend to it. And I hope
you will not accuse God, who only can do it, for not cureing the
sin and confusions of the World this way.</p>
               <p>III. It is therefore only the Moral way of Cure that remaineth,
by Laws, Rewards and Punishments: And hath not God made
better Laws for Religion than Man can make? More infallible
and perfect, with more aweful Power, and with ten thousand
fold greater Rewards and Punishments? And now what mean
you by saying that <hi>every Man must not be left to chuse what Religion
he list?</hi> 1. Every Man is a rational voluntary Agent, and not a
Stone or Brute. 2. Every bad Man is left undetermined by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of God or Man in all the evil that he doth. 3. Every one
in the World is left by God and Man to chuse Salvation or Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in the means, and to speed as he chuseth. 4. No Man
is left Lawless to chuse what he will without the Obligation of a
perfect Divine Law.</p>

               <p>But Men that believe not a God, and a Life to come, must be

come are fit for Church Communion, and may be forced to it?
No nor any that do not desire Christ, Grace and Glory before all
the Baits of sin.</p>
               <p>2. Did you think I had pleaded that Men may without punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
do what they list, and live in wickedness? It's one thing
to <hi>restrain them from sin,</hi> and another to <hi>constrain them to sin</hi> under
the name of Religion.</p>
               <p>3. Nor did I speak against constraining Atheists and Infidels
and Malignant Enemies to hear the Gospel.</p>
               <p>4. But your force cannot constrain them to believe. And</p>
               <p>5. You ought not constrain them to Lie and say they believe.</p>
               <p>6. And you ought not prophanely to Lie in Christ's Name, by
telling an unwilling Communicant that all his sins are pardoned,
and that you Seal it to him.</p>

               <p>The last words are a great mistake: Political Power doth not
contain Natural, Personal and Oeconomical, and Ecclesiastical in
it; but supposeth them all unalterable and pre-existent, and only
useth them to Political ends, that is, the safety and good of the
Common-wealth: And as far as this end requireth, the King
hath more power of my Wife, Children, Estate, Life, than I

aforesaid: Nor hath he right to lye with your Wife as you have,

ruleth Priests may not do what the Priest doth, administer Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
use the Church Keys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that all that he can do, is
to over-rule Personal, Family and Church Governors, to the

               <p>1. I prove Communion with us a Duty; (Tho' it be
not every Man's Duty to be Locally present with us, it is
every Man's Duty not to avoid it as an unlawful thing, but to
be willing of it as he hath occasion).</p>
               <p>2. It is a Duty for all Christians to own Communion with
all true Members of the Body of Christ. But Nonconformists
and their Assemblies for Worship, are true Members of the Body
of Christ. <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
               <p>The <hi>major</hi> is most fully proved by Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 24. and
<hi>Paul 1 Cor.</hi> 12. throughout, and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, to the 17. and
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 15. and many other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The <hi>minor</hi> I prove. All those are true Members of the Body
of Christ, who have all the Essentials necessary to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of such Members. But so have the Nonconformists
and their Church Assemblies (as afore described:) <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>major</hi> none but the ignorant of Logick will deny.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>minor,</hi> They that have true Christian Faith, Hope,
and Love, have all that is Essential to personal Members: And
the Churches that have Pastors and People communicating in that
Faith, Hope and Love, in Doctrine, Worship, Sacraments and
tolerable Discipline, are true Churches, parts of the Universal
Church. But such are many Persons and Churches of Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists.
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>major</hi> all sound and knowing Christians grant.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>minor</hi> no proof is necessary but our Profession, till it
be disproved. And let the Accusers of the Brethren, as they
love themselves, take this warning before they undertake to
disprove it: Do it by no Argument that will ten times more
condemn your selves and your Church, than such Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists.</p>
               <p>2. The second Argument is this: It is a Sin of Schism to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
Communion with those that Christ receiveth, so we own not
any of their sin: <hi>Rom. 15. 6. &amp;c.</hi> But Christ receiveth (into his
Communion) the foresaid Nonconformists and their Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Assemblies. Proved as before.</p>
               <p>3. It is a Sin to deny the lawfulness of Communion with
Christians and their Assemblies, for lesser faults than those
Persons and Assemblies had, whose Communion Christ and his
Apostles were for: But so must they that will deny the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Communion with the said Nonconformists and their
Assemblies.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:59333:92"/>
The <hi>major</hi> none will deny that take Christ and his Apostles
for their Teachers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is easily proved: The Church of the Jews had Priests
unlawfully introduced, and corrupt Teachers, and Worship, and
yet Christ disowned not Communion with them in Synagogues,
and Temple and Houses, save only that he Conformed not to
their sinful Traditions and Corruptions. The Church of the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> had men guilty of Schism, and Faction, and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the Apostle, wronging each other, sinful Law Suits,
Scandalous Persons, denying the Resurrection, grosly abusing
the Sacrament and Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Churches of <hi>Galatia,
Ephesus, Smyrna, Thyatira, Sardis,</hi> &amp;c. had such faults as I need
not tell you of. Yet no Man is bid or allowed to disown Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them. You can truly prove no such by those in
question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg. 3. Ad hominem:</hi> It is lawful to communicate with the
Churches of <hi>England,</hi> that have more Faults than the Nonconformists:
<hi>Ergo</hi> it is lawful to communicate with them that
have fewer.</p>
               <p>We challenge any to prove so many and such Faults by us as I
have here before proved by your Church. And if for ours, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from us be a Duty from yours, it proves a Duty much
more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. It is a Schismatical Doctrine which would teach Men
by parity of Reason to renounce communion with all Churches
and Christians on Earth, or near all.</p>
               <p>But such is that which would teach Men to renounce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with all the Nonconformists and their Worshipping
Assemblies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>major</hi> is unquestionable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is proved, In that all or near all the Christians on
Earth have as great Faults as the Nonconformists and their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

O that God would so bless the World, as to make all the
Churches of the <hi>Armenians, Abassians, Syrians, Georgians, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassians,
Greeks, Moscovites, Papists, Lutherans,</hi> and all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but as knowing, sincere, faithful, obedient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as
those in <hi>England</hi> that you revile, cast out and prosecute.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But Communion in Schism is unlawful: But you are accused of
Schism, and so are your Assemblies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59333:93"/>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And the Church of <hi>England</hi> is as loudly accused of Schism
and Heresie by the Papists: and too much by the Greeks, if the
Patriarch <hi>Ieremy</hi> spake their Sence. Art they therefore Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
indeed? None forwarder to accuse than the Ignorant
or Guilty! Judge by what I have said of our Judgment in my
<hi>Search for the Schismatick.</hi> We abhor Schism, and have laboured
to have healed the Wounds of the Church with all our power
these 22 years and more; And who be they that have resisted it,
and hate the only healing Balsam?</p>
               <p>2. It is not true that we must have Communion with no Church
that is guilty of Schism, tho' we must not be guilty of Schism it
self. If the Schism be Apostasy that cuts them off from Christ
and the Church universal, we must not have Christian commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with such, that are no Christians. But if they are only
guilty of Schism from some particular Church, and of Schism <hi>in</hi>
the Universal Church, and not <hi>from it,</hi> wounding and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring,
we must not renounce communion with such, save
only as with any other scandalous Sins, so far as impenitence
proveth ungodliness. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was much guilty of
Schism, and so was that of <hi>Galatia;</hi> and yet none were therefore
to renounce their Communion. Was not <hi>Peter</hi> guilty of some
Schism? <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. I doubt there are few Churches on Earth that
are not herein guilty, either in East, South, West or North.
And must we renounce communion with them all? That is, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
tenfold greater Schism for fear of Schism.</p>
               <p>3. Read impartially my <hi>Search for the Schismatick,</hi> and if the
Prelates thus mentioned be not far more guilty of Schism, than
we are, I despair of ever understanding what Schism is. This would
be the strongest Argument for separation from them: and is so
used by many Separatists.</p>

instituted a certain determinate Discipline in his Church, of
great use to the Church, and to particular Souls: And this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59333:93"/>
1. As a Duty. 2. As a Benefit. And no Man hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

2. Or to deprive us of a Benefit of Christ's giving. But Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What mean you by that Discipline? I thought our Church had
rather too sharp Discipline? I hope you mean not the <hi>Geneva</hi> Discipline,
or the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyteries and Stool of Repentance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I mean nothing but what as to the Matter, the Episcopal
Party write for as the Ordinance of Christ: The true exercise
of the Keys, and the previous Acts. That is, That God hath
made the Church to be as it were the Porch of Heaven, a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
gathered out of the Infidel World, sanctified to God, and
prepared for Glory; and therefore he would have none in his
Church, but such as profess Faith, Love and Holiness, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
a fleshly, sensual, worldly and profane Life: And the
Pastors bear the Keys of Trust and Government to judge of such;
that is, who are to be taken in, and who to be cast out, and who
to be admonished and cured of scandalous Sins: And all the
Members are bound to preserve the Purity of themselves, and
the Society in their places; And therefore if a Brother live scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalously,
contrary to his Profession, his Neighbour that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, is to tell him of his fault, and if he hear not, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
not, to warn and admonish him before witnesses: and if yet
he repent not, to tell the Church; and if yet he repent not, and
hear not the Church, he is to be avoided, as one that is none of
their Communion. But if warning, perswasion, Prayers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
bring him to Repentance, the Church is gladly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his forgiveness by God, and to receive him. This is the
Discipline which Christ hath instituted, and the Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
have Professed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>This calling Men to Repentance personally will but disturb and
distract the Parishes: Men will never endure it: And that's no Duty
that will do harm.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>They are not fit to be Communicants or Members of a
Christian Church that will not endure it. It is the Crime of the
Church-Governours that they receive, yea, drive such into the
Church, as will not endure the Laws of Christ, and Church-Duties,
and then cast by such Duties, because Men will not endure them.</p>
               <p>As if you took Scholars into a School that will not endure Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Correction, or Soldiers into an Army that will not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59333:94"/>
endure Command and Discipline; and then omit it, and leave
them to their wills, because they will not endure it. Or, as if
you would take Servants that will not be commanded, nor endure
Labour, and then let them be masterless and idle, because they
will not endure service. Who allow'd you to take and keep
such in Christ's Church, that will not endure either to live obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently,
or be called to Repentance?</p>
               <p>I confess that to let all Men alone in their sin, is the way to
some kind of Peace in the Parish: But it is not Christ's Peace,
but the Devils, by which he keeps possession of Souls and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
till Christ break his peace, and cast him out; such peace will
end in endless sorrow.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. It is Christ's Law and Institution, and that is the same
reason that we give for our Christianity it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But I have read in <hi>Erastus, Selden, Ludov. Moulin</hi> and <hi>Prin,</hi>
that Christ did but tell his Disciples how they should carry themselves
under the <hi>Jewish</hi> Government, and use their <hi>Sanedrims</hi> or Iudicatures,
and did not institute any new sort of Church-Discipline.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Christ's taking occasion from the <hi>Iewish</hi> Judicatures to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
his Discipline, doth no more prove that he did not obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
institute it, than his calling twelve Apostles according to
the number of the Tribes, and his taking occasion from former
practice, for Baptism, Ministry, Elders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth prove that he
ordained no such things.</p>
               <p>2. What need Christ command his Disciples to use that <hi>Iewish</hi>
Government which was in use before, and they could not avoid?</p>
               <p>3. Christ knew that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Government was presently go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down, and tells his Disciples that they should be judged and
scourged as Malefactors in those Synagogues. And is it like then
that he is calling them to exercise their discipline in those Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues.</p>
               <p>4. If it were so, it will hold <hi>à fortiore,</hi> that if Christ during
the <hi>Iewish Policy</hi> command them to use such a Discipline, much
more in his own Churches.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What are your other Reasons for it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>2. The very Nature of Christ's Church required it, which
is a Society separated from the World under special Laws of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and Love, and for special heavenly Ends: If therefore it
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59333:94"/>
shall be confounded with the World, and not separated to Christ,
it is no Church.</p>
               <p>3. Christ did it for the Honour of himself, and his Kingdom:
If he be no more for Holiness than the Infidel and Heathen
World is, what is he better than they, or how is he a Saviour, or
what is the Church better than Infidels?</p>
               <p>4. It is needful to save Heathens from deceit that would come
into the Church, and to convince them that their impure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is insufficient.</p>
               <p>5. It is needful to save Christians from damning deceit, that they
may not think that a dead, barren, unholy Faith and Name of
Christianity will save them, without a holy, obedient Heart and
Life.</p>
               <p>6. It is needful to keep Christ's Ordinances from falsifying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation:
If a sealed Pardon and Gift of Life shall in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be given, as commonly to Dogs as Children, it is a taking
God's Name in vain, and profane belying Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>7. It is needful to bring Sinners to Repentance, that they may
be Pardoned and Saved.</p>
               <p>8. And it is needful to the comforting absolution of Penitents.</p>
               <p>9. Accordingly God's Church in all Ages hath owned it as their
Law of Christ's institution, to this day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But some learned Men say, This was but because there was at first
no Christian Magistrate: But when there was such the Discipline fell
into their hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The first Christian Magistrates finding the Church in Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of it, confirmed it, and too much accumulated and added
to it; but took it not away.</p>
               <p>Of this see a small Book which I wrote of the Magistrates
Power in Religion, to Dr. <hi>Lud. Moulin,</hi> which may end all this
dispute. Briefly, I ask you,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. Would you have all Infidels and Pagans baptized, and

               <p>Shall any words go for a Profession, or what must that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>It must be a Profession of Christian Faith and Obedience.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Who must try and judge of that Profession, whether it be
Christianity or not: Is it Magistrates or Pastors?</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Magistrates have somewhat else to do: Else they must study and
exercise that work alone; for they will have no time for Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Did not Christ institute an Office for it, and give them this
Power of the Keyes? And if one half that Office cease as soon as
Magistrates were Christians, why not the other half, and so Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates

               <p>It must be no doubt the Ministerial Office, to judge who is fit

against his Will.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You must confess the use of discipline, or else openly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
the Word of God, the very Being of the Church, and the
Judgment of the Universal Church to this day. And do you
think then that to deprive the Church of this is a lawful part of
Conformity?</p>

               <p>1. In our Great Parishes, the People are few of them
known to the Priest or to one another. Of the two Parishes
of my last abode, I do not think but there are Fifty Thousand
unknown to the Minister and to each other. And how can these
admonish the Offenders, or the Minister exercise this discipline
upon unknown Persons?</p>
               <p>2. The People know that it is in vain to begin where there can
be no progress. To what purpose is it to tell the Church, when
it's sure to do more harm than good. 1. The swarm of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
is so great, that they cannot be Prosecuted. 2. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
himself forbeareth it as unpracticable. 3. The accused must
be Prosecuted at rates which Men cannot bear. 4. And before
Bishops, that cannot possibly do this work to one of a Thousand,
any more than one School-master can Try and Correct all the faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Scholars in a Diocess. 5. And Men must be Judges that will
never call Sinners to Repentance with Ministerial Evidence, and
Love, and Patience, but like Secular Courts, bid them Recant
or be Excommunicate. 6. And the Cause must be decided by
Lay-men that profanely usurp the Power of the Keys. And how
is Christ's discipline here possible? Polluted, common Churches
frighten away the Religious conscionable People.</p>

               <p>Do you not before complain of <hi>too much</hi> exercise of Discipline by

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, of Discipline against Christ: It is not enough for
your Churches to be common and unclean without true Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
but when you should drive out the Dogs and Swine, you
turn out the Children: Witness all the fore-mentioned Canons.
As I said, you first force in all the ignorant ungodly multitude
that are unfit; then these are the strength and <hi>major</hi> part: Then
they cannot come under due Discipline; then this grieveth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
People, and they find fault with it. And then they must be
taken for Schismaticks, and condemn'd and ruin'd for finding fault.</p>
               <p>In short, what need there disputing: Is it not notorious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact that this Discipline is not exercised against one Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,
Swearer, Fornicator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of a multitude? and are not
Men then deprived of the use of it? And when it's known that
they cannot have it in most or many Parishes, how are they
bound to live and die without the benefit of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think Men are bound to separate from all Churches that
have not this Discipline? Sure it is not Essential to the Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I do not think that <hi>Preaching,</hi> as distinct from reading, is
essential to a Church; but that it may be at least for a time a
sorry Church without it, as those in <hi>Moscovy</hi> are. But I would
not continue in such a Church that is without it, if I can have a
better. It's one thing what a Man should endure that can have
no better without more hurt than good; and another thing what
Men should chuse in obedience to Christ, and for their own and
the Churches good that can attain it. Do you think it is lawful
to omit all Duty that is not essential to the Church? surely your
many humane Offices, your Forms and Ceremonies, your Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
and Subscriptions to them, are further from being essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
than true Discipline is, and yet you think that the omission of
these is unsufferable: Is mans accidental inventions more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
than Christs Ordinance and Church Government?</p>

               <p>The Presbyterians call their Discipline the Kingdom of Christ,

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I speak for nothing proper to Presbyterians: For no Lay-Elders,
nor Synods that by Vote govern all the Churches of the
Land, but only for that substance of Parish Discipline which all
acknowledge, not resisting Appeals from abusive Ministers to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

               <p>V. I will add next this aggravation which comprehendeth
many parts of Conformity.</p>
               <p>No true Christian doubteth, but seriousness and diligence in
serving God, and making our Calling and Election sure, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to Gods Law, and fear of sinning, are of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to Salvation. And how greatly the Laity is discouraged
and frightned from all this by the course of Conformity is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Who doth discourage them? Do not all our Ministers Preach for
Obedience and Godliness? Doth not our Liturgy pray that the rest of
our lives hereafter may be pure and holy, that we may attain Eternal
Life?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and more than so, you read the Scripture which is all
for holiness: The deeper is the guilt of Hypocrisie and Malignity
in them that seek to root it out: Out of their own mouths will
they be judged, and beaten with many stripes. Judge by these
instances.</p>
               <p>1. How Children are Baptized with God-fathers, and how Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
after, and Admitted to Communion, and forced to it, I
shewed before.</p>
               <p>2. So many humane Institutions are imposed on Men as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Communion, that he must be a Man of more Learning and
Understanding than I have, or with all the study of my Life could
obtain, who can discern them all to be Lawful: And he that
calls any of them sinful is Excommunicate <hi>ipso jure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It is certain that a great part of the Laity understand not
the Creed, and those few that set themselves to seek for saving
knowledge, attain so little in their secular course of Life, as that
we must be glad if they understand all the Catechism, the Creed,
Lords Prayer and Ten Commandments, and take such for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
wife: And yet if one of these think a Form, a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
a Lay Chancellors Discipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be repugnant to the
Word of God, and say it, he is Excommunicate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:59333:96"/>
4. By this it is absolutely necessary that the generality of men,
even all <hi>England</hi> that know not more than I do, must blindly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
as the Canon and Priest bids them, barely on their Word,
or else they must falsly pretend to believe them, or be all liable
to Excommunication. And so an implicite Faith in the Canon-Makers
and Bishops is become the necessary Religion of the Land.
And then if the Bishops turn we must all turn with them.</p>
               <p>5. By this means wilful ignorance is made necessary. For it is a
dangerous thing (as I have found it) to study for knowledge in
Gods Word, lest it should lead us to differ from something in the
Canons, Liturgy or Bishops, and then we are liable to ruin. And
so they that will be Church Members must take heed of studying
Gods Word, or searching after Truth.</p>
               <p>5. If for thinking and saying any of the Impositions are amiss,
they be once Excommunicated, or but noted as Dissenters, they
are rendered odious to the Church-Courts and Priests, and by
them to the credulous Obsequious Herd; and it's likely that in
the Pulpit they will be proclaimed Hypocrites, Schismaticks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
Spirits, Phanaticks, and in as much danger of Damnation as
Murderers or Adulterers, who are as safe as they.</p>
               <p>6. By this means fear of sinning, and the danger of dissenting
being so usually conjunct, the avoiding of sin is made Puritanism,
and a suspicious sign, if not a common scorn.</p>
               <p>7. By this means ignorant Youth is quite discouraged from seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
piety and fear of sin, lest they fall under common scorn; and
it's well if they follow not the multitude and be scorners of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to God themselves. And the very plea of Conscience
(which is but obeying God) is made a disgrace or mockery, and a
<hi>tender Conscience,</hi> made equivalent with a self-conceited Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick.</p>
               <p>8. It is no danger to meet by hundreds at a Play-house; or by
great numbers at Taverns, Ale-houses, Coffee-houses, Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>races,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if a few Neighbours meet to Pray or Excite each
other in the Love of God and Heaven, you know what the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is.</p>
               <p>9. If any Minister will but leave Preaching the Gospel of
Christ, and turn Physician, he may be quiet; tho' hebe of the
same judgment that he was before; the forbearing of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
may preserve his peace. There are now in this City ejected
Ministers who have forsaken their Function, and are Doctors of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59333:97"/>
Physick, and they live in great wealth and acceptance: There are
Physicians and Ministers of the same judgment, and perhaps dwell
together in the same House (it was the case of Dr. <hi>Micklethwait</hi>
and me.) The Physician is honoured, and the Minister call'd and
used as a Rogue, though they were of the same mind. There are
some Nonconforming Ministers, that tho' they are Doctors of
Physick, yet dare not cease their Ministry, but practice both:
These are welcomed to the Sick, but the Healthful banish them
or hunt them away, notwithstanding their acceptance as Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
the hatred of their Preaching being more prevalent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Sure they Preach some dangerous Doctrine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Not a word of such is charged on them, tho' malicious
Persons come to hear them, and inform against them. Their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
tell the World their Doctrine. Dr. <hi>Clifford</hi> was one of them
who hath written of the Covenants: Dr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> is one of them
who hath written of Temptations, driven from <hi>Newcastle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some ejected Ministers Educate their Sons to Physick, and
tho' they be of their Fathers mind, the Sons are highly esteemed
and honoured, and the Aged Fathers laid in Jayl: This last Week
old Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> that is about 80 or 79 years of Age, and almost
Blind, and hath lived there 36 years and more, (known by some
writings) a Man of a calm, quiet, sober, peaceable Temper,
was sent to the common Jayl at <hi>Coventry</hi> for dwelling there, and
sometimes exhorting his old Hearers to fear God; and he hath
here a Son, and a Son-in-Law, Doctors of Physick, deservedly
honoured, who if they did but Preach the Gospel might speed as
ill as he.</p>
               <p>10. If an ejected Minister would but teach the Children of the
Laity, tho' it were but to read, and tho' there be no other
School-master near, the people must rather have their Children
untaught, and must not be suffered to have so needful a
help.</p>
               <p>11. If a Minister would give over Preaching, yet if his old
Hearers desire his Neighbour-hood, that they may have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of his Conference, they must not enjoy it, lest he whisper
Nonconformity to them, but he must be Banished five Miles
not only from Corporations, but from every place where-ever he
Preached these twenty years. I know some such who have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
much abroad, who can hardly find a place in that part of
<hi>England</hi> that is not within five Miles of a Corporation or some
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59333:97"/>
place where they have Preached: And those few places have
seldom any untenanted Houses: And if rarely such a House
be found, it's like enough that the Landlord will have no such
Tenant: Or if he would, it's ten to one the Minister is not able
to take it and pay his Rent; besides his undoing in removal, and
putting off his former House and Goods.</p>
               <p>12. If any one that feareth sinning by Conformity, be never
so falsly accused, he usually accounteth it his Wisdom to suffer
patiently whatever Men will say or do, without Self-defence:
I saw two Warrants against a Lay-man this Week, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
his Hearing two Ministers as Sworn by two poor Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
Women; when I can witness that both their Oaths were
false, and that neither of those Ministers Preach't at the time
and place that they Swore they Preached: For my House
being at the next Door, I heard that it was not they that then
Preached. But I suppose its all one: They dare not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
it.</p>
               <p>I heard of one that said he woulp Swear Treason against
a Nonconformist: and being ask'd, What he said, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever he heard him speak? He said, No; but he heard
him whistle Treason: And being ask'd, How whistling could
be Treason? He said, That he whistled the same Tune that a
Ballad was Sung in, that they said had Treasonable words
in it.</p>
               <p>13. In the mean time, let but Men be utterly void of
Conscience and Fear of Sinning, and what can hinder them
from Saying, Covenanting, Swearing, Doing, any thing that
is required of them in order to a Benefice, or to the Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of an obedient Son of the Church. And then he can
Preach down Nonconformists as intolerable Rogues.</p>
               <p>And thus the Laity that will fear Sin, and search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and have a Faith of their own, must go through all these
Discouragements, if they be not so unhappily happy, as to attain
to assurance or belief that all the Impositions in Conformity
are lawful.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Whom will they constrain? 1. Not the Minister: He
is not to Baptize it unless it be brought and desired. 2. Not
the Godfathers: For none can compel any to be a Godfather,
nor ever do. 3. But it is the Parent that is compelled? How?
Those that hold it lawful will do it without Compulsion, the
Baptizing of their Child being desirable to them. But those
that think it a Sin, will rather be Excommunicate and lie in
Jail; and so they cannot compel them. And the <hi>Anabaptists</hi>
Children are mostly unbaptized for all their Compulsion. But
the usual way of Nonconformists is to elude the Canon, and to
agree privately with the Godfathers to be but Witnesses or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds,
and that the Parent himself will be there present, and
when the Questions are put to the Godfathers, will shew his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
by bowing, tho' he may not speak.</p>
               <p>But such shifts to avoid the Evil of Conformity, is no Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of Conformity or the Canon, nor of any that will
deny Baptism for an unnecessary if not an ungodly device of Man;
and that when themselves seem to make Baptism necessary to
Salvation; and do clearly make it a means that ascertaineth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

to such as think their crossing sinful: And yet he would
have no Man commit any Sin, to gain Baptism: but will save
the unbaptized that desired it, so they might have had it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
and will himself shew Mercy to such as consent not
to a polluted Sacrifice. And would have us prefer a lawful
way when we can have it. Baptism is our Renunciation of
Sin.</p>

the imposers; they should deny Communion with Christ
and his Church as much as in them lieth to faithful Christians;
and should turn the Sacrament of Love for no just cause, into
an occasion of hatred and persecution; and the Sacrament of
Unity, into an Engine of division, by their own needless imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to perplex mens Consciences, and set people one against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
O what a snare and instrument of wrath and discord,
and inhumane usage of other men, do many turn that blessed
Sacrament into, which is instituted for the Communion of Saints
in unfeigned Love. The more such magnify the Sacrament as
the very Flesh and Blood of Christ, the more do they condemn
themselves.</p>

               <p>IX DO you think it is a sin deserving exclusion from Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Communion, for a man to think it unlawful for him
to own and encourage the Ministry of an ignorant, insufficient, or
grosly scandalous, or hurtful Teacher. A poor Christian that is
unwilling to be damned, and readeth that he should love his
Neighbour as himself; perhaps, heareth the Priest tell the
People what hypocrites and odious persons <hi>Non-conformists</hi> are,
and exhorts them to avoid such, and to prosecute them, and root
them out as the intolerable enemies of Church and State, and as
unfit to be Members of any Society: He is acquainted with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Non-conformists,</hi> their Lives, and their Books and Doctrines,
and finds the clean contrary. He reads in Scripture, <hi>[See that
ye love one another with a pure heart fervently,]</hi> He heareth from
the Pulpit, <hi>[See that ye hate one another, and seek the destruction of
one another,]</hi> Christ saith, <hi>[Love your enemies]</hi> the Priest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
them <hi>[to root out their friends]</hi> Christ saith <hi>[He that
receiveth you, receiveth me: and shake off the dust of your Feet against
them that receive you not: It shall be easier for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah
<hi>than for such]</hi> the Priest saith <hi>[He that receiveth such Ministers,
sinneth against Christ, and he that hath any communion with them is a
Schismatick,]</hi> The man readeth, <hi>[Beware of false Prophets; and
thinks it a sin to encourage the teachers of lies and wickedness]</hi> and he
readeth <hi>[He that hateth his Brother is a Murderer, and hath not
eternal Life: and if I have not charity, I am but as sounding Brass,
&amp;c.]</hi> He thinks him a false teacher, that contradicteth Christ;
and that seeks to damn the hearers. And he thinks that no
tongue can more contradict Christ, than that which Preacheth
down Love, and Preacheth for hating godly Men, tho' on slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
pretences, and that no man can do more to damn the
People, than he that draweth them from love, to such hatred.</p>
               <p>Another liveth in a Parish where a dry ignorant fellow affords
him no such help as he is conscious his soul needeth, and where
the Common-Prayer is so much better, than the Sermon, that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59333:100"/>
were it not for that, he might better stay at home. And where
the Priests Conversation encourageth the Drunkards and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
and vilifieth godly Men.</p>
               <p>This man is for the Church-way, but for a better Minister:
The question is, whether for this he be so great a sinner that all
neighbouring Ministers must drive him away, and deny him
Communion.</p>
               <p>Another honest Christian taketh it for a sin to kneel at the
Railes, or to join with the Organs, or to receive or desire the
Diocesan manner of Confirmation, or to forbear Communion
with all Christians whom the Church-men here condemn or cast
out. The question is, whether it be no wrong to any of these
to be denied Communion at a neighbour Parish, where his
doubts are removed?</p>
               <p>I prove that he hath right to such neighbour Communion.</p>
               <p>1. Because he is a Member of Christs Body, the Catholick
Church, and therefore hath right to the Communion of Saints.
And to believe that in the Creed, and condemn it in Practice,
is to believe to condemnation.</p>
               <p>2. They themselves teach that a true Christian hath right
to Communion with all Churches, where he hath just occasion
to seek it.</p>
               <p>3. They say that there is no Church without a Bishop, and
that the Diocesan-Church is the least true political Church:
And if so, he separateth not from any Church that separateth
not from the Diocesan.</p>
               <p>4. These foresaid persons do nothing to forfeit the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of neighbour Churches; therefore it is a sin and wrong to
deny it them. If it were proved an errour to avoid that as a
sin which they avoid, all mankind hath errours; and to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fearful
of Fire, or Water, or Plague, or Poyson, is a tolerable
safe weakness, and not like the sins that swarm in multitudes of
tolerated Parishioners.</p>

               <p>That which is not so immoral, as Fornication, Drunkenness,

greater severity from Governours.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The Church-Keys are to be used with due relation to
Heaven, and those are to be taken in, or cast out, that Christ will
take in, or cast out from Heaven: And if you think he will
damn an obedient godly Christian for fearing to partake of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59333:101"/>
sin of wicked Priests, or for fearing to be poysoned with love-killing
Doctrine, or for fearing the vain Worship of mens tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
rather than a prophane derider of Conscience, and a filthy
Fornicator, Drunkard or Blasphemer; I shall not think it worth
my labour to dispute with you.</p>
               <p>But men that take the Churches welfare to lie in the wealth

               <p>2. How far it extendeth as to the persons obliged, I before
told you, and you may read; 1. In the <hi>Corporation Act,</hi> which
imposeth it on all Corporations. 2. In the <hi>Vestry Act,</hi> which
imposeth it on all Church-Vestries. 3. In the <hi>Act of Vniformity,</hi>

and more. 5. In the <hi>Militia Act,</hi> which imposeth it on all
the Military Commanders, and Souldiers in the Land; so that
you may well say, that is a National Covenant or Oath.</p>
               <p>3. What is amiss in the Church-Government that needeth
an amending alteration, I have so often told you, that I will not
repeat it. Judge then what this Oath importeth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>It could never be the meaning of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that no man
shall endeavour to amend the faults of any Officers, Courts or Actions;
for they often amend their own Acts of Parliament; and they reserve
a Power in <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> to make alterations even in Church
Governments: But that belongs not to the People, nor should they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. I hope you will not confound <hi>Stated Offices,</hi> and <hi>Mens
Exercise of them in Practice.</hi> I grant that they do not bind us
by Oath never to endeavour that Bishops, and all the Officers of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59333:101"/>
their Courts may be honest men, and slander, and injure no
man against Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is the Offices, as here stated, that
are made thus far unalterable, named in the Canon <hi>[Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Bishops, Deans, Arch-Deacons,</hi> and <hi>the rest that bear Office
therein.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I grant, that the Law is made to bind none but Subjects;
and that an altering power is reserved to King and Parliament:
But it doth not follow, that all the Subjects be not bound by it:
Though <hi>They</hi> may change Laws, yet <hi>We</hi> may not: And as you
say, They suppose that it belongeth not to the People to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
it: Which We grant, as to any Rebellious, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or otherwise unlawful Endeavour: But whether God
bind not all men in their own Place and Calling, by Prayer,
Conference, Elections of Officers, Petition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to endeavour
to amend all Crying, Dangerous, Common Sins, is a farther
Question.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>They cannot mean to exclude Petitioning, for that is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Right, and is by them allowed with Restraints.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. It is meant in opposition to the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenant, which
tyed men to oppose Popery, Prelacy, and Schisme, only in
their several <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Callings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is expres'd in the most universal terms, without the least
Exception, by men that knew how to speak.</p>
               <p>3. Reasons were given in Parliament against any Limitation,
and those Reasons carryed it.</p>
               <p>4. They were Men that were wholly for the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
whose Canon had before Excommunicated themselves,
and all men, that accused any Office in the Church Government
as sinful. And they knew, that should any of them, when the
Parliament is risen (yea, or there) so say, he is an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
Man.</p>
               <p>5. It is most certain that they intended to bind all Subjects on
whom these Oaths are imposed, even from petitioning, or any
other Endeavour of Alteration; though they allow petitioning
in other Cases; for they intended to fix and secure the Church-Government
against all Alterations.</p>
               <p>6. Therefore (as I said before) they joined it with, yea,
and set it before <hi>State-Government</hi> in all their Oaths and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants;
And do you think in Conscience, they left men at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to petition against Monarchy, or against the Life, or Power,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59333:102"/>
or Honour of the King: Far be it from us to think so ill of
them.</p>
               <p>I must profess to you that I do not think half so ill of well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
Monasteries of Men or Women, as I do of our large Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesses,
or our Lay-Excommunicators, according to the Canons.
And yet even in the Times of Popery, the Nation was not
Sworn never to endeavour any alteration of Monasteries.</p>
               <p>If you would have all Corporations, Soldiers, Vestries, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
sworn never to endeavour to cure the Sick, to relieve the
Poor, to seek more Wealth, to reform all Play-houses, Ale-houses
and Taverns, to Catechize their Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would
not join with you.</p>
               <p>National Oaths and Covenants are Matters of great moment:
We have deeply suffered by rashness in such already: And
should any of them prove false and wicked, and the Nation be
stigmatized with Perjury, you might more sadly write, <hi>Lord
have Mercy on us,</hi> on the Land, than on the Doors where the
most dreadful Plague prevaileth.</p>

               <p>All Politicks agree that the Difference between near Subjects

take from them, but by their Consent, at least in their Wives,
Children, and Lives; and that Slaves have none such, nor may
resist a Commission to take them away, though causlesly, and
Laws are there but the Will of the Lord, who may cross them
at his pleasure; and that a Ruler of Subjects, and an <hi>Owner</hi> of

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>This Declaration is to be expounded by the many following
Acts, which only say, there is no obligation to Change the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>That's <hi>gratis dictum</hi> without proof; that several Acts

to be presumed. One of them is an Universal Negative with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least exception, and the other a <hi>particular Negative</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
2. And the Acts were made at several times, to several
men, and the Parliament in the latter, never pretended to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
or explain the former, which sure they would have done
if they repented of the Terms. 3. And Parliament Men tell us.
That it was mentioned that the Non-Obligation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
should be limited, and it was pleaded against it, That if
men believe that they are bound by it to any thing, some will
think that they are bound to all that is lawful, and that it's law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to take Arms against the King, and so there is no securing
them from Rebellion, as by that Covenant, but by renouncing
all its Obligation: And this carried the Cause. 4. It is not
lawful for Subjects to put a particular Sence on Universal
Words imposed, unless the imposers first so expound the Terms;
which they have refused to do after twenty years complaint of
the Dissenters, and do justifie the universal sence to this day.
Therefore such forced Expositions of our Rulers words in
so tremendous a matter, are not to be feigned without good

Evil <hi>simpliciter</hi> but <hi>scundum quid.</hi> Do you think all is Evil
that is there Vowed?</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>If it be Evil, no one is bound to keep it.</p>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>No, not in the Evil part: But do you think that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of some Ill things in a Vow or Covenant, doth disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
a man from all that's good in it? If so, mark what will
follow.</p>
               <p>1. Man is so ignorant, and imperfect, and faulty, that he
doth nothing that's good without a mixture of some evil, how
can sinless perfection come from sinful Imperfection? And
so we should be bound by no Vow, or Oath, or Contract at
all.</p>
               <p>2. If Knaves once learn this Lesson, they will be sure to foist
in some ill clause into their Vows to GOD, and their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
with Man; that so they may be bound by none.</p>
               <p>3. The Oath of Allegiance or Fedelity to the King, and the
King's own Oath at his Coronation, in the time of Popery, had
ill clauses in it for the Papal interest; doth it follow that neither
of them did bind?</p>
               <p>4. If an <hi>Irish</hi> Tory should, on the high-way, meet an <hi>English</hi>
Lord, and take his Purse, pretend that he is against the King,
and should force him at once to take an Oath to be true to the
King, and to give him his Estate, and conceal his theft: The
latter is evil, and yet even that Oath bindeth to be true to
the King.</p>
               <p>5. If the Clergy in their Ordination, in time of Popery, had
divers sinful clauses and promises, doth it follow that their
Ordination was null, and obliged them to no Ministerial
Duty?</p>
               <p>6. If the Clergy in former ages, or in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> be
sworn to the King and the Pope, doth it follow that this binds
them not to the King, because it binds them not to the
Pope?</p>
               <p>7. If men were Married in time of Popery, with unlawful
Words and Clauses, or lately in <hi>England</hi> by Justices in new
terms, was such marriage null?</p>
               <p>8. If a Papist make to you a Testament, or Deed of Sale of his
Estate, and put in some unlawful clauses appealing to Angels,
or wishing you to pray for the Souls in <hi>Purgatory;</hi> I do not think
you would take that <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Deed</hi> for a nullity.</p>
               <p>9. If in Popery or here, some Clauses at Baptism prove bad,
it doth not nullifie the Baptismal Vow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:59333:104"/>
10. If the King's Souldiers at once swear to fight for the King,
and to destroy or plunder some innocent men; or the Papist
Souldier should swear to be true to the King, and to pull down
the Protestant Ministry and Bishops; the former Part binds
them, though the latter doth not.</p>

               <p>An Oath unlawfully imposed binds no man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>That's only the Doctrine of Perjury, contrary to all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Christian Casuists. An unlawful imposition that is made by
an Usurper without true power, binds no man to take the Oath
imposed; but if he take it without being bound to take it, the
Oath binds him to the lawful part of the matter.</p>
               <p>1. If a High-way Robber make me swear to be true to the
King, that Oath binds, though he had no Authority to impose
it on me.</p>
               <p>2. If an Usurping Minister Baptize a man, and make him
Vow himself to Christ, his Vow binds him, though the Usurper
had no authority.</p>
               <p>3. If a man make many voluntary Vows, which no man
bound him to make, he is bound to keep them if the matter be
lawful. And the want of authority in the imposer doth but
leave you as a volunteer, unobliged to take it.</p>
               <p>4. And I would not have a Popish Clergy tempted to say, The
King and Parliament had no authority to impose the Oaths of
Allegiance and Supremacy on us without the Pope; therefore
we be not bound to keep them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But the Covenant was forced, and no man is bound by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
or Oath which he was forced to make.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>That's a Doctrine of gross Perjury: It's true, that no
man that without authority forceth another to promise any thing
to him, can lay any just clame to that which he forced a man
to promise: For no mans own Crime can give him right to a
Commodity; <hi>Nemini debetur Commodum ex propria culpâ,</hi> and
the promiser is not bound to give it him, because he hath no
right to receive it; but if you be injuriously forced to promise
or vow your Duty to GOD, or the King, or your Neighbour,
that vow and promise doth bind you to perform it.</p>
               <p>1. If it be done without right by Prince or Prelates that force
men to be Baptized, yet that forced Vow doth bind them.</p>
               <p>2. If Bishops unjustly force unfit men to the LORD's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
their Vow there made obligeth them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:59333:104"/>
3. As I said, if a High-way Robber force you to swear to be
true to the King, or to restore ill gotten goods, or to recant a
slander, that Oath doth bind you.</p>
               <p>4. If the King should unjustly force you to Marry a Woman,
the Covenant binds you.</p>
               <p>The Reason is, because man hath free will, and doth all
that he doth by that choice, which is true freedom. It's no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
force of his will that moveth him, though we call it force
from anothers act, who doth his best to force him; a man may
refuse though he die for it. He that casteth his goods into
the Sea to save the Ship, is urged to it, but may choose. He
that giveth a Thief his purse to save his life, might have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.
Do not the Martyrs freely lay down their lives? and if
any deny Christ or his Cause to save his life, and say I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that will not save his Soul.</p>
               <p>5. And your Doctrine will set up all unfaithfulness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.
All men that under Penalties are commanded to swear
Allegiance, or to take this Corporation-Oath, or the Militia-Oath,
or the Oath to the Bishops, are hereby taught to say, <hi>We were
forced to it by the King and Prelates, and did it all against our wills,
and therefore are not bound by it.</hi> Such principles loose the bonds
of all Societies, Loyalty and humane Converse; and married
men will put away their Wives when they are weary of them,
and say, I was forced against my will by my Parents, or by
Poverty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But this Covenant was unlawfully taken, as well as unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imposed, and therefore bindeth not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>This also is Pernicious Doctrine against all sober Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists.
If the matter be good, the causeless and unlawful act
of taking it, doth not nullifie the obligation to perform it. He
that voweth an indifferent act, should not have done it; for
a vow must not be causeless; but he must keep it when it is
made.</p>
               <p>He that sinned in marriage when he ought not, yet must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his marriage Covenant.</p>
               <p>He that in meer hypocrisie maketh the Baptismal vow, did
sin and yet is bound to keep it.</p>
               <p>The truth is, wicked men have so much of ill principles, and
ill ends, that they do all sinfully that they do oft as to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and ever as to the manner: But they are not disobliged
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59333:105"/>
from all their Contracts and Vows, because they sinfully made
them. Else they will purposely do all sinfully, that they may,
not be obliged.</p>
               <p>So that, 1. If the Act of Imposition. 2. The Act of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
3. And part of the matter Sworn, be all unlawful; yet a
man is obliged to that part of the matter that is lawful. But
part of the Vow in question was good.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. The renouncing of Popery. 2. And of Schism. 3. And
of Prophaneness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. The Obligation to defend the King. 5. The
Profession to Repent of sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>But all this we are bound to otherwise before.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Then you confess that it is good; and then the Vow in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
binds us to it. I hope you are not so ignorant as to think that
2 Vow binds not a man to do that which he is bound to before.
I told you before, tho' a man be bound by his Vow in Baptism to
Christ, his renewing it at every Sacrament layeth more and
more Obligation on him. If a man have taken the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
every time he taketh it, he is again bound to the same
thing. One may have a thousand Obligations to one and the
same Duty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But one thing is unanswerable: No man is bound by a Vow
that had not a self-obliging power: But the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> had no self-obliging power to take that Covenant, because
the King was against it. The 30. of <hi>Levit</hi> proveth this at large.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed if the Act of Vowing were not only sinful
but a meer nullity, that Vow being no Vow, could not bind:
But that <hi>Levit.</hi> 30. doth no whit prove this, I have fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
in my <hi>Christian Directory</hi> in the <hi>chap.</hi> of Vows, to which
I referr you <hi>part. 3. cap.</hi> 5. Where the whole case of Vows is so
largely opened, that I will here only say this little.</p>
               <p>The text of <hi>Levit.</hi> 30. doth expresly speak only of Women,
that are in a Parents or Husbands house, and only of Vows made
freely to God of doing or offering something to him: Yea it
seemeth limitted to them, of which many reasons may be given.
And many reasons I have there mentioned <hi>pag.</hi> 33. why it doth
not extend to Princes and Magistrates for releasing their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from their Vows, tho' some pretend a parity of reason.
But these things are certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:59333:105"/>
1. That even the Parents make not the Vow null at its first
making, but only relax it after, and stop the Confirmation of
it, <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That this Power is about vows to God, as good or hurtful
to the inferiours; and that some Vows are so certainly necessary
to the inferiours good, that the Father or Husband (whose
Power is only for their good, and not their hurt) cannot
dispense with it. As Dr.</hi> Sanderson, <hi>saith</hi> Praelect. 4. §. 5.
p. 104, 105. <hi>it belongeth only to that matter in which one is
under another Government, which hath §. 6. a double limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
One in the person of the Swearer, <hi>viz.</hi> There is scarce any one
that hath the use of reason, that is so fully under anothers Power,
but that in some things he is <hi>fui Juris.</hi> And there every man may do
as pleases himself, without consulting his Superiour, so at that by his
own Act; without his Superiours Licence, he may bind himself. 2. As
to the consent of a Superior—<hi>a tacit consent antecedent</hi> or
<hi>consequent suffices</hi>—Quasi diceret, si dissensum suum vel uno
die dissimulet votum in perpetuum stabilivit.</p>
               <p>And it is certain that to <hi>oppose Prophaneness, Schism,</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi>
and to <hi>Repent of Sin,</hi> are things so necessary, and so much for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
persons good, that no Parent or Husband can either forbid or
nullify such a Vow: No man can hinder any from Vowing in
Baptism to be a Christian, and to forbear Murder, Adultery,
Theft, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor can disoblige them after.</p>
               <p>It is certain that if a superiour dissent, and after consent, or
he die, and the next superior <hi>(e.g.</hi> a Husband) do consent,
when a Woman makes the same Vow, it remaineth obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
               <p>And it is certain that if a Parent or Husband make the same
Vow himself, he cannot disoblige himself. And if once he
consent, he can never after nullify it.</p>
               <p>And as to our case <hi>de Facto</hi> it is agreed, 1. That Parliament-Men
took and imposed this Oath, when they were neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
nor acknowledged the Kings Power to dissolve it.</p>
               <p>2. That thousands in the Nation knew not of the Kings pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
Profession against it.</p>
               <p>3. That thousands, yea the far greatest number in <hi>England,</hi>
took it after the death of the King.</p>
               <p>4. That they thought the present King took it himself, and
owned it by a Declarantion; In which, tho' for my part I doubt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59333:106"/>
not but the <hi>Scots</hi> sinfully abused Him and the Kingdom; yet that
alters not the case of the Subjects obligation by that Vow.</p>
               <p>5. That multitudes of Lords, Knights, and others took it that
had adhered to the King in his Wars: All which undoubtedly
puts it out of the case of dissolution in <hi>Levit.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>Besides, the common <hi>Protestant</hi> Doctrine is, that neither
Popes, Princes or Prelates, can dispense with Vows made in <hi>re ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria.</hi>
Could Kings disoblige all their Subjects from their
Oaths and Vows, it would make a great change in the Religion,
Morality, and Commerce of the World: So that hitherto we
have no satisfaction.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But this was a League and Covenant between man and man,

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I have nothing to do with it as a League of Men, to do
any action towards each other; but only as a Vow to God, and
Covenant of Duty to God: And tho' the name of a Vow be
not in it, I think him not worth the disputing with that on deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
denieth it to be a Vow to God. Whom think you else
do men make these promises to, of Repentance and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and opposing Prophaneness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The words signifie as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn

or justifying themselves, and all others in three Kingdoms whom they
never saw, in the violating of a Vow against Heresy, Schism, Popery,

not with other Men. And you know a man that saith, <hi>This Vow
binds not,</hi> may yet hold that something else binds us against the

this topick of the non-obligation of the Vow, I know not how

               <p>I argue <hi>ab essentia particularis ad communem essentiam.</hi>
If this Vow have all that is essential to a Vow and yet binds not,
then no Vow as such essentially doth bind. If the <hi>anima hujus
bovis vel ovis,</hi> be not <hi>anima rationalis,</hi> and yet have all that is
essential to the <hi>anima brutorum,</hi> then it is not essential to any <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
bruti</hi> to be rational: And it cannot be accidentally so here.
If the Vow against Schism and Prophaneness have all essential to
a Vow and yet bind not, then no Vow bindeth <hi>qua talis</hi> as a
Vow. And if Vows bind only by accident, or by something else
that's an adjunct, that's nothing for their own essential obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>And so much of the <hi>Corporation-Declaration.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. LVI. Of many agreed Tremendous Circumstances
and Principles which affright many from Conformity.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>THere are also many general and collateral and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial
considerations that make men fear the
guilt of Conformity the more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What are those? I believe you will find as many of that sort
of reasons on the other side to move you to Conform, if you consider
them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you what I mean, and then I will hear all that
you have to say for it.</p>
               <p>I. We are all agreed that no sin must be done for any commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
or on any pretence of good.</p>
               <p>II. We are agreed that to pretend Gods Service, or Name for
our sin is a heinous aggravation: To say, I must do evil to
please God, to Preach and to win souls, is Prophaneness and
Hypocrisy.</p>
               <p>III. We are agreed that it is worse in a Minister of Christ
than in others; because he is bound to be an example to the
flock, who are apt to imitate him.</p>
               <p>IV. It is granted that God is jealous about his worship, and
that the profaning of Holy things, and sinning openly in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Assemblies is, <hi>caecris paribus,</hi> worse than meer miscarriages in
our Conversation.</p>
               <p>V. Lying is by most acknowledged a great sin, as overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
humane credit and converse: But especially in a Preacher,
because it will tempt men never to believe him: And to say
that we assent and consent, and that <hi>ex animo</hi> when we do not,
is heinous lying.</p>
               <p>VI. It is granted that man hath not a despotical power of his
own understanding, to believe what he will: And that if
any of his errours be vicious, vice and errour must have better
cure than meer commands: And if men could know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what they will, they should will to believe nothing but
what hath credible evidence, without a carnal biass.</p>
               <p>VII. It is agreed that all men have errour, and therefore that
erring men or no men must be tolerated in our Communion;
and he that thinks otherwise condemneth himself, and teacheth
all men to condemn him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:59333:107"/>
VIII. It is granted that it is a very low degree of knowledge
that the universality of vulgar Christians do attain, who hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learn the common Catechism, much less can it be expected
that they should all be able to understand all indifferent things to
be indifferent, and to be judges of the <hi>minutissima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. If any errours be tolerable, it's like to be the errours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
things indifferent and small.</p>
               <p>X. St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath expresly determined the Controversy about
loving and receiving such, <hi>Rom. 14. &amp;</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>XI. To encourage by compliance a generation and design of
men that overthrow Christ's and his Apostles rule of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by invented impositions of their own, would make
Church-Concord impossible, and would propagate this way of
certain Schism, and stablish it in the World, is to confederate
for tearing the Church of Christ, and making Schism common
and uncureable.</p>
               <p>XII. It is granted that he that after his greatest study is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that unnecessary Oaths, Subscriptions, Covenants, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
are sinful; is condemned if he go against his Conscience,
tho' he should mistake.</p>
               <p>XIII. Those therefore that make such snares for Souls, and
then tell us <hi>[If you go against your Consciences you are damned for
that, and if you do not you are damned as Schismaticks, for disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us]</hi> are far unlike the Ministers of Christ, or Men that help
to save our Souls.</p>
               <p>XIV. We Non-Conformists offer cur solemn Oaths that we
have by Prayer and earnest search and study, laboured to know
the truth herein: And as our worldly interest would perswade
us to conform, so we would readily do it, did we not believe
that it is sin against God: Yea we take it (as to us) to be no
small but heinous sin, by the aggravations which I am mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>XV. Seeing then the way of our Condemners is either to cast all
Christians out of the Church, that have not a greater degree of
Knowledge herein, than I have, and all men of my Rank, or
else to bring all men implicitly to believe all to be lawful that is
commanded them, we cannot consent to either of these two
Measures for the Church.</p>
               <p>XVI. It is agreed that Perjury is so heinous a Sin, as that
few are greater: It so taketh God's Name in vain, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59333:108"/>
his Justice in a special Revenge. It depriveth Kings of
due Security for their Lives and Crowns, by the Oath of
Fidelity. It destroyeth all Trust, and consequently all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
among Men; as well as all Hope of publick Justice: It
exposeth the Estates and Lives of all men to the will of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
men; so that he that dare be perjur'd, may be supposed
liable to any other Wickedness how great soever. Therefore
if we Ministers should be perjured; we should make our selves
utterly unmeet for our Office.</p>
               <p>XVII. It is agreed that to sin <hi>deliberately by a Covenant under
our Hands,</hi> is one of the most heinous sorts of sinning; and if
it be done knowingly, sheweth the person to be a wilful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of sin. To sin by the <hi>sudden surprize</hi> of a <hi>Passion</hi> is too
bad; but to <hi>study it, resolve it,</hi> and <hi>covenant it,</hi> is most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
To engage a Mans self by <hi>Covenant</hi> to be once a Month
drunk, or steal, or commit Fornication, is far worse than the
bare Act.</p>
               <p>XVIII. It is granted that <hi>Repentance</hi> is the condition of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,
and for a man to swear or covenant that <hi>he will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
or <hi>endeavour to amend,</hi> or alter any thing that is amiss, is
to renounce Forgiveness.</p>
               <p>XIX. It is granted that <hi>publick, common, national Sins,</hi> are far
worse than <hi>private</hi> and <hi>personal,</hi> in few; and if <hi>heinous,</hi> they are
Prognosticks of the sorest Judgments; and to promote them, is
to be the Enemy of the Land.</p>
               <p>XX. It is granted that if that prove <hi>Perjury,</hi> which some
Dissenters fear is such, and the Kingdom should be stigmatized
by it, there could scarce be any greater Shame and Danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
the Land, to make it odious to <hi>GOD</hi> and Men, and Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as such to all Generations. As I said, The <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>
to <hi>endeavour</hi> no <hi>Alteration</hi> in <hi>Church Government,</hi> is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on all <hi>Corporations,</hi> all <hi>Souldiers</hi> in the <hi>Militia,</hi> all <hi>Vesteries,</hi>
all <hi>Non-conformist Ministers</hi> that will take it, and all Ministers
as to covenant in the Act of Uniformity: And he that (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
accusing others) only studieth to be innocent of so mortal
a (feared) Guilt, sure is therein excusable, if the fear of
God, and the love of our Souls, and of the Church and State,
be not an unexcusable Crime. Apply this no farther than I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:59333:108"/>
XXI. There is so much written for a foreign <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> over
<hi>England,</hi> in Church Affairs, by Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Bromhall,</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> Dr. <hi>Saywell,</hi> Bishop
<hi>Gunning</hi> 's Chaplain (and many others) whose Words I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to produce) as may assure us that it is in the same Mens
thoughts to introduce it as the only way to Concord, and that
they therefore desire the Ejection and Ruine of such as we, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are against it. And how far, and how soon God will
let these men prevail, we know not: But we are past doubt,
that to subject a Nation to a <hi>foreign Iurisdiction,</hi> is to <hi>stigmatize</hi>
it with the most <hi>odious Perjury:</hi> Seeing as the <hi>Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi>
sweareth all expresly against it, so the foresaid <hi>Corporation
Oath, Vestery Oath, Militia Oath, Oxford Oath,</hi> and <hi>Vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
Subscription,</hi> have sworn or engaged the Nation <hi>never to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
any Alteration of Government, in Church or State:</hi> And
if a <hi>foreign Iurisdiction</hi> be <hi>no Alteration,</hi> we know nothing capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of that Name. And when we see some of the same men at
once endeavour to make us <hi>take such Oaths</hi> on pain of Ruin,
and to design to bring all under the <hi>Guilt of breaking them,</hi>
when we have done, men think it best to take no more of them
than is necessary, till they see whether they must be kept or
broken.</p>
               <p>XXII. Plagues, Flames, Poverty, Convulsions that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln
Corporations of late years, makes us the more afraid of
the sins which are like to be the Cause: And the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> 's
Case makes us afraid of stretching Expositions of Oaths: And
the <hi>Londoners</hi> have sped so ill by such stretching Expositions as
confirmeth us in our Purpose to avoid them.</p>
               <p>XXIII. If we wilfully sin on pretence of Liberty to preach
the Gospel, we cannot expect God's Blessing on our Labours:
And then what is our preaching worth?</p>
               <p>XXIV. We read how joyfully many Martyrs in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s
days endured the Flames, rather than grant the <hi>real Presence in
the Mass:</hi> And we that fear far greater sin, must rather suffer
than commit them.</p>
               <p>XXV. As we dare not <hi>Conform against Conscience,</hi> so to <hi>lay
by our Ministry while we can exercise it,</hi> we take to be <hi>Sacrilege,
Covenant-breaking</hi> with God, and Treachery and Cruelty to the
Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:59333:109"/>
XXVI. We are sure if all the Ministers should conform, it
would be so far from healing the Church, that it would widen
the Breach: For the Dissenting People would be tempted to
go the further from us all, and think that none of us were to be
trusted; as many have turn'd further already on some such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
               <p>XXVII. We are Commonly agreed that <hi>no men have right
from God to Silence all the Ministers in the Land:</hi> And we are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfyed that Conformity to the things aforesaid <hi>being a Sin,</hi>
all the <hi>Ministers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> ought to have been <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi>
and then the Act of Uniformity had silenced them all.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. Lastly, the dreadful effects of Canonical, and the like
Impositions, the sufferings of Godly Minsters, Congregations,
Cities, Countries, and Persons thereupon; our doleful divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
especially among Ministers, the evil Spirit that possesseth
multitudes to cry down Love and call for Vengeance, and the
prospect of what is going on, do affright us from approving,
consenting to, or using the Engines that thus divide us, and the
Canons that are battering down our Peace, and consequently to
be guilty of all the Atheism, Prophaneness, Malignity, Popery,
Persecution and Calamity to this Land, which are like to come
in at the breach of our Walls, which the battery of those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and Engines make. A Jayl, and a Fire, or a Gallows is
an easier place, than a bed, where Conscience shall charge such
Evils home upon us; much more then the Judgments which the
True and Righteous Judge of the World will shortly execute on
Lyers, Malignants, or Persecutors of his Flock; yea, of the
least of those that Christ will call Brethren at that day.</p>
               <p>I have oft said, if any Church-History of one man be credible,
St. <hi>Martin</hi> wrought many Miracles; and when the Bishops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him being bad men, to get down the <hi>Priscillian</hi> Gnosticks
(worse than our <hi>Quakers)</hi> did, 1. Seek help of the Magistrate's
Sword; 2. And bring strict Godly persons under suspicion of
being <hi>Priscillianists; Martin</hi> renounced their Communion by
resolved separation to his death; save that once at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
desire, he Communicated with them on condition the
Emperour would spare the lives of some condemned as <hi>Priscil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianists;</hi>
and even for this was rebuked and chastized by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
if his Scholar and Companion <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> a Learned
Godly man, be to be believed.</p>

               <p>Have I pleaded with you any such <hi>Impulses</hi> or <hi>Inspirations,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. II.</hi> They say you make a Schism and Stir for meer
tristes and things indifferent, <hi>viz.</hi> Ceremonies and Liturgy; confessing
that they are not unlawful.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. And what if they say that we are <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi>
or have Horns and are Brutes, what remedy have we? To
their honour be it spoken, we would not hope to confute
them.</p>
               <p>2. Do you not know that so far are we from this, that even
under the <hi>old easier Impositions,</hi> we protested to the Bishops in
our <hi>Petitions for Peace, That we would yield to any thing but Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God,</hi> and we endeavoured to <hi>prove Conformity sinful?</hi> And
do they well agree with themselves, when Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> saith,
that I would represent Conformity such as should make them
seem a company of <hi>Perjur'd Villains?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. I pray you tell me, whether the 52. Points now opened by
me, be nothing but <hi>Liturgy and Ceremonies,</hi> and whether you
take them all to be <hi>things indifferent.</hi> Is it not an odd sort of
Accusers that we have, that sometimes say we suspect the Nation
of <hi>common Perjury,</hi> and the Church of Subverting, Corruption,
and overthrow of Discipline, and Excommunicating Christs
Faithful Servants; and shortly after say, We Dissent only about
things Indifferent? God have mercy on those miserably Souls
that take such things for Indifferent.</p>
               <p>4. Who is it troubles the Land with their <hi>things Indifferent?</hi>
Is it we? Did we devise them? Do we impose them on any,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59333:110"/>
and say, <hi>Vse our things indifferent, or we will Silence you, or Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

            <sp>

               <p>III. They say you hold your Opinions in obstinate wilfulness,

with as weak Brethren.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>So said the <hi>Arians</hi> of the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and the <hi>Heathens</hi> of
the <hi>Christians.</hi> It's a fine World when ignorant ungodly Lads are
heard tell such men as were Dr. <hi>Reignolds, Iohn Fox, Amesius,
Blondel, Dailee, Chamier,</hi> &amp;c. We can't allow you so much as
the esteem of <hi>weak Brethren:</hi> I do not think but some of their
School boys might soon be taught by a Bishop to say thus to
their Masters.</p>
               <p>2. But do all the young Clergy that can talk thus, shew us by
any good evidence, that in other things they are so much <hi>Wiser</hi> &amp;
<hi>Learneder</hi> than the <hi>Dissenters?</hi> Are they all of greater Learning
than <hi>Iohn Reignolds,</hi> or better Hebricians than <hi>Hugh Broughton,</hi>
or better Logicians than <hi>Sadeel,</hi> or <hi>Ramus,</hi> or <hi>Sohnius,</hi> or of
greater Reading than <hi>Blondel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. Do they know us better than we our selves? We offer our
Oaths that we hold what we do by the Cogency of appearing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and are willing to know the truth.</p>
               <p>4. Have I here and elsewhere given <hi>no Reasons</hi> for our <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent?</hi>
Have they answered my <hi>Treatise of Episcopacy,</hi> my First and
Second <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> my <hi>Apology,</hi> my <hi>Treatise</hi> of the <hi>Terms of
Church-Concord,</hi> or any one thing that I have written for our
Cause, save two or three by disputes, which when I have vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
they have let fall the Disceptation? What front have these
men then that say we <hi>Dissent without giving Reason for it?</hi> But
you know how long the Press was shut against our Writings;
and yet then they that would not endure us to <hi>Speak,</hi> accused us
for <hi>being Silent.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. IV.</hi> They say you are Non-Conformists meerly to make
good your former Errours, because you will not confess that you did
amiss, but will make the People justify you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. What are those Errours? If it be our dislike of any
of the things before described, I confess it is because we will not
renounce them: If it be an errour to be against their Church-corruptions,
and cruel Excommunications, and denying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
to the Seed of the Faithful, and Communion to faithful
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59333:110"/>
Christians, I confess we will not recant these errours, till
they have better proved them such. The Papists that swarm
with Errours, as a Beggar doth with Lice, yet <hi>burn</hi> the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
as for <hi>Errour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I pray you wish those infallible men, that in the ditch of dirt

                  <hi>Obj. V.</hi> They say that you took part with the Parliament
against the King, and involved the Land in Blood, and have still

               <p>1. I confess there were some among us that were of the
mind of <hi>Hooker, Bilson, Grotius, Barclay,</hi> and the common sort
of <hi>Casuists, Politicks, &amp;c.</hi> and that thought that as in a doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Physick, the College of <hi>Physicians</hi> were most to be trusted,
so in a doubt about Law, the Parliament had been most cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible:
And when the <hi>Irish</hi> had murdered two hundred thousand
Protestants falsly pretending that they had the Kings Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and threatning to finish their works in <hi>England,</hi> there were
many formerly tempted to fly in fear to the Parliament for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
being ignorant that the Kings bare word, notwithstanding
the Papists strength and interest, was more to be trusted with
our Laws, Lives and Religion, than all the Lawyers, Courts and
Pariament; and that if all the Protestants in <hi>England</hi> had been
used as those in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they ought to have died patiently, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the killers would have given them time to send to the King
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59333:111"/>
to know whether he would have them live or die: They were
ignorant that a Lord Proprietor may do with his own as he list.
Who accuseth the owner for killing his own Sheep? But the
times of this ignorance are past: The Long Parliament that
made the Act of <hi>Vniformity</hi> cured it: And shall not the Act of
<hi>Oblivion</hi> be permitted to reconcile us, and continue our peace?</p>
               <p>2. But, Sir, Who be they that were thus deceived? I told
you, 1. That of near ten thousand that had Churches under the
Parliament and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> there was but two thousand that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to Conform: And is not seven thousand Conformists more
than two thousand Dissenters. 2. Many that were in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Army Conformed; and some that were for the Kings
Death, when the generality of those called <hi>Presbyterians</hi> abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it, and the Engagement; and brought in the King on rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of meer Conscience.</p>
               <p>3. I have told you that we will take it thankfully, if only
those were silenced that had any hand in that War, believing that
it will not now be twenty Ministers in <hi>England.</hi> And why are
the rest that were Boys at School, accused for other Mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or actions? For the time to come, you need not fear them.
I heard some tell the Members of the Long Parliament that call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them Rebels for saying, that a <hi>Parliament may use defensive
Arms against the Kings Commissioned Souldiers;</hi> that if that would
serve, they would promise, that if the King would but send a
dozen <hi>Irish-men</hi> to kill them all in the house, they would never
be guilty of taking Arms to defend them, nor perswading any
else to do it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. VI.</hi> But they say that these Non-Conformists, tho'
they had no hand in the late War, yet have the same Principles that
caused it, and that is, Non-Conformity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>This is an argument <hi>a baculo ad angulum:</hi> A man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Cross in Baptism, or a Lay-Chancellor's excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Men for a Ceremony, <hi>&amp;c. ergo</hi> he is against the King,
and for Rebellion. The other side say, that the <hi>Irish</hi> Principles
and the <hi>Popish</hi> were the cause; and must we therefore conclude
all <hi>Irish</hi> or <hi>Papists</hi> to be against the King? They were <hi>Papists</hi>
that raised the Wars on both sides, in the aforesaid days of King
<hi>William,</hi> K. <hi>Stephen, H.</hi> 1. and <hi>H.</hi> 3. and <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. and <hi>Rich.</hi> 2.
and <hi>H.</hi> 6. and <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. and <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. &amp;c. Doth it follow that all
<hi>rapists</hi> are rebels?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:59333:111"/>
2. But I have elsewhere fully proved that the Parliament
when that War began, were of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists;</hi>
and it's strange that any should have the face to deny it,
while so many are yet living that know them: <hi>Whitlocke</hi> tells us
in his Memorials, that they voted, that every County should have
a <hi>Bishop</hi> and his <hi>Presbytery:</hi> And were those then against Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy?
One would think that a County should be big enough to
keep Episcopacy from dwindling to nothing; every Bishop of
old had but one City: Many Counties have ten, or near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Towns that were then called Cities. But when <hi>Papists</hi> dare
say that all are against Kings that are against the Pope, who is
the ruler and deposer of Kings; it's no wonder if every Bishop,
or Chancellor, or Official, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will say, If you be not for us you
are against the King; since all are sworn against altering the
Church-Government before that of the State.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> that lost an arm in the Kings service in the War,
lay in Gaol at <hi>Warwick,</hi> for preaching when silenced; and Mr.
<hi>Francis Bampfield</hi> that was against the Parliament's War, lay
seven years in Gaol for preaching as a <hi>Non-Conformist,</hi> and
died in <hi>New-gate. Non-Conformists</hi> that have been, and are
most for the King, do suffer as much as others.</p>
               <p>3. Read my second <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> in which I declare our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Principles; and tell us what you there dislike.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If you reduce your objection to an argument, it must run
thus; (All those are disloyal to the King who think that this vow
binds them to be against Prophaneness, Popery or Schism, or to
endeavour any amending or alteration of the prelatical way of
Church-Government: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I deny the Major. Is he an
honourer of the King that dare affirm this?)</p>
               <p>We are ready to renounce all Obligation from that or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Praech but to keep up a party, and your own Reputation and Interest

be past doubt that they have need of help. I would as soon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him if he undertook to build a Castle alone, and said he
had no need of help; or that forty thousand of the poor of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
have no need of relief, and that it is rebellion to relieve
them; as that the forementioned two hundred thousand have no

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. IX.</hi> There are some that have written that it is Pride
and Covetousness that makes you Non-Conformists to seem godly, and
to get livings for your Sons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Satan is so impudent a disputant, that I am aweary of
answering him, tho' in self-defence: If it be pride to be scorn'd
and toss'd about as Rogues, why will these humble Lord Bishops
and Masters so be-rogue us to make us proud? Men use to take
down that which feeds their enemies pride; I pray get them to
restore us from poverty, and prisons, and scorns, and slanders,
to take down our pride.</p>
               <p>And for covetousness get them one year to take our turns,
to have all their Goods and Books taken away, on the penalty of
40 <hi>l.</hi> for every Sermon, and that to be levied on their hearers
which they cannot pay, and in this case to ly in Gaol, and tell
us when they have tried it whether it gratified their covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>As to mens <hi>Charity</hi> to our selves or <hi>Sons;</hi> 1. I have said here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
that the 2000 that were ejected were fit for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> if
they would go out and suffer, that so forty Mens Sons that
conform against their Fathers wills, might get benefices. 2. They
will take it for a disgrace to their Church, if we should not grant
that the Lords, Knights, Rich Men and Patrons, are far more
of their Church, than of Dissenters; and therefore liker to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
Conformists Sons, than others: And a <hi>Living for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
another for the Son,</hi> is more than a <hi>possibility</hi> for <hi>one.</hi> But
brazen-faced impudence cannot be confuted.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. X.</hi> They say you are meer Hypocrites, that have learnt
a shew of Holiness and Iustice, but have false, proud, self-conceited,
rebellious Hearts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And truly we cannot confute them any otherwise than
by an appeal to the Judge of Hearts: We cannot shew them our
Hearts: And if they say that they see and know them, let Men
believe them as they see cause. They did not craftily so much to
praise our out-side; for those that take them not for Gods will
hardly believe that they see any deeper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:59333:112"/>
But as far as I understand, their meaning is, That no man on
earth is truly honest and godly; and therefore all are Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
that profess it. And so they confess themselves Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
in professing Christianity, if <hi>Professing</hi> be the mark of

that they take it for worse than Adultery, Murder, Persecution or
Perjury, to cross their wills and worldly interest. And if calling
themselves <hi>(the Church)</hi> would make any needy or ambitious pack
of men, the masters of all mens consciences, and persons, and
estates, I should not wonder if more than Papists and Prelatists
strove to be called, <hi>The Church.</hi>

indeed? We appeal to the common reason of mankind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Christs Church and Servants, and add to his Laws an hundred

               <p>These things are unfit matter for a controversy with
any <hi>English-Men</hi> of this age, but only with Foreigners and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
I thought once it would never have been so hard to
know good Men from bad, as these would make it. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how bad Christ and his Apostles were thought by their
persecutors. Wherein doth such mens badness lie? In not
coming to their Churches? Thousands do, and the rest go to
other Churches: But thousands of our adversaries go to none,
but very rarely.</p>
               <p>Is it in any <hi>other Vice?</hi> Why do they then charge them with
<hi>avoiding Vice in Hypocrisie?</hi> And what is that Vice? Here are,
some say, many hundreds that practise Physick in <hi>London:</hi> The
Posts, Walls, and Gates are stickt with Physicians offers to cure
the Lecherous pox: To day I read <hi>Kirleu</hi>'s Bill, that saith he
hath cured eight hundred of that disease. I dare bet with you
all the Money I have, that if you enquire, not eight, or perhaps
two of that eight hundred were <hi>Puritans,</hi> or such as you now cast
out for <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> (unless you call <hi>Papists</hi> or such other,
<hi>Non-Conformists)</hi> except any of them were Wives that
catcht it of Husbands that are of your Church or Parishes and
not of us, or Husbands that catcht it of such conformable (or
Papist) Wives. But of these things we need no defence.</p>
               <p>3. But if our hearers be bad, they have the more need of
teaching; and whether more are converted from ignorance,
sensuality, worldliness and prophaneness, by their teaching or
ours, ask others and not us.</p>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>They may of the two say more probably it is we that
bring in Prelacy, Lay Excommunicators, Ceremonies, Liturgies:
For of the two, we have done less against these than against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and stand not at so great a distance from them: The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency
of some men is the shame of depraved humane nature.
They know that it is for being more against Popery than they
are, that our ruine is so implacably endeavoured. They know
that the Papists are our chiefest prosecutors, thinking that if
they could destroy us as their greatest adversaries, they should
bring the Church of <hi>England</hi> to their will, and that it is but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating
the <hi>name of Popery</hi> to the <hi>Italian Faction</hi> that set the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59333:113"/>
                  <hi>Pope above Councils,</hi> and calling the rest by a <hi>better Name,</hi> and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off a few shreds named by <hi>Heylin</hi> in the Life of Arch-bishop
<hi>Laud,</hi> and it's done. They know that it is for drawing so near
to Popery that the Non-Conformists Dissent from them; and
take it for granted that those men that are labouring to bring in
Popery, are the forwardest to make this putid accusation of us;
and that it hath been their labour these two and twenty years to
have forc'd us to yield to an universal toleration, and to petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for it, that they might bring in Popery, and then say it is
we that did it, and that for denying this and being unreconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Popery, the Papists are so unreconcileable to us, as that
nothing will satisfy them but our utter extirpation, of which
they would make blind, sensual, debauched, malignant men that
call themselves Protestants the instruments. And how many of
their pillars have written for a foreign Jurisdiction and defend
<hi>Grotius,</hi> I have told you before. And to this day that Priest that
is nearest to Popery, is the bitterest enemy to the Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,
and most preacheth for their destruction: And these
brazen-faced men cannot endure an honest Conformist that doth
but preferr Protestants that dissent from their fetters before the
Papists: And those Bishops and Arch-bishops and the very
Church of <hi>England</hi> in their times, that were most against Popery,
are their scorn and hatred, as you may see in <hi>Heylin</hi>'s reproach
of Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> and the Bishops and Convocation, except
six Bishops in his days: And by the base scorns that they now
pour out against good Arch-Bishop <hi>Grindal,</hi> calling such men as
would strengthen us against Popery by reconciliation, by the
names of <hi>Grindalizers</hi> and <hi>Trimmers,</hi> and such as would betray
the Church: And how they reproach and use Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> for his
<hi>Protestant Reconciler,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> for his <hi>Sermon,</hi> and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>four Pleas of the Conformists for the Non-Conformists,</hi>
and such others, you know: The Author of the <hi>Reflections,</hi> and
the <hi>Samaritan</hi> they have not yet found out. Mr. <hi>Tho. Beverley</hi>
feareth them not: The Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> Dr. <hi>Crofts,</hi> (the first
man that ever I saw go forth with a Troop raised by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the King, and his Sermon in my Pulpit the first that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I heard against the Parliament, when the King was in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
and he himself had been a Papist, and is still zealous for
their Church cause) because he wrote the Book called <hi>Naked
Truth,</hi> to heal us and strengthen us against Popery, they gnash
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59333:114"/>
the Teeth at him; and so they do at Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi>
that wrote of the treasonable principles of Papists, tho' these Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
are too big for them yet to vilify, and openly oppose.</p>

               <p>Who do you think in your Conscience is liker to bring
it in, we or they? Who hath done and suffer'd more to keep it
out? We lay down all that we have to that end: They will not
part with a Ceremony, or one Oath, or a Re-ordination, or an
Excommunication of Christs Members to keep it out; but plainly
tell us, that they had rather Popery came in than abate a jott of
their Self-made Religion or Impositions, or than such as I should
Preach the Gospel.</p>
               <p>But I confess I am not able to deny it, that the Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
may be the occasion of bringing in Popery, by way of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiperistasis;</hi>
some men hate us and all serious Godliness so much,
that they are like enough to be for Popery, because godly men
are against it: And I fear lest they that see the Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
would reform their Prelacy and Church-Courts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to the Primitive Episcopacy, described by Bishop
<hi>Vsher,</hi> will be so much afraid, lest they lose some of their Wealth
and Domination by it, that some of them will hearken to the
Papists, that will promise them an Encrease of that which they
so esteem. And indeed it is already no strange thing to hear
them say, They had rather the Papists came in with Popery,
than the Dissenters with their Reformation.</p>
               <p>I think ere long you are like to be convinced more effectually
than by Writing, which Party is liker to bring in Popery, and
to turn Papists. In the mean time I begin to praise <hi>Stephen Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner,</hi>
and such others, for their Modesty, that when they burnt
<hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper, Philpot, Rogers,</hi> and the rest, that they
did not charge them with bringing in Popery, and say we burn
you for that.</p>

               <p>1. I hope you will grant, that when the things that men
fear (whether justly or mistakingly) no less than deliberate
Lying, Perjury, and Contracting by Justification the Guilt of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59333:114"/>
many hundred thousand Perjuries, and Swearing or Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
never to repent or endeavour that the Nation should repent
of heinous Church-Corruptions, or amend them, and the nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the Ordination and Ministry of thousands, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching
almost all the Protestant Churches, and more such
like, a man should not play with Matters of this moment,
nor take God's dreadful Name in vain, nor sport with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
Fire. And I hope you grant, that Words in Caths and
Impositions, are to be taken in the properest usual sence, unless
the Authors otherwise expound them. And you know that
they have been so far from expounding them otherwise, as that
these twenty years they have refused it, and in <hi>Scotland</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd
the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> to die for expounding them as some
would have us do. And what do Oaths or Covenants signify, if
the Takers may put what sence they will on them, and if the
most express Universals, yea, the express Exclusions of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
may be taken in a particular sence with Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
such Swearers and Subscribers give their Rules no
security. Is it not enough to tell you we will willingly stand to
Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s own Rules in his Excellent Prelections <hi>de Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramento,</hi>
for expounding Oaths and Promises?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such as these Expositions of stretchers, make Oaths to be
none,</hi> viz. [It's unlawful] <hi>that is,</hi> against the King's Law but
not against God's [to take Arms against the King] <hi>viz.</hi> As
King, <hi>but say the Papists, when the Pope excommunicates and
deposeth him, he is no King,</hi> [on any pretence whatsoever,] <hi>that
is,</hi> any unjust pretence, [by his Authority against his Person] <hi>viz.</hi>
It is to be done by Gods Authority and not by his, [or against any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned
by him,] <hi>viz.</hi> Lawfully Commissioned, of which we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerning
Iudges. <hi>The same I may say of all the rest: As</hi> Assenting
<hi>and</hi> Consenting to all things, except many things: <hi>Swearing</hi> Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Obedience in Licitis &amp; Honestis, <hi>when we judge ten or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Canons, if not the very frame to be</hi> Illicita &amp; Inhonesta, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>But as you have said that those Great Men, <hi>Grotius,</hi> and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Jeremy Taylor</hi> were for profitable Lying, so you know that
Worthy Latitudinarian Dr. who was wont to say, <hi>That if false
Knaves would turn him out of his Ministry and Living, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snaring
Impositions, he would take the Words in the best sence
he could subdue them to, whatever the Authors meant;</hi> and it
was as Lawful for him to defend himself against Knaves with his
Tongue, as with his Hands and Sword.</p>

Oath, and may shake off the Oath of Allegiance, or any other
when they have taken it. And if we are thought worthy to be
hated, and ruined as Rogues, for refusing self-saving, pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
deliberate Lying, and Perjury, when Oaths and Veracity

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I. The <hi>Diocesan Churches,</hi> as they <hi>depose all inferiour Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Churches,</hi> and Rule by their <hi>Lay-Civilians, Church-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi>
I disown and hold no Communion with in <hi>those errours,</hi>
but only in their <hi>Christianity.</hi> But I peaceably <hi>submit</hi> to <hi>them,</hi>
and would live quietly under them, if I might.</p>
               <p>II. Those <hi>Parishes</hi> that have <hi>notoriously uncapable Priests,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through <hi>utter insufficiency, heresy</hi> or <hi>hurtfulness,</hi> doing more
harm than good, I own not to be Organized Churches, nor have
Commmunion with their <hi>Ministers</hi> as <hi>Ministers,</hi> not owning
them for such.</p>
               <p>III. I hold it utterly unlawful to be <hi>Ministers</hi> with them, on
the <hi>terms</hi> now required of us; and therefore I have no such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial
Communion with them.</p>
               <p>IV. I preferr them not before better.</p>
               <p>V. I hold not fixed Communion as a fixed Member of their
Churches, with all that I hold occasional Communion with.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>What Communion is it then that you hold with them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I. With the <hi>Diocesans</hi> and their <hi>Officers,</hi> I hold mental
Communion as a Christian and a Protestant in all the essentials
of Christianity, and that Reformation which they own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. With the</hi> Parish-Churches <hi>that have</hi> true Ministers, <hi>I hold</hi>
mental Communion, <hi>as</hi> true particular Churches of Christ, <hi>(tho'
faulty) and</hi> local Communion <hi>on just occasions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. With the Parish-Assemblies that have <hi>intolerable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
I hold <hi>mental Communion</hi> with the <hi>People as Christians,</hi> and
will not refuse on just occasion to join with them in any good
exercise as <hi>Lay-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. With those Churches that have <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Liturgy</hi> as
ours that need reformation, I profess to join with them as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and Protestants that own all the Scriptures, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to preach nothing as necessary to Salvation but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it, or may be proved by it: And when I Communicate
with that Church it is as a Society so professing: But if their
Sermons, Liturgy, or Lives have any faults, being not <hi>Idolatry,
Heresy, Blasphemy,</hi> or such as rendreth their whole Worship, and
assembling unacceptable to God, I disown Communion in any
of those faults, tho' I be present.</p>
               <p>V. When I can have better, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> without
greater hurt than good, I preferr it; and only use <hi>occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59333:116"/>
local Communion,</hi> with the <hi>Liturgy-Churches,</hi> as I would
do with strangers were I in foreign lands.</p>
               <p>VI. Where I can have no better, without more hurt than
good, I Communicate constantly and only with the Parish-Church
where I live, as to Local-Communion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But how can you do either of these without guilt, when they
are as bad as you have described?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. I have not charged the Parish-Churches with that which
I have charged the Diocesans &amp; their Courts with; many honest
Ministers, never troubled nor excommunicated a true Servant of
Christ, nor ever owned intentionally the doing it by others.
They lament the impositions, and would be glad we were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by their removal: They would fain have good men resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and they do their best to promote godliness. And the
Ordinary Lords-Day part of the Liturgy tho' not faultless,
containeth things true and good, and it was a very great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
degree of Reformation, to make that Book: And the
most of all its faults are in the By-Offices, Baptism, Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Burial, &amp; the Rubricks, which the Lords-Day common
Worship is not concerned in, nor do the Congregation approve.</p>
               <p>2. Sin hath brought woeful faultiness into all the Churches
on Earth: And there are very few on Earth that have not worse
Doctrine and a worse Liturgy than ours: What then? Must we
either own or hide all their faults, or else disown and renounce
them all? No neither, but disown what is evil, and own what
is good; and separate from none of them further than they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from Christ.</p>
               <p>3. But I pray you answer me a few questions:</p>
               <p>1. Do you think any Church on Earth to be faultless?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>No: For all men are faulty, but the difference is great.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt it is great: But, 2. Do you think that you are
guilty of all the faults of the Church that you join with?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>They say, no, not of the <hi>secret Faults:</hi> But of the <hi>open</hi> they
say we are partakers by our presence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think there is any Church on Earth that <hi>hath no
open Faults?</hi> And will you join with none?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But they say, It is not Faults of <hi>Conversation</hi> that they
mean, but in <hi>Ministry, Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Worship.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I am sure <hi>Conversation Faults</hi> are oft alledged for <hi>separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
But is there any Minister or Church that hath no <hi>open Faults</hi>
in <hi>Ministry</hi> and <hi>Worship?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:59333:116"/>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>They mean not <hi>small Infirmities,</hi> such as weak, faulty expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
methods, disorders, dullness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>gross, intolerable Faults.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>So then you are come to what I hold, I profess that if I
see or hear any such <hi>Blasphemy, Idolatry, Heresy,</hi> or <hi>Malignity,</hi> as
renders the <hi>Worship</hi> abhorred of God, I will abhor it and avoid it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Is none of all that such which you have described?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing in the ordinary Lords-Day Worship, which
the Congregation must join in: Yea I dare not say that their By-offices,
<hi>viz.</hi> Baptism it self, notwithstanding their kind of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
and Crossing, doth frustrate the Sacrament to the capable.
And the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is very Piously Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
in the words of the Liturgy: And if they force men
thither or admit them that are unfit, that maketh not the words
of the Liturgy unfit for the Faithful, and their faults in Discipline
are none of mine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But Faults <hi>known before hand</hi> become mine if I join with
such a faulty Worship.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Then you must join with none on Earth: You know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand your own faults, that you will be guilty of in prayer:
Must you therefore forbear to pray? Suppose I have a teacher
that is an <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> or hath some known tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Errour, which I know before hand he holds, and useth to vend
in his Praying and Preaching. Is it unlawful to join with such?
Then <hi>Presbyterians, Independants,</hi> and all that differ in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
must still run away from one another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But to commit a Fault themselves makes it but their own, but
if they impose it <hi>on me,</hi> it's mine if I be present.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You should have said only, <hi>It's mine if I commit it.</hi> If you
were commanded to burn a Martyr, your presence maketh you
not guilty if you do it not, nor consent to the doing of it.</p>
               <p>2. It's one thing to impose on you the committing of a fault,
and another thing to impose on you to hear another man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it.</p>
               <p>3. And it's one thing to impose that which you <hi>can refuse,</hi>
and another to force you <hi>to do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When an <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> or an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> or a Preacher of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent
Expressions or Disorder, teacheth in the Assembly, he
imposeth on them all to hear <hi>his Faults,</hi> but not to <hi>approve them or
do the like:</hi> Or if he command them to believe his Errours, it is
a <hi>refuseable imposition,</hi> and they may choose.</p>

               <p>Prejudice may make any thing seem so. But, 1. The

time and order, and avoideth the confusion.</p>

               <p>But my Friend saith that the Apostle saith, <hi>with such no not

               <p>1. I never told you that I took all the Parish-Ministers or
People for persecutors. No, nor for Lyers: For when they
say that <hi>ex animo</hi> they hold that nothing in the Liturgy or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is contrary to the Word of God, they speak as
they think. But it would be a <hi>lye in me</hi> who am otherwise

them not with that: And it's another thing to say or do
somewhat that may make a man some way guilty of other mens
perjury: This is it which <hi>affrights me</hi> from Conformity; but as
<hi>to them,</hi> they understand the words of Oaths, and Promises and
Impositions otherwise than I do (as I told you the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>yle</hi>
did) and I doubt not but many worthy men, such as Mr.
<hi>Gurnal,</hi> and others known to us, were drawn in, by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leave to declare that they took the impositions in such a sence
as they thought Lawful (as the <hi>Arians</hi> at the Council of <hi>Seleuci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
and the <hi>Acacians</hi> drew many in to them by giving them all leave
to subscribe in their own sence): And though I can justifie none
of this; yet what ever their words were, and though they were
not faultless, their hearts abhorred Perjury.</p>
               <p>But I pray you ask your friend these Questions. 1. Did none
that are for separation from the Church of <hi>England</hi> take the
<hi>Corporation-Oath</hi> and <hi>Declaration?</hi> You know that many of
them did.</p>
               <p>2. Do <hi>they</hi> ever since avoid Communion with all those men?
You know they do not. And yet none of the Ministers Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
to me seem half so frightful as the Corporation De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.
Do they not then here shew Partiality, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
justify our Communion with the Conformists?</p>
               <p>Yea when Mr. <hi>Eaton,</hi> and some other <hi>Independants</hi> wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the obligation of the Covenant, and of the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
and many called the Covenant an Almanack out of date;
did the rest avoid communion with these?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But briefly tell me why you Communicate in the Parish
Churches.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Briefly, 1. Because Christ hath Commanded us to live
in the utmost Love, Union and Concord with all his Church on
Earth, that we possibly can.</p>
               <p>2. Because they hold all the essentials of Christianity, which
constituteth them Members of Christ's Church, and no errour
that nullifieth their Christianity, or maketh their Communion
unlawful to me.</p>
               <p>3. Because my own edification hath required it: I have long
lived where I could have no better Communion; and after I
found Communion with both sorts most profitable to me; I found
the Liturgy in the main, fit for my serious desires and praises to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59333:118"/>
God, and the Preachers that I heard were profitable Preachers,
and if some words were amiss, I past them by; and the very
Concord and Presence of Christians (though faulty) is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to me.</p>
               <p>4. I lived where and when these Parish Churches were slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by mistakes, to be such whose Communion was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and my constant avoiding them, would have made me seem
a consenter to the slanders, and so to be guilty of scandal.</p>
               <p>5. I lived in a time and place, where the Rulers and Laws
Commanded Parish Communion; and to forbear it against such
commands and penalties, seemeth plainly to tell the world that
I hold it unlawful, which is an untruth.</p>
               <p>6. I had seen whither this extream of separation had brought
this Nation, formerly, and of late; and what a hopeful Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
it shamed and destroyed, and that by such Rebellious and
mad actions, as made them, and accidentally others, the scorn
and hatred of the World, and have occasioned all our suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>7. I lived where men that I thought guilty of our sinful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
and the danger of the land, did discern the mistake of
them that overcharged the Liturgy and Parish Communion, and
thereupon took them for a proud Fanatick sort of People, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all that doth befal them, and think they do God service
in ruining us all, as if we were such: And I durst not thus scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
and harden men in grievous persecutions.</p>
               <p>8. I was loth to misguide others by my example; and I
doubted not but when necessity drove them to it, many would
see cause to Communicate with the Parish Churches. And I
was willing that they should sooner see these Reasons, and not
seem to do it only to save themselves.</p>
               <p>9. I had read the writings of those excellent men of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Brownists,</hi> or Separation heretofore; who then were the
Non-Conformists that did suffer so much for Reformation:
He that will read what is written by Mr. <hi>Iohn Paget,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Bradshaw,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hildersham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Iohn Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rathband,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> First and Second Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuduction,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and lately Mr. <hi>Iohn Tombes,</hi> the Pillar of the
<hi>Anabaptists;</hi> and for hearing by Mr. <hi>Philip Nye,</hi> may see e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for just satisfaction; especially in Mr. <hi>Ball</hi>'s Trial of
Separation. And though the case of Conformity be since made
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59333:118"/>
much harder to the Ministers, to the Laity the change is not
so great as herein alters the case of Lawfulness or Duty.</p>
               <p>10. I found that St. <hi>Paul</hi> charged the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
as having among them men Carnal, guilty of Schism, slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Apostles; guilty of sinful Law-Suits, and defrauding
each other, bearing with incest, disordered, profane and drunk
at Sacramental Communions; some decryed the Resurrection,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Galatians</hi> seem more to be accused than they, as
depraving the Christian Doctrine. The <hi>Colossians</hi> faulty; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the Seven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> charged with grievous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
And yet in all these, no man is commanded to separate
from any one of these Churches, nor blamed for not doing
it.</p>
               <p>11. And, which is most of all, I find that Christ himself,
who was certainly sinless, held open Communion with the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Church in Synagogues and Temples, and Commanded the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
their duty even to the falsly obtruded Priests, and to hear
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> while they delivered <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law; though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and separated from their false Doctrine, and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
traditions and corruptions.</p>
               <p>These are my Reasons for Lay-Parish-Communion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you did not answer</hi> [from such turn away, <hi>and</hi> with
such not to Eat, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The answer is obvious; 1. It is the duty of the Church
to cast out wicked impenitent men; and this Christ commandeth
them; but he never bids particular Christians to separate from
the Church where some such are, because the Church omits its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
For then you should separate from duty, from Gods Worship
and holy Communion, on pretence of separating from sinners.</p>
               <p>2. But for Family and Private Converse, every Christian is
judge himself, and must refuse all familiarity with scandalous
Christians which encourageth them in sin or seemeth to own it.</p>
               <p>God Commandeth no man to do that which is not in his power;
to put a scandalous impenitent man from the Church, is in the
Churches power, and so that command belongs to them; it is
not in your power, and therefore belongs not to you, save to
admonish men, and tell the Church; but to put men from
your table and familiarity, is in your power and belongs to you.</p>
               <p>Suppose the King write to the City of <hi>London</hi> to put all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
out of their Company and Converse; its easie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59333:119"/>
that every one must do it only in his own place. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
single man cannot turn such out of the Common-Council:
The City Rulers must do that, and till it be done, single men
may not deny obedience to the Governours: But all may turn
them out of their houses, shops and familiarity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But they say it is a receding from our former Reformation, and
pulling down what we built.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The Separators pull'd it down with a witness; but it is
no such thing: Did the Covenant or our Profession ever bind us
to take the Liturgy, to be worse than it is, or the Parish Churches
to be no Churches, or their Communion utterly unlawful? Or did
it bind us to preferr a desertion of all publick Communion before
it? No, it did not; but if it had, it had been sinful, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of. But, 1. We were bound by God's word (and no
Covenant, or Practices bind us to any more than Scripture binds
us to) to avoid all that is sin. 2. And when we have our choice
to preferr the best; he that doth either turn to Sin, or preferr a
less good, when it is so, before a greater, goeth back; but he that
preferreth <hi>no Publick</hi> Worship, before the Parish Worship, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
back indeed, and breaketh the Covenant, by profaneness
and Schism. God's word is a clearer and surer Test of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Controversies, than any humane Covenants.</p>
               <p>When Ministers were changed, 1647. many places got out some
tolerable weak Ministers to get in abler men in great Towns.
When the Bishops returned, their abler Ministers being dead or
ejected, they took the old ones again. Did these go back from
Covenant Reformation or Duty, when they could have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
Had not those been the revolters that would rather have
had none?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But why go you to the Parish-Churches when you might have
better?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. All Non-Conformists Preach not better than many
of them; yea, the Liturgy is better words of Prayer, than
some weak or faulty Non-Conformists oft use.</p>
               <p>2. A brown loaf and a white one both, may be better than
a white one alone; I found both best; and I knew it sin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Communion with any Church for weakness, because they
are not as good as others.</p>
               <p>3. That is best at one time and place, that is not so at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Praying in it self, is better than working, and eating,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59333:119"/>
sleeping. And yet in their proper time, your servants working,
and your eating and sleeping is better than praying at that time.
One that is a Son, a Servant, a Wife, who is commanded by
ahe Master of the Family to hear a tolerable Parish-Minister,
may then find it better than disorderly and disobediently to hear
an abler Man; that may by variety of conditions be one mans
Duty, which is anothers sin.</p>
               <p>But alas! I fear that Communion with a Non-Conformist-Church
will quickly in <hi>England</hi> be so rare, as will end the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
which you should preferr, and you must have Parish-Church
Communion or none: As it was before 1638, when
there was scarce more than one Non-Conformist that held any
Church-Communion but Parochial, in each County. I think,
God's Judgments will soon silence this dispute with all that will
not renounce all Local-Church Communion.</p>
               <p>I will conclude with another reason of my practice. Almost
every Church on Earth hath a worse Liturgy (as I said) and
People than ours: But I dare not separate from almost every
Church on Earth: And therefore not from one for a reason
that is common to almost all.</p>

that do but affirm, <q>That any thing is unlawful or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant

and Godly Ministers judge such things too light to deserve
an Excommunication, and dare not so dishonour those Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
whom God hath commanded us to honour; yea, and
think all Excommunicating, <hi>ipso facto, sine sententia

which supposeth Impenitence: And let no

Arbitrarily Decreed, or against their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences:
And let none be forbidden to Preach the Gospel,

are gifts from God, of unspeabahle value; so none
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59333:122"/>
at age but willing Consenters to the Covenant of God, can
have any right to them: Therefore no unwilling person
should be forced to Baptism or the Lord's Supper, and so
to profane Gods holy Ordinance, and corrupt the Church:
But in each Parish the meer Auditors or Catechized, must
be distinguished from the Communicants; as meer Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising

<hi>Approvable, Tolerable</hi> and <hi>Intolerable;</hi> though the

all <hi>Laymen</hi> that can but <hi>Buy</hi> or <hi>Inherit a Patronage,
Advowson,</hi> or <hi>Presentation,</hi> either Authorized by
God, or Qualifyed with sufficient Wisdom and Piety, to
choose such as <hi>Pastors,</hi> to whom (though Ordained by a
Bishop) all men are bound to commit the Pastoral care
and conduct of their Souls (as is aforesaid). Therefore
to <hi>this Relation,</hi> the <hi>Peoples Choice or Consent</hi>
is necessary: And because Parish Churches are by fixed
Neighbourhood, the most convenient Order, the Rulers
should either make those the <hi>Publick Teachers,</hi> whom
the People can take for their <hi>Pastors,</hi> or the People after
take those for their <hi>Pastors</hi> who are truly Capable, whom
the Rulers first choose for the <hi>Publick Teachers:</hi>
But in case they cannot so agree, each man must be <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated</hi>
to choose and join with some other (Parochial or
more private) Minister for his <hi>Pastor;</hi> so be it, 1. They
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59333:122"/>
fess the essentials of Christianity, and Church Communion.
2. And live peaceably and loyally, in their Preaching and
Practice. 3. And pay the publick Teachers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
their dues; renouncing Heresie and Popery, and all
Foreign Iurisdiction and Treason.</p>

               <p>As to the ignorant clamors for a real or seeming Re-ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:59333:124"/>
But I say, that I have fully proved (unanswered) that they
that were Ordained by Synods of Incumbent Pastors, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
those also then approved by the <hi>Westminster</hi> Assembly, had a
better Ordination, and that by true Bishops, than either <hi>Papists</hi>
or meer <hi>English</hi> Diocesans that are not Arch-bishops can give:
And yet they Re-ordain not <hi>Papists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Either they take the Parish-Churches (that is, the Pastor and
Communicants distinct from the meer Auditors and Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,
and from the Aliens) to be true proper Churches in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Sense or not: If yea, Then those Churches have Bishops;
For <hi>Ecclesia est plebs Episcopo adunata, &amp; ubi Episcopus ibi Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia:</hi>
Their own Principle is, That it is no proper political
Church without a Bishop. There are three degrees of Bishops.
1. All Presbyters are <hi>Episcopi Gregis</hi> (by the consent of Papists
and Protestants.) 2. The chief Incumbents that have Curates
or may have, are <hi>Episcopi Praesides:</hi> The Ordination without
Diocesans was by these two sorts of Bishops. 3. True Diocesans
are Arch-bishops, <hi>Episcopi generales plurium Ecclesiarum;</hi> We
refuse not their Ordination; but Men have true Episcopal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
without it.</p>
               <p>But if they say that the Diocesan is the lowest Bishop of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church, and that the Parish-Incumbent Rectors are no
true Bishops, and their Assemblies no true political Churches
formed of Bishops, but only parts of one Diocesan Church
<hi>infimi Ordinis,</hi> we abhor such Tyrannical, Schismatical Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans,
and their pretence of proper power to Ordain; and the
Primitive Church had never any such Ordaniers or Bishops:
And I advise all Ministers neither to be Re-ordained by such, nor
to yield to the appearance of such an evil, by coming under their
equivocating imposition of hands; lest they take God's Name
in vain, and harden Papists and Church-Tyrants in their false
condemnation of the Reformed Churches. If it be want of a
legal right in <hi>England</hi> that they pretend, let the Magistrate give
you a Licence or Legal right. I write not this for my own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
for I was Ordained by a Diocesan, and am past all hopes or
fears of Man.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>YOV must give me leave to tell you what objections are like to
be raised against your proposed Articles of Reconciliation.
And first your own party will be unsatisfied in them, and so they will
do no good, because here is not a word against Arch-bishops, Bishops,
Deans, Arch-deacons, and the rest that bear office in their Courts,
which yet is the thing that you your self seem most to dissent from, and
which the Covenant did renounce.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. We have so much swearing and unswearing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing,
that I will meddle as little as I can in things that look
like Perjury. You know that as the last Generation was sworn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Prelacy, this new Generation is sworn to it: Yea in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the whole Land is sworn or covenanted <hi>never to endeavour
any alteration of it:</hi> And how much soever I am against that
Oath, yet I will meddle as little as I can in urging men to that
which they take for Perjury.</p>
               <p>And I have elsewhere told you that the Covenant renounced
not all Episcopacy; many of the Assembly of Divines declared
their dissent from any such renunciation, and had entred their
protestation against it (as Dr. <hi>Cornel. Burges</hi> told me) had not the
Explication been added, which confineth the Renunciation to the
<hi>English</hi> frame. And that the present <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> would
have thankfully received the Primitive Episcopacy, they shewed
by their motion, 1660.</p>
               <p>2. We offer this form on supposition that we may not have
what we think best, but what we can joyfully submit to, for our
Concord and the Churches safety.</p>
               <p>3. I have inserted those restraints of the hurt and abuse of the
Diocesan form and their Courts, as may do much to secure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
And if they be kept from doing harm, we have most of
our end. Their faults are not ours who cannot remedy them.</p>
               <p>4. And you are mistaken in thinking that this form of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
will cause no Concord: Less was accepted with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
thanks to the King for his <hi>Declaration,</hi> 1660. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the <hi>Dissenters</hi> would be so few, as that the Concord of
Consenters would render them inconsiderable, or uncapable of
being dangerous to our peace.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But, 1. what makes you put in so much that no body denieth?
Do you not seem hereby to intimate unjustly that all this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. I have no hope of Concord, but by disputing <hi>ex conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
and improving mens own principles: Do you think I am so
foolish as to expect that Adversaries so fierce should change their
judgments by any thing that I can say, if their own interest or
their own principles by inference change them not?</p>
               <p>2. We want nothing more in reality and practice than that
which is most granted us in shadow and general words; who
grant not that we must obey God before man? And must love
God above all, our neighbours as our selves, and must do as we
would be done by? And must bear with the receive the weak,
and persecute none, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if this were done, we were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.
O happy <hi>England</hi> if all were granted practically and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
which men in general words approve! But if they <hi>grant
this,</hi> and yet will not <hi>grant it,</hi> but seek to ruine them that seek it,
are they not unexcuseable?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Why begin you with the qualifications requisite to Baptism, as
if you spake to Infidels?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Because I cannot build without a foundation: This is the
chief thing necessary to our Reformation, that the Church may
consist of capable persons.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Why name you Parents and Pro-parents instead of God-fathers
and God-mothers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Because it belongs to him to covenant in the Childs name
or behalf, whose <hi>will</hi> may justly go as for the Childs <hi>will;</hi> and
that is they <hi>whose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he is, and who have the power of him, and
whom God hath commanded and authorized to this office, and
who are obliged to educate him and seek his well-fare: By <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parents,</hi>
I mean such as by <hi>Adoption</hi> or otherwise justly take the
child for <hi>theirs;</hi> which when Parents leave them Orphans is
usual. I say nothing against <hi>God-fathers</hi> as <hi>seconds,</hi> presupposing
this much.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But I pray you who shall be judge whether the profession be <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>
which must be made by the <hi>Adult,</hi> or by the <hi>Parent?</hi>
By this trick you will make the Priest the chief Governour of the
Church; and he shall keep out whom he pleases, as for want of <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
the words of the Covenant.</p>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. I confess that this is the first and most momentous part
of the power of the Keys. But it tells us that it is not only Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
that have that power: But either some-body or no body
must have this power or trust.</p>
               <p>1. If <hi>No-body;</hi> Turks, Heathens, Sadducees, any may be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized
tho' in scorn; and may be members of the Church at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and the Church shall indeed be no Church, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with the World. A <hi>Parrot</hi> may be taught to say those
words. A man of about 80 Years of age in the Parish where I
taught, being ask'd who <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was, pointed to the <hi>Sun</hi> and
said, That was he; and ask'd, <hi>Wh was the Holy Ghost?</hi> Said, he
thought the <hi>Moon.</hi> What wiseman will be the <hi>Pastor</hi> of such a
Church?</p>
               <p>2. Christ hath instituted an Office for this judgment, and
given them the Keys: Therefore there must be some such judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>2. If <hi>Some-body,</hi> who must it be? 1. If it be every expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant
for <hi>himself,</hi> it will be as before; and there will be no
Church. Any Heathen may come in. 2. If it must be the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,</hi>
you call him to attend this Service, and to teach and try
all that are baptized at age, and all Parents for their Children:
And if you lay on him the <hi>Pastors</hi> Office, you make him
<hi>Pastor.</hi> 3. If it must be the <hi>Bishop,</hi> it is impossible, and no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
will do it; when he doth not so much as know or see one
of an hundred in his Diocess: It must then be the <hi>Parish-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
or <hi>No-body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Those must be trusted with it whom Christ hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for such trust: But that is the <hi>Ministers:</hi> To them he hath
commited the Keys of his Church or Kingdom.</p>
               <p>4. Those must be trusted with it, that must <hi>Execute</hi> it: It is
the <hi>Minister</hi> that must <hi>Baptize:</hi> And therefore he must judge
<hi>whom to baptize,</hi> or else he is but an Executioner, like one that
washeth any one that's foul; and not a judge of what he doth,
nor must answer for it.</p>
               <p>5. The Universal Church ever since Christ's days hath agreed
in this: And shall we now overthrow it?</p>
               <p>And as to the exception against the <hi>Power of the Pastor.</hi>
1. All power may be abused; shall we have no King, no Judge,
or Justice, or Bishops, because they may abuse their power?</p>
               <p>2. It is so natural to men to consult their own carnal Interest,

omit so costly and troublesome a duty, that it's enough to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
that a hundred will sin in making the door too wide, for one
that maketh it too narrow; and doleful experience tells us this:
We are confounded by the contrary extream.</p>
               <p>2. He that is refused wrongfully by one Minister, may find
enough that will receive him.</p>
               <p>3. We grant appeals to Rulers in case of Male-administration.</p>
               <p>4. The setting open the Church-doors without an examiner,
will be an hundred fold worse: And you must be like the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that would never have her house swept, lest her servant
should chance to sweep out a pin.</p>
               <p>What think you of all the ancient Churches that taught the

               <p>2. In your second Article again you give the Minister a power
to judge of mens <hi>Understanding:</hi> But I need no further answer
to that.</p>
               <p>But do you not thus make Examination by Ministers necessary to
the Sacrament?</p>

               <p>But is it not enough that Children own their baptismal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
by <hi>coming to Church,</hi> and not <hi>denying it,</hi> without any <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi>

               <p>Many come to hear that are no Christians; Children are
born in Nescience, and when they come to age must be made
knowing Christians, and believe and obey for themselves if they
will be saved; and they cannot consent to their baptismal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
if they understand it not: This is the thing that hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Church: Those that were <hi>Infant-Christians,</hi> and at
age were no <hi>Christians,</hi> have filled many Congregations. Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that where Confirmation and Personal Trial is by the sin of
Pastors omitted, the peoples ordinary attendance at Church
and desiring the Sacrament, is an obscure profession, and may
serve to the <hi>being</hi> of a Church, tho' not to the <hi>well-being.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But some of your Non-conformists will as much blame you for
requiring <hi>too little</hi> to Communion, in that you demand not an account
of Mens Conversation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. He that truly <hi>consenteth to the Covenant of Baptism,</hi> is
<hi>Converted</hi> or <hi>Sanctified;</hi> and he oweth the Church no account
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59333:127"/>
of that consent but his own Profession, not nulled by <hi>word</hi> or
<hi>deed.</hi> And if you forsake this rule, you will never know what
terms to take up with.</p>
               <p>2. And as to the time or circumstances, whether God Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
him in Infancy and he grew up in grace, or when, or how
God wrought upon him, he oweth no account to others.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>3. In your third Article again the chief exception will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this trying men by the Minister for Communion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I have proved to you the necessity of it, <hi>ad bene esse.</hi> And
may I not hope that the Bishops will be for it? When, 1. They
order that the Minister catechize and send to the Bishop such as
are to be confirmed. 2. That he <hi>give the Sacrament to none but
those that are Confirmed, or are ready and willing to be Confirmed:</hi>
And how can they know this without trial? 3. When they
know that the Bishops are not able to do it for all, or the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth
part themselves. Why then should they be against it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>If all the Bishops in <hi>England</hi> be for it, the Parish-Priests will
some be unfit for it, and few will be at so much labour and self-denial
as it will cost them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If the Bishops put or take in bad untrusty men, I cannot
help that: Let them be encouraged to do well that will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But why must they make their profession before others?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Not but that the Pastors word may satisfy the Church,
but it is much fitter that he that is to have Communion with all,
should be known to some besides the Minister to be a professed
Christian. I should have desired that it might be done as Baptism
in the Congregation, as best, but that of these men we must ask
as little as may be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But many ignorant people have not words to express their own
belief or thoughts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>It is not ornamental unnecessary knowledge that must be
demanded of them: They that want other words, may by <hi>Yea,</hi>
and <hi>Nay</hi> make known their mind, when the Minister expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the matter in his question. And the Church requireth that
they can answer as catechized.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Some other will say that you are too lax in admitting all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
formerly by Bishops, or by other Pastors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If we crave that each Minister may try his Flocks, we
cannot in modesty refuse those tried and received by the Bishop
or other Pastors. All Churches should live in such Communion
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59333:127"/>
with each other, as to receive each others Members on just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
without trying them all again. And if Bishops or any do
it superficially, that's their own fault.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you impose the Registring of Communicants?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I impose it not, but only commend it as a help to memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
He that hath no more Communicants than he can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
needs it not. But Bishop <hi>Ier. Taylor</hi> in his <hi>Pref.</hi> to <hi>Treatise</hi>
of <hi>Repentance,</hi> saith, That a <hi>Man cannot take a Pastoral charge, or
give an account of them that he knoweth not.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>4. Your fourth Article sets Ministers on such work as few can
well do, and few will ever faithfully do. And yet for every young, raw
Priest to have such power will never be granted by the Bishops or the
Laity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You may as well speak out and say, that Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
such a Ministerial office as the World will never endure.
Why then do they call themselves Christians? This is the
proper work of a Pastor, as it is of a Physician, to look particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to the sick, and not only to read a Physick Lecture to them.
If Bishops will put in ignorant lads or unfit men, I say again we
cannot help it; nor must we for that deny the Ministerial
office, any more than we must put down Preaching and Praying
because some are unfit. The weight of this work should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make all careful to get only fit men into the Ministry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But shall every Priest have power to put men from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If every Priest must administer it, he must judge to
whom: It is not a common food for all, but the Childrens Bread.
If every Priest must judge whom to baptize, so he must whom
to give this Sacrament to. 2. The Canons allow this as to the
scandalous, so we do but present them to the Bishop or Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
and it's less offensive to suspend them without such prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
If he wrong any, they have their remedy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But why do you mention no more solemn Excommunication, but
this Declarative one and Suspension?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Because I would ask no more than needs of men that will
not grant so much. And I know no just Excommunication but
a Ministerial declaring according to God's word, that a man hath
made himself uncapable of Church-Communion and of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of Gods Covenant, and binding him over to answer his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence
at the barr of God, and requiring the Church accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
to avoid him.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>5. The main charge will be against your fifth Article, that cuts
off so many Oaths, Subscriptions and Professions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>It's pity that these will not serve the turn, whenas they
are more than Christ, or his Apostles, or the Church for 300
years imposed.<note place="margin">See the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> about Subscription in his foresaid Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to King <hi>Iames.</hi>
                  </note> And yet must we have more, even as necessary
to Ministry? Will not the experience of 1300 years yet teach
us to forbear tearing the Church by unnecessary snares? Yet I
deny not but the Ordainers may try the ability of Ministers, in
more than the words that they must subscribe to: And if any
will draw up such Articles as <hi>none shall Preach against,</hi> I oppose
them not: The greater Concord the better: But we must not
cause perpetual discord, by unskilful, and impossible terms of
Concord.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But for ought I see you will let in Papists if they will but take
the Oath of Supremacy, and renounce all in general that is contrary to
the Scripture and their Profession.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And all Churches will let in <hi>Heart-Papists</hi> that renounce
Popery: Who knows the heart? But, 1. The Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
is a most express abjuring of the Essence of Popery; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as extended against the Ecclesiastical as well as Civil
Power of the Pope. 2. And is not God's Word a sufficient Rule
of Religion? Deny this and you will turn Papists to keep out Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.
3. If it be, if Popery be against Scripture, it's here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced:
If not, why should we be against it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But should they not distinctly renounce Transubstantiation,

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>There is no end of enumerating Errours: They are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
like Maggots in a Carcase. A thousand will be unnamed
when you have done your best at it. But the <hi>Rule</hi> must not name
every Errour against it: The contrariety will be discernable.
It is enough that men profess a <hi>perfect Rule,</hi> and <hi>renounce all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi>
and be <hi>responsible to the Church</hi> and their <hi>Rulers</hi> when they
<hi>corrupt Religion</hi> contrary to the <hi>Rule</hi> and their own Profession.
An Errour not manifested hurts not others, and none is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
till proved. If Heresy be kept secret, the Church must not
make new Laws and Tests to make men confess it; but punish it
when it is vented.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But shall Ministers make no profession but what a Papist or a
Heretick will make?</p>

               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:59333:128"/>

               <p>No, if a Papist or Heretick will profess all that is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
else we must make more. Must we make new Creeds or
new Scriptures as oft as dissemblers will falsely profess that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made? This was the temptation to those multitudes of
Creeds, by which Councils distracted the Churches, which <hi>Hilary</hi>
decryeth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But the Bishops will never take down the Oath of Canonical
Obedience, and all the other Oaths and Subscriptions that are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their Interest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot help that: Over-doing is un-doing: If ever Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy
be cast out, it will be by such over-doing, which will not
let men live in Peace that would not molest them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>6. Why do you seem to grant the Bishops and Patrons votes in
the choice of Pastors, when before you seem to have much against
them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I have nothing against the <hi>Ordainers</hi> judging of the <hi>fitness
of the Ordained,</hi> nor of <hi>Magistrate</hi> or <hi>Patrons disposal</hi> of <hi>Temples</hi>
and <hi>Tithes:</hi> And because nothing but necessity will weigh down
the great inconvenience of maintaining distinct Pastors, while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
setled Lecturer hath the Temple and Tithes, therefore I suppose
that the Bishop and Patron will have their Votes: And I suppose
you know that it is vain to motion to Patrons to resign this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
were it worse than it is; else Advowsons would not be sold
at such rates as they are by many Patrons: And my silence
where speaking will do no good, is no sign of my approbation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But do you think that the <hi>Communicants</hi> shall have a <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Vote</hi> in choosing Pastors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I think they will not, till God raise up better men, than
many Patrons are. But I am past doubt that God's Law of Nature
and Scripture, and the whole consent of ancient Churches, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Councils, are for it: And methinks were not carnal
Interest stronger with them than Religion, men that are profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
for God's Law, and Church-Canons and Customs, should
not obstinately oppose them all: Yea, the highest Episcopal Men
are in this against them. Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> saith, that till the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and People again choose their own Bishops, there needs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason be given of the contempt of Episcopacy. Yea, I
have proved past denial oft, that no Non-consenter can be a
member of any Pastoral Church, nor any man be a mans Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
that doth not consent. It's reason then to speak for
the Flocks <hi>Consenting Vote.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But they may be forced to consent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I shall give you a reason against that anon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think the ignorant vulgar are fit to choose themselves a
Pastor? The most are usually the worst.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If the Church-men will make the uncapable rabble <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants,</hi>
and then deny them <hi>Church-privileges,</hi> because they
are <hi>uncapable,</hi> they condemn themselves for taking (yea forcing)
in such <hi>uncapable</hi> men: Even as the Bishops that <hi>Ordain Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
that <hi>cannot Preach,</hi> and then by their <hi>Canon forbid them to
Preach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And yet I will say, That never knew any places, in City
or Country, that have oft had better Pastors, for Learning and all
Worth, than where the Communicants were the choosers:
Yea, even the ignorant usually have a gust, that discerneth
and valueth good and able men.</p>
               <p>3. And yet, I speak not so high as for their Power of <hi>first
Choice,</hi> but only of <hi>Consent;</hi> nor yet to choose who shall be
a <hi>Minister,</hi> but who shall be <hi>their Pastor.</hi> The Bishop ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not their consent at <hi>Ordination.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But you know that if there must three Consents go to it;
The <hi>Ordainers,</hi> the <hi>Patrons,</hi> and the <hi>Communicants,</hi> they may
never agree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and frustrate all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Humane faultiness puts inconveniences into all actions:
But we must not cure it with a worse: If you would take no
Physick till three Physicians agree, it's a less mischief than to
give any man that can buy that Power, a right to impose
what ignorant fellow or enemy he will, to be your sole Physician.
Three Locks and Keys in three hands, to so great a Trust,
may be better than one in an untrusty hand. Shall every
Papist or Atheist choose me a Physician as fitter than I?</p>
               <p>2. But if they should never agree, it is but every one stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at his own part. The Ordainers have done their part;
and the Patron hath chosen a Teacher for Auditors, and a

               <p>But the Patron will prevail against them, as long as he must

               <p>Uncurable evils I cannot help. I can but wish that no

               <p>I think not; and therefore I have no hope of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

               <p>1. You know it is hopeless to move for that. 2. And

               <p>I know what's necessary and just, but I know not what
men will grant; I am of your mind of those in possession,

better.</p>

               <p>But they say if nothing unlawful be imposed, it is disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to refuse it: And if disobedience be endured no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. Judge by what is said whether <hi>no Sin be imposed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Obedience to God being more necessary than to man,
all just Rulers should encourage a due fear of sin, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

3. God himself doth not silence, eject, or condemn men for
all disobedience, else none could be saved: All sin is disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to God. There is disobedience in small things as
well as in great; and of ignorance and infirmity, as well as
of malicious wilfulness: And what smaller matter can there
be than Humane Forms and Ceremonies? and where is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
more excuseable than in things so minute, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and hard, that they must all be wiser than you and
I that know them to be lawful? and what Unity will be in
that Church and Kingdom, that will endure none but such
as are wiser than you and I?</p>

               <p>8. Your <hi>8th.</hi> Article preventeth all the objections against Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters

what if the Rulers be Bishops or men that distaste your desired

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>We are not choosing Rulers (by the sword) but only
Pastors to guide us by God's word; and if we shall have bad
ones, we must patiently suffer; we cannot remedy such infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities.</p>

but to the Church.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Iudgment is as various as <hi>Execution, e. g.</hi> If one be a

whether and how he shall be <hi>Corporally Punished.</hi> 2. The
<hi>neighbour Churches</hi> are Judges whether they will owne his
Communion as approved. 3. His own <hi>Flock</hi> are <hi>discerning
Iudges,</hi> whether he be fit to be trusted and owned as their
Pastor, or to be forsaken by them.</p>
               <p>We must not imitate Papists in exempting Ministers from

               <p>9. I confess your Reasons against <hi>Constraining Infidels</hi>
to <hi>Profess Christianity</hi> are undeniable, and agree with the sence
of the Antient Church and Fathers; But the Papists, and many
Protestants hold that when once men are Baptized, they may be

               <p>What if they openly apostatize and turn <hi>Infidels, Iews,</hi>

the Lord's Supper?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>No, but they will put them to Death as they Burn Hereticks.</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:59333:130"/>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>That's their way, but not Christ's way. Why should
they put Apostates or Hereticks to death, any more than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
that never believed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Because they break their Covenant; and because they sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Laws which they consented to.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And doth not sinning against God's Law, In neither <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting</hi>
to nor <hi>Obeying</hi> it, deserve as bad? If God, by many years
Preaching, call one man to Christianity, and he derides it to
the last; and another took it up but by Education and the
Law of the Land, and never heard and understood the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of it, and turneth from it, being taken prisoner by the
<hi>Turks,</hi> which of these is the greater sinner? God binds them
to <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> that do not; and they sin against God's
<hi>Law,</hi> which is more than to break their own <hi>Covenant</hi> as
such: But both these deserve death and worse from God:
But if it were Christ's way, to have men put one of them to
death, I see not but why they should do so by the other.
Torment or Death is no fitter way to make an <hi>Apostate</hi> believe
than other <hi>Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's known that all the ancient Churches abhorred this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and punishing way. I have wondered at the Impudence
of <hi>Baronius, Binnius,</hi> and other Papists and justifie <hi>Martin</hi> for
separating from the Communion of the Bishops that were
for punishing the <hi>Priscillianists</hi> by the sword, and Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
him as a Saint, and condemn these Bishops for it, and
yet are for for more cruelties themselves, to far better men
than the <hi>Priscillianists.</hi> But where Fleshly interest is a mans
Religion, no wonder if it have neither consistency with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
nor Modesty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But if none but Volunteers be Christians or Communicants
most will despise the Church and it will be empty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>All that are fit to be there will come in: And those few will
give the Pastors more comfort and lesser trouble than the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the uncapable. If your purse be not quite full of Gold, will
you fill it up with dung or stones? The uncapable will do better
for themselves, and the Church among the <hi>Audientes</hi> or Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens.
It is their forcing in the uncapable, that hath corrupted
the Church, and deprived the Flock of their due privileges
(choosing their Pastors, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> because it's made up of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of them. And doubtless if you but countenance and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59333:131"/>
preferr the Communicants before the rest, it will draw in more
than are capable, without force.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>If the Excommunicate be no further punished, nor forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
the Church censures will be despised: How little will men care
for an Excommunication?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>This is commonly said, and much of it is true: But, 1. Can
you force men to Repent, or rather Lye? You make him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
that he brought himself into your hands and into suffering:
But that is not to Repent of Sin. Will you tell a man before hand,
<hi>If thou wilt but say thou repentest rather than lye in Gaol till death,
we will pronounce thee absolved and forgiven in Christ's Name?</hi>
Who can think ill enough of such an <hi>Absolution?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Do not they scorn Christ that say he hath advanced his
Church to the Dignity of Government, by putting into their
hands a Reed for a Scepter, and a Leaden Sword that will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without the Magistrate's Sword of Steel? Hath he set up
an useless mock-power in the Church?</p>
               <p>3. Did the Primitive-Churches for 300 years use any Sword
but Spiritual? Or did they find it so uneffectual and vain?</p>
               <p>4. Yea for some hundred years after there were Christian
Magistrates, did not the Church abhorr such a thing as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Excommunicate to repent by imprisonment or the
Sword?</p>
               <p>5. No man is meet to be a just Member that careth not for
a just Excommunication? And still this sheweth what a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
it is to force in the unmeet, that despise God's Ordinance
and the Church that they are in: And then God's Ordinance
must be debauched for their unfitness.</p>
               <p>6. The Sword doth the Keys much more hindrance than
help, when it is thus annexed to them; for then it cannot
be discerned whether Excommunication do any Good or none;
or whether it be only the <hi>Sword</hi> that doth the cure: And do not
they that profess Excommunication to be vain without the
Sword, teach men to call them as Church Governours <hi>Vain,</hi>
and to despise them? And is it not all one, as to say, if any
good be done by Church-Government, it is by the Magistrate's
Sword, and not by ours by the Keys?</p>
               <p>7. And is it not then ridiculous contradiction to dispute so
hard about Church-Power, and against the Presbyters claim,
when you confess that it is an useless shadow that you dispute
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59333:131"/>
for, and it's not <hi>it,</hi> but the Sword that doth the deed.</p>
               <p>8. Is it not an odious defacing of Princes and Magistrates, to
say, That they are bound to Imprison and Ruine a man as a meer
Lictor or Executioner of the Judgment of the Clergy, or of a
Chancellor, without ever hearing or trying his Cause; and
to punish him again because they punisht him before, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath not got their pardon?</p>
               <p>9. If Excommunication be grosly unjust (as against Christs
Members, for doing their duty, or for common humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity)
they do well that set by it no more than it deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
and pretend not to repent when they do not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
nor ought to repent.</p>

               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Though you call it no <hi>Punishment,</hi> to keep all the Non-Communicants
from publick power and trust, I think it will pass
for a notable Penalty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I grant them as much as I can, as knowing how little
they will yield to; and indeed it's my opinion that to deny
all Non-Communicants Magistracy and publick Trust, would
be to Reform the Common-Wealth in the Foundation, if the
Keys were but justly exercised: But then by this I exclude
none but the <hi>Intolerable,</hi> that Neither Communicate with the
<hi>Approved</hi> or the <hi>Tolerated Churches.</hi>

because they will do <hi>Wrong?</hi>

               <p>No, the Case is greatly different. Nature bindeth all
men to learn, that they may know what is good or evil to
themselves. Learning and Knowledge is the common Duty and
Interest of mankind; and though no man can be forced to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
and <hi>Repent;</hi> he that is forced to Hear, may hear that
which may make him <hi>Voluntarily</hi> Believe and Repent: You
must force your Children to Learn, but not to Communicate.
I told you that to give a man the Sacrament, is to give him
a seal'd Pardon and Gift of Christ and Life, which no unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

Learn.</p>
               <p>And this being only to those that are refusers of all Church-Communion,

they should grant the Communicants that small consequent Vote
of Consent or Dissent, that you pleaded for; but if they will not
do that, they should give them leave to go to another Parish, or to
choose a Tolerated Pastor whom they will maintain. But men are
so set on their own ways, that they banish all sense of others case,
and of what conduceth to the common good.</p>

wide a Toleration, that I doubt it will do little good. For, 1.
some will scruple some of the Subscriptions, or Oaths, which, you
grant, shall be imposed on them. 2. If all the Tolerated
must be responsible for their Doctrine and Ministration, it's two
to one, but the Rulers to whom they must give account, will be so
contrary to them, that they will have no peace or safety.</p>

               <p>How would you have these dangers and inconveniences
be avoided? An <hi>unlimitted Toleration</hi> of the <hi>Intolerable,</hi> is it
self <hi>Intolerable;</hi> and you can devise no safer limitation. The
engagements which they are to take, tell you the Terms of
Toleration; and if men will-Preach against those Terms, that
is, against the Christian Faith, or the Holy Scripture, or
their Allegiance to the King; or if they use their Meetings,
to destroy Love and Peace, they ought to be restrained; and
there are lower punishments than depriving them of their To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
which are for lower faults. 2. But if Rulers will
oppress, we cannot help that, and must not therefore be ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>

               <p>There are now these following sorts of known Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

here <hi>setled;</hi> but yet will also, occasionally join with other
Churches, as the <hi>French, Dutch, Lutheran,</hi> or some Non-Conformists.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>Pacifick Non-conformists,</hi> who at the King's Return,
Petitioned for Arch-Bishop <hi>Vsher's Model</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal
Government,</hi> and thankfully accepted the <hi>King's Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>

               <p>V. The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> (who are half <hi>Arminians,</hi> and half not).</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:59333:133"/>
VI. The <hi>Fifth-Monarchy</hi> Party (most of which are <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi>
also).</p>
               <p>VII. The <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Is the meaning, that all these are the guilty Rebels to be

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>If all, I doubt the King would lose no small part of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
But you know the Papists are not numbred with the Dissenters
or Conventiclers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Say you so? Do those that differ but about a Ceremony,
or Lay-mans use of the Keys, or the largeness and paucity of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
Churches, dissent more from you than the Papists, that
would bring King and Kingdom under a foreign Jurisdiction,
and introduce all the Mass and doctrinal corruptions of their
Church. Read Bishop <hi>Downham</hi>'s Catalogue of Popish Errours <hi>de
Anti-Christo,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Willet</hi>'s, <hi>Chamier</hi>'s, <hi>Iewell</hi>'s, or any such, and
judge.</p>
               <p>And do you think that the Mass is no <hi>Conventicle,</hi> or more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than the forbidden assemblies of Protestants?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Well, But it's <hi>Protestant-Dissenters</hi> that. I mean.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>So then; You would have <hi>Protestant-Dissenters</hi> rooted out,
and not <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Infidels?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>We would have those rooted out that were in the Plot, which the

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt but such a Plot as you describe deserveth the
extirpation of those that were guilty of it: But I pray you
compare not the innocency of <hi>Papists in their Principles,</hi> with the
<hi>Protestants:</hi> Or read Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi>'s and <hi>Hen. Fowlis</hi>'s Books,
and <hi>Prin</hi>'s History of Bishops Treasons, and judge as you see
cause. But it's none of my business now to accuse the <hi>Papists.</hi> Do
but grant that the innocent should not suffer for the crimes of the
guilty, and we are agreed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But is it not justly supposed that the whole <hi>Party</hi> is guilty of
those Principles which have caused particular mens rebellions; and
that it is their Preachers and Conventiclers that have caused all?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You that are a Lawyer should know somewhat of the
Rules of <hi>Iustice,</hi> or <hi>Humanity</hi> at least. Come on, and let you
and I consider soberly of the case.</p>
               <p>And first, to your face I challenge you to name and prove <hi>any
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59333:134"/>
the least difference</hi> between the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> who sought for
Concord at the King's Restoration, or the party of <hi>meer Non-Conformists,</hi>
and the <hi>Protestants of the Church of England,</hi> in their
<hi>Principles</hi> about the <hi>Power of Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Subjection</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi>
of the People. Name any difference if you can?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>You would make one believe that great Numbers are inhumanely
impudent, that charge them with such heinous difference, if there be none.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you not name the difference, if there be any?
Contrarily, 1. We all take the same <hi>Oaths of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. We Subscribe all the same <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> about the
<hi>Power of Magistrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. We have often professed our consent to all that is written
for Magistracy and Subjection in all the Scripture, in any <hi>General
Council</hi> (save what is for the Papal Tyranny over Princes and
People) or in any <hi>Confession of any Christian Church, Greek, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,</hi>
or <hi>Protestant,</hi> that ever we saw; and for all that (for the
Power of Kings, but not <hi>all against it)</hi> which the generality of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Historians, Philosophers, Politick-writers, Lawyers, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists,
or Divines, are for. And is not all this yet enough?</p>
               <p>4. I have oft told you where; <hi>e.g.</hi> Bishop <hi>Andrews in Tortura
Torti,</hi> Sir <hi>Fran. Bacon,</hi> Lord St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and many others, have
vindicated the principles of the <hi>English Non-conformists,</hi> as the
same with the Church's in point of Loyalty against the <hi>Papists</hi>
accusations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But do not you know who wrote the <hi>Political Aphorisms, or
Holy Common-wealth,</hi> condemned lately by the <hi>Oxford Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And do not you know, 1. That the Author had never
leave to confute his accusers about it?</p>
               <p>2. Do you not know that he hath divers years ago written a
large Book called his <hi>Second Plea for Peace,</hi> fully opening the
Principles which he and his Consenters hold; and no man hath

                  </gap> one word against any of them, that I hear of, to this day?
Is this fair dealing then to silence what at large he owneth, and
name only a writing 29 years ago, which he never was heard
about?</p>
               <p>3. Do you not know that the Famously Learned <hi>Tho. White</hi> a
<hi>Papist,</hi> wrote at the same time the like Doctrine, and will you
charge that on the <hi>Party of Papist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

4. The Historians Rule is <hi>Distingue de temporibus,</hi> Do you
know in what times that was written? And know you not that
few men then living wrote and spake more plainly against the
Usurpation than he did?</p>
               <p>5. And you see that the <hi>Oxford Convocation</hi> condemn the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and principles of the Doctors of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as
well as others? And as for <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Buchanan</hi> we are no more
guilty of their words than of <hi>Iewell</hi>'s, <hi>Bilson</hi>'s, <hi>Hooker</hi>'s, <hi>Laud</hi>'s, or
any such.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But if you differ not from the <hi>Church of England</hi> in Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Loyalty, why do you not take the <hi>Oxford-Oath</hi> in the Act of
Confinement, and the <hi>Subscription</hi> in the Act of Vniformity?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I have told you fully before: Not because we differ in
Doctrine, but in expounding the words of that Oath and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.</p>
               <p>2. Were neither Arch-bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> nor his Clergy, nor the
Parliaments of those times of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well as
<hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bthorp</hi> and <hi>Mainwaring?</hi> Were not the Laws made by those
Parliaments, made by the Members, if not Representatives of
the Church of <hi>England?</hi> You know that our late great Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Church, describe the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be <hi>those
that Worship God according to the Law:</hi> And were the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that made those Laws none of the Church themselves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chillingworth</hi> would not Subscribe without a limitting Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
Was he therefore none of the Church?</p>
               <p>Was Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> none of the Church? Was <hi>R. Hooker</hi>
none of the Church? The first dedicated his Book to Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the latter is Dedicated to our King <hi>Charles</hi> the
second, and Praised by his Father. And yet the Author of the
<hi>Holy Common-wealth</hi> hath larglier than any man confuted
<hi>Hooker</hi>'s <hi>Popular Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>William Barclay</hi> a Lawyer defended the King of <hi>France</hi>
his Temporal Power, against the Popes Usurpation of a Power
to depose and restrain him, he is fain to profess that the contrary
opinion was so common that he was taken to speak some strange
and singular thing. And yet none doubts but he was of the same
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I again challenge you to name that point in which we differ in
this Doctrine from the true Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>Not so much as the aforesaid Bishop and Doctors of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> did, or the Parliaments that made Church-Laws.
Again, See our <hi>second Plea for Peace;</hi> how far we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
it. I profess that I am acquainted with no meer Non-Conformist
Ministers, that hold it at all lawful for Subjects to
resist the King, or any Supream Power by a War; except in case
that he notoriously declareth that he will if he can destroy the
Common-wealth, or deliver it up to a foreigner or destroyer
that hath no right.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Sure the cry would never be for Extirpating the Dissenters, for
this Plot and their disloyalty, if they were not guilty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, if that be your argument <hi>[Strangers to them say they
are disloyal and guilty;</hi> ergo <hi>they are so]</hi> I leave you to God's
answer, for I will not undertake to answer you.</p>
               <p>But will you use Sobriety a little further?</p>
               <p>1. It is now twenty seven years since they were ejected and
cast out of maintenance and countenance, and left to beg or crave
their bread: Long have they been laid in Gaols, and fined deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Law laying on them twenty and forty pound a Sermon:
Their Goods, Beds, Books taken from them and they left desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute:
How many in all these years have ever been accused and
proved guilty of one disloyal or seditious Sermon or Word?
I know of none: Certainly it was not for want of will in the
Accusers. Those that by Oaths have brought them under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
and Warrants for distress of five, ten, and much more
forfeitures, even divers hundred pounds at once, before they
were ever summoned to speak for themselves; would sure have
sworn some disloyal Words against them, had they been able.
And can many hundred Ministers have a fuller proof of their
innocency, than that they had no such prosecution twenty seven
years from such a sort of Adversaries, in so great Sufferings?</p>
               <p>2. And now this Plot is detected, It is divers Months since,
and many Countries and Corporations have accused the <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
of it, and cry them down to Extirpation: And to this day
I cannot hear of any one <hi>English</hi> Minister (or at most not of
two) that is either an Episcopal or Presbyterian Non-Conformist,
so much as accused, or named as guilty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches in <hi>London</hi> are Dissenting
Presbyterians. Yet no man accuseth any of them for being in
Plots; and yet must they also be destroyed?</p>

But, Sir, if any one or more of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian
Non-Conformists, Ministers</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> had been found guilty, would
you condemn thousands (or any) of the guiltless for their
sakes? On what account: Is it for their Relation to them?
They are mostly strangers to one another. Come, and let us
try your rule of Justice.</p>
               <p>I. Is there any Relation nearer than that of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son?</hi>
And can any Minister be supposed to have more interest in, or
influence on his <hi>Hearers,</hi> than a <hi>Father</hi> hath on his <hi>Son?</hi> And
you know that the chief man accused is the <hi>Kings eldest Son:</hi>
I hope you will not for this, <hi>charge the King,</hi> as if he principled
him for Treason against himself: Nor as if he were to suffer
for his Sons faults.</p>
               <p>II. The Judges have oft declared that many <hi>Iesuits</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
were Plotters and Traitors, and they died for it. I hope
you will not make all <hi>Papists</hi> guilty of their crime, nor extirpate
them for it. And yet the <hi>Papists</hi> are Conventicling <hi>Dissenters</hi>
too.</p>
               <p>III. The Lords and great Men accused of this Plot and
Treason (how justly God knoweth) were of the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> and shall all the Church of <hi>England</hi> be destroyed for
their sakes?</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> and others now blamed by the <hi>Oxford</hi>-Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hocker, &amp;c.</hi> were of the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> and shall all the <hi>English</hi> Clergy be accused of their
words?</p>
               <p>IV. Many of the accused were <hi>Hobbists</hi> and Infidels, and
some common ill-living Protestants: Shall all the <hi>Hobbists,</hi> and
Infidels, and ill-living Protestants be extirpated for their
faults?</p>
               <p>V. Many Gentlemen of some late <hi>Parliaments</hi> are accused
(not yet tried, and proved guilty): Shall all the <hi>Parliament-men</hi>
therefore be extirpated as guilty?</p>
               <p>VI. Some <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Students</hi> at Law are accused: Shall
all <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Students</hi> therefore be extirpated?</p>
               <p>VII. Divers of the Nobility are accused: Must all Noble-men
be therefore reproached?</p>
               <p>VIII. Some that have been of the Kings Privy Council were
accused<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is his Council therefore to be disgraced or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:59333:136"/>
IX. Formerly many Judges have been guilty: Are Judges
therefore to be dishonoured?</p>
               <p>X. By this justice you may next conclude, They were <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
that were accused, therefore let all <hi>English-men</hi> be rooted
out: Or they were <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Christians;</hi> therefore away
with all <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Christians:</hi> Whereas I think it an unjust
conclusion, that because they were <hi>Irish-men</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> that
murdered two hundred thousand in <hi>Ireland,</hi> therefore root out
all <hi>Irish-men</hi> and <hi>Papists;</hi> unless you will inferr, <hi>They are men</hi>
that commit all sin; therefore root out mankind.</p>
               <p>If it had been men that <hi>hate serious Godliness,</hi> and are the seed
of the <hi>Serpent</hi> and of <hi>Cain,</hi> that are at deadly enmity to the true
fear of God, and thirst for the blood of the innocent, that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of this Plot; and if People had petitioned to have all this
sort of men rooted out for it, it would have fallen on more
than you and I are willing to name, or to have destroyed.</p>
               <p>But can you bear with me if I tell you truly and plainly what
this <hi>Extirpating motion</hi> of all called <hi>Dissenters</hi> and <hi>Conventiclers</hi>
signifieth, and what it tendeth to?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>I have had so much reason from you, as obligeth me to hear
what you can further say.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. The motion is so apparently from Satan, that it will
tempt those that are Christians indeed, and know the devil's
will and works, to take you for no other than his listed souldiers
against Christ, if you set your selves to do this work. <hi>Truth,
Love,</hi> and <hi>doing Good,</hi> are the Christian State and Life. <hi>Lying,
Hatred,</hi> and <hi>Hurtfulness,</hi> are Diabolism, or Satans work and
image. All the Art of prating and deceit of Clergy or Laity in
the World, will never so far blind true Christians, but that by
your <hi>Fruits they will know you.</hi> The pricks of <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Thistles</hi>
will be known from <hi>Grapes</hi> and <hi>Figs,</hi> in despight of all the craft
of Diabolists. And if Children know not a <hi>Wolf</hi> in <hi>Sheeps-cloathing,</hi>
they will know him that see him tear the <hi>Flock;</hi> yea, or
that see his bloody jaws.</p>
               <p>And are you willing to renounce Justice, Humanity and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and openly to profess Diabolism?</p>
               <p>Men will see how malignity greedily picks quarrels with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
innocent men, while it beareth or cherisheth the debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
ungodly, unconscionable rabble, whose God is their belly,
or the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:59333:136"/>
And methinks men, so proud that they cannot bear with any
that differ from their ignorant dictates, should scarce be willing
that History should list them among the <hi>Cainites</hi> or <hi>Diabolists.</hi>
any more than among man-eating Cannibals.</p>
               <p>II. You cannot extirpate or destroy all <hi>Dissenters,</hi> if you do
your worst. 1. So great a number will be true to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and suffer what ever you inflict on them, as will take
you up much time and trouble, and render you more odious to
the rest.</p>
               <p>2. The common People that were indifferent, will enquire
what these men have done, and will be turned from those that
afflict so many of the innocent; especially their neighbours, who
know them better by experience, than by your reports.</p>
               <p>3. Those that fill not Prisons, or die not as Martyrs, will but
<hi>Conceal</hi> their minds, and not change them. And they will then
be out of the reach of your hurting power: When they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with you, and give you no outward matter of accusation,
what can you do to them? Or what pretence can you find to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
them? The heart you know not: Their actions they
will keep out of the reach of the Law: If you try them by <hi>Oaths</hi>
or unjust Professions, by increasing the number of Sufferers, you
will increase your infamy and odium: And they that for fear
do swear against their Judgments, will hate you the more when
they feel their wounded Conscience smart.</p>
               <p>4. And if you force them into secrecy, they will there speak
more freely, and will Educate their Children into a hatred of
your ways. And if you could destroy them, two for one will
spring up as their successours.</p>
               <p>Who would have thought that the great <hi>French</hi> Massacre
should have rather increased than diminished the Protestants?
Or that Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s bone-fire should have extinguished Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery?
Or that the two hundred thousand murdered by the <hi>Irish</hi>
should but have hastned the overthrow and ruine of the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers?
In short, you cannot extirpate them.</p>
               <p>III. The more you attempt it, and the more you succeed,
the more you will do <hi>against your selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Is not the King more safe, and strong, and honourable, and
easy when he hath the Hearts of all his Subjects, than if he rule
a People by divisions and persecutions shattered like a broken
Glass, or living in prosecution or fear, and hatred of one another,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59333:137"/>
as if they were still in a state of hostility, and lived among their
dangerous enemies? If either Christ or Satan be to be believed, a
divided Kingdom in enmity cannot stand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks you argue against your self: For therefore it is that
we would have all Dissenters rooted out, because of the danger of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
by tolerated Dissenters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Had you read a Book called, <hi>The Samaritan,</hi> and another
called, <hi>The True and only Terms of Church-Concord,</hi> you would
need no further answer to that objection. If you would have all
of <hi>one mind and way,</hi> it must be in that which it is <hi>necessary</hi> and
<hi>possible</hi> for all men to agree in, and to make things <hi>unnecessary</hi> or
<hi>impossible</hi> your terms, is the certain way of pernicious division.
Will you extirpate all that dissent in Controversies of Law, of
<hi>Philosophy, Astronomy, Physick, Grammar;</hi> or that differ in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Constitution, Statute? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do you think that all will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in all the Mysteries of Divinity, while knowledge is so low
and rare? Yea, do you think that even in circumstances and
things doubtful, all good Christians will ever be so much of one
measure of knowledge as to agree? How happy are we if we all
agree in great, plain, necessary things? But to understand also
all little circumstances, and humane Orders and Phrases; which
be lawful, and which not, supposeth all Plow-men, Trades-men
and Work-men, to be far more perfect in the knowledge of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
than the most learned Philosophers are in Physicks,
who agree in little but a few principles, and things within the
reach of sense: When yet alas, we can scarce teach half the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
the meaning of the Creed, or Baptismal Covenant.</p>
               <p>If the King would extirpate all Lawyers, Physicians, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
who in a multitude of little and controverted points,
cannot tell which side is in the right; he may have so much the
more success in it, by how much the more men will be bold to
dissemble their opinions in matters of such a nature. But about
the matters of God and Salvation, Consciences will be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to stretch and dissemble. It's far less wise to take this
way, than for School-masters and Tutors to destroy or cast
out all Scholars and Pupils, that have not just the same degree
of knowledge.</p>
               <p>And at what age must this perfect knowledge begin, which
must extend to the most minute things that men will command?
At sixteen years of age you compel them, <hi>volentes, nolentes,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59333:137"/>
the Lords Supper; and do you think then that all at
sixteen years old, in <hi>England,</hi> should be presumed to know
more of the Lawfulness of all your impositions on them,
than I can reach to know at 68 (now near 74) after the long
and hard Study of my life? If you compel no more Men,
Lads or Women to Communicate, but such as really un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Lawfulness of all such Impositions, which I judge
unlawful, sure it will make a great change in your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Courts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>By this talk you seem to intimate, that the people must
not be constrained to obey in Circumstantials or Little things,
because they may to them be doubtful; and what worship of God
can you perform without such little Circumstances?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Little or Great, God in mercy hath made all <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
things intelligible and plain: It is the <hi>Vnnecessary</hi>
things that are most controvertible and doubtful. There
are many <hi>Circumstances</hi> that are so <hi>Necessary</hi> to actions, that
they cannot without them be performed; <hi>e. g.</hi> He that will
Preach, must open his mouth; he must speak audibly, he
must use a Language understood, he must have some capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Place, and convenient Time; Psalms must be sung in
some Tune, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> some Clothing, some posture of Body
must be used; and all men know that to choose these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the general Rules of Charity, Edification, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Decency, belongs to the Guides of the Assemblies.
And where do you see any great division about any such things
as these; except in cases of accidental scandal?</p>
               <p>And if any should be so childish or ignorant, as to think
it unlawful; <hi>e. g.</hi> to be <hi>Vncovered,</hi> or to <hi>Kneel at Prayer;</hi>
due Instruction, and gentle Rebuke may easily cure such
weakness, and is meeter than an extirpation. If any were
so silly that they scrupled; <hi>e. g.</hi> singing our Metre or
Tunes of <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms, but are only for the Cathedral
singing of the Prose; it's fitter to let them be <hi>silent,</hi> or
let them go only to Cathedrals, than to Excommunicate
or Destroy them; and if any be so weak, that they think
a <hi>Lawful Form</hi> or <hi>Gesture</hi> unlawful, it's fitter, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be convinced, to let them be silent, or Worship God
among themselves in another Form or Gesture, than to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
or Extirpate them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:59333:138"/>
But what are these easy intelligible Circumstances to all
the Ceremonies unnecessary even <hi>in genere?</hi> What are they
to the Vows of God-fathers without the Parents, or to the
dedicating Symbol of the Cross, or to adhering to a bare
Reader, when the next Parish hath an able Teacher whom the
ignorant have great need to be instructed by; to say no
more now of all the Oaths, Declarations, Subscriptions, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
and Professions required of Ministers? I again say
therefore, if you extirpate all Subjects that cannot unite with
you in all things required by the Rubricks and Canons, you
will wrong the King by weakning his Kingdom, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
him of more of his Subjects, than He or the Welfare
of the Land can spare.</p>
               <p>And you will keep the Kingdom in a state of division
(and like <hi>Antioch,</hi> that was so oft and terribly shaken by
Earthquakes, that it was in continual danger of ruine) and
even honest <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rajan</hi> lodging there, did hardly scape through
a window, while the falling houses kill'd his Souldiers.</p>
               <p>And the Dissenters are not all of one mind and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
All that are wise and good, will suffer patiently and
peaceably; for I incline to think, that the expositors mistake,
who apply <hi>Soloman</hi>'s words to <hi>Sufferers [Oppression maketh
Wise men mad];</hi> and that as some Criticks tell us, it rather
meaneth <hi>Rulers [that an affectation of an oppressing power, and
the exercise of it, maketh wise Rulers forget the very obvious
Reasons of Morality and Interest, and to act as men distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.]</hi>
But there be Dissenters of <hi>dangerous Principles,</hi> which
are fitter to be <hi>restrained,</hi> than by <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>speration</hi> to be <hi>enraged;</hi>
as hap is, the <hi>Behmenists</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> are <hi>against War,</hi> and
the <hi>old Anabaptists</hi> were so reported; but some of them
have shewed a contrary judgment; but it's known past doubt,
that the <hi>Papists</hi> are a sort of Dissenting Conventiclers, who
have so strong a back beyond Sea to encourage them, and
are so instructed by multitudes of learned Clergy-men and
Friars, and so taught by General Councils, which are their
very Religion, that many of them will think it merits Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to kill such Kings as would extirpate them.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> is deeply censured by some, for doing so much
as he did towards a Toleration, and for what the <hi>French</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Ambrun</hi> writes of him. But for my part I
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59333:138"/>
verily believe that he did it in fear to secure his life:
when Queen <hi>Eliza<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth</hi>'s death had been so oft attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and when two great Papist Kings of <hi>France,</hi> had been
murdered, because they were not zealous enough for
the Pope, and that so desperately by single men, that
did it to merit Heaven; and when he had so narrowly
escaped the horrid <hi>Gun-powd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r Plot,</hi> and when they still
told him that he should not escape; what wonder if he were
afraid?</p>
               <p>And so great confidence have the Papal Clergy, in this
terrifying of Kings as in constant danger of death, if they
be against their Church, that the Pope and his close Adherents
could never to this day be procured to disown the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and other Councils for Deposing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
Heretick Princes; no, nor to deny the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of killing such; yea, even in <hi>France, Perron</hi> himself,
their Learned Cardinal, so defends the Pope's power of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Kings that deserve it, that (in his <hi>Oration to the
States)</hi> he professeth, That, if it be not true, the Pope is Anti-Christ,
and the Church Anti-Christian that hath so long owned
and practised it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>You seem to intimate in all this that you would have the
Papists Tolerated, for fear least they should kill the King; and so
the worse that Men and their Principles are, the more they must
be Tolerated for fear of them: But who lived in greater safety
than Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> who supprest them, even when the Pope had
Excommunicated her?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I would have the King and Kingdom (Church
and State) secured from a <hi>Foreign Iurisdiction,</hi> of <hi>Pope</hi>
or <hi>Prelates;</hi> and to that end, I would have <hi>Papists kept out</hi>
of <hi>Government, Civil, Military, or Ecclesiastick;</hi> and I would
wish that the King. 1. By the <hi>Vnity of his Subjects;</hi> 2. By
<hi>Navies</hi> and <hi>Military provision;</hi> 3. And by just <hi>Confederacies</hi>
abroad, be still so strong as not to fear the force of Foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and these things being secured, without fear of any
mens censure, I say,</p>
               <p>1. That I would have all <hi>Men</hi> used as <hi>Men,</hi> and all <hi>Peaceable-men</hi>
as <hi>Peaceable,</hi> be they what they will.</p>
               <p>2. I would have <hi>no hurt done to any Papist for his Religion,</hi> but
<hi>Defensive;</hi> that is, such as is necessary to the forsaid Ends, <hi>viz.</hi> to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59333:139"/>
save King and Kingdom from a foreign Jurisdiction, and from
Invasion, and to save the Souls of the People, from subversion by
unreasonable liberty of Seducers.</p>
               <p>3. I would not have punishments <hi>excessive,</hi> that shall drive
multitudes into desperation: Lest undone desperate men be
carried to Revenge, or to think Treason lawful, when they
can no otherwise be saved from death and ruine.</p>
               <p>Man hath not a despotical power over all passion: And
some passions do almost necessitate errour of Judgment, or
else sudden Action against Judgment. Take the most meek
conscientious man, that knoweth the evil of Revenge, and
try his patience by buffetting him, and it's two to one, but
passion will make him strike you again. Much more if you
buffet him twenty year every day, patience may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
at last: There is scarce any Creature, Beast, Bird,
or Venmin, but will use all the resistance it can in case of
hurt and fear of death. The Devil could say, <hi>Skin for skin,
and all that a Man hath will he give for his Life.</hi> And can
you think that Prince or Kingdom is in safety, that shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
to destruction so great a number and of such quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as are all the <hi>Papists, Infidels, Iews, Anabaptists, Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
Independants, Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Episcopal Non-conformists,</hi>
as are in <hi>England?</hi> Though I think the latter sort would
suffer death rather than be disloyal; I am sure Rulers and
Adversaries think not so, who accuse them of intolerable
disloyalty. And they that think so ill of them will expect
ill at their hands.</p>
               <p>It's true, that the worse men are and their principles, the
more need there is of suppressing them. But destroying them
is the chief means that I know to increase their principles
of resistance. It's ordinary with men that never suffered, to
detest resisting Governours; and to change their opinions
when they think they are implacably h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mted to destruction
without desert or any remedy. Draw your Sword upon them,
even on a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and it's two to one you will change his
judgment, and make him think that self-defence is lawful.
Yea, if you could kill all that think resistance lawful, (if it be
half the Kingdom) it's the likliest way to make all the rest
that survive of the same mind, because of the inhumanity of
the Execution. I have met with few that thought that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59333:139"/>
at the <hi>French</hi> Massacre on <hi>Bartholomew-day,</hi> or at the
greater in <hi>Ireland,</hi> had been unlawful, whoever commanded
them.</p>
               <p>Yea, the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of a <hi>Holy War</hi> against the <hi>Turks,</hi> and of a <hi>War
with Spain;</hi> thought that their barbarous Cruelties (though
the <hi>Turks</hi> give <hi>Liberty of Conscience)</hi> allow other Princes to
War upon them to vindicate mankind, the World being one
Kingdom of God in which every man oweth charity and
due help to others; which is honoured in <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> when
he relieved the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour of another Religion against
<hi>Bajazet</hi> that was of his own, and this in meer Humanity and
Charity.</p>
               <p>I meddle not with the case of the lawfulness of such actions.
But I say, All the World cannot devise a more effectual way,
to make all men think that <hi>Self-defence</hi> is <hi>Lawful,</hi> than by great
cruelty against multitudes to make it seem <hi>necessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if you will cure it by <hi>forced Oaths,</hi> I heartily wish the
King better security for his Life, and the Kingdom for its
Peace, than mens conscientious keeping of those Oaths will
be, unless conscience and patience were more universal and
powerful than they are, and would make all sorts of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi>
choose Martyrdom, rather than defensive resistance.</p>
               <p>And as for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Case, her Dangers were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
her Advantages were great, her Executions for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were so few, that the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> and many other say,
none suffered for any thing but Treasons or such crimes:
And God did wonderfully preserve her.</p>
               <p>But to say no more of the Papists whose case quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
from all the rest, if you will make many Laws about
doubtful words, and forms and ceremonies, and then extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
all sober, godly, peaceable Subjects, that for fear of
sinning against God dare not obey them, what do you but
mince and pulverize the Nation, and dissolve its consisting
and strength, and make it a Cock-pit, or a Prey to the
cloven-footed deceiver and divider.</p>
               <p>The Non-conformists in <hi>England</hi> lived quietly till the
<hi>Canons</hi> were made for their prosecution. The great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours
of State, (Sir <hi>Nic. Bacon, Throgmorton,</hi> Sir <hi>Amias
Paulet,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Knowles,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59333:140"/>
Walsingham,</hi> Secretary <hi>Beale, &amp;c.</hi> except <hi>Hatton</hi> and <hi>Whitgift,</hi>
were for lenity; yea for such abatements as might have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Unity: And Sir <hi>William Cecil,</hi> Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> (though
for Episcopacy) almost fell out with Arch bishop <hi>Whitgift</hi>
for his hard usage of the Non-conformists. And were all
these fools, and you only the wise men? But when <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft,</hi>
lest they should increase, would ruine them, and the
Canons were made, which <hi>ipso facto</hi> Excommunicated all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Land, high or low, that did but affirm that any
thing in their Liturgy, Articles, Ceremonies, Ordination, or
Church offices (from the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> to the <hi>Apparitor)</hi> was
repugnant to the Word of God, the Church and Kingdom
presently felt that <hi>solutionem continui</hi> which these tearing racks
had made: And when all must be ejected and silenced that
durst not subscribe that <hi>[There is nothing in the Liturgy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Word of God]</hi> (which I would not say of the
Bible it self as in any one translation) then our over-zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Uniters tore all to pieces, and the shreds could never
to this day be well set together to make one piece.</p>
               <p>Yea all the <hi>Parliaments of England</hi> have still been striving
to restore the Concord of <hi>Protestants</hi> by laying bye some of
these dividing, tearing Engines: But <hi>Whitgift</hi> (though too
great an <hi>Anti-Arminian)</hi> and <hi>Hatton, &amp;c.</hi> prevailed still with
the Queen to prohibit them; and they were loth to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
her, having had so great a deliverance from Popery
and Persecution by her Reign. The Lord <hi>Verulam (Bacon)</hi>
tells us of a Reforming Act in which himself had a hand, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
in the Parliament, but prohibited by the Queen.</p>
               <p>And if any Kings (who should no more divide from their
Kingdom Real or Representative, than the Husband from the
Wife, that I say not, Than the Head from the Body)
should so far misunderstand their own and Peoples interest, as
to be jealous of Parliaments as their enemies; and if wise
Kings desire to keep the Nobility from being (as <hi>Henry
4th. Richard Nevill</hi> and others have been) too strong for
their Sovereigns, they cannot more cross their own ends, and
serve the ambitious designs of these men, than by afflicting
a great, a sober, and a religious part of the Kingdom, whom
these seditious men will be still serving themselves upon, by
pretending to head them for their deliverance; as many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59333:140"/>
Nobles did in <hi>France.</hi> It's a great encouragement to
rebellious great ones when they have always hope that a
great body of distressed men, will be ready, as necessitated for
self-defence, to accept of their offers for insurrections or at
least to strengthen faction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>It is for all these very reasons that we would destroy or
extirpate all Dissenters, that they may not be the serviceable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
in such designs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>For all these reasons, you should unite on the terms
that Christ and his Apostles instituted as sufficient for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Love, Communion and Concord, that there may be no
distressed, exasperated Dissenters among us; or only so few
and culpable by the grossness of their errours, as that their
shame and paucity may reader them no way dangerous.
You should not take such men of extraordinary wisdom, as
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 's Councellours and Parliaments, the Lord
<hi>Bacon,</hi> Judge <hi>Hale,</hi> and such pacificators as <hi>Davenant, Hall,
Chillingworth, Abbot, Grindal, Amycald,</hi> and most of the <hi>French,
Dutch, German</hi> Protestants, to be all fools, and you to be
wise Men. A Council in <hi>Bedlam</hi> could scarce advise a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
way to root out faction, than to make Canons or Laws,
that all the Kings Subjects shall be extirpated, that will not
subscribe, There is not one word in all the <hi>Statute Book,</hi> or
the most Learned <hi>Law-Books</hi> contrary to the Word of God;
and that the <hi>London Dispensatory</hi> hath no errour in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine;
and that no Licensed Book hath any errour in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
Verily, if the Bishops and Clergy of <hi>England</hi> cannot
give us better proofs of their infallibility, or that their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
imposed Books are as free from errours as <hi>Adam</hi> was
before his fall, than by making all subscribe, or swear, or
declare in the Church that <hi>it is so,</hi> cowards may say, <hi>your
Lordships and Reverences have never an erroneous word,</hi> but few
men will believe it ever the more; yea it will be the <hi>less
believed,</hi> that needeth such a proof as this: Even as men
would take him to be never the more an unerring Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
Lawyer or Physician, who could force all the appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
boys and women in the Town, to swear that he is
such.</p>
               <p>Try first to make all the Kings Subjects of one opinion in
all points of Learning, Law or Trading, and of one degree
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59333:141"/>
of wit, and of stature and complexion, and then hope to
make them all of one measure of understanding, not only in
the substance of Religion, but in all the little things that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
call indifferent, and do or may impose.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>But you run upon the Errour that all must have so great
knowledge according to our rules, as to know the Lawfulness of
all Lawful things: We know no Church-men reach so high:
But the way to Concord must be by obeying the Church in all
cases that are doubtful to the Subjects.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>1. It's well that you limit it to <hi>doubtful cases:</hi> But
what if I am past all doubt <hi>(e. g.)</hi> that it is a sin to
make our sort of God-fathers the vowing Covenanters in
Baptism, excluding the Parents, to cast out all from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Communion that scruple kneeling in the reception, to
deny Christendom to all that refuse our God-fathers and
Crossings, to pronounce all in <hi>England</hi> at Burial saved, except
the unbaptized, excommunicate and self-murderers, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that <hi>[It is certain by the word of God that Infants</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
none) <hi>baptized and dying before actual sin, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
saved; To assent to a false rule</hi> to know <hi>Easter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day]</hi>
with many such: What must I do in such <hi>undoubted
cases?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Tell us plainly, Is it <hi>all doubted cases</hi> or <hi>some</hi> only, in
which you say we must obey? If not all, till you tell us
which, and how to know them, you talk in vain. If all,
what if men doubt whether Polygamy, Lying, Fornication,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> be lawful? Or what if a Papist doubt whether King-killing
be lawful, and the Clergy command it, must it
therefore needs be done?</p>
               <p>3. And I pray you tell us <hi>where</hi> and <hi>when</hi> it is that men must
obey this rule? Was it a duty in <hi>England</hi> in the days of
<hi>Thomas Becket, Anselm, Dunstan, &amp;c.</hi> or in the Reign of all
the Kings that were Papists? Is it a duty now in <hi>France, Spain,
Italy, Bavaria, Austria, &amp;c.</hi> or in the Dominion of the <hi>Turks,
Persians, Tartarians, China, &amp;c?</hi> Must all Subjects every
where do all commanded them? If they have but ignorance
enough to be in doubt themselves, sure they are bound to
receive God's Light to overcome those doubts, and in errour
it is not obedience in Evil, but seeking truth till they find
it, that is their duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:59333:141"/>
But If you limit this Rule to Christians, is it to all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?</hi>
If to <hi>Orthodox Rulers,</hi> are the Subjects any fitter to
judge whether their Kings and Bishops are Orthodox or not,
than whether the things imposed be good or bad? If you
dare say, That all Subjects are bound to be of the Religion
which their Kings or Bishops say is right, speak out and you
will need no confutation.</p>
               <p>It's granted by all sober men, that as Rulers have the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of publick decision, so every reasonable man must judge
by <hi>private discerning</hi> whether his Actions be agreeable to God's
Commands or not. It is not Brutes and Infants, but Men that
have the use of reason, that Kings and Bishops rule.</p>
               <p>4. But if you are stiff in the contrary opinion, that all
men must implicitely believe the King and Prelates, in all that
ignorance can but make them doubtful of, I hope you have more
brains than once to dream, that ever you shall bring all the
Kingdom to unite in this opinion, and to lay by their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and confess themselves Ideots or Brutes, that must not
labour to know whether they keep or break God's Supream
Law; or if you must rule men on these terms, you must keep
them in fetters, and not at liberty.</p>
               <p>And I pray you dishonour not the King so much, as to
make him a King of Beasts and Ideots, and not of Men
or Christians; or at least expose him not so much to the
Power of Usurpers, as to say that his Subjects are not the
<hi>Discerning Iudges,</hi> who is their True and <hi>Lawful</hi> Soveraign,
and who <hi>not;</hi> and if they must judge whether all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be agreeable to the <hi>Kings Laws</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> lest they be hang'd
or punished; allow them also to judge whether or no they
be agreeable to God's Law, lest they be damned.</p>
               <p>If men once believe that God is not their Supream Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
no wonder if they believe that Kings have no Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
right, nor any are bound in conscience to obey them;
for who can <hi>give Governing Authority,</hi> or who can <hi>bind Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
to obey it, but the absolute Soveraign, the Almighty
God?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Experience confuteth all that you have said; what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

               <p>It seems you know not what you say. 1. The <hi>Pope,</hi>
and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> allow greater differences, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees than those that you condemn Dissenters for; their
<hi>Iesuits,</hi> and <hi>Dominicans, Thomists, Scotists, Nominals, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randists,</hi>
&amp;c. differ so much from each others in Doctrinals,
about God, and Grace, and Free-will, and Providence, and
the Cause of Sin, and many other Points, that the Volumes
they have written for their several Opinions, make up huge
Libraries, which employ the hard studies of the most Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men in the World, and are as far as ever from being
ended.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Iansenists</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> differ, not only in such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
about Predestination, Redemption, Grace, Free-will,
Perseverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but also about abundance of Doctrines,
commonly called Moral; as about Murder, Perjury, Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
Stealing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you may see in the Books lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by the <hi>Iansenists</hi> against the <hi>Iesuits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though approved general Councils, have made the
doctrine of Deposing Excommunicated Princes, and Absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their Subjects from their Allegiance, and giving their
Dominions to others, to be a very part of their Religion,
yet are not the Papists agreed in it; but the <hi>Germans</hi> in the
days of the Emperours, <hi>Frederick, Otho, Henry 4th,</hi> and <hi>5th,
&amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> to this day are much against it. And
what Learned men wrote against it, read but <hi>Mich. Golda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
his many Volumes of Collections, and you may see.</p>
               <p>Yea, the Papists are not agreed of the very essential Form
and Constitution of their Church, and therefore are indeed
of several Churches: One Party thinks that the supremacy
is in the Pope, another that it is in a General-Council, and a
third that it is in the Pope and General-Council agreeing;
and yet all these so far bear with one another, as to cover over
the difference with the <hi>Name</hi> of one <hi>Church,</hi> and to repute
each other as True Roman Catholicks.</p>
               <p>Yea more, it is, by an <hi>Allowance</hi> of Dissenters, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ways of Worship, that the Pope doth chiefly keep up
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Kingdom. When any Religious people have fallen into a
dissatisfaction with the loose Discipline and Conversation of the
Bishops and their Churches, the Pope alloweth them to set
up by themselves, and exercise a stricter Discipline, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59333:142"/>
and Conversation of their own devising, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
and no Bishop shall have power to impeach. And
thus he keepeth them in dependance on himself, as the only
Defender of their humours, inventions and liberties of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ways.</p>
               <p>On such accounts, there are multitudes of Sects among them
under the name of <hi>Friars,</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Sisters,</hi> &amp;c. The
<hi>Benedictines, Augustinians, Dominicans, Franciscans, Iesuits,
Carthusians,</hi> &amp;c. And all have their several ways of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
but it sufficeth, that all depend upon one Pope.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> it self, <hi>Philip Nerius</hi> being a Serious Religious
man, was unsatisfied with the dead formal way of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Mass-priests; and to bring men to knowledge and
seriousness in Religion he borrowed a Church, and set up
a Lecture or Course of Serious Extemporate Worship, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
like the exercise called Prophecying, that Arch-Bishop
<hi>Grindal</hi> was for, and the Lord St. <hi>Albans (Bacon)</hi> writes for.
Four Zealous men spent the whole day, one in Extemporate
praying, and one in Preaching and Expounding Scripture,
and one in telling the people the History of the Church,
and the Lives and Miracles of Saints, and one in Praying
again, just like those here hated as extemporate Puritans.
The Bishops said they were proud hypocrites that drew crowds
of people after them for reputation of sanctity; and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
<hi>Nerius,</hi> and accused them to the Pope, and silenced
him: The silencing Bishop was presently struck with death,
and <hi>Nerius</hi> went on, <hi>Baronius</hi> being his second. The crafty
Pope, instead of calling them Fanatick Rognes and Rebels,
thinks it policy to turn this stream of Pious Zeal into his
own channel, to drive his own Mill; and he rescueth them
from the Prelates, and alloweth their Exercises, and calleth
them by the name of the <hi>Oratorians,</hi> and honoureth the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
so that he drew them to depend on him, and <hi>Baronius</hi>
to write those many great Volumes of Ecclesiastical History,
which have done <hi>Rome</hi> greater service than any one Writer
that I know of in the world; and to this day the <hi>Oratorians</hi>
are the most sober Puritan Papists.</p>
               <p>Thus did he make use of the <hi>Sectarian</hi> singularity of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius
Loyola,</hi> a Souldier turned to Superstition, allowing them
(as others) to set up by themselves from under the power of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59333:143"/>
the Bishops, in dependance on the Pope alone, whereby he
hath mastered Emperours, and Kings, and Kingdoms, and made
great attempts on <hi>Abbassines, Greeks,</hi> yea on <hi>Congo, Iapan, China,</hi>
and the <hi>Heathen</hi> World.</p>
               <p>And I have credibly heard that Dr. <hi>Tho. Goodwin, Philip
Nye,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> the Leaders of our <hi>Independants,</hi> did tell
the King, that as the Pope allowed these orders of Religious
parties in meer dependance on himself, without subjection
to the Bishops, all that they desired was (not to be the
masters of others,) but to hold their own liberty of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Discipline, in sole dependance on the King, as the
<hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches do, so they may be saved from
the Bishops and Ecclesiastical Courts.</p>
               <p>2. But further, Do you forget that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by their
sacred Cruelty and Inquisition have lost the <hi>Low, Countries,</hi>
and had almost lost the seventeen <hi>Provinces?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And do you not know that ever since the days that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Gothes</hi> possessed <hi>Spain,</hi> they have been like <hi>Ireland,</hi> a blind
superstitious People, whose Ignorance most fitteth them for such
a kind of Concord? And is there not a Concord in their way
among the enslaved ignorant <hi>Muscovites,</hi> and among the <hi>Turks,</hi>
and many <hi>Heathens?</hi> Satan himself is against the dividing
of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>4. And do you think that the effect of <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Tyranny and Concord, doth answer the cost? The Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of their Inquisition hath made their names as odious as
of Cannibals or Wolves, insomuch that the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> thought
that an Invasive War against them as the enemies of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that violate the Laws of Nature and Nations, was just.</p>
               <p>And the many millions that they most cruelly murdered,
and tormented in <hi>Mexico, Peru, Hispaniola, &amp;c.</hi> (among whom
were divers Kings) do tell the World what are the fruits
of their Catholick fury, and Arbitrary Government: Their
Arch-bishop <hi>Barth. de Casa</hi> and their Jesuit <hi>Ioseph. Acosta,</hi>
eye witnesses of undoubted credit, report that which renders
them liker devils than men. And <hi>Gage</hi> that lived there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, seconds it.</p>
               <p>And it was no small infamy to their King <hi>Philip</hi> that he
put to death his Son and Heir <hi>Charles.</hi> Are these the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
that you would have us imitate?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:59333:143"/>
And as for <hi>Italy,</hi> 1. Read of all their Histories, and then
name that Country on earth, if you can, that for many Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
hath been infested with so much Civil War and Blood,
as <hi>Italy</hi> hath been, yea <hi>Rome</hi> it self. 2. And since policy hath
setled it of late in Peace, what a Peace is it, and of what effect?
It is said by travellers that no Country more aboundeth with
<hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> that are indeed of no Religion. And
truly, if it be God and Conscience that you would have banished
out of <hi>England,</hi> and Infidelity, Sadduceism, Hobbists, Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Drunkenness, Whoredom, Perjury, that you would have
take the place, I dare say that the Devil will not fight against
such Concord, but will promote it withal his policy and power,
by himself and all his agents Ecclesiastical, Civil, and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
               <p>4. Yet further, Why look you not on all the rest of the
World, as well as <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy?</hi> Indeed <hi>Iapan</hi> restored Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
but it was by so devilish and cruel Torments of Christians
and those that would not accuse them, as rendreth their names
odious to mankind (of which <hi>Varenius</hi> will satisfy you.)</p>
               <p>But what <hi>France,</hi> what <hi>Ireland</hi> and others have got by cruelty,
I have told you before.</p>
               <p>And though I am far from justifying the <hi>Hungarians</hi> (men
that I know not or their case) for flying to the <hi>Turks</hi> for help,
do you think that the Countries now ruined by War, and the
many thousands in <hi>Austria, Silesia, Moravia,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi>
killed and taken Captives, and the thousands killed in Fight, and
the Famine that the next year is like to come on the ruined
Countries, where Corn and Hay are all destroyed, and the
bloody War that is yet like to follow before the end; I say,
do you think that all these are not a dear price to be paid, for
<hi>hindering men to Worship God only according to the Scripture?</hi>
Would leave to serve God only as Christ and his Apostles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and did themselves, have cost the Emperour and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
dearer than all this amounteth to?</p>
               <p>5. And the World knoweth that (as <hi>Cromwel</hi> got his strength
and usurpation in <hi>England</hi> by his Liberty of Conscience, so) the
<hi>Turks</hi> won <hi>Constantinople</hi> and the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire, much by this.
For when their Emperours were become dissolute or cruel, kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and deposing one another, putting out their eyes, and thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them into Monasteries (forced Saints); and when ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59333:144"/>
ungodly Bishops were still striving for superiority, and
persecuting Dissenters as not Orthodox, and mutinous Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
pulling down Emperours, and setting up others, the poor
Christians thought that to defend such a Government against
the <hi>Turks</hi> that gave all men the Liberty of their own Religion,
would cost them dearer than it was worth; and so were the more
remiss in their resistance, and the easilier yielded to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
Whereas had the <hi>Turks</hi> done as the <hi>Papists,</hi> who make
our extermination by our own Rulers, a very part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the <hi>Greeks</hi> would have more resolutely resisted them, in
necessary self-defence.</p>
               <p>And did not the <hi>Turks</hi> still give Liberty to Christians (only
restraining them from speaking against <hi>Mahometism)</hi> do you
think that the <hi>Greeks</hi> in all their Dominions would no more
strive for their deliverance? And that <hi>Transilvania, Hungary,
Walachia, Maldavia, Croates,</hi> and <hi>Cossacks, Armenians, Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,
Circassians, Mengrelians, Nestorians,</hi> and <hi>Iacobites,</hi> in so
vast numbers, would live so long quietly and patiently under
them as they do?</p>
               <p>All the great Conquerours of the World that are famous in
History, ever observed that sober policy, to let <hi>Conquered Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
enjoy their own Religion, and mostly their own ancient Laws and
inferiour Magistrates:</hi> And then the People find the change so
tolerable in the Supremacy, as they the more easily yield, with
less resistance, and continue their subjection with the greater
quietness and peace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> in Christ's time, (and till they rebelled afterwards
under <hi>Vespasian, Titus</hi> and <hi>Adrian)</hi> had so much of their own
Religion and Law allowed them, as was no small cause of their
Crucifying Christ, lest the name of a King sent from God (such
as they expected the <hi>Messiah</hi> to be) should draw the People to such
Insurrections, as should provoke the <hi>Romans</hi> to deprive them of
their Temples, Religion and Laws, and to destroy their place
and nation.</p>
               <p>And I hear by travellers that where the <hi>Turks</hi> yet allow their
Provinces (as in <hi>Transilvania)</hi> their own Magistrates and Laws,
Religion prospereth almost as well as under Christian Sovereigns,
and far better than under the extirpating zeal, or rather fury of
persecuting <hi>Papist</hi> Princes. I desire you therefore before you
plead experience for your desolating way of Concord, to study
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59333:144"/>
History better, and be better informed of the case of the
World.</p>
               <p>When I think but what men Bishop <hi>Wilkins</hi> and Judge <hi>Hale</hi>
were, that on my knowledge drew up an Act for the total cure
of our <hi>English</hi> Church differences, (to which those called to it
by the Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgman,</hi> did on both sides consent) I
have thought it some defect of humility in some Clergy-men,
that took themselves to be so much wiser than these rare and
excellent men, as to judge that all our distractions, sufferings, and
dangers by divisions, are not so bad as the effect of these mens
counsil would have been.</p>
               <p>But I do with greater confidence ask you, Whether those men
seem to be serious and understanding Christians, who think all the
bloody Wars, and tormenting Inquisition, and the destruction of
Love and Justice, and good Works, which are caused by Church-divisions
in the World, to be a less Mischief than it would be to

               <hi>GOD IS LOVE, AND HE THAT DWELLETH IN
LOVE DWELLETH IN GOD, AND GOD IN HIM,
Iohn</hi> 4. 16. The most fundamental and comprehensive Article
of Natural and Evangelical Religion.</p>
            <p>How Angels fell from Love and became Devils, malignant
Spirits, is not revealed fully to us; but that such there are,
both Scripture and too great Experience certify us. But how
Man fell, is told us in the Scripture. It pleased God to make
a rank of intellectual Animals left to their understanding,
self-determining free-will, between the Brutes which are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to things Sensible, and the confirmed. Angels who are
determined to things Spiritual. It pleased him to oblige and
allure Man by his Blessings, to live still in the love of God; but
withal to permit the malignant Tempter, to try whether by
his allurement and deceit, he could win him from this Holy
Love: As if a man should leave his Daughter to be his Wife,
who could win her own consent. The malignant Spirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
and turned man from the Reigning Love of God, to the
Love of <hi>SELF,</hi> Self-pleasing, Self-ruling, and Self-trusting;
and having won man's <hi>Will,</hi> he is by just permission become
his Prince, as long as he can keep the <hi>Will</hi> which he hath won.
But <hi>Infinite LOVE,</hi> first promised, and then gave his <hi>SON</hi>
to be the <hi>PRINCE OF LOVE,</hi> and so the Captain of our
Salvation; His Incarnation, Doctrine, Life, and Suffering;
his Resurrection, Ascension, Intercession and Government, are
but the works of <hi>LOVE</hi> for Man's Salvation, which is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59333:146"/>
the <hi>Will</hi> of Man to the Reigning Love of God, from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sensual self-love. A war is thus commenced between <hi>Christ</hi>
and <hi>Satan;</hi> Christ's warfare is to Conquer malignant <hi>Enmity,</hi>
and set up a Kingdom of Love. The Devils work is to assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate
man to himself, and to make him a <hi>Lyer, Malicious,</hi> and
a <hi>Destroyer.</hi> Thus two Kingdoms are set up in this World,
which are in continual war against each other. The Subjects of
each are discernible by their works: <hi>TRVTH, LOVE,</hi> and <hi>DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING
GOOD</hi> are the works and marks of the one; and <hi>LYING,
HATRED</hi> and <hi>HVRTFVLNESS,</hi> are the works and marks
of the other; and <hi>HOLINESS</hi> and <hi>DEVILISM</hi> constitute
this world. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were the leading instances: <hi>Heb.
11. 4. By faith Abel offered a more excellent Sacrifice unto God
than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was Righteous,
God testifying of his gifts; and by it, he being dead, yet speaketh.</hi> He
conquered, but died, as did our Saviour, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 12, 14. Cain
was of that wicked one, and slew his Brother; And why slew he him?
Because his own works were Evil, and his brothers Righteous:</hi> In
this warfare we must live and die. <hi>Marvel not my Brethren if
the world hate you;</hi> though we die as <hi>Abel, we know that we have
passed from Death to Life, because we Love the Brethren: He that
loveth not his brother, abideth in death,</hi> though as <hi>Cain,</hi> he kill
and seem to conquer. All that believe not a better life, which
will abundantly make up the loss of this, are his subjects who is
called the <hi>GOD OF THIS WORLD,</hi> who blindeth the minds
of unbelievers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Devils are called, <hi>The Rulers of
the Darkness of this world, Eph.</hi> 6. 12. The Princes who set up
a Worldly interest, against or above the Heavenly interest, are
called, <hi>The Princes of this world, that come to nought, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 6.
And to be Wise only for an interest, is, <hi>The Wisdom of the
world, which is Foolishness with God,</hi> 3. 18, 10. Thus Christ
fighteth by <hi>Love,</hi> to win Souls to <hi>Love</hi> for the Glorious World
of Love; and the Devil by Malice to <hi>destroy Love</hi> and <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
them from the God and World of Love, by fighting as
Dogs about their Carrion, for their fleshly interest in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
world; but the time is short, and the War will be short,
but the Victory sweet, and the Crown everlasting.</p>
            <p>And it is greatly to be considered, that as Christ's <hi>Cause</hi> &amp; <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
are contrary to the <hi>Devils,</hi> so also is his manner of <hi>Fight</hi> and
<hi>Conquest.</hi> Christ and Christians fight not by <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:59333:146"/>
against their <hi>Haters,</hi> but by loving them as Men (and praying
for them, even when they suffer by them:) And in this course it
is, that they <hi>are more than Conquerours,</hi> Rom. 8. 37. <hi>And heap
Coals of Fire on their Heads, which will burn them for ever that would
not on Earth be melted by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seemeth a strange thing to us to see the poor. <hi>French-men</hi>
come hither from their own pleasant Land, in Raggs and Bodily
Distress: And who expelleth them? And for what? Who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all the blood and banishments that have been exercised on
Christians, since the Heathen Persecutions? And for what? Who
destroyed those many thousands of Christians called <hi>Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
and <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and <hi>Bohemians,</hi> in History mentioned? And
for what? Who set up the Inquisition as against <hi>Protestants,</hi>
and Tormented and Burnt so many? And for what? Who
caused the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> and other Massacres and Murders?
And for what? Who keep out Truth and Reformation from all
Kingdoms subject to the Pope? It is men in the Sacred Offices,
Ecclesiastical and Civil. We all own Reverence to Magistrates
and Pastors. Satan is not so foolish as to do his work in his own
name, nor to put its proper name upon his work. Did you ever
hear or read of Persecutors, who openly said, <hi>[We are the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the Devil, and come against you for his Interest and in his
Name, to perswade or persecute you from Christ and your obedience to
God, and your Salvation?]</hi> No, It is as for wickedness, that
wicked men destroy the just; and as for sinning that they
persecute them that will not sin: It is for Religion that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is impugned; and for the Church that the true Children
of the Church are Persecuted: And is it for the Gospel that the
Preachers of it are silenced and destroyed? Without the Church
a false Religion is set up against Christianity. But within it,
an Image of Christ, and of the Church, and of Concord, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is set up against <hi>Christ, Church, Concord,</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi>
and men in the Garb of Magistrates and Pastors, do prosecute
the War as by Christ's Commission, and in his Name: And sin
is defended and propagated, by false, pretended opposition.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Iews</hi> had known him, they would not have Crucified the
Lord of Glory. <hi>Heathens</hi> would not for Idols fight against God,
nor <hi>Mahometans</hi> for a Deceiver against Christ, if they knew what
it is that they are doing. Christ who was Crucified as a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and Rebel, foretold his Disciples, that they should be kill'd
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59333:147"/>
as an act of service to God. Where the Gospel is believed, it
is a crime so horrid to silence and destroy Christ's faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and forbid his publick Worship, and render his most
conscionable Servants odious, and plot their extirpation and
ruine, that none dare do it but those that know not what they
do. When Christians as a Sect were every where spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
<hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>exceeding mad against them, and persecuted them to
strange Cities, and verily thought that he ought to do many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Name of</hi> Jesus, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. But when he heard from
Heaven, <hi>Why persecutest thou me?</hi> it stopt his rage, and changed
his judgment.</p>
            <p>But alas! How slender a means will serve to deceive the
wicked? A meer nick-name, or malicious slander; yea the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a sin which they think to be no sin, is enough with them
to make the best men seem the worst; while Perjuries, Adulteries,
Blasphemies, Prophaneness, Cruelty and Persecution, are tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
motes in the eyes of their Companions. All the Holiness,
Wisdom and Miracles of Christ and his Apostles, would not
serve to make them pass for good, yea or tolerable men; while
Sadducees who denied Spirits &amp; the Resurrection; &amp; Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
hypocritical, blood-thirty Pharisees, went for meet Rulers
of the Flock. And how can it be expected that he who thinks
not Holiness desireable to himself, should think it any excellency
in others? Or that he that thinks his own sin but a tolerable
frailty, should much abhor it in the World?</p>
            <p>Satan then hath his Army not only among Infidels, but nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Christians: And it is commanded by Honourable and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Names, and he pretends a good and righteous Cause,
whereever he fighteth against Christ, and Holiness. But by the
fruits he may be known in the greatest pretenders, whatever
names he call them by. It is the most profitable Preaching which
he laboureth to suppress, and the most faithful Pastors that he
would silence; the most conscionable Christians whom he striv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to make hateful, and the more Spiritual Worship of God
which he would hinders. And therefore even among Christians
we have great cause to warn men to fear least they be enticed
into Satan's service, against Christ and their own Profession and
Salvation. And especially in an age; 1. Where worldly and
cross Interests are set up against the Interest of Christ and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
2. Where these worldly and cross Interests have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59333:147"/>
wasted Christian Love, and Contentions have begun a
Mental War. 3. When these have prevailed by scorns and
slanders to make Conscionable Christians pass for some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
criminal, or erroneous Sect; and this Reproach is
fortified by Honourable and Reverend Names. Lest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such Causes, too visible in the World, should draw the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and rash into the dreadful Sin of fighting against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Christ, and Souls, by hindering Christ's Ministers
from their necessary Work, and faithful Christians from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
God, I will humbly beseech all that are in danger of
such Temptations, but seriously to exercise their own Reasons
in the present Consideration of these following Questions, and
to take up with no other Answer to them, which will not bear
weight at Death and Judgment, when worldly Pomp and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
leave them; and not worldly Interest, Wit, or Grandeur,
but the Righteous Lord, the Lover of Holiness, and Holy Souls,
will be the dreadful and final Judge.</p>

are not worse than most Heathens, Are we not agreed, That
Man's Soul is immortal, and that we shall all be shortly in another
World; and that it shall be with us there, as we live on Earth?
If any doubt of this, should not the least probability of such
an everlasting Life, of Joy or Misery, prevail against the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Vanity of such a shadow as this World? Or if yet they

God, our Creator and Redeemer, and a holy Heart, and Life
are of necessity to our Salvation? Do we not see, That Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

us, how hard, and how long a Work it is, to make the Ignorant
understand the very Articles of Faith, and necessary Duty to
God and man; and as hard to perswade their Carnal Minds to

and the Mahometans, offer their God some publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
And must not Christians publickly worship Christ? Are
not holy Assemblies for Doctrine, Prayer, Praise and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
Commanded to that end; and the Lord's day separated
thereto, and all forbid to forsake such Assembling?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 7. Let the Bills of Mortality, and the knowing Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
tell you, Whether there be not some Hundred Thousands
in the great Parishes, in and near this City, more than can come
into their Parish-Churches, and hear. If they would all but
shew their willingness to come in, if they could, and Twenty
Thousand stood at St. <hi>Martin's</hi> in the Church-Yard, and Streets,
and as many at <hi>Stepney,</hi> and at St. <hi>Giles Cripplegate,</hi> and Ten
Thousand at <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields, and so of the rest, and should
say, We are here desirous to come in, and cannot, What would
you say to them? Are they not more miserable that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to stay at home?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 8. What would you have all these Thousands do? Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59333:148"/>
of them are hardened already by this seeming necessity
into self-excusing, and a custom of neglecting all publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
And how think you do they spend their time at home?
Is it not the time for sinful Practices, or Idleness at the best?
And would you have all these Thousands turn Atheists, or live
more impiously than Mahometans? And are not these to pay
to the Church, that cannot come in it; and the Weak that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand and can get no Seats? And are not the Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
bound to present all these Thousands, that have no Room?
And shall all these suffer as Recusants, while the Rich that can
pay for Seats, escape? If you say they should seek room in other
Parish Churches, do you know what it is for a man to wander
into the City, with his Family, to seek room, he knoweth not
where? The Tabernacles where Churches stood are small<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
we see the Church full already, where is profitable Preaching,
and the Seats at least possest; and the worse men are, the more
need they have, but the less they feel it, and are unlikely to
seek help at such a rate, who would come in, if it were near them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 9. Are all these many Thousands that stay at home (or
worse)
hunted and prosecuted, fined, and imprisoned for it,
as seditious, and Enemies to the King, or to the Peace, as some
are that worship God as wisely as they can? And do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that such a Worship of God, as hath nothing in it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Holy Scripture, or contrary to the Practice of the
Apostles of Christ, is worse than none at all, or than meeting
at Plays and Taverns, and deserveth scorn, imprisonment, and
ruine?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 10. Suppose it be Ignorance and Errour in such Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
as take it to be a sin against God (yea, a heinous sin)
to take all the Oaths, Declarations, Subscriptions, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
imposed for Conformity (while they willingly take the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy); and suppose it be an
Errour in those People, who think their Souls need better Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Helps than they can have in many Parishes; shall this Errour
be punished with keeping them from all God's publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
unless they will sin against their Consciences, or change
their Judgments which they cannot change? Yea, suppose some
Communion or Ceremony be indifferent, which they mistake
for sin, will you forbid all men to worship God, till they have
no Sin or Errour? Is there any one such a man on earth? Are
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59333:149"/>
you such your selves? And shall all the World be driven
therefore from worshipping God? Little do men know how
great a part of the daily Thoughts, even of Orthodox Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, are Errours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 11. Can there be a more horrid thing in the world, than
either to condemn or excommunicate all men who dare not do
that which after their best search, they think to be more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Sin than they dare name, lest the very naming of it offend,
and are desirous to have their Reasons heard; and to make it
necessary to Communion, or to their Liberty to worship God,
that all Men and Women must know even all <hi>indifferent</hi> things,
to be <hi>indifferent</hi> or lawful in God's Worship, which men may
impose on them? Have not all sober Peaceable Divines agreed,
that <hi>things necessary for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all to know,</hi> are <hi>few;</hi> and that Christian
Concord can never be expected on any other terms, than by
agreeing in those <hi>few,</hi> plain, necessary things? And who
knoweth not that <hi>indifferent things</hi> are <hi>numberless,</hi> as well as
small; no mortal man knoweth them all? And if a poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
that feareth the Justice of God, do take that Oath, that
Covenant, that Declaration or Subscription; yea, or that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Symbolical Badge of Christianity, or other Ceremony to
be a heinous Sin, which others say is a thing indifferent; Must
all as Atheists be kept from worshipping God, till they know
<hi>all these things to be indifferent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 12. Did not the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> himself make it his prime Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Law,
That all that profess Repentance and Faith in God
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, should by Baptism be made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Christians; and all Christians live in Love to one another,
and Holy Communion, and jointly worship God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 13. Was it not the Nature of all the Old Heresies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from this Universal Christian Love and Unity, and that
on pretence of some singular Opinion of their own, in which
they thought they were wiser than others, and would have had
all to be of their mind; and should those that cry down Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
go the way of Hereticks, if they can but get <hi>Number</hi> and
<hi>Power</hi> to pretend <hi>Catholicism?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 14. Did not the Holy Ghost by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as plain as the
Pen of Man can write, determine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 15. and <hi>Eph.
4. 6, 7, &amp;c.</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. that Christians should receive each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into Communion, and live in Love and Peace, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59333:149"/>
differences about Meats, Days, and such indifferent
things; yea, or Weaknesses in Faith and Holiness? And did
not Christ mind the Ceremonious <hi>Pharisees,</hi> That <hi>God will have
Mercy rather than Sacrifice;</hi> and that they worshipped God in
vain, while they preferred their Ceremonies and Traditions to
his Word?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 15. Had it been Reason, or Impudency rather, in the
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> if they had cryed out against Christ and his Apostles,
for not Conforming to their Traditions, <hi>[You are Schismaticks,
and disturb the Church's and the Nation's Peace, and cast all into
Confusion]?</hi> And was it not Turbulent Arrogancy that made
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Christians so urgent with all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised,
when they were left to their <hi>own</hi> Ceremonies, and no
body medled with them, or hindred them? If men love that
Diet, let them use it: But must none live that cannot love the
same?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 16. Will you give men leave to open all the real Faults
they can find in the <hi>Diocesan</hi> or Parish Churches? And if they
prove far more than they can prove in theirs, Will you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
silence all your Teachers, and shut up all your Church-doors,
and give over worshipping God? Do you think that
your Priests and your Worship are without Fault; yea, or the
Constitution of your Churches? We are not able well to <hi>know</hi>
what a Parish-Church is, by its Materials; that is, who are of
the Churches, and who not. 1. If it be all the Baptized Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioners,
the Papists and Separatists are your Members. If it
be all such as are of no other Church, then the Atheists, Infidels,
Seducers, and others that are of no Church indeed are of it. 3.
If it be only those that dwell and communicate there, how small
a part of your great Parishes are of the Church? Yet are not
these many Thousands declared to be out, but are permitted
without Censure, and may come if they will: Not only the
Members, but the Minister himself knoweth not who are of his
Church, for the far greater part, till he see them come to the
Altar, and then most, if they come, must be utter strangers to
him whom he never saw before. How great a Number of
<hi>Hobbists,</hi> Infidels, Papists, and wicked Livers are amongst us,
your own Pens proclaim. And may not these come to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
when they please? This is spoken only to convince you,
that if all this may be born, the supposed sin of fearing sin in a
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59333:150"/>
thing call'd indifferent, deserveth not Excommunication or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 17. Is not <hi>the Fear of God the beginning of Wisdom?</hi> And
doth not this contain a Fear of sinning? And is not this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
and to be cherished? Is not God above man, and
first to be obeyed, and most feared? Hath man any Power but
what God hath given him, and hath God given any against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or his own Laws, or for destruction of his Fear? If <hi>Conscience</hi>
towards God be once driven away, is any man to be trusted?
Will not the unconscionable do any thing for worldly Interest?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> 18. Is it not an unmanly sort of impudence in them, that
many years perswade the world, that those same men make
Schisms, by forbearing only such things as they confess to be no
sin, who have twenty years ago Protested, that nothing but <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
is refused by them, and did then give in a Catalogue of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sins which they undertook to prove such? And should
those same men that have read, or may do <hi>The King's Gracious
Declaration about Ecclesiastical Affairs,</hi> 1660. and the <hi>London</hi>
Ministers printed Thanks-giving for it, and the many late
Books, in which we have told men what it is which we dare
not conform to; I say, should these still take on them, that they
cannot know it, and call out still, <hi>[What is it that you stick at?
And what is it that would satisfy you?]</hi> Yea, those that cannot
bear that we should tell them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 19. Do you think that the King who then past that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(in which the Non-Conformists who sought it with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
acquiesc't, as in terms of happy Concord) and the House
of Commons who gave him thanks, or the Bishops and Clergy
who after rejected it, and procured the new Act of Uniformity
and such other, did take the way to have United Protestants, and
to have prevented our present sad divisions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 20. Hath not Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in his History of the <hi>Regale</hi> fully
proved that the choice of Bishops and Pastors for many hundred
years was in the People and the Clergy: And do you think in
your Consciences, that if a good Gentleman build and endow a
Church, all men must ever after trust the Pastoral conduct of
their Souls with such Priests only as his Posterity, or any man
that will buy the Advowson shall present? Will not Drunkards,
Fornicators, malignant haters of Holy Life choose men as fit for
their turn as will be admitted? And do you think in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59333:150"/>
that all the Patrons now in <hi>England,</hi> are either fit, or by
Christ allowed, to be choosers of all those Pastors that all men
in <hi>England</hi> must take up with: Do you not know that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
converteth not like a Charm, nor is the Devil cast out of
Souls as by the words of an Exorcist? It requireth great skill
and care to convince sinners, and instruct, resolve, confirm and
comfort Souls: There is as great difference of Teachers as of
Physicians: And Souls are unspeakably more precious than Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
And it's said of (too many) rash and unskillful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
that the difference between them and Souldiers is that
<hi>they kill their Friends who pay them for it, when Souldiers kill but
their enemies.</hi> What Power Princes and Patrons have of things
Dedicated to God, as Temples and Tithes, Lands; we presume not
to dispute. But these are not to inseparable from the Pastoral-office
that the People must trust their Souls only on their Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
care, to whom the Patron will give the Tithes and Temples.
Had men so setled maintenance on Physicians for every Parish,
we would not therefore trust our lives on the unskillful or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent,
because either Prince or Patron choose him. And if
you would not say to such, <hi>You shall have the Physician which the
Patron chooseth or none;</hi> Why should you say so of the Pastor?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 21. Are we not of the same Religion with the Magistrates
and Bishops? In what one Article of Faith do we differ (except
the new one of <hi>the undoubted Salvation of all dying Baptized In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi>
not excepting those of Atheists or Infidels, and this as <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
by God's Word,)</hi> almost all parts of the Christian World,
<hi>Greeks, Papists, Protestants, Nestorians, Iacobites, Arminians, &amp;c.</hi>
do charge one another with Heresy or false Doctrine, while
Conformists charge no such thing on the Non-conformists, but
only dissenting from the modes of worship and discipline which
they impose. And would you have all the Christian World, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
one another to Worship God, till they all agree? If not,
where yet their differences are so great, why must they be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
it, who differ not in points of Faith from the Churches
Articles at all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 22. It is forbidden that more than four meet to VVorship
God <hi>[in other manner than according to the Liturgy and practice of
the Church of</hi> England.] If by <hi>[other manner]</hi> be meant <hi>[with
any other positive manner of Worship]</hi> I see none that do it <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi>
For <hi>Reading of Scripture, Praying, Preaching, Singing
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59333:151"/>
Psalms,</hi> are all done in the Parish-Churches. But if <hi>[o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

extend to every <hi>omission</hi> of any appointed part of the Liturgy,
all <hi>Parish-Churches</hi> where I come do it in <hi>other manner.]</hi> And
shall all the Lords, Gentlemen and People be therefore punished
as Conventiclers? The Non-conformists where I come, use
most of the Liturgy, (that is) The <hi>Psalms,</hi> two <hi>Chapters,</hi> the
<hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Commandments,</hi> the <hi>Singing Psalms,</hi>
&amp; some of them more. Must all go out of the Church, if the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
omit part? If by <hi>[otherwise]</hi> be meant <hi>[with any other
accidents or circumstances]</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> agreeth not
in all such, and can be no rule therein to the Non-conformists:
Cathedral and Parish-Churches differ: Some Parishes have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns,
Altars, Rails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and some none: Some Worship in
Tabernacles, and some in unconsecrated Places, (as some Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,
the Spittle, the Prison, <hi>Sturbridge</hi>-Fair, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> And almost
all the Christian Sects on Earth (before-named) differ in far
greater matters than our difference from the Liturgy is: And
even in the time when the Christian Emperours and Prelates
were of greatest Power and Zeal for Concord, they never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
one Liturgy for all the Churches in the Empire. Nor did
any Bishops in Councilor out, so magnify themselves, as to write
down for all other Bishops and Priests the words which they must
speak to God in all their Prayers, as if none that are fit for the
Sacred Office, knew what to say to God but they, or they only
had the Spirit of prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 23. Are there not some sorts of Government antecedent in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of nature to publick Government, and such as no Prince or
Prelate can abrogate, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Self-Government. 2. The Husbands-Government
of the VVife. 3. And the Parents-Government of
his Children, in order to personal and family wellfare? If Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or Patrons on what pretence soever, would take on them to
choose for all men, what Food they shall eat, what Physick they
shall take and when, what Trade they shall choose, what VVives
or Husbands they shall have, as to individuals, and what Food,
Raiment, Physick or Calling, they shall give their Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
No Prince can deprive men of Self-governing, maternal or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Power. And is this power more concerned in any thing
than in the saving of our Souls? Hath God laid our Salvation
on Princes, and Patrons choice, or on our own? If we mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
by their choice, will they be damned for us, and not we?
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59333:151"/>
Is it not our own Salvation that lieth on our actions? And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
say, <hi>you are unfit to judge,</hi> what <hi>Food to eat,</hi> what <hi>Physick
to take,</hi> what <hi>Wife to choose,</hi> and so what <hi>Pastor to choose for the
conduct of your Souls;</hi> will any man, not distracted, therefore
make a Prince or Patron the absolute chooser, and trustee for his
Soul? Or doth it follow that <hi>I need not,</hi> or <hi>may not</hi> choose a
skillfuller Pastor than many thousand Parishes in <hi>England</hi> have,
because the Patron is by Law enabled to choose the Parish-Priest?
Let him choose who shall have his Tithes and Temple, but he
shall not make me trust an unfit man with the pastoral care of my
Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 24. If a Wife or Son say, <hi>My Husband,</hi> or <hi>my Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
me to take this man and not that for my Pastor.</hi> And you,
say <hi>(The Prince</hi> or <hi>Patron chooseth you another, and will imprison
you if you submit not to his choice,)</hi> which do you think the Law
of Nature, and the fifth Commandment will justify? Hath
God made the King of <hi>France, Spain, Portugal, &amp;c.</hi> the chooser
of a Pastor for all their Subjects? And consequently the chooser
whether they shall be saved or damned, according to God's ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
course of VVorking by the aptitude of means. If this power
extend not to <hi>Infidels, Heathens, Papists, Hereticks, &amp;c.</hi> how shall
the Subjects know to whom it extendeth? Must all Subjects be
made Judges whether Princes and Patrons are Orthodox and fit
to choose? Is not this more arrogancy, than to judge who is fit
to be my Pastor or Physician? Is it not sufficient that the Prince
and Patrons so provide for Teachers (and Physicians) that
none may want, nor neglect instruction in the essentials of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
but as many as need and are able may use better than the
unskilful at their own charges?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 25. VVhereas some pretend that we ought to be silenced
for preaching without the Bishops Licence, is that the true
cause, when such are silenced and excommunicated that have
Licences? Mr. <hi>Tho. Gouge</hi> was excommunicated for preaching
even in <hi>Wales,</hi> where he laboured in such eminent works of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
notwithstanding his University Licence not-forfeited: For
though he conformed not, he never <hi>refused Conformity,</hi> and so fell
not under the Canon which maketh void the Licences of Refusers.
And I that have the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>'s <hi>(Sheldon</hi>'s) Licence, am
hindered with the first. The same I say of Episcopal Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was no protection to him or me, or many others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:59333:152"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 26. As to the common cry that we are justly silenced for
our being for the Parliament in the late VVars, 1. Is that the
meaning of the Act of Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ivion? Are they friends to King or
Kingdom that will not suffer our sores to heal; but when all
are returned to the Love of Peace, still fill mens ears with the
noise and fears of VVar? 2. Did the King so judge of General
<hi>Monk</hi> and his Army who restored him, who yet were hotly fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Scotland</hi> against the King, while we were preaching against
the Usurpers? 3. Do not our long requests yet silence these
incendiaries, while we offer and crave but that those may have
leave to Preach Christ's Gospel and VVorship God, who never
had to do with any VVar against the King, and that they silence
only all the rest, (which we suppose are a number not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable)?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 27. As to any other charge, is it not that which we crave
our selves, that if any Non-conformists be proved guilty of
drunkenness, fornication, lying, perjury, oppression, or other
immorality or Rebellion or Sedition, they may be punished as
the crime deserveth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 27. Do you believe that the great Parish Ministers need
no help? Can any man think so, who believeth the worth of a
Soul, and understandeth but one <hi>half</hi> a Pastors work, and why it
was that the Primitive Church had so many <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi>
with a Bishop, to Churches of smaller number by far than our
great Parishes? And do not all Ministers of sense and forbriety,
confess their need of many to help them, and say that it is the
want of Maintenance that hindereth it? and if that be it, why
may not we be endured to help them for nothing, while we
Preach the same Gospel, and submit to beg our Bread? Doth
helping them freely deserve our destruction?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 28. Whom did Christ or any of his Apostles ever Silence,
who Preached only sound Doctrine, for any difference about
Circumstantials of mans invention? Or where did they ever
command or authorize any others so to do? When some would
have Christ restrain some from useing his name who followed
him not, he rebuked the motion, saying, <hi>he that is not against us,
is for us.</hi> When some preached not sincerely, but enviously, and
contentiously, to add affliction to his bonds, St. <hi>Paul</hi> was glad
yet that Christ was Preached, and professed that he did and
would rejoice therein, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:59333:152"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 29. Do you think that any would Silence, Imprison or
Prosecute Religious Christians, for things which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
call Indifferent, and others think to be great sin, if <hi>they
loved their neighbours as themselves, and did by others as they would
have others do by them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 30. Is not the Office of the Ministery to be <hi>Stewards</hi> of the
house, <hi>and mysteries of God,</hi> and to give the <hi>Children their meat in
season, Luk.</hi> 12. 42. and to <hi>teach men publickly from house to house,</hi>
Act. 20. And is it not a calling fixed during life and ability,
not to be cast off at pleasure? And this in those that are called
by men? As a Priest that hath marryed Persons cannot unmarry
them, and the Arch-Bishop who may Anoint or Crown a King,
may not Depose him, because he was not the Donor or Lord,
but a Ministerial Invester; so he that Ordaineth a Minister may
not depose him, till he become uncapable of the Office, and if
he do, it doth not disoblige the Minister.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 31. Did not the Church for 300 years, worship God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the will of Princes, and afterward, when <hi>Arrian,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
erroneous Princes forbid them? And hath a Christian
Prince any more power to hinder the Gospel and Worship of
Christ, and the saving of Souls, than <hi>Heathens</hi> had? or rather
far greater obligations, as nursing Fathers to promote them,
which I ask only in answer to such as pretend Law and human
Authority, to forbid what God Commandeth; in which case
saith Bishop <hi>Bilson, we must go on with our work, and patiently
suffer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 32. Is it not a dreadful charge that is laid on <hi>Timothy</hi>
(one called by men) 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 1, 2. I charge thee before God
and the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at
his appearing and his Kingdom, that thou Preach the word; be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long
Suffering and Doctrine.</hi> Have you so little mercy on our souls,
as to drive us on such a Flaming Sword, and wish us to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by Christ, for disobeying such a charge, and to bid us
obey any contrary charge of mortal worms?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 33. Is the <hi>Conformists Ministery</hi> necessary or not? If not,
why is all this stir made about it, and all the Church Lands and
Tythes to maintain it? If yea, why then is not <hi>our Labour</hi> in
Preaching the <hi>same Gospel</hi> as necessary as theirs, to such persons
as cannot hear them for want of room, and to such who say that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59333:153"/>
their true necessity commandeth them to use better Pastors than
many Parishes have? And if any of them have a scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
errour about a Pastor, must they therefore be Ruined, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
or Forsaken?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 34. Is not the silencing of faithful Ministers, a far greater
loss &amp; hurt to the people that need their Ministery than to them?
What if it prove my fault, that all my most impartial
Studies and Prayers did not serve to make me know, that all
the imposed Subscriptions, Declarations, Covenants, Oaths
and Practices are lawful? Shall hundreds or thousands of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
people suffer for my fault, and that in their Souls? Should
you for this have deprived all persons of any help, which they
have had by all my Preaching and VVritings this Twenty or
Fourty years? And is it just to wish it had been all undone, and
the like of many hundred others? If we preach false Doctrine,
accuse and punish us; If the Physicians were drunkards or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators
you would not for that forbid them to help to save the
sick. If the Country Farmers scrupled Conformity, you would
not therefore forbid the Market to them, and let the poor
famish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 35. If our not Swearing, not Subscribing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be our
fault, as long as we preach Necessary Truth, could not Lovers of
the Gospel find some penalty for us, that did not hinder it? Is it
worse than Drunkenness or Fornication? Twelve pence an
Oath, is thought enough for Prophane Swearers, and is there
one in many hundreds pay it? VVe had far rather be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
punished, so we be not hindred from serving Christ in
the work to which we are devoted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 36. Do you think there is any such sin as Sacrilege in
the world? If there be, is it not greater Sacrilege for me,
that am Ordained and Devoted to the Ministery, to alienate my
self, than to alienate Church Utensils, Goods or Lands? These
are devoted but for the Pastor, who is Consecrated to nearer
and more holy service. VVhat think you of them that cry out
against the alienation of large Church Revenues as Sacrilege,
and use them for worldly pomp, and fleshly fulness to their own
pleasure, which are devoted to God's service; but with a few
confident words will prove it no sacrilege, for many thousand
faithful Ministers, to forsake their Calling, if Bishops forbid it
them? (For what it is in the forbidders, we leave to God and
them.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:59333:153"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 37. Dare you undertake to justify at the Bar of God, the
many hundred Ministers forbidden to Preach, if they obey you
and cease their Ministery? Or will you answer for all the People
whom some drive away from their worship of God, if
they thereupon give over worshipping him, and as thousands o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
idle it at home, when all these say <hi>[We Preach no Doctrine,
nor offer God any Worship, contrary to any Word of God, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other manner than Christ and his Apostles did or allowed]?</hi> Dare
you give it under your hands that you will bear the punishment
if we be condemned for obeying you and ceasing our work? If
you would, were that man well in his Wits, who should trust
his Soul on your undertaking, who are so unable to save your
selves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 38. Should things Indifferent exclude things Necessary,
when Christ saith, <hi>I will have mercy, and not sacrifice?</hi> And is
neither our Preaching, nor the Concord of the Churches here
Necessary?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 39. Have you thought what Christ meant, when after his
Resurrection he thrice saith to <hi>Peter</hi> (and to others in him) <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
thou me, feed my Lambs and Flock?</hi> As if he had said, <hi>As ever
you loved me, feed those whom I loved to the Death:</hi> Would you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully
wish us to renounce our love to Christ? and when <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, <hi>Necessity is laid upon me, and woe unto me if I preach not the
Gospel:</hi> Would you wish us to run upon such a <hi>Woe,</hi> upon the
meer chat of such as do but tell us, that we are not called as the
Apostles; and that we are under Bishops? As if none but men
called the <hi>Apostles,</hi> were liable to that Necessity or Woe; or God
had allowed us to forsake His Work when Bishops please, and
will forbid us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 40. God hath encouraged us in our work by his undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
blessing on many Souls. If you take it for nothing, for men
to be turned from ignorance, worldliness, deceiving, lying,
sensuality and fleshly lusts, to the serious belief of a life to come,
and to the Love of God and Man, and to the joyful hopes of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the obedience of Christ, and confidence in his salvation;
we take this to be worth our labour and our lives. And would
you have us so unthankful to God, who hath blest us, as to
cast away our Callings? Can you expect that all the threatnings
of Men, or the weekly reproach of Pamphlet-writers, should
make us wish all the Sermons unpreach'd which we have
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59333:154"/>
preach'd, and all the Books unwritten which we have written,
and all the Souls unconverted who have repented?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 42. VVhen <hi>Ionas</hi> over-ran an unpleasing Ministery, did
not God overtake him with his Judgment? And if we prove <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses,</hi>
may we not expect to meet with Storms more terrible
than Jails?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 43. Can all this said and done against such in the world,
ever make the sober that knew them, believe, that such a man as
<hi>Anthony Burges,</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hildersham</hi> (the Son) Mr.
<hi>Hughes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Allen,</hi> and hundreds much like them, were
worthy Silencing, Imprisonment and Shame, while such as fill
some thousand Churches are worthy of maintenance and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
Or will sober Posterity who read the Lives and VVri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of such men as <hi>Iohn Corbet, Ioseph Allen, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn
Ianeway,</hi> and abundance such others, believe that they were as
bad as their accusers make them? There is but one way to bring
them under the Infamy and Odium of Posterity; and that is
the <hi>Papists</hi> way to kill all that are of another mind, and to drive
Truth and Conscience out of the world, and then who would
stay behind?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 44. VVho did Christ mean by the Hypocrite that seeth
a mote in his brothers eye, and could not see the beam in his
own? VVas it not the Pharisee that blamed Christ's Disciples
for crossing their Ceremonies and Traditions, and saw not all the
crimes in themselves recited <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. And is not the scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
of a thing called by others <hi>Indifferent,</hi> a mote in the eye of
many truly godly persons? I will not offend you by describing
the beams.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 45. Have we not often offered, that as soon as any true
reason can tell us, that our Labours are here needless, by the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
number, and quality, and labours of others, we will joy ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be silent, and seek for work where there is need: Till then,
to starve souls is to be guilty of their damnation. And if
Meeting-Chapels be wanting, why do not the great and rich
Conformists build them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 46. Is it not a pleasing advantage to Papists, if they can
see two thousand of those Minister, who are most against them,
silenced, and driven from Cities and Corporations, and made a
hunting game and scorn, and the Kingdom crackt by general di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
as turned into Guelphs and Gibelines, weekly reviling
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59333:154"/>
and deriding each other as <hi>Whiggs</hi> and <hi>Tories?</hi> Is it not their
design to banish <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>absolute Obedience to God?</hi> And
you know who ruleth where God and Conscience doth not rule.
And what is it that the unconscionable will not do, for worldly
interest? And did not the Papists always know that our Love
and Concord would be our strength, and their terrour?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 47. Who is it that was, or is able to cure all these our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions?
It never was in our power, nor yet is, unless damning
our souls by willful sin must be the cure: For we have oft offered
our Oaths that nothing but fear of sin shall hinder us from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming.
If our fear come from ignorance, do the Churches suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
none more ignorant than we? But how easy were it with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
without sin, or cost to cure all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 48. Is it not God's great Mercy to our Land, that we
have had twenty years peace, while other Lands have been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
by Wars? And if it be the Preachers of the Gospel that
yet will give the Land no peace, but cry out, <hi>execute, prosecute,
suffer not, strike home,</hi> and their judgment be the executioners en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment,
who say, <hi>The Clergy tells us it is our duty;</hi> I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
answer them with tears than words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 49. Should not the long and universal experience of the
Christian VVorld be some warning to us, which these thousand
years hath been broken into shreds, by the contentions of the
Clergy, and their Magisterial needless impositions, and by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
the Primitive purity and simplicity?</p>
               <p>Q. 50. <hi>Are not these words in the Liturgy before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
very terrible:</hi> 
                  <q>If any of you be a hinderer or slanderer of
God's Word—or be in malice or envy—Repent of your sin,
and come not to this Holy Table, lest after the taking of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
the Devil enter into you as he did into Iudas, and fill you
full of iniquities, and bring you to destruction of Body and Soul?</q>
                  <hi>And are not the Words of our Judge more terrible:
Mat.</hi> 25. <q>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for
the Devil and his Angels: For I was hungry,—thirsty,—a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,—
naked,—in prison, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> In as much as ye did it not to one of the
least of these, ye did it not to me: And these shall go away into
everlasting punishment; but the Righteous into Life eternal?
<hi>O let me never be one of those, who for nothing shall run
on such a doom!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:59333:155"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 50. If yet objections or the mis-understanding of our
cause do frustrate all these reasons, I have answered so many
objections, and so far opened the cause already, as here is
not to be repeated, <hi>viz.</hi> In the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second Pleas for Peace,</hi>
In the <hi>Apology for our Preaching,</hi> and in the <hi>Treatise of Episcopacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And against the judgment of those Reverend Fathers who
still cry <hi>[Abate nothing, and suffer them not; do Execution]</hi> I set
