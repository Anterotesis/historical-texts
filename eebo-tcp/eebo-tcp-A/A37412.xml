            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHAT is here presented unto thee (Christian Reader) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a True and Faithful Relation, &amp;c.</hi> (as the Title beareth, and will be further cleared by this Preface) though by the carriage of it, in some respects, and by the Nature of it too, it might be deemed and termed, <hi>A Work of Darknesse:</hi> Yet it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then what with great tendernesse and circumspection, was tendered to men of highest Dignity in <hi>Europe,</hi> Kings and Princes, and by all (<hi>England</hi> excepted) listned unto for a while with good respect. By some gladly embraced and entertained for a long time; the Fame whereof being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed unto <hi>Rome,</hi> it made the Pope to bestir himself, not knowing what the event of it might be, and how much it might concern him. And indeed, filled all men, Learned and Unlearned in most places with great wonder and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: all which things will be shewed and made good (to the utmost of what we have said) in the Contents of this book, by unquestionable <hi>Records</hi> and evidences. And therefore I make no question but there will be men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough found in the world whose curiosity will lead them to Read <hi>what I think is not to be parallell'd in that Kind by any book that hath been set out in any Age to read:</hi> I say, though it be to no other end then to satisfie their curiosity. But whatsoever other men, according to their several inclinations, may propose to themselves in the reading of it, yet I may and must here professe in the first place, in Truth and Sincerity, that the end that I propose to my self (so far as I have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Publishing of the Work) is not to satisfie curiosity, but to do good, and promote Religion. When we were first acquainted with the Book, and were offered the reading of it, having but lately been conversant in a Subject of much Affinity; to wit, of <hi>Mistaken Inspiration</hi> and <hi>Possession,</hi> through ignorance of Natural causes (which labour of ours, as it was our aime at the first in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of it, to do good, so we have had good reason since to believe, that we did not altogether misse of what we aimed at) we could not but gladly accept of it. And as we gladly accepted, so we read unto the end with equal eagernesse and Alacrity: Which when we had done, truly it was our Opinion, That the Publishing of it could not but be very Seasonable and Useful, as against <hi>Atheists</hi> at all times, so in these Times especially, when the Spirit of Error and Illusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not in profest <hi>Anabaptists</hi> only, even of the worst kind that former Ages have known and abhorred, doth so much prevail, but in many also, who though they disclaim and detest openly (and heartily too, I hope, most of them) the fruits and effects that such causes have produced in others, yet ground them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves neverthelesse upon the same principles of <hi>Supposed Inspiration</hi> and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary <hi>Revelations;</hi> and upon that account deem themselves, if not the Only, yet much better Christians then others. And I was much Confirmed in this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when I was told (as indeed I was, at the first, by them that knew very well) that the Most Reverend, Pious and Learned <hi>Archbishop of Armagh,</hi> lately
<pb facs="tcp:49588:3"/>
deceased, upon reading of the said book, before his death, had declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the same purpose, and <hi>wished it Printed.</hi> But because it is very possible, that every Reader will not at the first be so well able of himself to make that good use by good and Rational Inferences and Observations of this sad Story as is aimed at, my chiefest aim in this Preface is to help such. And because it is not lesse probable that this Licentious Age will afford very many, who with the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> of old (that is, Jewish Epicures) believe no <hi>Spirit,</hi> or Angel, or Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; who therefore being prepossessed with prejudice when they hear of so many Spirits as are here mentioned, and so many strange Apparitions, in several Kinds, will not only fling back themselves, but will be ready to laugh at any other that give any credit to such things. Although I will not take upon me to convert any by Reason that are engaged into such an opinion by a wicked life, that is, Unjust practises, Luxurious lewd courses, open profanenesse, under the name of Wit and Galantry, and the like, because, I think, it is very just with God to leave such to the error and blindnesse of their Judgments; so that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Miracle there can be little hopes of such. Yet I shall hope that such as are Rational men, sober in their Lives and Conversations, such as I have known my self; yea, men of excellent parts in other things, men that are both willing to hear and able to consider: that such, I say, may receive some satisfaction by what I shall say and propose to their Ingenuous consideration in this matter. Were we to argue the case by Scripture, the businesse would soon be at an end; there being no one Controverted point among men, that I know of, that can receive a more Ample, Full, Clear and speedy determination, then this business of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and <hi>Witches,</hi> and <hi>Apparitions</hi> may, if the Word of God might be Judge. But I will suppose that I have to do with such, who though they do not altogether deny the Word of God, yet will not easily, however, admit of any thing that they think contrary to Reason, or at least not to be maintained by Reason. I shall therefore forbear all Scripture Proofs and Testimonies in this particular, and desire the Christian Reader (who otherwise might justly take offence) to take notice upon what ground it is that I forbear.</p>
            <p>But though I will not use any Scripture for proof, yet by way of Application I hope I may be allowed to use some Scripture words, which may direct us perchance to a good Method in the examination of this businesse. The Apostle saith in a place, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> (<hi>professing themselves to be wise, they became fools</hi>) I shall not enquire of whom, and upon what occasion it was spoken: I draw no argument from it; only because there is a shew of great Wisdom in this Opinion; and yet, as I conceive, as much of Error and falshood (that is, <hi>Folly,</hi> as the word is often used) as in any other false opinion that is lesse popular. I will frame my discourse to this issue, first, to enquire what it is that makes it so popular and plausible, among them especially that pretend to more then ordinary Wisdom; and then secondly, lay it open (as I am able) to the view in its right colours, that the <hi>Folly</hi> or falshood of it may be discernable even to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary judgments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </hi> then, (as for them that <hi>deny Spirits,</hi> &amp;c.) we say, The world is full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture; to know this, to observe it in all Trades, in all Professions, in all ranks and degrees of men, is to know the world, and that is to be wise. Though we call them <hi>Juglers,</hi> yet they deserve to be thought the plainest dealing men of the world that shew their tricks openly in the streets for money; for they professe what they are. They are the truest Juglers that do their feats (and they for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:49588:3"/>
too, most of them) under the Veil and Reputation of Holinesse, Sanctity, (or, Saintship) Religion, Virtue, Justice, Friendship; fine words to catch men that are of easie Belief, and thinks that every thing that glisters must needs be gold. Hence it is, that men that have had the Reputation of Wise men in the world; have commended this unto us as greatest Wisdom, NOT EASILY TO BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEVE: <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Epicharmus</hi> got more credit for this one saying (and hath done more good too, perchance) then many that have been the Authors of vast Volumes. Now if those things that are exposed to sense, the proper Objects of our Eyes and Eares, be lyable to so much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture and Deceit, that the wisest can scarce know what to believe: How much more caution do we need in those things that are so much above Sense, and in some respects contrary to Sense (and that is <hi>Spirits</hi>) that we be not deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? If we consider the Nature of man, his Bodily frame, the Affections of his soul, the Faculties of his mind, we shall have no occasion at all to wonder if most men are apt to believe and to be cheated. But as no cause to wonder, so as little cause to imitate: <hi>Felix qui rerum potuit cognoscere causas!</hi>

               <hi>a desire of, or to strange things that may cause amazement,</hi> is the proper affection of the vulgar, that is, of most men, which they bring into the world with them, (it is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the wisest of men that have written concerning the affairs and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men) and cannot be rid of but by wisdom, which is the happinesse of few: <hi>Errandi, non necessitas tantum, sed amor. Seneca</hi> somewhere speaking of the Nature of Man; There was a time when the world was much governed by <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;</hi> private men went unto them as unto God, Kings and Princes sent unto them to be advised about greatest matters: and so much faith was ascribed unto them, generally, that the very word became a Proverb appliable unto those things, whereof no question can be made. Yet those very ancient Heathens, that tell us of these Oracles, tell us of their vanity; and though they say not, That all were false and counterfeit, yet whilest they acknowledg it of some, they give us just occasion to suspect that it might have been found as true of the rest also, had like care been taken to examine the truth of them also.</p>
            <p>Again, there was a time (and that time not many hundred years yet past) when <hi>Miracles</hi> were the only discourse and delight of men: Ghosts and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were in every house; and so prone were men to receive what was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them in that kind, that Miracle-makers were much put to it, not to make their stories probable, (for that was not stood upon) but to make them wonderful enough; insomuch that some have been forced <note place="margin">See the Life of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> M.</note> to complain publickly of the credulity of the people, who yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves tell us much more, I dare say, then was ever true. As of Miracles, so of <hi>Exorcismes:</hi> How many Divels and Spirits have been driven out of men and women, supposed to be <hi>possessed,</hi> by solemn Exorcismes, to the great wonder of the beholders, which afterwards upon further search and examination, have been convicted to have been nothing but the artifices and subtil contrivances of men? Sentences and Judgments have passed upon such cheats when they have been discovered in most places of Europe, which have been published. But they have done strange things though (some that were thought possessed) and things impossible, to ordinary sense, to be done by Nature. It is very true, some have: But they that know what strange things may be done to the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

As for the bodily temper of man and of his <hi>Brain,</hi> it hath been sufficiently by some late books of that subject (<hi>Enthufiasme</hi>) both by reasons from Nature, and by sundry examples proved, that a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle distemper of the brain, scarce discernable unto any, but those that are well versed in the study of Natural causes, is enough to represent Spirits, Angels and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his Meteors, tells of one that alwayes saw (so he thought, at least) another man's shape before his eyes, and how they happened unto him naturally, he gives a reason. <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi>

                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> (a very short Discourse, but full of excellent matter) sheweth how some, both men and women, through Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural causes, come to fancy to themselves that they see <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> Divels and Spirits, and to be tormented in their Souls, even to the making away of themselves by their own hands. The Author of the book, <hi>De Morbo Sacro,</hi> (very ancient too, but not right <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> as many are of opinion) hath excellent matter too, to the same purpose; but I have not the book at this time by me. <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> (where before) sheweth how many in that case were gulled by the Priests of those times, making them believe, That this happened to them through the anger of some god. <q>They that are verst in the <hi>Opticks</hi> know, That there is a way, through the help of <hi>glasses</hi> that shall not be seen, to make moving sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows that shall appear like Ghosts, to the great terror of the ignorant behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and it is said, That pretended Astrologers and Fortune-tellers cheat many by those sights.</q> It is the opinion of some Jewish Rabbins, That what Ghosts or Souls are raised by <hi>Necromancy,</hi> they alwayes appear <hi>inverso corpore,</hi> that is, their head dowards and feet upwards. Though nothing is to be wondered at in Rabbins, who (commonly) are as full of ridiculous conceits as ever came into the head of any Bedlam: Yet my opinion is, <q>That the first ground of this wild conceit was, some appearance by the <hi>Species</hi> of an object, gathered through a little <hi>glasse</hi> into a dark room. For so indeed the objects must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>inverso corpore</hi> if it be done in a high room, and the objects from whence the <hi>Spiecies</hi> are gathered be lower then the glasse through which they passe.</q> And the reason of it is very Demonstrable to the sight of any reasonable man. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, by this secret (which yet is no great secret, being commonly seen and practis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them that are any thing curious) strange things may be done by a Cunning-man, to their great amazement that know not the cause. There would be no end if I should attempt to gather from several Authors what hath been invented by men, and what may be done by Art to cheat men in matters of this nature. Let any man, that is yet a stranger to it, but read the life of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the false Prophet,</hi> or Prognosticator, written by <hi>Lucian,</hi> and he shall see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table examples of successeful Cheats and Impostures, scarce credible indeed, but that the thing was yet then fresh and famous, and that all circumstances of
<pb facs="tcp:49588:4"/>
History confirm the truth of the relation. And let him that reads it judge, what dull and dry fellows the Mountebank-Astrologers, Prognosticators and Fortune-tellers of these dayes are, to this Noble, Renowned <hi>Alexander.</hi> Only let him know that reads, that <hi>Lucian</hi> was a profest Atheist, and therefore no wonder if he find <hi>Epicurus</hi> spoken of with great respect, whom all Atheists, and Atheistically inclined are so much obliged to honour. This excepted, I think, the Story is very worthy to be known, and much more worthy to be read by all men (considering the good use that may be made of it) then many books that are daily translated out of other languages.</p>
            <p>But lastly, If there were any such thing, really as Divels and Spirits that use to appear unto men; to whom should they (probably) sooner appear, then to such as daily call upon them, and devote their Souls and Bodies unto them by dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Oaths and Imprecations? And again, then to such, who through damnable curiosity have many times used the means (the best they could find in books, by Magical Circles, Characters and Invocations) and yet never, neither the one nor the other saw any thing?</p>
            <p>I have said as much as I mean to say (though somewhat perchance might be added) to shew the plausiblenesse of the opinion, in opposition to vulgar appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions and capacities, whereby (as I conceive, for I have not wittingly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any thing that I thought material) it chiefly intitles it self to wisdom, and more then ordinary prudence, which all men generally are ambitious of. Yet I would not have it thought that all men that hold this conclusion, That there be no Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> go so rationally to work, or can give this account or any other more rational and plausible for what they hold. God knows there be many in the world, men of no learning, and mean capacities, who can speak as peremptorily as the best, not because they have considered of it, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the grounds of either opinion, but because they know, or have heard it is the opinion of some Learned, and they hope they shall be thought learned too if they hold with them.

because of his great Learning, and wonted circumspection in his censures) what great undertakers many men are upon very little ground, and how prone others to extol what doth favour their cause, though to the prejudice of their better judgments, if they would judge impartially.

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We said, The world was full of Imposture. It is granted, of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors and Impostures. But what then shall the conclusion be, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </hi> is yet extant, a very learned book it cannot be denied, and of excellent use for the understanding of ancient Authors, Phylosophers especially. I could name some Christians also, by profession, men of great learning that have gone very far that way. But this will not be granted by some I am sure that are or have been thought great oppugners of the common opinion about Witches and Spirits; some Physicians I mean, and Naturalists by their profession. But may not we argue as plausibly against that which they professe, as they have done or can do against Spirits and Apparitions? We would be loath to make so long a digression; we have had occasion elsewhere to say somewhat to this purpose: and they that will be so curious may see what hath been written by <hi>Cornel. Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> (who is very large upon this subject) about it, not to name any others. It is not yet a full twelve-moneth, that a friend of mine, a Gentleman of quality, brought his Lady to <hi>London</hi> (some 60 miles and upwards from his ordinary dwelling) to have the advice of Physicians about his wife (a very Virtuous and Religious Lady) troubled with a weak stomack and ill digestion, which caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> symptoms. I think he had the advice of no lesse then a dozen first and last: I am sure he named unto me five or six of the chiefest in Credit and practice that the Town affordeth. Not one of them did agree in their opinions, either concerning the Cause, or the means to be used for a Cure. So that the Gentleman went away more unsatisfied then he came. What he did I knovv not: I knovv vvhat some men vvould have inferred upon this. Yet I, for my part, for the benefit that I have received by it, and the effects that I have seen of
<pb facs="tcp:49588:5"/>
it, both upon my self, and others in my life-time, upon several occasions (where <hi>learned Artists,</hi> not <hi>Empiricks</hi> have been employed) though all the world should be of another opinion, I think my self bound to honour, as the profession, so all Learned, Ingenious Professors of it: and I make no question but the worst of <hi>Agrippa's</hi> objections, by any man of competent judgment and experience, may easily be answered. I say therefore that as in other things of the world, so in matters of <hi>Spirits and Apparitions,</hi> though lyable to much error and imposture, yet it doth not follow but there may be reality of truth and certainty discernable unto them that will take the pains to search things unto the bottom, where truth commonly is to be found, and are naturally endowed with competent judgments to discern between specious arguments and solidity of truth.</p>
            <p>But this proveth nothing. No: but the removing of this common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection may dispose the Reader, I hope, to consider of what we have to say with lesse prejudice. And that shall be our next task, what we have to say for <hi>Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. before we come to particular Objections. Wherein never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse I will be no longcr then I must at this time, because I shall have a more proper place in two several Tractates, the one whereof hath been a long time in loose notes and papers, not yet digested, to wit, my Second Part of <hi>Enthusiasme:</hi> the other, in my head yet wholly, but in better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse to be brought to light, because of later conception; to wit, <hi>A Discourse of Credulity and Incredulity, in things Natural, Civil and Divine, or Theological.</hi> We shall meet there with many cases not so necessary here to be spoken of, which will help very much to clear this business.</p>
            <p>¬∂ But here I say, first of all, It is a Maxim of <hi>Aristotle's</hi> the great Oracle of Nature, which many have taken notice of, and applyed to their several purposes: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>That which is generally believed, is most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be true.</hi> Who also in another place of the same book doth approve the saying of <hi>Hesiod,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> Now if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny opinion whereof question is made can justly pretend to a general assent and consent of all people, places, ages of the world, I think, nay, I know, and it will be proved that this of Witches, Spirits, and Apparitions may. I do not know scarce any ancient book extant of Philosopher or Historian (the Writings of professed Epicureans excepted, of <hi>Aristotle</hi> we shall give an account by and by) but doth afford some pregnant relation, testimony or passage to the confirmation of this truth. I dare say, should a man collect the relations and testimonies out of several Authors and books (that are come to our knowledge) within the compasse of two thousand years, of Authors well accounted of, generally, and vvhose testimonies (Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans especially) vve receive in other things; a man might make a book of the biggest size and form that ordinary books (vvhich vve call <hi>Folioes</hi>) are. It is true, many Authors may vvrite one thing vvhich may prove false, as the famous history of the <hi>Phenix,</hi> perchance, or some such; but upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination it vvill appear that those many take all from one or tvvo at the most, vvho first delivered it. They add nothing in confirmation of their ovvn knovvledg or experience. But here it is quite othervvise; those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Authors that I speak of (Historians especially of several ages) they tell
<pb facs="tcp:49588:6"/>
us different things that hapned in their own times, in divers places of the world: and of many of them we may say they were such as knew little of former books, or stories of other Nations but their own. Within these 200 years the world, we know, by the benefit of Navigation hath been more open and known then before; yea, a great part of the world disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that was not known before. I have read many books, the best I could meet with, in several Languages, of divers Voyages into all parts of the world: I have conversed with many Travellers, whom I judged sober and discreet. I never read any book of that argument, nor yet met with man, that I have had the opportunity to confer with, but was able of his own knowledg to say somewhat whereby my belief of these things might be confirmed.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Epicureans</hi> (of all Philosophers the most inconsiderable in matters of knowledg, as former ages have described them) no man need to wonder if they denyed those things which by <hi>the solemn engagement of their Sect</hi> they were bound and resolved, notwithstanding any sight or sense, experience or evidence to the contrary, not to believe, at least not to acknowledg. This doth clearly appear by one that may be believed (though I have met with it in more) in such things. <hi>Lucian</hi> (himself a profest <hi>Epicurean</hi> Atheist) who doth commend <hi>Democritus, Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Met rodorus</hi> (the most famous of that Sect) for their <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> as he calls it, their <hi>fixed, irrevokeable, unconquerable resolution,</hi> when they saw any strange thing that by others vvas admired as miraculous, if they could find the cause or give a probable guesse, vvell and good, if not, yet not to depart from their first resolution, and still to believe and to maintain that it vvas false and impossible: It is a notable passage, and vvhich excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent use may be made of. I vvill therefore set dovvn his ovvn vvords for their sake that understand the Language: ‚Äî <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>As for <hi>Aristotle,</hi> I confesse his authority is very great with me; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am superstitiously addicted to any of his opinions, which I shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ready to forsake when better shall be shewed unto me. but because
<pb facs="tcp:49588:6"/>
(besides the judgment of all accounted wise and learned in former ages) I am convicted in my judgment, that so much solid reason in all Arts and Sciences never issued from mortal man (known unto us by his writings) without supernatural illumination. Well: <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth not acknowledg <hi>Spirits,</hi> he mentions them not in any place.

               </gap> and purpose of <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Phylosophy? He lived when <hi>Plato</hi> lived; he had been his fellow Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler under <hi>Socrates,</hi> and for some time his Scholer; but afterwards he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his <hi>aemulus,</hi> and pleased himself very much to oppose his Doctrine, insomuch as he is censured by some Ancients for his ingratitude. The truth is, <hi>Plato's</hi> writings are full of Prodigies, Apparitions of Souls, pains of Hell and Purgatory, Revelations of the gods, and the like. Wherein he is so bold that he is fain to excuse himself sometimes, and doth not desire that any man should believe him, according to the letter of his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but in grosse only, that somewhat was true to that effect. Indeed he hath many divine passages, yea, whole Treatises, that can never be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently admired in their kind; but too full of tales, for a Phylosopher, it cannot be denyed. <hi>Aristotle</hi> therefore resolved upon a quite contrary way: He would meddle with nothing but what had some apparent ground in Nature. Not that he precisely denyed all other things, but because he did not think that it was the part of a Phylosopher to meddle with those things that no probable reason could be given of.

               </gap> that he did not deny Witches, may appear by that mention he makes of them in more then one place. How much he ascribed to common report and experience, though no reason could be given, doth appear by his 'reface to his Treatise <hi>De Divinatione per insomnia:</hi> where he proposeth the case, how hard it is for a rational man to believe any thing upon report which he can see no reason for; nay, which seemeth contrary to reason: as, for a man to foretel by dream what shall happen in another Kingdome far off without any apparent cause. But on the other side, saith he, not less hard to deny that which all men, or most men, do believe, to wit, that there be such predictions. For to say (his own words) that such dreams come from God, besides what else might be objected (which might easily be understood by them that understand his Doctrine) it is most unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to believe that God would send them to men either vitious in their lives, or idiots and fools, of all men the most vile and contemptible, who have been observed to have such dreams oftner then better and wiser men. So leaving the businesse undetermined, he doth proceed to the consideration of those Prophetick dreams, for which some probable reason may be given. Yet in the second Chapter he saith directly, That though dreams be not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I will not enquire further into the meaning of these words; it is not to be done in few words. It plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that nothing troubled him so much (for he repeats the objection twice or thrice) as that God should be thought to favour either wicked men or fools. I wish no worse Doctrine had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been Printed or Preached concerning God. But still let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that he knew of no Divine Word or Revelation. Yet <hi>Jul. Scaliger</hi> in his Commentaries upon <hi>Hypocrates De Insomniis,</hi> doth wonder that <hi>Aristotle</hi> should stick so much at this, and seems himself to give a reason grounded in Nature. Indeed he saith somewhat as to the case of fools and idiots, but nothing (that I remember) that reacheth to wicked men also. Let these things be considered, and let the Reader judge of how different tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Aristotle</hi> was from that of ancient or later <hi>Epicures.</hi> This mention of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> puts me in mind of <hi>Socrates</hi> their Master, <hi>his Familiar Spirit;</hi> no Shape but a Voice only, by which his life and actions were much directed. The thing is attested by so many, so grave Authors where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some lived at the very time, others not long after, or in times not very remote, that I know not how it can be questioned by any man. Neither indeed is it, that I remember, by any Heathens or Christians of ancient times, and there have been books written of it, divers, in Greek and Latine, whereof some are yet extant. But whether it were a good Spirit or an evil, some men have doubted, and it is free for any man to think what he pleaseth of it. For my part I ever had a Reverend opinion of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49588:7"/>
and do believe (if there be no impiety in it, as I hope not) that he was, as among Heathens in some respect, a fore-runner of Christ, to dispose them the better when the time should come to imbrace (and it did it effectually) the Gospel. Many other Phylosophers, that have been of greatest fame, were certainly great Magicians, as <hi>Orpheus, Pythagoras, Empedocles,</hi> and the like, as by those things that have been written of them by several ancient authors may be collected. But above all I give the pre-eminence to <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius Thianeus,</hi> a man of later times, and of whom we may speak with more confidence and certainty. This was the man whom ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens very tenacious of their former worship and superstitions, did pitch upon to oppose unto Christ. His Life hath been written by divers, four of them were joyned together and opposed to the four Gospels: and <hi>Hierocles,</hi> a famous Phylosopher of those times, made a Collation of his Miracles with those of Christs, who was answered by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> yet extant. Sure it is, they prevailed so much, that he was for a long time worshipped by many, and in sundry places as a very God; yea, by some Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, as we find in History. <hi>Philostratus</hi> hath written his Life in very Elegant stile (as <hi>Photius</hi> judged) in 8 books, which are extant. And though they contain many fabulous things, as any man may expect by the undertaking, yet have they so much truth and variety of ancient learning, that I think they deserve to be better known then commonly they are; but cannot be understood, I am sure, as they should be, by any transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either Latine or French that ever I saw: For the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition, though it boast of great things (as the manner is) yet how Tittle was performed may easily appear unto any that will take the pains to compare it with the former edition of <hi>Aldus:</hi> Which I speak not to find fault, but because I wish that some able man would undertake the work; there is not any book, by the Translations yet extant, that more needeth it. What use <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> made of him, may appear by his frequent quotations in his Notes upon <hi>Eusebius,</hi> in the History of those times. As for <hi>Appollonius</hi> his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or wonderful Acts (which is our businesse here) though many things have been added, some, probably, done by Imposture, yet I do not see how it can be doubted but he did many strange things by the help of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> which things may be judged by due observation of circumstances; as for example, That being convented before <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperor in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of many, he presently vanished and was seen a great way off (at <hi>Pute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oli</hi> I think) about the same time. That at the very time when <hi>Domitian</hi> was killed at <hi>Rome,</hi> he spake of it publickly and of the manner of it at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus:</hi> and so of many others, which seem to me (as unto most) almost unquestionable. The greatest wonder to me is, that such was his port and outward appearance of Sanctity aud Simplicity, that even Christians have thought reverently of him, and believed that he did his wonders by the power of God, or by secret Philosophy and knowledg of Nature not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto other men. So <hi>Justine Martyr,</hi> one of the ancient Fathers of the Church judged of him, as is well known. Most later Phylosophers that lived about <hi>Julians</hi> time, and before that, as also the Emperors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, many of them, were great Magicians and <hi>Necromancers,</hi> as may
<pb facs="tcp:49588:8"/>
easily appear, partly by their own writings, and partly by the History of those times.</p>
            <p>I do very much wonder whether any man, being a Scholer, and not strongly prepossessed, that doth not believe <hi>Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. can say that he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read the books of Tryals and Confessions of Witches and Wizards, such I mean, as have been written by learned and judicious men. Such as, for example, I account <hi>Nichol. Remigius,</hi> his <hi>Demonolatria: ex judiciis capitalibus</hi> 900 <hi>plus minus hominum,</hi> &amp;c. grounded especially upon the Confessions and Condemnations of no lesse then 900 men and women in <hi>Lorraine</hi> within the compasse of few years. That he was a learned man, I think no body will deny that hath read him; and that he was no very credulous and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious man (though a Papist) that also is most certain: and I have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at his liberty many times. I know not how it is now in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but by what I have read and heard of the doings of Witches and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers in <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> in former times <q>(I could say somewhat of my self, how my life was preserved there very strangely, but my witnesses are not, and I will not bring their credit in question for such a businesse.)</q> I am of opinion, That he that should have maintained there that there was no such thing as Witches, or Spirits, &amp;c. would have been thought by most either mad and brain-sick (so frequent and visible were the effects to sober eyes) or a Witch himself. For indeed it is ordinary enough, that those that are so really, are very willing (which deceiveth many) to be thought Impostors, and there is good reason for it: I should sooner sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him an Impostor that doth professe himself (except it be by way of confession, as many have done) and is ambitious to be counted a Witch or Sorcerer. I remember I saw a book some years ago, intituled, <hi>De l'incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance des mauvais Anges &amp; Demons,</hi> printed at <hi>Paris</hi> 1612. in <hi>quarto,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the same Author, and size, intituled, <hi>L'incredulite &amp; mescreauce du sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilege, Paris</hi> 1642. Strange stories are told there of a Province of <hi>France,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time (or little before) marvellously infested with Witches and Sorcerers, insomuch that people did not know one another (in some one place) in the streets, by reason of evil Spirits appearing publickly in the shape of men; and that the proceedings of justice (which doth not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen often) were sometimes disturbed by them. I think the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was one that was sent to the place by the King with some authority, and to make report. But as I do not altogether trust my memory, having had but a sight of the books (it was at the <hi>Bell</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard:) So I beseech the Reader not to rest upon this account that I give him upon my best remembrance, but to peruse the books himself. I am confident he may receive good satisfaction, being things that were not done in a corner, but very publickly and well attested as I remember. However the reader must give me leave (though it be not to this purpose, lest my si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence <note place="margin">Tom 11. p. 608. Mer. Cas. <hi>Pietas.</hi>
               </note> be drawn to the prejudice of the truth) to tell him, that I met with one great falshood there concerning my own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (of <hi>Bl. M.</hi>) which I have abundantly refuted, and all others of that nature, when I was yet very young. But that (as I conceive) which in all these stories would most puzzle a rational man, is the signes which are set
<pb facs="tcp:49588:8"/>
down by many how witches may be known, as <hi>Teats, swimming upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, dry eyes,</hi> and the like: which things indeed have some ground of truth, being limited to particular times and places, but are not of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Voss.</hi> de Idolol. 111. 180, 181.</note> general application. Mr. <hi>Vossius</hi> had therefore reason to find fault with <hi>Springerus</hi> and <hi>Bodinus</hi> for making that a certain token of a Witch that she cannot weep. Who also in the same place doth well except against the tryal of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> as he calls it (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, <hi>purgatio per aquam frigidam</hi>) condemned by many. But he had done well to have limited his exception, and to have shewed how, and when, and how far such observations may be used. Forcertainly they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to be neglected. But the reasons of such observations or marks that are given by some, are so ridiculous, that they would make a sober man (that hath not patience enough to ponder all things diligently) to suspect all the rest. So one tels us, That when the Cock croweth the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn meetings of Witches (which opinion perchance may prove ancient enough, as we shall shew elsewhere) are dissolved: and he thinks a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may be because of the crowing of the Cock in the Gospel, when St. <hi>Peter</hi> denyed Christ. Another tells us, That Witches being well beaten <hi>trunco vitis</hi> (with a Vine stick or club) <hi>Maleficia illata solvere saevillina coguntur,</hi> have no more force to do hurt, or, that the party bewitched recovereth. And the reason (he thinks, and yet he no ordinary man neither) <hi>ex mysterio vini &amp; vineae dilectae Deo, ex cujus mysterio</hi> 
               <note place="margin">So in my Copy, it may be it should be, <hi>vitis &amp; vin.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>quotidie Sacramentum Sacrosancti Sanguinis Domini conficitur,</hi> &amp;c. But I shall have a more proper place for the full examination of these things in one of the two Treatises before mentioned. It cannot be denyed but this whole businesse of Witches, what through ignorance, what through malice, is very lyable to many mistakes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers impostures. And it were to be wished that in all such Trials some prudent Divines, and learned experienced Physicians might be joyned. But hence to conclude with <hi>Wierius</hi> (who neverthelesse doth acknowledg <hi>Spirits,</hi> and the Illusions and Apparitions of Divels, and their mischiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opperations as much as any, and tells as strange things of them) and some others, that therefore there are no Witches and Sorcerers, is as if a man should deny the power of herbs because a thousand things have been written of them of old, and are yet daily falsely and superstitiously. And indeed it so fell out once in <hi>Rome,</hi> as by <hi>Plinie</hi> is recorded at large, Where when some ascribed such power unto Herbs, as though Sun and Moon had been subject unto them, the dead might be raised, armies vanquished, and what not! which was not very well relished by many: at last came <hi>Ascle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades,</hi> who perswaded men that were very well disposed to be perswaded, that all Physical use of Herbs and Simples was a meer cheat, and that men were better want them, there being other means easier and lesse trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to restore health and overcome diseases, which he professed to teach: and prevailed so far for a while, that they were laid aside, and a new course of Physick introduced. Which for a while, as I said, (so prone are men commonly to entertain new divices) gave good content generally. It is well observed by <hi>Aristotle</hi> (and I think a great part of humane wisdome
<pb facs="tcp:49588:9"/>
dependeth on it) that in all things of the world that are commendable, as there is somewhat which is true and real, so somewhat also which is counterfeit and false. There is beauty Natural, saith he, and there is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial beauty by painting and trimming. A true, sound, healthy complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and that which makes a good shew, but is not sound. True, real gold and silver, but divers things also that may be taken for gold and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at a distance, or by them that judge at the outward appearance. So, true, sound Ratiocination, and that which seems so to the unlearned, or to corrupt judgments, though it be very false. They that consider well of this, may the sooner come to the knowledg of truth in all things.</p>
            <p>Well: we go on.</p>
            <p>There was in <hi>Aix (Aquae Sextiae</hi> anciently, now <hi>Aquensis Civitas</hi>) in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi> (a County of <hi>France</hi> so called) in the year of the Lord 1611. a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Priest tryed, convicted, and by Sentence of the Court or Parliament condemned to be burned alive for abominable practises, and horrid things by him upon divers (some persons of quality) committed with and by the Divel. He had long desired it and sought it; at last the divel appeared to him in the habit of a Gentleman. The story is in divers books, <hi>French</hi> and Latine, and translated (at that time I believe) in divers languages. I would goe forty miles with all my heart to meet with that man that could tell me any thing whereby I might but probably be induced to believe, or at least to suspect, that there might be some mistake in the particulars of his Sentence. For my reason, I must confesse, was never more posed in any thing that ever I read of that nature. <hi>Gassendus</hi> indeed in <hi>Pereskius</hi> his life, hath somewhat (as I remember) of <hi>Pereskius</hi> his Opinion, as if he thought some of those things he confessed might be ascribed unto imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but I see no reason given: neither are the things of that nature, that can admit any such suspicion. Besides, <hi>Tristan, of the Lives of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and their Coynes,</hi> will tell you somewhat which may make a doubt, whether <hi>Gassendus</hi> ought to be believed in all things that he reporteth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that famous man. I am not very much satisfied of what Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (though truly a very learned man) <hi>Gassendus</hi> was. And by the way (which is somewhat to the case of Witches in general) if I be not mistak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en (for I have it not at this time) there is a relation in that very book of somewhat that hapned to <hi>Pereskius</hi> by Witches when he was a child. That wicked Sorcerer which was burned at <hi>Aix,</hi> foretold before his death that some misfortune would be done at the time and place of his execution, which hapned accordingly, and very strangely too. Somewhat again, I must confesse, I have seen printed (<hi>Mimica Diaboli,</hi> &amp;c.) to take away the scandal of some part of his confession, or the Devils saying of Masse, &amp;c. some part of which things might perchance with some colour be ascribed to imagination: but that is not it that troubles me. But enough of him</p>
            <p>What man is he, that pretends to learning, that hath not heard, and doth not honour the memory of <hi>Joachimus Camerarius,</hi> that great light of <hi>Germany?</hi> so wise (and for his wisdom, and other excellent parts, sought unto by many Princes) so moderate a man (an excellent temper for the

The strangest relations that ever I read, or at least as strange as any I have read of Witches, and Sorcerers, and Spirits, I have read in him: such as either upon his own knowledge he doth relate, or such as he believed true upon the testimonie of others known unto him. The last work that he ever went about for the publick was, <hi>De generibus Divinationum,</hi> but he did not live (the more the pity) to make an end of it.

Here I could come in with a whole cloud of witnesses, name hundreds of men of all Nations and professions that have lived within this last hundred years, and not any among them but such as have had, and have yet generally the reputation of Honest, Sober, Learned and Judicious, who all have been of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we maintain. But because we have to do with them especially who by their Profession pretend to the Knowledge of Nature above other men, I will confine my self for further testimony to them that have been of that Profession. I have been somewhat curious for one of my Calling, that had no other end but to attain to some Knowledge of Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which a man may quickly be lead into manifold delusions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures. I have read some, looked into many I do not remember I have met with any professed Physician or Naturalist (some one or two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which have been or shall be named) who made any question of these things. Sure I am, I have met with divers strange relations in sundry of them, of things that themselves were present at, and saw with their own eyes, where they could have no end, that any man can probably suspect, but to acknowledge the truth, though with some disparagement to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (according to the judgment of many) in the free confession of their own ignorance and disability to give reasons, and to penetrate into causes. Well: what then shall we say to such as <hi>Jul. Caesar, Scaliger, Fernelius, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus,</hi> the wonders and Oracles of their times?

There is one, whom I think inferiour to none, though perchance not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known or read, and that is, <hi>Georgius Raqusaius</hi> a Venetian, who by his first education and profession was an Astrologer, cast many Nativities, and took upon him to Prognosticate; but afterwards conscious to himself of the vanity of the Art (that is, when the Divel doth not intermeddle, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes must be understood: for some Astrologers have been Magicians withall, and have done strange things) gave it over, and hath written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it very Learnedly and Solidly.

But I must not omit the Learned Author that set out <hi>Musoeum Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nense,</hi> a great Naturalist and a Physician too; he handles it at the end of that work somewhat roundly and to the quick, I must confesse, but very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and Solidly, in my judgment, against those pretended Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticians, that would be thought to defend the opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> herein. I could say somewhat of ancienter Physicianstoo, and give some account of those many Spels and Charmes that are in <hi>Trallienus,</hi> in all his books; an ancicnt Physician, in high esteeme with some eminent Physicians of these late times, as they themselves have told me; though not for his Charms, but for his other learning and excellent experience, which they had found good use of But this I reserve for another place &amp; work. And this men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that eminent Physician who commended <hi>Trallienus</hi> unto me, puts me in mind of what he imparted himself, not long before his death, of his own knowledge and experience; and particularly of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Hitherto I have gone by Authorities rather then Arguments, partly because I thought that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and the clearest way for every bodies capacity, and partly, because such Arguments (if any besides these we have here) as have been used against this opinion, may be found fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in those I have cited. The truth is, it is a Subject of that nature as doth not admit of many Arguments, such especially as may pretend to subtilty of Reason, Sight, Sense, and Experience (upon which most Humane Knowledge is grounded) generally approved and certain, is our best Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. But before I give over, I will use one Argument which perchance may prove of some force and validity, and that is, A consideration of the strange shifts and evasions and notorious absurdities that these men are put

to, who not being able to deny the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> would seem to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rather then to acknowledg Spirits, and Divels, and Witchcraft. <hi>Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> who hath not heard of? I once had the book, I know not now what is become of it. But I remember well, I never was more weary of reading then when I read him; nothing that ever I read or heard of <hi>Legends</hi> and old womans tales did seem to me more groundlesse and incredible. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those men bear themselves very much upon the power of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which indeed is very great, and doth produce strange effects) I shall commend to the sober Reader that hath not yet met with him, <hi>Tho. Eienus</hi> his Learned Tractat, <hi>De Viribus Imaginationis,</hi> a very Rational and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical discourse. Of their miserable shifts and evasions in general, the Author or Observator rather of <hi>Musaeum Veronense,</hi> before quoted, will give you a good account. I have at this present in my hands the writings of a Physician, <hi>Augerius Ferrerius</hi> by name. What he was for a Physician I know not; all (I doubt) of that profession will not allow very well of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his <hi>Castigationes Practicae Medicinae,</hi> whatever they think of the <hi>Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationes</hi> themselves. But in general, his Stile, and various reading, and knowledge of good Authors, speak him a Learned man sufficiently. <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> in his History gives him a most ample <hi>Elogium,</hi> and makes him to have been <hi>Jul. C. Scaliger</hi> his intimate acquaintance and much respected by him. But I doubt whether <hi>Thuanus</hi> had ever seen this book of his: it doth not appear by that <hi>Elogium</hi> that he had. Well, this Learned man in his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>De Homerica</hi> (so he calls it) <hi>Medicatione,</hi> where he treats of cures done by Charms and Spels, by Words and Characters, which others impute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to Witchcraft: first, for the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> he doth not deny it: (<hi>Nam iis quae senfibus exposita sunt contravenire, sani <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> non est.</hi>) He thinks them little better then mad men that will deny that which is approved by so visible experience. Yet it seems he was one of them that did not believe, or would not believe (though he doth not say so positively) <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> and Supernatural Operations. What then? he plainly maintaineth and argueth it (though he quote no Gospel for it) that such is the nature of the Soul of man (if he know how to use it) that by a strong faith and confidence it may work any miracle without a miracle: <hi>Verum confidentia illa, ac firma persuasio</hi> (that you may have some of his words if you have not the book) <hi>comparatur indoctis animis per opinionem quam de Caracteribus &amp; sacris verbis conceperunt. Doctis &amp; rerum intelligentiam habentibus, nihil opus est externi, sed cognit√¢ vi animi, per eam miracula edere possunt. &amp;c.</hi> And again alittle after, <hi>Doctus ver√≥ &amp; sibi constans solo verbo sanabit.</hi> I do not hence conclude that this <hi>Ferrerius,</hi> though he speak as though he were, and names no body else, that he was the first or only that hath been of this opinion. <hi>Avicenne</hi> the Arab was the first, as I take it, that set it on foot: some others have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him in it. But since these men acknowledg the strange effects that others deny, let the sober Reader judge whether of the two more likely to grant <hi>Spirits</hi> and Divels, or to make the Soul of man (of every man, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally) either a God or a Divel. But let men take heed how they attempt to do Miracles by their strong faith and confidence, for that is the ready way to bring the Divel unto them, and that is it which hath made many Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb facs="tcp:49588:11"/>
and Sorcerers. As for that Faith whereby men did work Miracles in the Primitive times, spoken of in the Gospel, commonly called, <hi>The Faith of Miracles,</hi> that is quite another thing, which I shall not need to speak of in this place. Of a strong confidence in God, even in them that are not otherwise very godly, whether it may not, according to Gods first order and appointment, produce sometimes some strange effects; we have had a consideration elsewhere, where we treat of <hi>Precatorie Enthusiasm.</hi> But this also is quite another thing, as may appear by what we have written of it.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this part; upon due consideration of the premises, and what else I have in readinesse upon the same Subject (if God give me life and health) I cannot satisfie my self how any Learned man, sober and rational, can entertain such an opinion (simply and seriously) That there be no <hi>Divels</hi> nor <hi>Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. But upon this account which I give my self (leaving all men to their own judgments herein) that if there be any such truly and really, it must needs be because being at first prepossessed upon some plausible ground, and being afterwards taken up with other thoughts and employments, they are more willing to stick to their former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion without further trouble, then to take the pains to seek further. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> as <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi> doth very well observe. And when we say, <hi>A Learned man,</hi> there is much ambiguity in that word. For a man may be (not to speak of the ignorance of the common people, in those climates especially, who think all Learning concluded in preaching; and now in these times too, them best Preachers that in very deed have least Learning, but preach by <hi>Instinct</hi> and <hi>Inspiration,</hi> as they call it) but a man, I say, may be a <hi>Learned Man,</hi> a very Learned man in some one kind or profession, even to Excellency and Admiration, who neverthelesse is and may be found ignorant enough in other kinds: but a general Learned man is a thing of a vast extent, and not often seen. It is a businesse of an infinite labour, besides that it requireth Natural parts answerable; without which (judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment specially) the more pains sometimes the more ignorance. I aim not by this at any particular man or men (<hi>Deum testor</hi>) I would much rather submit to the censure of others my self, then take upon me to censure any; but the observation is of very good use, I know it, and may give much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in many cases, and have given an instance of it in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and some others elsewhere.</p>
            <p>I have done for this time; I come now to the Objections, wherein I shall not need to be very long, because they run much upon one thing, Imposture, which hath already been spoken of and answered. But yet somewhat more particularly shal be answered.</p>
            <p>First, Of <hi>Miracles.</hi> It cannot be denyed but the world is full of horrible Impostures in that particular: Yet I believe, that some supernatural things, as cures, &amp;c. do happen in every age, for which no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be given, which also for the strangenesse may be called Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. But if we limit (with most) the word to those things that proceed immediately from God or divine power: I shall not be
<pb facs="tcp:49588:11"/>
very ready to yield that many such Miracles are seen in these Dayes. But I will not further argue the Case in this place. Well, let us take <hi>Miracles</hi> in the ordinary Sense: I verily believe that many such things do happen in many places; but that through negligence partly, and partly through incredulity, they are not regarded oftentimes, or soon forgotten. And wiser men, sometimes, though they know or believe such things, yet are not they very forward to tell them, lest they bring themselves into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with those supposed wise men, who will sooner laugh at any thing they do not understand, then take the pains to rectifie their ignorance or inform their judgments. I hope I shall do no wrong to the Memory of that Venerable, Incomparable Prelate, BISHOP ANDREWES, for Sound Learning and True Piety whilest he lived, one of the greatest Lights of this Land; if I set down two Stories, which we may call <hi>Miracles,</hi> both which he did believe to be true, but for one of them, it seemes, he did undertake upon his own knowledge: The one, concerning a noted, or at least by many suspected Witch or Sorceress, which the Divel, in a strange shape, did wait <hi>upon</hi> (or <hi>for</hi> rather) at her death. The other, concerning a man, who after his death was restored to life to make Confession of a horrible Murder committed upon his own Wife, for which he had never been suspected; both these, as he related them to my F. (in familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation) and my F. did enter them for a remebrance into some of his <hi>Adversaria.</hi> In the substance I believe there could be no mistake, but if there be any mistake in any Circumstances, as of Names, or otherwise, that must be imputed to my F. who was a stranger, not to the tongue only, but to all businesses (more then what might be known by printed books, and such publick wayes) of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>There is no necessity that any body should make of either of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations an Article of his Faith; yet I thought them very probable, because believed by such a man, and therefore have given them a place here. So much of <hi>Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of <hi>Exorcismes</hi> we must say as of <hi>Miracles.</hi> One notable example of a counterfeit Possession, and of great stirs likely to have insued upon it in <hi>France,</hi> we have out of <hi>Ihuanus,</hi> in our late <hi>Treatise of Enthusiasme. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Boy of Bilson</hi> is extant, who by the Wisdom and Sagacity of the R R F. in God <hi>Thomas,</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Lichfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> was discovered to be an Impostor on purpose set up and suborned to promote the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish cause, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1620. Such examples and stories most Countries have afforded good store, which are extant in divers Languages. Neither must it be concealed (by them that seek truth without partiality) that some, once called <hi>Disciplinarians,</hi> now more known by another name, have attempted to deal in those things, hoping thereby to gain great advantage to their cause. It was a famous Story in Q. <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Reign, though now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance out of the knowledg of many, and beyond the remembrance of any living, how one Mr. <hi>D.</hi> a very zealous man of that Sect, did take upon him by long prayers to cast out Divels, so maintained and asserted with great vehemency by him and some others that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>oured that cause, though upon legal examination they proved otherwise, which occasioned many books on both sides in those dayes, but two, <hi>melioris notae,</hi> as we say, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Dr. <hi>H.</hi> concerning <hi>Exorcismes;</hi> the one against Papists, the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>P.</hi> I have them both somewhere yet, I hope, but can not come at
<pb facs="tcp:49588:12"/>
them at this time, which is the cause that I cannot particularize that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse with circumstances of times, and names or persons as I would. But there were many other books written (some very big, which I have seen) about it, as I said before; so that the whole businesse, with very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, if any have a mind, may quickly be found out. One Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller in Little <hi>Britain</hi> did help me to the sight of six or seven at once; yet one of the books then written, and as I was told, upon this occasion much commended unto me by some very Learned, to wit, Dr. <hi>Jordan, of the Suffocation of the Matrix,</hi> I long sought before I could meet with it. And such was the ignorance of some Booksellers, that I could not perswade them there was any such book extant: but now at last I have got it. All the use I shall make of it at this time is, that whereas the whole dirft of the book tends unto this, to shew the error of many in ascribing natural diseases to supernatural causes, which might be thought by some to favour their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that believe not <hi>Witches,</hi> &amp;c. The Author doth very prudently and piously make this profession in the Preface, <hi>I do not deny but that God doth in these dayes work extraordinarily for the deliverance of his children, and for other ends best known to himself; and that among other there may be both possessions by the Divel, and obsessions, and Witch-craft,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and dispossession also through the Prayers and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of his servants, which is the only means left unto us for our relief in that case, but such examples being very rare now adayes,</hi> &amp;c. Yet for all this I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Mr. D. was guilty of any Imposture: he might do it through ignorance being cozened by others. I have heard he was an honest man, and dyed piously, and disclaimed to the very last that he did any thing in that businesse otherwise then <hi>Bon√¢ Fide.</hi> I would judge charitably, even of those men that are not guilty of much charity towards others, whose judgments and consciences will not suffer them (though men of approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worth and piety otherwise) to say as they say, and to do as they do in all things. Be it granted therefore, that this businesse of <hi>Exorcismes</hi> is ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to much Imposture: however, no man that hatho read the relations of men and women possest, in several places, with due observation of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, some of which relations, besides other persons of credit, have been attested; yea, some penned and published by learned Physicians and Naturalists, who have been employed about the Cure, observed their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, heard some of them speak strange Languages: silly women possest, discourse of highest points of Phylosophy, or the Mathematicks and the like. No man, I say, that is not a stranger to these things (besides what some Travellers, no way interessed in the cause, can aver upon their own knowledge) will make any question either of the real possession of divers, according to relations that have been made, or of the Divels speaking in them and by them when they have been Exorcised; and sometimes upon bare conference. And though some Protestants are of opinion, That it is not lawful or warrantable for any man to take upon him to Exorcise upon such occasions, that is, (as I conceive) by way of absolute power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and by superstitious wayes and means, as is ordinarily done: Yet where a man hath a Calling, as if he be lawfully Called to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and set over such a Parish where any happen to be possessed (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

            <p>In English (for their sakes that understand no Latine, and that it be not required alwayes, for it would be very tedious) this is the effect, At such a time, in such a place, he had the opportunity to meet with a grave (whether Lady or Gentlewoman) Matron, one he had a very good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of; her name <hi>M. de St. Pons,</hi> and having often heard by common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a certain Protestant Minister that was said to cast out Divels, he did accurately inform himself by her (she living, it seems, very near, if not in the same parish) of all particulars concerning that businesse; who did averre it to be most true, and that ten, or thereabonts, Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacks, or possessed men (all making profession of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion) had been brought to the Church (at several times, as I take it) and that publickly, and by the generall confession of all then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and by some notable signes (sometimes) at the going out of the Devils; they were, upon his Praying after Sermon, all delivered. But that he took it very hainously if any said, that he had cast out Devils; For, not I, said he, but the earnest Prayers of the Church, have prevailed with Almighty God to work this wonderful thing.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Oracles:</hi> It is true, Heathens themselves acknowledg, that some
<pb facs="tcp:49588:13"/>
were the jugglings of men. Sometimes Princes; sometimes private men: (as now of Religion, of Preaching, and Praying, and Fasting; of Masses and Processions: most Princes and States in all places) made good use of them to their owne ends; and made them speak what themselves had prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted. But a man might as probably argue; because some have been so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged to have been by compact and subornation, it is the more likely, that those of which never any suspicion was, should be true. We read of many in <hi>Herodotus:</hi> of one, which was contrived by fraud; but there we read also, that when it came to be known (though care had been taken that it might not:) the chief Contriver, a great man, was banished, or prevented worse, by a voluntary Exile; and the <hi>Sacred Virgin</hi> or <hi>Prophetesse,</hi> deposed. But not to insist upon particulars, which would be long, it is most certain, and it will cleerly appear unto them that are well read in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edest Authors and Histories, That all Heathens, generally the wisest and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edest of them, those especially, that lived when Oracles were most frequent, did really believe them to be, which they pretended unto: and that they were so indeed, for the most part (taking it for granted that their Gods were <hi>Divels</hi> or <hi>Evil Spirits</hi>) by many circumstances of Stories, and by other good proofs, may be made as evident: neither was it ever doubted or denyed (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes granted and presupposed, that, as in all worldly things, much impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture did in tervene and intermingle) by ancient Christians acknowledged, I am sure, by most, if not all. But I have spoken of them elsewhere already, and therefore will be the shorter here.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>last Objection</hi> was: If there be <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> Why do they not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto them, who do what they can, as by continual curses, so by profane curiosity to invite them? First, We say, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> When we have good ground for the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> to stick at the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we do not understand the reason, is as much as to say, that we think we should be as wise as God. <hi>Aristotle</hi> did not meddle with things that he could give no reason of; yet he did not deny them (as we have shewed) and it is one thing to require a reason of things meerly natural; and another of those that happen by a meer secret Providence. But this will give them no great satisfaction who perchance believe a God (some) as much as they believe a Devil. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Therefore we say, There may be some natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son too, upon <hi>Aristotles</hi> grounds. <hi>Aristotle</hi> (as hath been shewed elsewhere) compares the effects of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> from whence he deriveth all kind of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm,</hi> to the known effects of <hi>Wine.</hi> What is the reason, that some men with little wine will quickly be drunk, and become other Creatures, being deprived for the time of the use of reason? Others though they drink ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much, will sooner burst then reel, or speak idly. as some in their excess grow merry, others sad: some calm and better natured; others furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: some talkative, others stupid. The Devil knowes what tempers are best for his turn; and by some in whom he was deceived, he hath got no credit, and wished he had never meddled with them. Some men come into the world with <hi>Cabalistical Brains;</hi> their heads are full of mysteries; they see nothing, they read nothing, but their brain is on work to pick somewhat out of it that is not ordinary; and out of the very <hi>ABC</hi> that children are taught, rather then fail, they will fetch all the Secrets of Gods Wisdom; tell
<pb facs="tcp:49588:14"/>
you how the world was created, how governed, and what will be the end of all things. Reason and Sense that other men go by, they think the acorns that the old world fed upon; fools and children may be content with them but they see into things by another <hi>Light.</hi> They commonly give good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (till they come to profest <hi>Anabaptists</hi>) because they believe them the Word of God and not of men; but they reserve unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Interpretation, and so under the title of <hi>Divine Scripture,</hi> worship what their own phansie prompts, or the devil puts into their heads. But of all <hi>Scriptures</hi> the <hi>Revelation</hi> and the obscure Prophesies are their delight; for there they rove securely; and there is not any thing so prodigious or chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical, but they can fetch it out of some Prophesie, as they will interpret it. These men, if they be upright in their lives and dealings, and fear God tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is to be hoped that God will preserve them from further evil; but they are of a dangerous temper; Charitable men will pity them, and sober men will avoid them. On the other side, some there are whose brains are of a stiff and restive mould; it will not easily receive new impressions. They will hardly believe any thing but what they see; and yet rather not believe their eyes; then to believe any thing that is not according to the course of nature, and what they have been used unto. The devil may tempt such by sensual baits, and catch them; but he will not easily attempt to delude them by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Shews and Apparitions. And what sober man, that believeth as a God, so a divel, doth doubt, but they that make it their daily practice to damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by such horrid oaths and curses, are as really possest, yea far more in the possession of the devil, then many that foam at the mouth, and speak strange languages?</p>
            <p>But 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> Some have tried and used the means, but could never see any thing but what if others that never desired it really, but in some wanton curiosity, unadvisedly, that they might be the better able to confute the simplicity of some others as they thought, rather then that their faith wanted any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, have tryed some things, or have been present at some experiments and have seen (with no small astonishment) more then they expected or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired? Some persons of credit and quality, I am sure, have made it their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession unto me, that it hath so hapned unto them; who have been so affected with it, that they would not for a world be so surprized again.</p>
            <p>But 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> and lastly, The Confessions of some <hi>Magicians</hi> are extant in print, who tell very particularly what means they used, what books they read, &amp;c. and they saw and found (if we believe them; and what should tempt them to lye, no melancholy men, I know not) till they were weary, and Gods grace wrought upon their hearts to bring them to repentance. There be such confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions extant, but the Reader shal pardon me, if I give him no further account. It would much better becom them therefore, that have made such essays with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out successe, to repent, and to be thankful unto God, then to make that an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that theres no divel, and perchance no God. There is a terrible say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (if well understood) in the Scripture; <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I Come now to Dr. DEE, and to <hi>This Book</hi> of his, which hath been the occasion of all the Discourse hitherto. As for his Person or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, Education and the like, I have but little to say more then what he saith himself in his first Letter to the Emperor (RODOLPHE) of <hi>Germany,</hi> that being yet very young he was sought unto (<hi>ambiverunt me</hi>) by two Emperors, CHARLS the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and FERDINANDO his Brother and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor in the Empire. Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> indeed in the year 1572 makes honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mention of him, and calls him, <hi>Nobilis Mathematicus.</hi> He dedicated his <hi>Monas Hieroglyphica</hi> to MAXIMILIAN Successor to FERDINANDO, first printed at <hi>Antwerp, An. Dom.</hi> 1564. and afterwards at <hi>Francford,</hi> 1591. and what other places I know not. In the year 1595. he did write (and was printed 1599 I am sure, but whether before that or no, I cannot certainly tell) <hi>A discourse Apologetical,</hi> &amp;c. directed to the then <hi>Archbishop of Canterbury,</hi> wherein he hath a Catalogue of books written by himself, printed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, to the number of 48. in all, and doth also mention the books of his Library about 4000 volums in all, whereof 700 ancient Manuscripts, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. There also doth he produce a Testimony of the University of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> dated 1548. But this whole Discourse of his being but short, for the better satisfaction of the Reader, I thought good to have it here reprinted the next after this Preface. His <hi>Mathematical Preface</hi> before <hi>Euclid,</hi> is that I think which of all his writings published hath been most taken notice of in <hi>England,</hi> and added much to the worth and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Edition of <hi>Euclid.</hi> He was a married man and divers children, as will appear by this Relation; a great Traveller, and lived to a great age. But as I said before, I do not pretend to give an account of his life in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, unto others, which my self am yet a stranger to. What concerneth this <hi>Relation</hi> I am to give an account, and I hope there shall be nothing wanting to that. Four things I propose to my self to that end,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Somewhat to confirm the truth and sincerity of this whole <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To answer some Objections that may be made against some parts of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To give some light to some places, and to satisfie the Reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the perfection and imperfection of the book, as also, concerning the Original Copy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and lastly, To shew the many good uses that may be made of all by a sober Christian.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It seems that Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> began to have the reputation of a <hi>Conjurer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. He doth very grievously complain of it in that <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Euclid</hi> but now spoken of, about the end of it, and yet there doth also term himself, <hi>An old forworn Mathematician.</hi> For my part whether he could ever truly be so called, I yet make some question: But I am very confident, that himself did not know or think himself so, but a zealous worshipper of God, and a very free and sincere Christian. How this is to be reconciled with the truth of this <hi>Relation,</hi> shall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards considered of. For the truth and sincerity of the <hi>Relation,</hi> I hope
<pb facs="tcp:49588:15"/>
no body will so grosly mistake us as though we intended thereby to justifie what is here printed against any suspition of forgery; as if any man taking the advantage of Dr. <hi>Dees</hi> name and fame of a <hi>Conjurer,</hi> could be suspected to have devised and invented these things in his own brain to abuse the world. I should be sorry my name should appear in any kind to any book lyable to such a suspition; and the very name and credit of that so much and so deservedly prized <hi>Library</hi> from whence this is pretended to be taken, is sufficient (with civil under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing men) to prevent the grossenesse of such a mistake. Besides the Original Copy it self, all written with Dr. <hi>Dees</hi> own hand, there kept and preserved. But by <hi>Truth and Sincerity,</hi> intending not only Dr. <hi>Dee's</hi> fidelity in relating what himself believed, but also the <hi>reality</hi> of those things that he speaks of, according to his relation: his only (but great and dreadful) error being, that he mistook false lying Spirits for Angels of Light, the Divel of Hell (as we commonly term him) for the God of Heaven. For the <hi>Truth</hi> then, and <hi>Sincerity</hi> or <hi>Reality</hi> of the <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in this sense, I shall first appeal to the Book it self. I know it is the fashion of many (I will not say that (I never did it my self) that are buyers of books, they will turn five or six leaves, if they happen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on somewhat that pleaseth their fancy, the book is a good book, and when they have bought it, it concerneth them to think so, because they have paid for it: but on the other side, if they light upon somewhat that doth not please (which may happen in the best) they are as ready to condemn and cast away. It is very possible that some such buyer lighting upon this, and in it, upon some places here and there, where some odd uncouth things may offer themselves; things ridiculous, incredible to ordinary sense and construction, he may be ready to judge of the whole accordingly. But for all this, I will in the first place appeal to the book it self; but with this respect to the Reader, that he will have patience to read in order one fourth part of the book at least before he judge; and if by that time he be not convicted, he shall have my good will to give it over. Not but that all the rest, even to the end, doth help very well to confirm the truth and reality of the whole Story: but because I think there is so much in any fourth part, if diligently read, and with due consideration, that I despair of his assent, that is not convicted by it. For my part, when the book was first communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Thomas cotton</hi> Knight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> me by that Right worthy Gentleman who is very studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to purchase and procure such Records and Monuments as may advantage the truth of God (all truth is of God) and the honour of this Land, following therein the example of his noble Progenitor, by his very name, Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> known to all the Learned as far as Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope extendeth. I read it cursorily because I was quickly convinced in my self that it could be no counterfeit immaginarie businesse, and was very desirous to see the end, so far as the book did go. Afterwards, when I understood that the said worthy Gentleman (especially, as I suppose, relying upon my <hi>Lord of Armagh's judgment and testimonie,</hi> which we have before spoken of) was willing it should be published, and that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb facs="tcp:49588:15"/>
the whole business unto me; I read it over very exactly, and took notes of the most remarkable passages (as they appeared unto me) truly I was so much confirmed in this first opinion by my second reading, that I shall not be afraid to profess that I never gave more credit to any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane History of former times. All things seemed unto me so simply, and yet so accurately, and with so much confirmation of all manner of circumstances written and delivered, that I cannot yet satisfie my self, but all judicious Readers will be of my opinion. But nevertheless, to help them that trust not much to their own judgments, let us see what can be said.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I would have them, that would be further satisfied, to read Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> in that forecited Preface, where he doth plead his own cause, to acquit himself of that grievous crime and imputation of a <hi>Conjurer.</hi> But that was written, I must confess, long before his Communication with Spirits: yet it is somewhat to know what opinion he had then of them that deal with Divels and evil Spirits. But after he was made acquainted, and in great dealings with them, and had in readiness divers of these his books, or others of the same Argument, containing their several conferences and communications, to shew, and the manner of their appearing exactly set down; observe, I pray, with what confidence he did address himself to the greatest and wisest in Europe. To Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> often, and to her Council, as by many places of this Relation doth appear; but more particularly by his Letter to Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> Secretary, &amp;c. That he did the like to King <hi>James</hi> and his Councel, may easily be gathered by the Records (in this <hi>Relation</hi>) of 1607. but much defective. But then to the Emperor <hi>Rodolphe,</hi> to <hi>Stephen</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and divers other Princes and their Deputies; the wisest and learnedst, their several Courts did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford for the time: the particulars of all which addresses and transactions are very exactly set down in the book. Nay, such was his confidence, that had it not been for the <hi>Nuncius Apostolicus</hi> his appearing against him at the Emperors Court by order from the Pope, he was, as by some places may be collected, resolved for <hi>Rome</hi> also, not doubting but he should approve himself and his doings to the Pope himself and his Cardinals. In all these his addresses and applications being still very ready to impart all things unto them that would entertain them with that respect he thought they deserved; yea, readily, which is very observable, even to receive them into this Mystical Society, whom he thought worthy, and in some capacity to promote the design; as <hi>de facto</hi> he did divers in several places: <hi>Albertus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasco,</hi> Prince Palatine of <hi>Polonia, Puccius</hi> a learned man, and Prince <hi>Rosem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who were long of the Society, besides some admitted to some Actions for a while, as <hi>Stephen</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and some others. We will easily grant (as elsewhere hath been treated and handled at large) that a distempered brain may see, yea, and hear strange things, and entertain them with all possible confidence, as real things, and yet all but fancy, without any real sound or Apparition. But these sights and Apparitions that Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> gives here an account, are quite of another nature; yea, though possibly the Divel might represent divers of these things to the fancy inwardly
<pb facs="tcp:49588:16"/>
which appeared outwardly: Yet of another nature, I say, and not without the intervention and operation of Spirits, as will easily appear to any man by the particulars. Besides the long Speeches, Discourses, Interlocutions upon all occasions and occurrences in the presence of more then one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; and externally audible to different persons, for the most part or very frequently. That these things could not be the operation of a distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Fancy, will be a sufficient evidence to any rational man.</p>
            <p>Again, let his usual preparations and Prayers against an Apparition or Action (as he called them) his extraordinary prayers upon some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occasions, as upon <hi>Edward Kelley</hi> his temporary repentance, and another for him when he was about to forsake him (in Latine a long one) <hi>Stephen</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> being then present. And again, when his Son <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> was to be initiated to these Mystical Operations and Apparitions, in the place of <hi>Edward Kelley,</hi> and the like. And again, his Humility, Piety, Patience, (O what pity that such a man should fall into such a delusion! but we shall consider of the causes in its right place afterwards) upon all occasions, temptations, distresses, most eminent throughout the whole Book. Let these things be well considered, and above the rest, his large and punctual relation of that sad abominable story of their <hi>Promiscuous, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Copulation,</hi> under the pretence of obedience to God. ‚Äî Let these things, I say, be well considered, and I think no man will make any question but the poor man did deal with all possible simplicity and sincerity, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of his understanding at that time. And truly, this one thing (as we said before) excepted, his mistaking of evil Spirits for good, it doth not appear by any thing but that he had his understanding, and the perfect use of his Reason to the very last, as well as he had had any time of his life.</p>
            <p>Again, let it be considered, that he carryed with him where ever he went A STONE, which he called his <hi>Angelicall Stone,</hi> as <hi>brought unto him by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, but by a Spirit sure enough,</hi> which he shewed unto many; to the Emperor among others, or the Emperors Deputy, Dr. <hi>Curts,</hi> as I remember: But more of this <hi>Stone</hi> afterwards. We may therefore conclude surely enough, That Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> in all this Relation did deal with all simplicity and sincerity. I shall only add, That whereas I used the word <hi>Reality</hi> before, concerning those things that appeared, according to this Relation: I would not be mistaken, as though I intended that whatsoever the Divel did seem to do or represent; it was <hi>Really</hi> and <hi>Substantially</hi> as it seemed and appeared, that would be a great and gross mistake. The very word <hi>Apparition</hi> doth rather import the contrary. All I understand by <hi>Reality,</hi> is, that what things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, they did so appear by the power and operation of Spirits, actually present and working, and were not the effects of a depraved fancy and imagination by meer natural causes. By which, strange things, I confess, may be presented and apprehended too, sometimes by the parties with all confidence, as we said before, though all be but fancy and imagination. But all circumstances well considered, make this Case here to be of another nature; and it may be it was the policy of these Spirits to joyn <hi>two</hi> of purpose in this business, to make the truth and reality of it the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable;
<pb facs="tcp:49588:16"/>
hoping (if God had given way) they should have passed, in time for good Spirits abroad generally, and then we should have seen what they would have made of it. From lesse beginnings, I am sure, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est confusions have proceeded and prevailed in the world, as we shall shew elsewhere. And since that in all this business, as we said but now, Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> did not deal alone, but had a constant Partner or Assistant, whom sometimes himself calleth his <hi>Seer,</hi> or <hi>Skryer,</hi> one by name <hi>Edward Kelly:</hi> it will be requisite before we proceed further, that we give some account of him also. According to Dr. <hi>Dee's</hi> own relation here, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1587. <hi>April</hi> 7. <hi>Trebonae:</hi> in the particulars of his Son <hi>Arthur's Consecration</hi> (after his manner, which he calls, <hi>His offering and presenting of him to the service of God:) Uriel</hi> (one of his chiefest Spirits) was the author of their <hi>Conjunction:</hi> but when and how it hapned (being but <hi>obiter</hi> mentioned there) we do not find any where; and more then what I find here I have nothing to say: For certain it is by this whole story, from the beginning to the end of it, that <hi>Kelley</hi> was a great Conjurer, one that daily conversed by such art as is used by ordinary Magicians, with evil Spirits, and knew them to be so. Yet I would suppose that he was one of the best sort of Magicians, that dealt with Spirits by a kind of <hi>Command</hi> (as is well known some do) and not by any <hi>Compact</hi> or agreement: this may probably be gathered from sundry places. But that he was a Conjurer, appearereth first by that, where he proffered to raise some evil Spirit before the Polish Prince Palatine, <hi>Albert Lasky</hi> (of whom more by and by) for a proof of his Art. But Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> would not suffer him to do it in his house. Wicked spirits are cast out of him to the number of 15. <hi>P.</hi> 32. But I make no great matter of that in point of proof, because all there upon his bare report only. But see <hi>p.</hi> 63. &amp;c. where it is laid to his charge, and he answereth for himself and his Spirits. See also where at last he yielded to bury not to burn his Magical books. But read his own confession (where you shall find him speak like one that knew very well what did belong to the Art) and the record made by Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> concerning a shrewd contest that hapned between Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> and him, (it was about some Magical things) wherein <hi>Edward Kelly</hi> carried himself so fiercely, that Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> being afraid of his life, was forced to call for help. Peruse well this place and I presume you will require no further light as to this particular concerning <hi>Kelly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the several <hi>Epistles</hi> (in Latin most) that will be found here, as also Narratives of several meetings and conferences, they carry so much light with them, being set out with so many remarkable circumstances of time, place, persons, &amp;c. that no man of judgment that hath any knowledge of the world, will or can make any scruple of the sincerity and fidelity of either reports or Deeds and monuments (such I account the Letters to be) herein contained. A man might with little labour (that had all kind of books at command) have found somewhat concerning most (outlandish) persons in them mentioned. I could not intend it, and I think it would have been a needless labour. If any make any question let them make search, I dare warrant it unto them they shall find all things to agree pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. But because <hi>Albert Lasky</hi> (next to <hi>Edward Kelley</hi>) is the man most
<pb facs="tcp:49588:17"/>
interressed in this story, I will give you some account of him out of Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> his <hi>Annals.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anno Dom. 1583.</hi> E Polonia, Russiae vicin√¢ hac aestate venit in Angliam ut Reginam inviseret, <hi>Albertus Alasco,</hi> Palatinus Siradiensis vir eruditus, corporis linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis barb√¢ promisissim√¢, vestitu decoro, &amp; pervenusto; qui perbenign√® ab ipsa nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libusque magnoque honore &amp; lautitiis, et ab Accademia Oxoniensi eruditis oblectationibus, atque variis spectaculis exceptus, post. <hi>4.</hi> menses aere alieno oppressus, clam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessit.</p>
            <p>But of all Letters here exhibited, I am most taken, I must confess, with the Bishops Letter that was <hi>Nuncius Apostolicus:</hi> he seemes to me to speak to the case very pertinently (take <hi>Puccius</hi> his account along in his long letter to Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> of his conference with the said Bishop concerning the same business) and to have carryed himself towards Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> very moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and friendly.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Now to Objections:</p>
            <p>The first shall be this: Although 'tis very probable that Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self dealt simply and sincerely; yet since he himself saw nothing (for so himself acknowledgeth in some places) but by <hi>Kelley's</hi> eyes, and heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but with his ears. Is it not possible that <hi>Kelley</hi> being a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man, and well practised in these things might impose upon the credulity of Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> (a good innocent man) and the rather, because by this office under the Doctor he got 50 <hi>l.</hi> by the year, as appeareth. Truly this is plausible as it is proposed; and like enough that it might go a great way with them that are soon taken, and therefore seldom see any thing in the truth or true nature of it, but in the outward appearance of it only. But read and observe it diligently and you will find it far otherwise: It is true indeed, that ordinarily, Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> saw not himself; his business was to write what was seen (but in his presence though) and heard by <hi>Kelley.</hi> Yet that himself heard often immediately appeareth by many places; I shall not need any quotations for that himself feeleth as well as <hi>Kelley.</hi> In the relation of the <hi>Holy Stone,</hi> how <hi>taken away</hi> by one that came in at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in the shape of a man, and <hi>how restored;</hi> both <hi>saw</hi> certainly. In the story of the <hi>Holy Books, how burned</hi> and how restored again (part of them at least) which Dr <hi>Dee</hi> made a great Miracle of, as appeareth by some of those places; there also both saw certainly. And <hi>Albert Lasky, the Polonian Palatine saw as well as Kelley.</hi> Besides, it doth clearly appear throughout all the book that <hi>Kelley</hi> (though sometimes with much adoe perswaded for a while to think better of them) had generally no other opinion of these Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions but that they were meer illusions of the Divel and evil Spirits, such as himself could command by his art when he listed, and was acquainted with, insomuch that we find him for this very cause forsaking, or desirous to forsake Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> who was much troubled about it; and is forced in a place to <hi>Pawn his Soul</hi> unto him (to use his own words) that it was not so, and that they were good Spirits sent from God in great favour unto them. But for all this <hi>Kelley</hi> would not be satisfied, but would have his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Protestation of his suspition to the contrary entred into the book; which you shall find, and it will be worth your reading. I could further
<pb facs="tcp:49588:17"/>
alledge, that if a man considers the things delivered here upon several occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, being of a different nature, some Moral, some Physical, some Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical, and Theological of highest points (though sometimes wild e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and not warrantable; yet for the most part very remote from vulgar capacities) he will not easily believe that <hi>Kelley,</hi> who scarce understood La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine) not to speak of some things delivered in <hi>Greek</hi> in some places) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himself to the study of Logick long after he had entred himself into this course, could utter such things: no, nor any man living perchance, that had not made it his study all his life-time. But that which must needs end this quarrel (if any man will be pertinacious) and put all things out of doubt, is, that not <hi>Kelley</hi> only served in this place of <hi>Seer</hi> or <hi>Skryer,</hi> but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also, as his son <hi>Arthur,</hi> and in his latter dayes, when <hi>Kelley</hi> was either gone or sick, one <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> as will be found in all the <hi>Actions</hi> and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of the year 1607. which (as I suspect) was the last year of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors life, or beyond which I think he did not live long.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It may be objected, or stuck at least, How Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> so good, so innocent, yea, so pious a man, and so sincere a Christian as by these pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers (his delusion and the effects of it still excepted) he doth seem to have been, God would permit such a one to be so deluded and abused, so rackt in his soul, so hurried in his body for so long a time, notwithstanding his frequent, earnest, zealous prayers and addresses unto God, by evil Spirits (even to his dying day, for ought we know) as he is here by his own rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion set out unto us? Truly, if a man shall consider the whole carriage of this businesse, from the beginning to the end, according to this true and faithful (for I think I may so speak with confidence) account of it here presented unto us, this poor man, how from time to time shamefully, grosly delayed, deluded, quarrelled without cause, still toled on with some shews and appearances, and yet still frustrated and put off: his many pangs and agonies about it, his sad condition after so many. years toil, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, drudgery and earnest expectation, at the very last (as appeareth by the <hi>Actions</hi> and apparitions of the year 1607.) I can not tell whether I should make him an object of more horror or compassion; but of both certainly in a great measure to any man that hath any sense of Humanity, and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of others of humane frailty: and again, any regard of parts and worth, such as were in this man in a high degree. True it is, that he had <hi>joyes</hi> withal and comforts, imaginary, delusory, it is true; yet such as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed and kept up his heart, and made him outwardly chearful often times, I make no question; such as the Saints (as they call themselves) and <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi> of these and former times have ever been very prone to boast of, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading themselves that they are the <hi>effects</hi> of Gods blessed <hi>Spirit.</hi> But even in these his joys and comforts, the fruits and fancies of his deluded soul (as in many others of a distempered brain) is not he an object of great compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to any, both sober and charitable? If this then were his case indeed, what shall we say? if nothing else, I know not but it ought to satisfie a rational, sober, humble man: If we say, That it is not in man to give an account of all Gods judgments, neither is there any ground for us to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mule because we do not understand them, or that they often seem contrary
<pb facs="tcp:49588:18"/>
to the judgment of humane reason, because it is against all Reason as well as Religion, to believe that a creature so much inferior to God, by nature as man is, should see every thing as he seeth, and think as he thinks; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge and determine in and of all things as God judgeth and determineth. The Apostle therefore not without cause, would have all private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (for of publick for the maintenance of peace and order among men, it is another case) deferr'd to that time, <hi>when the hearts of all men shall be laid open, all hidden things and secret counsels revealed.</hi> But we have enough to say in this case without it. For if <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Curiosity</hi> were enough to undoe our first Parent, and in him all mankind, when otherwise innocent, and in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of Paradise. Should we wonder if it had the same event in Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> though otherwise, as he doth appear to us, innocent, and well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified? That this was his case and error, I will appeal to his own confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (though he makes it his boast) in more then one of his Letters or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, where he professeth, <hi>That for divers years he had been an earnest suter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in prayer for Wisdom;</hi> that is, as he interprets himself, <hi>That he might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the secrets of Nature that had not been revealed unto men hitherto;</hi> to the end, as he professeth, and his own deceitful heart it may be suggested un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>That he might glorifie God;</hi> but certainly, that himself might become a <hi>glorious man</hi> in the world, and be admired, yea, adored every where almost, as he might be sure it would be, had he compassed his desire. And what do we think should put him upon such a desire, with hopes to obtain it, but an opinion he had of himself as an extraordinary man, both for <hi>parts,</hi> and for <hi>favour with God?</hi> But however, had he been to the utmost of what he could think of himself, besides his Spiritual pride of thinking so of himself (as great a sin as any in the eyes of God) his praying for such a thing with so much importunity, was a great tempting of God, and deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatest judgments. Had he indeed been a suter unto God for such <hi>Wisdom</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> describeth (11. v. 24, 25.) <hi>Let not the Wise man glorie in his wisdom, &amp;c. but let him that glorieth, &amp;c.</hi> And for such <hi>knowledg</hi> as our Saviour commandeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>And this is life eternal, that they may know thee,</hi> &amp;c. And his blessed Apostle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. 2.) <hi>For I determined not to know any thing,</hi> &amp;c. he had had good warrant for his prayers, and it is very likely that God would have granted him his request, so far as might have concerned his own salvation and eternal happiness. Besides, it is lawful (nay fit) for a man to pray for Gods blessing upon his labours, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of wit and capacity that he may do well in his vocation and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God. But for a man to aspire to such eminency above other men, and by means that are not ordinary (as that conceited <hi>Phylosophers Stone,</hi> and the like) and to interest God by earnest solicitations in his ambitions extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant desires; that God, who hath said of himself, <hi>That he resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble,</hi> must needs be so great and so high a provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (if well considered) as that I begin to doubt whether it be charity to pity him that suffered so justly and deservedly. I do not know but it is as lawfull for any man obscurely born to pray for a Kingdom, for a Common Souldier that he may have strength to encounter thousands, or for an ordinarie Maid, that she may become the fairest of women. In
<pb facs="tcp:49588:18"/>
all these it is possible to glorifie God, we grant, were it fit for us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe unto God, neglecting those that he hath appointed, by what means he should be glorified; and could we secure our selves that in pretending to Gods glory we do not seek our own. I wish that our great undertakers and reformers (such is their wisdom they think) of Arts and Sciences would seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously think of this; they especially who take upon themselves to make all men wise and of one mind, and to reconcile all doubts and difficulties in Religion, and otherwise; in a word, to make Truth to be imbraced by all men. Should these men tell us that if they had had the creating of the world, and the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all things (and there be, I think, in the world that have said little less) from the beginning, they would have made an other guess of things then God had done: We would have considerd of it perchance what might be the ground in any mortal man of such wonderful confidence. But such being the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, as it is, and such of men, naturally; or to speak as a Christian, since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the consequencies of it, the curse of God, &amp;c. to make all men wise, of one mind, good, religious, without an infinite omnipotent power, such as of nothing was able to create a world: can any man (sober and wise) hear it; hear it with patience, that thinks it impossible, yea strange, that Castles should be built in the air, or the heavens battered with great guns? And yet such books are read, yea and much set by, by some men. My judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, That they are to be pityed (if distemper be the cause, as I believe it is in some) that boast of such things; but if wise and politick, to get credit and money (as some I believe) it is a great argument of their confidence, that there be many in the word that are not very wise. But to return to Dr. <hi>Dee:</hi> It might be further added and proved by examples, that some men of transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>holiness</hi> and mortification (in the sight of men) so sequestred from the world (some of them) and the vanities of it, that for many years they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with God alone in a manner; yet through pride and conceit of their own parts and favour with God, fell into <hi>delusions</hi> and temptations, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the same, yet not less strange and dreadful. Such examples Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Story will afford, and other books of that nature, but I have them not at this time, and I conceive I have said enough to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But of his <hi>Praying</hi> too, somewhat would be observed. <hi>His Spirits</hi> tell him somewhere, that he had the <hi>Gift of Praying.</hi> Truly I believe he had, as it is ordinarily called: that it is, that he could express himself very fluently and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly in Prayer, and that he did it often to his own great contentment. Let no man wonder at this; I have shewed elsewhere that some that have been very wicked, yea, some that dyed for blasphemy, and with blasphemy in their mouth to the last gasp, have had it in a great measure, and done much mischief by it. It is no disparagement to Prayer, no more then it is to the best things of the world (and what better and more heavenly then prayer well used?) if they be abused. And it is commonly observed, that the corruption of best things is most dangerous. What bred those pernicious hereticks that so long troubled the world, and could not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> but by absolute destruction, but long affected prayers (therefore called <hi>Euchites</hi> or <hi>Messaliani,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Prayers</hi>) and Enthusiasms? And as to that point of <hi>inward joy and comptacency,</hi> which some Schismaticks and wicked men find in
<pb facs="tcp:49588:19"/>
themselves at their prayers, which ignorant deluded people think to be an argument of the Spirit: It is certain, and is a mystery of nature that hath (may I speak it without bragging) been brought to light (of late years at least) by my self and fully discovered, <q>That not only the inward heat of mental conception (where there is any vigor) but also the musick of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward words, is able to occasion it.</q> Indeed it is a point that doth deserve to be well considered of in these times especially. For when young boyes and illiterate men (and the number is likely to increase now that <hi>Catechizing</hi> is so much neglected) are turned loose to exercise themselves in this gift (as they call it) and when by long practice they have attained to some readiness and volubility, which doth occasion some inward lightsomeness and excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or perchance somewhat that may have some resemblance to spiritual sorrow and compunction, they presently think themselves inspired, and so they become <hi>Saints</hi> before they know what it is to be <hi>Christians.</hi> And if they can Pray by inspiration, why not Preach also? So comes in <hi>Anabaptism</hi> by degrees, which will be the ruine of all Religion and civil Government where ever it prevails. And I believe that this fond foolish conceit of <hi>Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> as it hath been the occasion of much other mischief, so of that horrid sacriledge, shall I call it, or profanation (I hope I may do either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, for it is not done by any publick Authority that I know of) the casting and banishing of THE LORDS PRAYER out of many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houses and Churches; then which, I think, Christ never received a greater affront from any that called themselves Christians. I am not so uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable as to believe that it is done in direct opposition to Christ by any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Christians, but in a furious zeale by many, I believe, against set prayers. But this is not a place to dispute it: Certainly, as the Lords Prayer is a Prayer of most incredible comfort to them that use it devoutly and upon good grounds (a good foundation of Religion and sound Faith, I mean) so I believe that set Prayers in general are of more concernment to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Peace in the Commonwealth then many men are aware of.

               </gap> for my opinion; there be worse I am sure that pass currently.</p>
            <p>Again, A man may wonder (I cannot tell whether an objection may be made of it) that Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> though he were at the first deluded (to which his own pride and presumption did expose him) as many have been; yet afterwards in process of time when he found himself so deluded and shuffled with; when <hi>Edward Kelley</hi> did use such pregnant arguments to him (as he did more then once) to perswade him that they were evil Spirits that appeared unto them; nay, when he had found by certain experience, that his Spirits had told him many lies, foretold many things concerning Princes and Kingdoms, very particularly limited with circumstances of time, which when the time was expired did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> at all come to pass; yet for all this he durst <hi>pawn his Soul for them</hi> that they were <hi>good Spirits,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his confidence (so farre as our Relation goes) to the last. I answer, Such is the power of this kind of Spiritual delusion, it doth so pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess them whom it hath once taken hold of, that they seldom, any of them, recover themselves. In the dayes of <hi>Martin Luther</hi> (2 great and zealous refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="tcp:49588:19"/>
of Religion, but one that would have detested them as the worst of Infidels that had used the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> as some have done in our dayes, as appears by what he saith of it in more then one place) there lived one <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Stifelius,</hi> who applying to himself some place of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to Prophecy. He had foretold that in the year of the Lord 1533. before the 29 of <hi>September</hi> the end of the world, and Christs coming to Judgment would be. He did shew so much confidence, that some write, <hi>Luther</hi> himself was somewhat startled at the first. But that day past, he came a second time to <hi>Luther</hi> with new Calculations, and had digested the whole business into 22. Articles, the effect of which was to demonstrate that the end of the world would be in <hi>October</hi> following. But now <hi>Luther</hi> thought he had had tryal enough, and gave so little credit to him, that he (though he loved the man) silenced him for a time; which our Apocalyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Prophet took very ill at his hands, and wondred much at his incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Well, that moneth and some after that over, our Prophet (who had made no little stir in the Country by his Prophecying) was cast into prison for his obstinacy. After a while <hi>Luther</hi> visited him, thinking by that time to find him of another mind. But so far was he from acknowledging his error, that he down right railed at <hi>Luther</hi> for giving him good counsel. And some write that to his dying day (having lived to the age of 80. years) he never recanted. And was not this the case of learned <hi>Postellus,</hi> who fallen into some grievous wild fancies in his latter dayes, though sound enough still in other things, could never be reclaimed though means were used from time to time the best and gentlest (in respect to his worth and person) that could be thought of? But what talk we of particular men? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in general. Above an hundred years ago they troubled <hi>Germany</hi> very much: it cost many thousands their lives. They roved up and down. No sooner destroyed in one place but they sprung (whilest that sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son lasted) in another. Their pretences every where were the same; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> and the <hi>Spirit:</hi> the wickedness of Princes and Magistrates, and <hi>Christ Jesus to be set up in his Throne.</hi> Well, at last they were destroyed in most places. Stories of them have been written in all Languages, read every where, and their lamentable end. Can all this hinder but that upon every opportunity of a confused and confounded Government, they start up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the same shape and form as before; the same pretences, the same Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, for all the world, miserably detorted and abused, to raise tumults and seditions in all places. Such is the wretchedness of man that is once out of the right way of Reason and Sobriety. But withall we must say in this particular case of Dr. <hi>Dee's,</hi> though his obstinacy was great and marvellous, yet it must be acknowledged, that great was the <hi>diligence</hi> and subtility of his <hi>Spirits</hi> to keep their hold: and some things sometimes happened (as his danger and preservation about <hi>Gravesend,</hi> when he first, here related, went out of the Realm) very strangely, and such was the unhappiness of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed zeal, that he made a Providence of whatsoever hapned unto him as he desired.</p>
            <p>So much for Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> himself. But of his <hi>Spirits</hi> a greater question per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance may be moved: If evil, wicked, lying Spirits (as we have reason
<pb facs="tcp:49588:20"/>
to believe, and no man I think will question) how came they to be such perswaders to Piety and godliness, yea, such preachers of Christ, his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, his Passion, and other Mysteries of the Christian Faith, not only by them here acknowledged, but in some places very Scholastically set out and declared? It seemeth somewhat contrary to reason and as contrary to the words of our Saviour, <hi>Every Kingdom divided against it self,</hi> &amp;c. But first, to the matter of fact: The Divels we know even in the Gospel did acknowledg, nay, in some manner proclaim Christ to be the Son of God: which is the main Article he did contest with Christ by Scripture Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> testimony, can transform himself, when he list into an Angel of light. And in some relations well attested, of Possessions and publick Exorcisms that have been used; we find the Divel often speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the mouth of women, rather like a Monk out of the Pulpit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading to temperance, rebuking vices, expounding of mysteries, and the like, then as one that were an enemy to truth and godliness. Insomuch that some have been ready to make a great mystery and triumph of it, thereby to convict Hereticks and Atheists, in time, more effectually, then they have been by any other means that have been used hitherto: and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing the whole business not to the Divel himself, but the great power and Providence of God, as forcing him against his will to be an instrument of his Truth. For my part, I see cause enough to believe that such things, there contained at large, might come from the Divel; that is, might tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really be spoken by persons possessed and inspired by the Divel. But that they are imployed by God to that end, I shall not easily grant. I rather suspect that whatsoever comes from them in that kind, though it be good in it self, yet they may have a mischievous end in it; and that I believe will soon appear if they can once gaine so much credit among men as to be believed to be sent by God to bear testimony to the truth. A man may see somewhat already by those very Relations, and that account that is given us there. And therefore I do not wonder if even among the more sober Papists this project (as the relater and publisher complaineth) hath found opposition. The Divel is very cunning; a notable Polititian. <hi>S. Paul</hi> knew him so, and therefore he uses many words to set out his frauds. He can lay the foundation of a plot, if need be, a hundred years before the effects shall appear. But then he hath his end. It is not good trusting of him, or dealing with him upon any pretence. Can any man speak bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he doth by the mouth of Anabaptists and Schismaticks? And this he will do for many years together if need be, that they that at first stood off may be won by time. But let them be once absolute masters, and then he will appear in his own shape. There is one thing which I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der much more at in those Relations I have mentioned, and that is, that the Divel himself should turn such a fierce accuser of them that have served him so long, Witches and Magicians. I know he doth here so too in some kind, in more then one place. He doth much inveigh against Divels and all that have to do with them, Megicians, &amp;c. But that is in general only, or in <hi>Kelley's</hi> particular case, upon whom he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother hold, which he made more reckoning of, to wit, as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb facs="tcp:49588:20"/>
to them as an Angel of light. Any thing to maintain his interest there, and their good opinion of him; for he had great hopes from that plot. But that he should pursue so ridgedly particular men and women whom he had used so long, to death, and do the part of an informer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, may seem more like unto a Kingdom divided against it self, but it is not our case here; neither am I very well satisfied, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Divel saith or layes to the charge of them by whose mouth he speaketh, ought to be received for good testimony. Here it may be <hi>Wierius</hi> had some reason; for I doubt some have been too credulous. But this by the way shall suffice.</p>
            <p>That the Divel should lie often, or be mistaken himself, in his <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> as by many particulars of this Relation will appear, I will not look upon that, as if any objection could be made of it. But it may be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, perchance, Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> being often in so great <hi>want of monies,</hi> that he did not know which way to turn, what shift to make; at which time he did alwayes with much humility address himself to his Spirits, making his wants known unto them; and the Divel on the other side, both by his own boasting, and by the testimonie of those who could not lie, having the goods of this world (though still under God) much at his disposing, and alwayes, as he seemed, very desirous to give Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> all possible satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: that in this case, once or twice perchance excepted, when the Dr. was well furnished (for which the Spirits had his thanks) at all other times he was still, to his very great grief and perplexity, left to himself to shift as he could, and some pretence, why not otherwise supplyed, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly devised by them that were so able, and to whom he was so dear. But I must remember my self: I said so able; but in some places his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits tell him plainly, It was not in their power, because no part of their Commission, or because it did not belong unto <hi>them</hi> (such as dealt with him) to meddle with the Treasures of the earth: and sometimes that they were things beneath their cognizance or intermedling. Of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>nature of Spirits,</hi> we shall say somewhat by and by, that may have some relation to this also, perchance. But granting that the Divel gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hath power enough both to find mony and to gratifie with it where he seeth cause. Yet in this case of Witches and Magicians, direct or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct, <hi>it is certain and observed by many as an argument of Gods great Providence over men, that generally he hath not:</hi> It is in very deed a great Argument of a superiour over-ruling power and Providence. For if men of all profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions will hazard (their Souls) so far as we see daily to get money and estates by indirect unconscionable wayes, though they are not alwayes sure, and that it be long oftentimes before it comes, and oftentimes prove their ruine, even in this world, through many casualties; as alterations of times, and the like: what would it be if it were in the power of the D. to help every one that came unto him, yielding but to such and such conditions, according as they could agree?</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have considered what I thought might be objected by others. I have <hi>one objection more,</hi> which to me was more considerable (as an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I mean, not so readily answered) then all the rest: Devils, we think
<pb facs="tcp:49588:21"/>
generally, both by their nature as Spirits, and by the advantage of long experience (a very great advantage indeed in point of knowledg) cannot but have perfect knowledg of all natural things, and all secrets of Nature, which do not require an infinite understanding; which by that measure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that even men have attained unto in a little time, is not likely to be so necessary in most things. But lest any man should quarrel at the word <hi>Perfect,</hi> because all perfection belongs unto God properly, it shall suffice to say, That the knowledge Divels have of things Natural and Humane is incomparably greater then man is capable of. If so, how comes it to pass that in many places of this Relation we find him acting his part rather as a Sophister (that I say not a Juggler) then a perfect Philosopher; as a Quack, or an Empirick sometimes, then a True, genuine Naturalist. And for language (not to speak of his Divinity, which he might disguise of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to his own ends) rather as one that had learned Latin by reading of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous books, of the middle age, for the most part, then of one that had been of <hi>Augustus</hi> his time, and long before that. But that which is strangest of all is, that as in one place the Spirits were discovered by <hi>Ed. Kelley</hi> to steal out of <hi>Agrippa</hi> or <hi>Trithemius</hi> (so he thought at least) so in divers other places, by the phrase, and by the doctrine and opinions a man may trace noted Chymical and Cabalistical Authors of later times; yea, (if I be not much mistaken) and <hi>Paracelsus</hi> himself, that prodigious creature, for whom and against whom so much hath been written since he lived; these things may seem strange, but I think they may be answered. For first, we say, The Divel is not ambitious to shew himself and his abilities before men, but his way is (so observed by many) to fit himself (for matter and words) to the genius and capacity of those that he dealeth with. Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> of himself, long before any Apparition, was a Cabalistical man, up to the ears, as I may say; as may appear to any man by his <hi>Monas Hieroglyphica,</hi> a book much valued by himself, and by him Dedicated at the first to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, and since presented (as here related by himself) to <hi>Rodoiphe</hi> as a choice piece. It may be thought so by those who esteem such books as Dr. <hi>Floid,</hi> Dr. <hi>Alabaster,</hi> and of late <hi>Gafarell,</hi> and the like. For my part I have read him; it is soon don, it is but a little book: but I must profess that I can extract no sense nor reason (sound and solid) out of it: neither yet doth it seem to me very dark or mystical. Sure we are that those Spirits did act their parts so well with Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> that for the most part (in most Actions) they came off with good credit; and we find the Dr. every where almost extolling his Spiritual teachers and instructers, and praysing God for them. Little reason therefore have we to except against any thing (in this kind) that gave him content, which was their aim and business.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I say, If any thing relish here of <hi>Trithemius</hi> or <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> or any such, well may we conclude from thence, that the Divel is like himself. This is the truest inference. It is he that inspired <hi>Trithemius</hi> and <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> &amp;c. that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here; and wonder ye if he speaks like them? I do not expect that all men will be of my opinion; yet I speak no Paradoxes: I have both reason and authority good and plausible, I think, for what I say; but to argue the case at large would be tedious Of <hi>Trithemius</hi> somewhat more afterwards will be said. But we must go far beyond that time. A thousand years and above,
<pb facs="tcp:49588:21"/>
before either of them was born, was the BOOK OF ENOCH well known in the world; and then also was <hi>Lingua Adami</hi> (upon which two most of the Cabala stands) much talked of, as appears by <hi>Greg. Nissen</hi> his learned books a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Eunomius</hi> the Heretick. To speak more particularly (because so much of it in this Relation) the BOOK OF ENOCH was written before Christ; and it is thought by some very learned (though denyed by others) that it is the very book that S. <hi>Jude</hi> intended. A great fragment of it in Greek (it was written in Hebrew first) is to be seen in <hi>Scaliger</hi> (that incomparable man, the wonder of his Age, if not rather of all Ages) <hi>his learned Notes upon</hi> Eusebius. It was so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a book antiently that even Heathens took notice of it, and grounded upon it objections against Christians. It may appear by <hi>Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus,</hi> in his book 5. <hi>p.</hi> 275. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> But S. <hi>Jerome</hi> and S. <hi>Augustin</hi> speak of it more peremptorily as a fabulous book, and not allowed by the Church. How much of it is extant, besides what we have in <hi>Scaliger,</hi> I know not; nor what part it is so often mentioned in this Relation. By what I have seen it doth appear to me a very superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, foolish, fabulous writing; or to conclude all in one word, Cabalistical, such as the Divel might own very well, and in all probability was the author of. As for that conceit of the tongue which was spoken by <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, we have already said that it is no late invention; and I make no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but it proceeded from the same Author. Yea, those very Characters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> by his <hi>Spirits</hi> for holy, and mystical, and the original Characters (as I take it) of the holy tongue, they are no other, for the most part but such as were set out and published long agoe by one <hi>Theseus Ambrosus</hi> out of Magical books, as himself professeth: you shall have a view of them <hi>in some of the Tables at the end of the Preface.</hi> Some letters are the same, others have much resemblace in the substance; and in transcribing it is likely they might suffer some alteration. But it may be too the Spirits did not intend they should be taken for the same, because exploded by learned men, and therefore altered the forms and figures of most of them of purpose that they might seem new, and take the better. So that in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> this the Divel is but still constant unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and this constancy stands him in good stead, to add the more weight and to gain credit to his Impostures. Not to be wondred therefore if the same things be found elsewhere, where the D. hath an hand.</p>
            <p>With Cabalistical writings we may joyn <hi>Chymical,</hi> here also mentioned in many places. I have nothing to say to <hi>Chymistrie</hi> as it is meerly natural, and keeps it self within the compass of sobriety. It may wel go for a part of Physick, for ought I know, though many great Physicians, because of the abuse and danger of it, as I conceive, have done their best (formerly) to cry it down. I my self have seen strange things done by it: and it cannot be denyed but the wonders of God and Nature are as eminently visible in the experiments of that Art as any other natural thing. <hi>However, it is not improbable that divers secrets of it came to the knowledg of man by the Revelation of Spirits.</hi> And the practice and profession of it in most (them especially that profess nothing else) is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with so much Superstition and Imposture, as it. would make a sober man, that tendreth the preservation of himself in his right wits, to be afraid of
<pb facs="tcp:49588:22"/>
it. Of the <hi>Transmutation</hi> of <hi>Metals,</hi> what may be done by Art I will not take upon me to determine: I am apt enough to believe that some strange things (in that kind) may be done, if a man will go to the cost of it, and undergoe the trouble upon so much uncertainty of the event. But that which we call ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, and most understand by it, <hi>The Phylosophers Stone,</hi> is certainly a meer cheat, the first author and inventor whereof was no other then the Divel. <hi>Legi etiam Spiritum supernorum revelatione traditam antiquitus artem faciendi Auri, &amp; me aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te idem usu evenisse,</hi> &amp;c. saith one (<hi>Jo. Franc. Picus Mirandula</hi>) of the learnedst Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that I have seen of that subject, in defence of it, I meant. If he mean <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernos Spiritus,</hi> such as appear in form of Angels of Light, such as deluded Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> and daily doth those that hunt after <hi>Revelations,</hi> and Prophecies, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Curiosities, I grant it. But that any good Angels did ever meddle in a practice commonly attended with so much imposture, impiety, cousenage as this commonly is, I shall not easily grant. Though I must add, I make great difference (if we will speak properly) between Arts <hi>faciendi auri</hi> (a thing I do not deny to be feasible by natural means) and that we call the <hi>Phylosophers Stone,</hi> as before already intimated. And for that objection of his, why evil Spirits should not be the Authors or revealers of it unto any (though otherwise for some other reasons he thinks it probable) because it is not likely that God would suffer <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </hi> to give such power unto men like themselves, whom only among men they favour and respect, that is, wicked ungodly men. First, I answer, That is a very weak objection, since we know by constant experience of present and future Ages, that they are not of the best of men commonly that are the greatest and richest. But Secondly, There is no great cause to fear that any thing hitherto revealed (or hereafter to be revealed, I believe) of this secret, should enable men (good or bad) to do much hurt in the world. The greatest hurt is to themselves who are deluded (yea, and beggerd many first or last) and to some few not very wise whom they cousen as themselves have been cousened. And for this that they can do no more, we are beholding not to the Divel who certainly would not be vvanting to himself or to any opportunity to do mischief by himself or his Agents, but to God vvho doth not give him the povver: So much to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> out of my respect to his name, and for the better satisfaction to the Reader. I ovve the sight and use of the book to my Learned friend Dr. <hi>Windett</hi> before mentioned ‚Äî. I am much confirmed in that opinion (of the Divel being the Author) by vvhat I find of it in the book vvhich hath given me this occasion to speak of it. Were there nothing else but the gross and impudent forgeries that have been used to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it unto men, some entituling the Invention to <hi>Adam</hi> himself, others to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the like; and the many books that have been counterfeited to the same end; and again the most ridiculous and profane applying &amp; expounding of Scriptures, a thing usually done by most that are abettors of it, those things vvere enough to make a man to abhor it. Sure enough it is, that not only Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> but others also vvho had part of that <hi>precious Powder brought unto them by Spirits,</hi> and expected great matters of it, vvere all cheated and gull'd (and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it cost some of them a good deal of money; <hi>Prince Rosemberg</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) by those Spiritual Chymists. Let them consider of it that have been deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such things as they shall see cause.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49588:22"/>
            <p>So still we see, that in all these things, as we said before, the Divel is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to others, (as might be suspected) but others have been beholding to him: As for his Divinity, in highest points, if he spake the truth, it was for his own ends, as we said before: He can do it, who makes any question? In controverted points, we may observe, that he doth <hi>serve the scene</hi> and present occasion; and I make no question, but had Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> gone to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and been entertained there with respect, his Spirits there would have shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as good <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as elsewhere good <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> or <hi>Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have somewhere a very pretty Tale, (I would say a curious Observation, if I thought it true) concerning the nature of the Serpent or Addar, handsomly expressed, how she traineth her yong ones to set them out abroad into the world, that they may shift for themselves. Twenty days, as I remember, are spent in that work: Now whether it be so really, I cannot say certainly, but I suspect it. It is not in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and I looked in <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> and I could not finde it: But whether it be so or no, let no body wonder; for this was the maner of Preaching formerly (and may be yet perchance in some places) among Monks and Fryars in great request. They would make a story of Man, or Beasts, as they thought fit themselves, and their Fancies best served; pretty and witty, as much as they could; whether it had any ground of truth, or no, no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: The moralization was good. If the Divel have done so here, it was not through ignorance (for he is too good a Naturalist; and I believe there is somewhat even in Nature, though we know it not, why both in sacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane History, <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Serpents</hi> are so often joyned) of which is true and real; but as hath been said, it served his turn, and that is enough. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, having considered it as an Objection, how the Divel cometh to speak so much truth, as will be found in this Book; no man, I think, will expect I should give an account of any false Doctrine or Divinity, that it may contain: Yet one point I think fit to take notice of, and protest against it; as false, erronious, and of dangerous consequence, and that is, where it is said, <hi>That a man</hi> (in some cases) <hi>may kill another man (Prince or other) without apparent cause, or lawful Authority, and therefore punishable by the Laws of Man; who nevertheless, may expect a great reward at the hands of God for his act:</hi> How this may agree with the Principles of <hi>New Lights,</hi> and Anabaptisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Divinity, I know not; it is very contrary to the Principles of that Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Divinity, lately professed and established by Law in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now said in this main Objection, (as I apprehended it) what I think was most proper and pertinent, and I hope may satisfie. But I have somewhat else to say, which in this case of <hi>Divels and Spirits</hi> in general, I think it very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and may satisfie perchance, in some cases, where nothing else can. We talk of Spirits, and read of Spirits often, but I think it is very little that we know (the best ofus all) of them, of their nature or differences: And how then can it be expected that we should resolve all doubts? And though I think it is not much that any man ever knew and rightly apprehended, or can, as he is a man in this business; yet my opinion is, (though I know it is much gainsaid and opposed) that ancient Platonick Phylosophers of the latter times, understood much more then most Christians; I do not write this, as though I thought, or would have any thought by others to be the worse Christians for being ignorant in these things; but rather, in my opinion, any
<pb facs="tcp:49588:23"/>
man the better Christian, by much, who doth not regard it or desire it: For my part, although I must acknowledge that some scruples of my minde, did induce me to lock into many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, until I was satisfied, which otherwise I had never done; yet I profess to believe, that it is so little that can be known by man in this subject, and subject to so much illusion, as that I think no study is more vain and foolish; and that I would not go three steps out of my doors (more then what I did to satisfie my minde in some matters of Faith, if any such scruple did arise) to know as much as the profoundest Platonick or Phylosopher yea, or Magician of them all ever knew. Certainly he is but a weak Christian, when so many high Mysteries are proposed unto us in Christ by his Gospel, and of so much consequence, that cannot bestow his time better: They that have any hopes, through Faith in Christ, and a godly life, to be admitted one day into the presenceof God, and to <hi>see face to face,</hi> as God hath promised; will they hazard so glorious a hope, by prying through unseasonable, unprofitable curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, into the nature of these vassal Spirits, which God hath forbidden: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth concern Religion in general, that we believe <hi>Spirits;</hi> √†nd when Objections are made that cannot be answered, many are scandalized, and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists ready to take the advantage of it; I say, that it should be no wonder to any, sober and rational, if we cannot resolve all doubts, since it is so little that we know, or can know, beyond the bare <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> in this matter: Most Christians are bred in and to this opinion, that all Spirits, (so commonly called) are either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven, or Divels of Hell: I know no Scripture for it, or determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any general Councel, that I remember, at this time at least, and so long I do not think my self bound against apparent reason: <hi>For the conceit of all evil Spirits or Divels being in Hell, I think learned Mr.</hi> Meade <hi>hath taken that to task in some of his Works, and sufficiently confuted it:</hi> The very word <hi>Spirit,</hi> is a term of great Ambiguity; We understand by it, commonly, substances, that are altogetherimmaterial. Many of the ancient Fathers, it is well known, did not allow of any such at all, besides God: But we think that to have no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Body, and to be purely immaterial, is all one: God knows how many degrees there may be between these, but we cannot know it, neither doth it concern our salvation for which we have reason to praise God: But if it were so, that all <hi>Spirits</hi> are either Divels or Angels, what shall we make of these that are found in mines, of which learned <hi>Agricola</hi> hath written; of those that have been time out of minde called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, as we have said elsewhere, <hi>Gobelin</hi> in English is derived) who live in private Houses, about old Walls, and stalks of Wood, harmless otherwise, but very thievish, so frequent and so known in some Countreys, that a man may as well doubt whether there be any Horses in <hi>England,</hi> because there are none in some parts of the World; not found in all <hi>America,</hi> I think, till some were carried thither: Neither can I believe, that those Spirits that please themselves in nothing else but harmless sports and wantonnesse, such as have been known in all Ages; such as did use to shave the hairs of <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Night, as himself relates (a very creditable man, I am sure) in his Epistles, and the like; that such Spirits, I say, have any relation either to Heaven or to Hell: We might insist in more particulars, but we do not desire to dwell upon it at this time; and there is yet somewhat else to be said: And
<pb facs="tcp:49588:23"/>
what I have said of some Platonicks, I did not intend thereby to justifie all their absurd or superstitious Opinions in this Argument of Spirits: As they have searched furrher into it then others (besides damnable experience, having confounded Magick with Phylosophy, yea almost turned all Phylosophy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Magick) so it was consequent, they would fall into more Errors and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities; yet withal, they have found somewhat that doth better agree with daily experience, then what is commonly known or believed. <hi>Sinesius</hi> was a Bishop, but as he doth appear to us in his Writings, a better Platonick then a Christian: In a place (in his Treatise <hi>De insomniis</hi>) he sheweth how evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits come to inhabit men and to possesse their Brains: His terms are very course, and apparantly ridiculous; but there may be some truth in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>For if there were not a very near and intimate conjunction, it were to be wondered how the Divel comes to know the very thoughts of Witches and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, as is found by experience, averred by more then one: And in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Book, if I be not mistaken, somewhat may be observed to that purpose: It is possible there may be more kindes of possession then one, and that some men, that never were suspected, have had a spirit (besides their own) resident in them, all, or most part of their lives.</hi>

            <p>I have done, with what I could think of, upon which objection can be made: The next thing is to make the way clearer to the Reader, by some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the <hi>method of the Books,</hi> and explanation of some terms and phrases there ufed, at which perchance some may stick at the first: At the very beginning a man may be to seek, it the Title of it, <hi>Liber sexti mysteriorum, &amp; sancti parallelus, novalisque.</hi> 1583. both as it relates to that which follows, and as it reflects upon somewhat before, by which it may be inferred that the book begins here abruptly and imperfectly: of this I am now ready to give an account to the Reader, and it is very fit it should be done.</p>
            <p>First concerning Titles, such as will be found here many more besides this, the whole book, or relation being subdivided into many parts; in general I say, that according to the Doctors genius (we have said before he was very <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balistical,</hi> that is, full of whimsies and crotchets, under the notion of Mysteries, a thing that some very able, otherwise, have been subject unto) and the high opinion he had of these actions and apparitions; they are mostly very conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and (to speak the truth) phantastick, which must make them the Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: I could give the Reader a view of them all here put together, but it would be superfluous: There be some fourteen or fifteen Divisions in all now remaining, and so many Titles: There is a Table at the beginning, that doth refer to the beginning of every division, where the Title also will be found: But at the end of the viii. Division, I finde these words, <hi>Sequitur liber 24. qui hac die etiam inceptus est, √† meridie: horam circiter tertiam, per ipsum La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanael:</hi> But I finde nothing following, (but some vacant sheets, till we come to the ix. Division, <hi>Mysteriorum pragensium, &amp;c.</hi> And the last Division hath onely some Fables, and before them, some five or six pages of unknown my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical words, which we know not what to make of; but of that more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: The main business to be resolved here (as I take it) is what it is that we have, and what we have not, so far as can be gathered by what remaineth; we shall see what we can say to it. In the year of the Lord, One thousand five
<pb facs="tcp:49588:24"/>
hundred eighty four, <hi>September</hi> the third, (being a Monday) Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared (being presented by Honorable persons, and expected) before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Rodolph.</hi> Among other things he then told him, <hi>That for these two years and a half Gods holy Angels had used to inform him:</hi> Our Book, or first Action here, beginneth 28 <hi>May,</hi> 1583. According to this reckoning, it must be, that above a year and three Moneths before, began the first Apparition: The account then of fifteen Moneths from the first Apparition, we want: How much (in bulk) that might come to, I cannot tell; neither will I warrant all perfect from this 28 of <hi>May,</hi> 1583 to the fourth of <hi>April</hi> 1587. though for the most part the coherence is right enough to that time: But from thence to the twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> 1607. is a vast <hi>chasma</hi> or <hi>hiatus,</hi> of no less then twenty years: How this hath happened, I cannot tell certainly; what I guess, is this, some years after Dr. <hi>Dees</hi> death ( ) Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> bought his Library (what then remained of it) with his <hi>Magical Table,</hi> (of which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) and the <hi>Original Manuscript,</hi> written With his own hand, whereof this is a Copy: The Book had been buried in the Earth, how long, years or moneths, I know not; but so long, though it was carefully kept since, yet it retained so much of the Earth, that it began to moulder and perish some years ago, which when Sir <hi>Thomas C.</hi> (before mentioned) observed, he was at the charges to have it written out, before it should be too late: Now full fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, or not many wanting, being passed since this Original came to Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> it is very likely, that had any more in all that time been heard of, Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> or Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> his Son and Heir, would have heard of it, and got it as soon as any body else: And because no more hath been heard of all this while, it is more then probable that no more is extant, not in <hi>England,</hi> nor I think any where else: Happily the rest might perish, some part, (if not all) even whilest the Doctor lived; and we shall finde in this Relation, <hi>That a good part of his holy Books were burned, but (which is more strange) a great part of them, by the help of Spirits, recovered and restored:</hi> Or it may be, that since his death, the rest (the place where they lay being unknown) might rot in the earth; now if, as probably no more be extant, we may account this that we have here, in that respect perfect, because here is all that can be had. But if any, (as it is the nature of many, if not most, rather to desire that which cannot be had, then to content themselves with that which may) shall much lament the loss of the rest, and be less pleased with this, because so much (though indeed we know not certainly whether much or little) is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I would desire them to consider with themselves, in case there had been twice or thrice as much more as all this comes too, what should have been done with it? For my part, for so much as is here set out (all we had) I thought it would do best, though somewhat long, yet as a thing very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and of great consequence to many good purposes and uses; I thought, I say, it would do best to have it all Printed; Yet we had some considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about it, and it may be some others would have thought that less might have served the turn: But I hope more will be of my minde, and there be but few actions but afford somewhat that is extraordinary, and for some respect or other observable and useful; Howsoever, I am confident, if all had been extant, (supposing that the rest would have made much more) that none or

A Gentleman of <hi>Norimberg</hi> had a Crystal (how he came by it is there to be read) which had this vertue: <hi>Si qua de re certior fieri vellet, &amp;c.</hi> if he desired to know any thing past or future, that concerned him, yea, or any other (in most things) let a young Boy (<hi>Castum,</hi> one that was not yet of Age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) look into it, be should first see a man in it, so and so apparelled and afterwards what he desired. No other but a Boy, so qualified, could see any thing in it. This Crystal became very famous in those parts; yea some learned men came to it to be satisfied in doubtful points, and had their questions resolved: Yet at last, (as well it deserved) it was broken in pieces by <hi>Camerarius</hi> his Friend. Many such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> are to be found of Magical Stones and Crystals: And though <hi>Fernelius, De abditis rerum causis;</hi> and after him (as I remember) one, in worth and esteem of all men, not inferior to <hi>Fernelius,</hi> Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, turns the relation of a strange stone brought to one of the late Kings of <hi>France,</hi> into an Allegory, or Physical explication of the power and proprieties of the Element of Fire; yet I am not satisfied, but that the relation might be literally true: For so it is, (as I remember here also, for I have none of those Books by me at this time) related by <hi>Thuanus,</hi> and so by some others, very learned, understood.</p>
            <p>Now for the maner how he came by it, the particulars of the story cannot be had by this here preserved, but onely this in general, That it was brought unto him by some, whom he thought to be Angels: So we finde him telling the <hi>Emperor, That the Angels of God had brought to him a Stone of that value, that no earthly Kingdom is of that worthiness, as to be compared to the vertue or dignity thereof.</hi> Page 272. in his conference with Dr. <hi>Curts,</hi> appointed by the Emperor to treat with him; <hi>and also let him see the stone brought me by Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ministery:</hi> And we finde this Note recorded, [<hi>Prague, Tuesday</hi> 25 <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tembris, I went to Dinner to the</hi> Spanish Ambassador, <hi>and carried with me the Stone brought me by an Angel, and the fourth Book, wherein the maner of the bringing of it is expressed.</hi>] And for the <hi>use</hi> of the Stone, besides what hath been said, this is observable: Some Spirits being in sight of <hi>E. K.</hi> out of the Stone, Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> would have the Stone brought forth, but <hi>E. K.</hi> said, <hi>He had rather see them thus, out of the Stone;</hi> to which the Doctor replies, <hi>That in the Stone they had warrant that no wicked Spirits should enter; but without the Stone illuders might deal with them, unless God prevented it, &amp;c.</hi> From which passage also we may learn, as from divers others in the Book that although the stone (as we said before) was the place, in which, and out of which, ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, most Apparitions were framed, yet it was not so always: For we shall meet
<pb facs="tcp:49588:25"/>
with divers things in that kinde that were seen and heard, without any reference to the <hi>Stone:</hi> From the same place also we may learn, that the said <hi>Stone</hi> was the same he also called the <hi>Shew-stone;</hi> as in many places besides. However, it is certain enough that he had more Stones then one, which he accounted sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred; observe <hi>Principal Stone,</hi> and <hi>this other Stone;</hi> &amp; <hi>first Sanctified Stone, usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Shew-stone,</hi> and <hi>Holy-stone,</hi> may be thought opposed and different; but I understand it otherwise: This is the account we can give of this <hi>principal Holy-Stone.</hi> And to supply the defect of the maner how it was brought to him, the Reader, if he please, may finde some satisfaction, if he read the <hi>maner how it was taken away, and restored,</hi> very particularly set down, as before (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another occasion) was observed.</p>
            <p>Besides this <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Stones</hi> there are divers other sacred things mentioned, that belonged to this personated Sanctuary, but nothing more frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned then <hi>Curtains;</hi> a <hi>Curtain</hi> or <hi>Vail,</hi> as it is sometimes called. A man would think at first, perchance, that it was somewhat outward, but it will be found otherwise; it was seen <hi>in the Stone,</hi> and appeared of different forms and colours, as they that read will quickly finde.</p>
            <p>Next unto these the <hi>Holy Table</hi> is chiefly considerable, ordering of it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> which he durst not take upon himself, until he had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from his Spiritual Teachers: This <hi>Table,</hi> which may well be called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical, is preserved and to be seen in Sir <hi>Thomas Cottons</hi> Library (from whence we had the rest) and by his leave is here represented in a brass Cut; mention is made of it, as I take it, where Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> proposeth to his Teachers, <hi>Whether the Table (for the middle cross of uniting the</hi> 4 <hi>principal parts) be made perfect or no:</hi> You may see more of it, it is also called <hi>League Table; Table of Covenant, mens a foederis</hi> in some places: The <hi>Pedestal</hi> of it is mentioned in two or three places, and indeed a very curious Frame belonging unto it, yet to be seen in the said Library. But I know not what to make of that, <hi>neither Nalu: nor the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appeareth;</hi> and <hi>the round Table or Globe appeared not.</hi> I believe it must be understood of somewhat that had appeared before in the stone. The Reader that will be so curious, by careful reading may soon finde it out; I was not willing to bestow too much time upon it.</p>
            <p>But here remaineth a main business whereof we are to give an account to the Reader: There were many Tables or Schemes at the end of the Book, containing Letters, <hi>a. b. c. &amp;c.</hi> disposed into little squares, with an Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over each Table in that unknown Character (before spoken of) expressed in usual Letters how it should be read. There is one for a <hi>Specimen</hi> here at the end of the Preface; the rest were omitted, because it was judged needless, except it were to increase the price of the Printed book. For first, Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> himself, though he took a great deal of pains to understand the Mystery of them, and had great hopes given him from time to time to reap the benefit (himself complains of it in more then one place) of his toilsome work and long patience, yet it never came to any thing: and if he made nothing of them (to benefit himself thereby) what hopes had we? Besides, we may judge of these <hi>Tables,</hi> and all this mystery of <hi>Letters,</hi> by what we have seen in others of the same kinde. <hi>Johannes Trithemius</hi> was a man that was supposed by most to have dealt vvith <hi>Spirits</hi> a long time, and to have been instructed by them in

Kelley;</hi> and the <hi>Spirits,</hi> to the number of some twenty, or thereabouts, so many named: (<hi>Madini, Esemeli, Merifri, Ath, Galuah, Il, Jubenladece, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel, Jam, Moreorgran, Aph, Lasben, Uriel, Naluage, Mapsama, Aue, Ilemese, Gaza, Vaa, Leveanael, Ben,</hi>) at least, but whether all Interlocutors, I know not, because I do not remember, neither doth it much concern.</p>
            <p>There be divers <hi>marginal Notes</hi> and Observations, which being of Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> his own, are for the most part not inconsiderable, and some very remarkable, all therefore here exhibited; but whereas in some places he had attempted to represent the apparition, or some part of it, in Figures also; this being done but sometimes, and in case it had been done oftner (except it were to satisfie the childish humor of many Buyers of Books in this Age, when because they buy not to read, must have somewhat to look upon; whence it comes to pass, that much trash doth pass for good ware, for the trimming sake, and on the contrary) of little use, no notice is taken of it; except some Figure be in the Text it self, and of some consequence, for the better understanding of the rest.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Greek, p.</hi> 25. <hi>b.</hi> is exactly set out, as it was found, and yet to be seen in the original, written by Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> himself: But little or nothing can be made of it, as it is written; and it is a sign that Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> who writ it, as <hi>Edw. Kelley</hi> reported it unto him, and afterwards plodded upon it (as doth appear by some Conjectures and Interpretations found in the original, and here also exhibited) as well as he could. was no very perfect <hi>Grecian;</hi> much less <hi>Edw. Kelley,</hi> who could not so much as read it, which made Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> to write some things that he would not have <hi>Kelley</hi> to read, in Greek Characters, though the words were English: I would not alter any thing that was in the Original: But the words, I believe spoken by the Spirit, (and so the Greek is warrantable enough) were these, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I cannot think of any thing else that the Reader need to be told, that is of this nature, and it may be some what might have been spared: However the Reader will consider, that as in all Books, so in this: It is one thing to read from the beginning, and so to go on with heed and observation, without skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; and another thing to read here and there, which would require a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Comment, which is the wretchedness of most Readers, in these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

It seems, though nobly born, and to great dignity, yet his thoughts did aspire much higher; and though no rich man, for a man of his rank and quality, yet expecting such matters from Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>his Spirits,</hi> as he did, he could finde money enough to supply their wants upon occasion. The Spirits were very glad of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and did what they could to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Besides, it is very pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, (which I desire the Reader to take good notice of) that both here and elsewhere the Transcribers, as they could not read sometimes, and were forced to leave some blancks (though seldome to any considerable prejudice of the sence) so they might mistake also, having to do with an Original that was (and is yet to be seen) so defaced and worm-eaten as this is, written (as we have said) by Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> himself.</p>

            <p n="4">IV. I am now come to the last of the four things that I promised, to shew the several <hi>good uses</hi> that may be made of this Book, and which were principally looked upon in the publishing of it. This order indeed I proposed to my self, but great part of this occasion offering it self upon other matter, is already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the former Discourse, so that but little is now left to be done. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I will sum them up, and represent them together, that every Reader may
<pb facs="tcp:49588:27"/>
have them in readiness and in view for his use the better.</p>
            <p>The first is against Atheists, and such as do not believe that there be any Divels or Spirits: We have argued it, I confess, pretty largely, at the beginning of this <hi>Discourse</hi> or <hi>Preface,</hi> and I hope some may receive competent sat sfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by what we have said: But if no Argument had been used, (setting aside Scripture Authority, which would be impertinent against Atheists) I do not know what can be more convincing then this sad Story, so exactly so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, so faithfully delivered. Truly, they must see further then I do, that can finde what to answer (rationally) and to oppose: This is a great point, and a great ground of Religion; but this is not all: For if there be Spirits indeed, so wicked and malicious, so studious and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> men, and to do mischief, which is their end, all which is so fully represented in this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then certainly must it follow, that there is a great over-ruling Power, that takes care of the Earth, and of the Inhabitants of it; of them especially that adore that Power, and worship it with true affection and sincerity: For without this over ruling Power, what a miserable World should we have? What man so sober or innocent, that could enjoy himself at any time with any comfort or security? But again, what man can read this sad story, and can be so perswaded of his own Wisdom or innocency, but will in some degree reflect upon himself, and will be moved to praise God, that notwithstanding many provocations in several kindes (as damnable curiosity, open prophaneness, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Oathes, Curses, Perjuries, scandalous Life, and the like) God hath been pleased to protect and preserve him from the force and violence of such enemies of mankinde?</p>
            <p>I said before, from les, beginnings greatest confusions had ensued, which is very true as in the case of <hi>Bacchus</hi> particularly many Ages before; and in the case of <hi>Mahomet</hi> afterwards, (two notable lewd <hi>Euthusiasts,</hi> by whom as Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> by Gods permission, brought great alterations in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and wrought much mischief and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> among Men and Women) we shall elsewhere shew more at large. By due consideration of all Circumstances, as chiefly their confident and reiterated Addresses unto, and Attempts upon so many great men in Power and Authority, and the like; I am much of opinion that these Spirits had as great hopes of Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> as ever they had of <hi>Bacchus</hi> or <hi>Mahomet.</hi> But God was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> The Divel we see can Pray and Preach, (as to outward appearance we mean; for truly and really, God forbid that any thing sacred and holy should be thought to proceed from Divels) and talk of Sanctity and Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as the best. And what he can in his own person, or by himself imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
<pb facs="tcp:49588:28"/>
there is no question, but he doth by his Ministers and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments much more, more ordinarily and frequently I mean: Let any man judge then, whether it be the part of a sober wise man, not onely to hear such men as can give no account of their calling, but also to follow them, to embrace their Doctrine, to be of their number or Congregation; and all this, upon this account, because they can pray and preach very well, (as they think and judge at least) and talk very godlily and zealously? How much more inexcusable they that will clave unto such, though they see and know them scandalous in their Lives, Proud, Insolent, Ignorant, Seditious, Intolerable, because they can pray, and preach, and talk, as best agreeth with their own humor, and gives them best content? Can any man think they follow God in this, who would have <hi>all things done in order,</hi> and is not a God <hi>of Confusion,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33, 40.) when all they do, tends to nothing else but disorder and confusion? I confess it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that men lawfully called may prove bad enough, we have divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Scripture. But if a man, simply and ignorantly be mis-led by such, certainly his judgement will be much lighter then they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, who will not use the means that God hath ordained, in so great and weighty a business as the salvation of Souls is. I know not what these men can say for themselves, except it be, that they are resolved to make use of the Liberty of the times to please their humor; they may do it, but if that bring them to Heaven, they have good luck.</p>
            <p>But the business of praying, is that I would principally insist upon: You see here how Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> where he gives an account of himself to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and others, bears himself much upon this, that so many years he had been an earnest Suitor unto God <hi>by Prayer</hi> to obtain <hi>Wisdom,</hi> such wisdom as he was ambitious of. I believe him, that he had prayed very earnestly, and with much importunity many times: This was the thing that made him so confident of his Spirits, that they must needs be good Spirits and Angels. I know a man, I have no comfort to tell it, but that I would not conceal any thing that may be a warning unto others, and yet I will have a respect unto him too: But I knew one, a very innocent man (in his outward conversation, and as I believe very really) Humble, Religious, very Learned and Orthodox, and one that had suffered for his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as others have done in these times: This worthy man, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a controverted Argument, upon which his phancy had wrought very much, or rather which had much wrought upon his phancy; he had written much, filled much Paper, and was desirous to communicate unto me as his friend what he had done: But when I perceived that the drift of his writing was out of the Law and the Prophets, to shew the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of some things which I thought of a more indifferent nature; I was not willing to meddle with it; and begun to argue against his main drift, and to shew my disliking. After many words to and fro, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to press me with this, that he had often prayed with much earnestness, and he was very confident that God had heard his Prayers: Yea, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded so far, that if God were true, he could not be deceived, and used many other words to the same purpose, at which I was much amazed, but
<pb facs="tcp:49588:28"/>
could do no good upon him, such was his confidence and violence upon this occasion, though otherwise a very moderate ingenuous man: And thus I found him more then once, or twice. Truly, I think God was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry merciful unto him, that took him away in good time. But certainly this business of <hi>Prayer and praising,</hi> is a business as of great comfort (the greatest that mortal man is capable of upon earth) so of much more danger and delusion, then many do believe. And if caution and circumspection be to be used in any thing that belongs to Religion, I think it ought in Prayer, as much as any thing. And since I have adventured to tell one story upon mine own credit, I will tell one more upon better authority, which I have long desired (for the observableness of it) to communicate unto the world, and to that end, had once inserted it in a Treatise of mine, which I thought would have been Printed, but it was not: I will first give the English of it, that all men may reap the benefit, and then set it down in the words of my Author (mine own Father <hi>Isaac Casaubon,</hi> of <hi>b. m.</hi>) as I have it to shew under his hand.</p>
            <p>At a Consistory in <hi>Geneva,</hi> upon a Friday, <hi>18 July, 1589.</hi> The case of one Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> being there proposed to the Assembly to be considered of, who was wont to insinuate himself into private Houses, under pretence of praying, and made small congregations: The business was disliked by the Pastors; First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing in the Church of God ought to be done without order. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to turn such duties of Religion to matter of Traffick to get money onely, (without any other end or calling) was not lawful. Thirdly and lastly, his batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, (or vain repetition of words) was not to be suffered: Then upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion it was related by Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> that the Saturday before, whilest that sharp conflict was, which we had before our eyes, (<hi>to wit, between the Genevians, and the Duke of</hi> Savoys <hi>Forces</hi>) that a certain Woman addressed her self to him, saying, What Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> will you make Prayers here? To which he had answered, <hi>No:</hi> What, do you think I do behold these things with mine eyes onely. and do not pray to God in my heart? Giving this reason for his answer he had made to the Woman: [<hi>It is not so expressed in the Latine, that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words were</hi> Beza's <hi>words, but the coherence of matter doth so require it</hi>] That Prayer was certainly a holy thing, which it did not become any man to apply himself unto, (<hi>or</hi> to undertake) without due preparation: And that they were deceived, who thought it so easie a thing to pray rightly: And that care also should be taken lest [<hi>under a colour of zeal and devotion</hi>] a way be made to superstition: <hi>The Latine words are these,</hi>

            <p>In the last place, All men may take warning by this example, how they put themselves out of the protection of Almighty God, either by presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous unlawful wishes and desires, or by seeking not unto Divels onely, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly (which Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> certainly never did, but abhorred the thought of it in his heart) but unto them that have next relation unto Divels, as <hi>Witches, Wizzards, Conjurers, Astrologers,</hi> (that take upon them to foretell humane events) <hi>Fortune tellers,</hi> and the like, yea and all Books of that subject, which I doubt, were a great occasion of Dr. <hi>Dees</hi> delusion: That men are commonly cheated by such, is sure enough; and those that are not very fools, would take heed how they deal with them, and avoid them, to avoid the Imputation of Fools; but those that are wise, much more, if they can more then cheat; for the more they can do, the more they know they have of the Divel in them: Wretched people! that will not, dare not trust God, who as he is the onely fountain of goodness, so onely knows what is good for every man. They may rejoyce for a time, and applaud themselves in their conceited successes, but misery, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not, will be their end; and it is a great sign that God is very angry with them, when he doth suffer them to thrive by means which Himself hath cursed.</p>

               <abbr>Esq</abbr> and in some <hi>Annotations</hi> there, at the end, an account concerning Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Edw.

And it may be the Reader may receive some further satisfaction in some particulars by his labor, which is the reason that I mention the Book here, being but lately come to my knowledge; His Judgement either concerning Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> or <hi>Kelley,</hi> I meddle not with; and it may be, had he seen what is here to be seen, he would have been of another opinion in some things: Here is enough, I am sure, to satisfie any man that is not very much preoccupied, or otherwise engaged by particular ends. As for those <hi>Reports</hi> concerning <hi>Kelley,</hi> (some whereof concern Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> also) he tells us of; as I believe him, that he hath heard so, so I must (and may truly) profess, that I have met with far contrary, and in my judgement, and by this account here given us by Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> much more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And particularly, that <hi>Kelley</hi> was put in Prison by the Emperor, for a notable Chymical cheat that he had put upon him; the particulars whereof, though they were fully related unto me, yet I will not adventure upon, lest I mistake in some terms of art, or petty circumstance of fact. And let the Reader judge by that account, Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> (who best knew) doth give us here throughout the whole Book of this <hi>Kelley,</hi> whether <hi>Wevers</hi> Story in his <hi>Funeral Monum. pag.</hi> 45, 46. of damnable <hi>Necromancy,</hi> and other <hi>Diabolical Conjuration,</hi> practised by <hi>Kelley</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> be not (besides what is there said and attested) much more probable, then any thing that hath been or can be said by others, to his justification or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation: Which indeed doth make Doctor <hi>Dee's</hi> case altogether inexcusable, that believing and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the man to be such a one, he would have to do with him, and expected good by his Ministeries; but that the Doctor his Faith, and his intellectualls (through Gods just judgement, as we have said) were so much in the power and government of his Spirits, that they might perswade him to any thing, under colour of doing service unto God, yea had it been to cut his own Fathers throat, as we see in the <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that they perswaded him to lie with another mans Wife, and prostitute his own to a vile, and, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self belived, Diabolical man.</p>
            <p>Besides, I have been told by many, that Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> very poor and every way miserable, dyed at <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack,</hi> here about <hi>London,</hi> which doth not seem to agree with the report in those <hi>Annotations:</hi> But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of them: Neither indeed have I said any thing at all of purpose to oppose the Author, but to give this further satisfaction to the Reader, or rather to the truth, which I thought I was bound to do.</p>
            <p>The passage in <hi>Wevers Funeral Monuments, pag.</hi> 45, 46. concerning <hi>Kelley,</hi> for their satisfaction that have not the Book, is this; <hi>Kelley,</hi> (otherwise called <hi>Talbot</hi>) that famous <hi>English</hi> Alchymist of our times, who flying out of his own Countrey (after he had lost both his ears at <hi>Lancaster</hi>) was entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Rodolph</hi> the second, and last of that Christian name, Emperor of <hi>Germany;</hi> for whom <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory, sent (very secretly) Captain <hi>Peter Gwyn,</hi> with some others, to perswade him to return back to his own Native home, which he was willing to do; and thinking to escape away in the night, by stealth, as he was clammering over a Wall in his own House in <hi>Pragne</hi> (which bears his name to this day, and sometimes was an old Sanctuary) he sell down from the Battlements, broke his leggs, and bruised his body, of which hurts within a while after, he departed this World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sed quorsum haec?</hi> you will say: Then thus, This Diabolical questioning of the dead, for the knowledge of future accidents, was put in practice by the said <hi>Kelley,</hi> who upon a certain Night, in the Park of <hi>Walton</hi> in <hi>le dale,</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> with one <hi>Paul Waring,</hi> (his fellow-companion in such Deeds of darkness) invocated some one of the Infernal Regiment, to know certain passages in the life, as also what might be known by the Divels foresight, of the manner and time of the death of a Noble yong Gentleman, as then in Wardship. The Black Ceremonies of that Night being ended, <hi>Kelley</hi> demanded of one of the Gentlemans servants, what <hi>Corse</hi> was the last buryed in <hi>Law</hi> Church-yard, a Church thereunto adjoyning, who told him of a poor man that was buryed there but the same day: <hi>He</hi> and the said <hi>Waring,</hi> intreated this foresaid servant to go with them to the Grave of the man so lately interred, which he did; and withal, did help them to dig up the Carcase of the poor Catiff, whom by their Incantations, they made him (or rather some evil Spirit through his Organs) to speak, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered strange Predictions concerning the said Gentleman. I was told thus much by the said Serving-man, a Secondary Actor in that dismal abhorred business; and divers Gentlemen and others are now living in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> to whom he hath related this Story. And the Gentlemen himself (whose memory I am bound to honor) told me a little before his death, of this Conjuration by <hi>Kelley,</hi> as he had it by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from his said Servant and Tenant, onely some circumstances excepted, which he thought not fitting to come to his Masters knowledge.</p>

               <p>Good my Lord, I beseech Your Grace, to allow of my plaine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable <hi>Epilogus,</hi> for this matter at this time. 1. Seeing my studious exercises, and conversation civill, may be abundantly testified, to my good credit, in the most parts of all Christendome; and that by all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Nobility, by all degrees of the Learned, and by very many other, of godly and Christian disposition, for the space of 46. years triall: (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Records lately viewed by two honourable witnesses, by Commission from her Majestie;) 2. And seeing, for these 36. years last past, I have been her most Excellent Majesties very true, faithfull and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull servant; at whose Royall mouth, I never received any one word of reproach; but all of favour, and grace: In whose Princely Countenance, I never perceived frowne toward me, or discontented regard, or view on

me: but at all times favourable, and gracious: to the great joy and comfort of my true, faithfull, and loyall heart. And (thirdly) Seeing, the works of my hands, and words of my mouth (here before notified, in the Schedule of my books, and writings) may beare lively witnesse of the thoughts of my heart, and inclination of my minde, generally, (as all wise men do know, and Christ himself doth avouch,) It might, in manner seem needlesse, thus care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully (though most briefly and speedily) to have warned or confounded the scornfull, the malicious, the proud, and the rash in their untrue reports, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and fables of my studies, or exercises Philosophicall: but that, it is of more importance, that the godly, the honest, the modest, the discreet, grave, and charitable Christians (<hi>English</hi> or other,) lovers of Justice, truth, and good learning, may hereby receive certaine comfort in themselves (to perceive, that <hi>Veritas tandem praevalebit</hi>) and sufficiently be weaponed and armed with sound truth, to defend me against such kind of my adversaries: hereafter they will begin afresh or hold on obstinately in their former er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, vain imaginations, false reports, and most ungodly slanders of me &amp; my studies. ¬∂ Therefore, (to make all this cause, for ever, before God &amp; man, out of all doubt:) Seeing, your Lordships good grace, are, as it were, our high Priest, and chief Ecelesiasticall Minister, (under our most dread and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lady Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) to whose censure and judgement, I submit all my studies and Exercises; yea all my Books past, present, and hereafter to be written, by me (of my own skill, judgement, or opinion,) I do, at this present time, most humbly, sincerely, and unfainedly, and in the name of Almighty God, (yea for his honour and glory) request, and beseech your Grace, (when, and as conveniently you may, to be well and throughly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified of me, what I am, <hi>Intus &amp; in cute: Reverendissime in Christo Pater, &amp; Dignissime Archipraesul, cognosce &amp; agnosce vultum t√†m internum, qu√†m exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num pecoris tui:</hi> And wherein I have used, do or shall use, pen, speech, or conversation, otherwise then as it appertaineth to a faithfull, carefull, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and humble servant of Christ Jesu, That your Grace would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to advertise me.

               <p>
                  <hi>E K.</hi> The Golden Curtain which covereth all the Stone hangeth still, but I heare a voice or sentence thrice repeated, thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A voice</hi> ..... Sanctum, Signatum, &amp; ad tempus.</p>
               <p>Œî. The sense hereof may be divers wayes understood, and more then I can imagine, but which sense is to our instruction would I faine know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A voice.</hi> ..... Sanctum, quia hoc velle suum; sigillatum quia determinatum ad tempus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E K.</hi> Hard speeches, but he could not perfectly discern them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A voice</hi> ..... Ad tempus &amp; ad tempus (inquam) quia rerum consummatio. <hi>All things are at hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Seat is prepared.</p>
               <p>Justice hath determined.</p>
               <p>The Judge is not yet willing.</p>
               <p>Mercy thrusteth it self betwixt the Divinity. But it is said,</p>
               <p>The Time shall be shortned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E K.</hi> Saw no creature: But the voice came behind him over his head, till now: when he espied one standing on the Table besides the silke cloth on which the Stone stood; he seemed like a Husbandman all in red apparel, red hose close to his legs, a red jacket, red buttoned cap on his head, yea, and red shooes. He asked <hi>E. K.</hi> how he did, and <hi>E. K.</hi> answered, Well I thank God.</p>
               <p>Œî. By your apparel it should seem you have somewhat to say concerning the Commons of this Realme, and not of high School-points, or Sciences. <hi>I</hi> am desirous to know who sent you? What is your message? and what is your name? for a name you have peculiar as all Creatures else.</p>
               <p>Œî. He paused a good while; whereupon <hi>I</hi> asked him if he considered my speeches?</p>
               <p>..... I consider your speeches, for I have left nothing behind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E. K.</hi> He kneeleth down and seemeth to say somewhat, his speech is quick, round, and ready. He seemeth to pray in a strange Language. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived these words among many other, <hi>Oh Gahire Rudna gephna oh Gahire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>His Countenance was directed towards the Stone.</p>

                  <hi>Mur.</hi> ..... Vse it upon the body molested, adding the letters of her name in a small Circle on the back half, not the letters in their forms expressed, but the number of such letters.</p>
               <p>Œî. We know not how to number her name in our letters.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Mur.</hi> ..... As by discretion shall be thought best: It prevaileth sufficiently, so it be done, but thus far I teach thee, and this, as concerning nature.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Githgulcag</hi> knew not himself.</p>

               <p>Pride was the cause he knew not himself.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>She.</hi> ..... Ignorance was the nakednesse wherewithal you were first tormented, and the first Plague that fell unto man was the want of Science.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>She.</hi> ..... In the same wherein the Devil was first proud.</p>
               <p>Who glorified the Devil?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> K. God.</p>
               <p>Œî. God glorified not the Devil, but before he became a Devil he was in glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She.</hi> ..... The <hi>abusing</hi> of his Glorification made him a Devil: So the <hi>abusing of the good- A Devil. nesse of God toward this man, may make him a Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The works of the Spirit quicken; the doings of the Flesh lead unto destraction. Art thou offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be called a Devil? <hi>Then extol not thy self above thy Election.</hi>

               <p>No man is elected by proper name, but according to the measure of his faith, and this faith is <hi>Faith.</hi> lively and hath a quickning Spirit in it for ever. Indeed thou art ignorant, and therefore thou art sufficiently plagued: Why dost thou boast thy self and say, <hi>This</hi> I <hi>can do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reeds pipe, but it is long of the wind, and herein thou shewest that thou knowest not thy self, for that thou art proud; pray therefore that thou mayest have understanding, and cast away pride if thou wilt not be counted a Devil.</p>
               <p>By true understanding you learn, first to know your selves what you are: of whom you are, and to what end you are.</p>
               <p>This understanding causeth no self-love, but a spiritual selfe-love.</p>
               <p>This understanding teacheth no Blasphemy.</p>
               <p>This understanding teacheth no fury.</p>
               <p>It teacheth a man to be angry, but not wrathful. <note place="margin">Wrath.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For we may be angry, and not offend. <hi>Wrath is to damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore considering that Damnation was the end of the first, which was Pride, and Ignorance, the punishment of the second (which is very loathsome.)</p>

               <p>Doth the World not like of thee?

               <p>If thou offend in the second flie hastily from the World: Tell the World what thou hast of hers, and let her be ashamed that thou knowest her.</p>

Very long I prayed in my Oratory and at my Deske to have answer or resolutions of divers doubts which I had noted in a paper, and which doubts I read over distinctly, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the preparation of things about the Table of practice, and other things above my Lamin and Stone; but answer came none, neither in the Stone did any thing appear; no, not the Golden Curtain, but the Stone was of his natural Diaphanitie. But I held on in pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful manner to request some advertisement, if for any our trespasses or offences this unlooked for alteration from former dealing had hapned, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>At length a voice came from behind <hi>E. K.</hi> over his head, and said thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A voyce.</hi> ..... The judgements of our God are most profound and hard in the understanding of man.</p>
               <p>There is <hi>silence</hi> above, let there therefore be patience amongst you. I have said.</p>
               <p>Œî. Upon this answer I began to discourse of divers causes of this silence, and divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <note place="margin">Silence.</note> of silences; and in the end I became in a great and sorrowfull heavinesse, and fear of the wrath, or displeasure of God; conceived for some, our misbehaviour towards him since our last dealing, whereupon I prayed long at my Desk, standing for mercy, comfort, counsel, and some exposition of the former sentence. After a long time thus passing there appeared one in the very top of the frame of the <hi>shew-stone,</hi> much like <hi>Michael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who said,</hi> ..... Write, for I must be gone.</p>
               <p>Silence there is in heaven, for the Governours of the earth are now before the Lord, the doings of their seats are now disclosed, every thing is NOTED. For that God will be righteous in all his doings.</p>
               <p>There is not this day any one that governeth the people upon earth, but his government
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49588:49"/>
is disclosed, and his government is set open, and his faults revealed,</p>
               <p>They without number cry, Lord, let thy vengeance come.</p>
               <p>The earth sayeth. Be it so.</p>
               <p>Sathan is before the Lord: He hath garnished himself with Garlands as a Conquerour, and <note place="margin">Sathan.</note> what he saith is wonderfull.</p>
               <p>Therefore shall the Lord open his mouth, and curse the earth, and all living creatures. For <hi>iniquity hath gotten the upper hand:</hi> Publickly the <hi>States</hi> of mankinde in the world are condemned. <note place="margin">Viols ready.</note>
               </p>
               <p>We are all silent and <hi>ready with our Viols</hi> to powre the <hi>wrath of God</hi> upon them, when he saith, BE IT SO.</p>
               <p>Therefore be you patient. For, <hi>our patience in an universal</hi> silence.</p>
               <p>We look for the mouth of Justice: But L O: The Lord saith unto the Lord, lift up thy <note place="margin">Yet awhile.</note> eyes (O God.) Behold, the Dignity of thy workmanship, <hi>yet suffer for awhile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have a people that will forsake their cruelty, and put off their Garments that stink of <note place="margin">1583.</note> abomination, in whom thy name shall be magnified, and our glory in heaven more exalted.</p>
               <p>But as thou wilt, so be it.</p>
               <p>Behold, <hi>I speak in body,</hi> because I tremble, as at the force of thy great indignation: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, we will what thou wilt.</p>
               <p>If therefore these wonders be so great in heaven, wonder thou not at our silence: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be patient, and say unto the earth? Why groanest thou so hard, or why is thy body so rotten: Hast not thou justly deserved these things for thy iniquity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> say, if you be partakers of these secrets, how much more shall you be partakers of that sweetnesse, which is the eternal dew, and very bread it self of life?</p>
               <p>SO.</p>

There stand a great many of Mawmets, little ugly fellows at the top of the hill, who threw stones against him, and so force this climing man (or goer up the hill) to tumble down again to the foot of the hill. The skin doth seem to be off his hands and his feet, and they very raw, with his excessive travail with hands and feet up that hill; Now there appear men eating meat below at the foot of the hill, who offered him meat to eat; But he laboureth up the hill again, one of these men said, come let me bind up thy feet.</p>

               <p>Now come two, or three handsome fellows, and said, Alas, let him tarry here and drink, we will lead him up <hi>another way</hi> to morrow.</p>

                  <p>And his fear is of the thing that is done. This is the true fear of God; and when we fear sin, we do it because we hate it.</p>
                  <p>When we study to do good, it is a token of our fear, in that it is a token we <hi>fear him,</hi> whom <hi>we love</hi> and for whose honour we study to do well.</p>

                  <p>Wednesday <hi>19.</hi> Junii. Hora <hi>2.</hi> a Meridie.</p>
                  <p>Œî. <hi>I</hi> made a prayer to God: and there appeared one, having two Garments in his hands, who answered.</p>
                  <p>..... A good praise, with a wavering minde.</p>
                  <p>Œî. God make my minde stable, and to be seasoned with the intellectual leaven, free of all sensible mutability.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> One of these two Garments is pure white: the other is speckled of divers colours; he layeth them down before him, he layeth also a speckled Cap down before him at his feet; he hath no Cap on his head: his hair is long and yellow, but his face cannot be seen; at the least it was turned away-ward from <hi>E. K.</hi> continually, though <hi>E. K.</hi> changed his place.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49588:54"/>
                  <p>..... You shall see my face, lo, it is white.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he putteth on his Pied Coat, and his Pied Cap, he casteth the one side of his Gown over his shoulder, and he danceth, and saith,</p>
                  <p>..... There is a God, let us be merry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> He danceth still.</p>
                  <p>There is a heaven, let us be merry.</p>
                  <p>Doth this Doctrine teach you to know God, or to be skilfull in the heavens?</p>
                  <p>..... Note it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he putteth off his Cloathes again: Now he kneeleth down, and washeth his head and his neck, and his face, and shaketh his Cloaths, and plucketh off the uttermost sole of his shooes, and falleth prostrate on the ground, and sayed:</p>
                  <p>..... Vouchsafe (O God) to take away the wearinesse of my body, and to cleanse the filthinesse of this dust, that I may be apt for this purenesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he taketh the white Garment, and putteth it on him.</p>
                  <p>..... Mighty is God in his great Justice, and wonderful in his immeasurable mercy: The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens taste of his Glory: The earth is confounded at his wisdom. In hell they tremble at him, as at a Revenger. This sheweth thee (O) to be a God, and stretcheth forth thy Glory from the East unto the West; for thy Heavens are Statutes, and thy Creatures Laws: that thou mayest be accounted a God of Justice and Glory. Because thou art a God, Therefore there is a Heaven: For unto the Prince of Righteousnesse, there belongeth a place of Glory; Into the which there entereth none that are defiled, neither such as are blemished <hi>with the spots of iniquity.</hi> Manus Haec bona est ..... E. K. <hi>putting forth his right hand,</hi> Haec Autem mala ..... E. K. <hi>putting forth his left hand,</hi> Qui Habet aures intelligat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he sitteth down on the Desk-top and looketh toward me.</p>
                  <p>Œî. This Parable is in general, somewhat understood of us: but in particular, how it may be, or is to be applied, presently we understand not.</p>
                  <p>..... Beware lest error enter within the <hi>dwelling place of</hi> Righteousnesse. <hi>I have said.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> He seemeth now to be turned to a woman, and the very same which we call <hi>Galvah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he is come down to the usual place, on the Table.</p>
                  <p>Œî. I have assayed divers wayes to place the five Tables, on the two sides on this first leaf; Is it to your likeing as I have done it, in the five little Triangles?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> ..... As concerning the setting down of the five Tables. it is sufficient as it is done.</p>
                  <p>The cause why <hi>I appeared thus,</hi> was that you might avoid error.</p>
                  <p>Œî. I pray you to shew us the means how that error was or is to incumber us.</p>
                  <p>Gal. ..... Whosoever taketh servants of the wicked, to prove the Glory of God, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed. <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>But, O Satan, how many are thy deceits?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, my Companion (<hi>E.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> ..... Behold, it is said, before he go from hence I will pour water into him; And my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel shall annoint him, as I have determined: <hi>Hide therefore Nothing from him; For you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long</hi>

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> ..... Soon you shall know more.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> ..... It shall be answered soon, and <hi>what questions soever he</hi> also demandeth.</p>
                  <p>Œî. May he be here present at the action doing?</p>

                  <p>Œî. May I request you to cause some sensible apparition to appear to him, to comfort him, and establish his minde more abundantly in the godly intent of God his Service?</p>

                  <p>Œî. You perceive, how he understandeth of the Lord Treasurer his grudge against him; And perhaps some other also, are of like malitious nature: What danger may follow hereof, or incombrance?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> ..... The sum of his life is already appointed, one jot cannot be diminished: But he that is Almighty can augment at his pleasure. Let him <hi>rejoyce in poverty.</hi> Be sorry for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <note place="margin">

                  <p>Œî. Deo gratias agamus.</p>
                  <p>Wensday afternoon, circa horam <hi>5.</hi> The Lord <hi>Albert √† Lasky</hi> being present.</p>
                  <p>Œî. We attended of <hi>Galvah</hi> some instructions or discourse concerning the Lord <hi>Laskie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>E. K. At length appeared before the Lord <hi>Lasky</hi> (in the air) an Angel in a white Robe, holding a bloody Crosse in his right hand, the same hand being also bloody.</p>
                  <p>Œî. In nomine Jesu Christi Crucifixi, a te requiro qui Crucis Trophaeum hic Gestas ut illa nobis signifies, quae sunt ad Christi gloriam, cui sit honor &amp; Laus perennis.</p>
                  <p>E. K. Now he is come from before the Lord <hi>Lasky,</hi> and standeth here on the Table: he turneth himself to all the four quarters of the World; he kneeleth down.</p>
                  <p>He prayeth.</p>
                  <p>..... O God, Why should the people upon earth rejoyce? or wherein should the pleasures of their sensual delights be fixed? Why doth the Moon hold her course? or why are the Stars observing an order? Why are thy people thus scattered abroad? Because iniquity hath caught the upper hand. The Doors of our God are polluted with blasphemy, his Temples desolate, his Commandments vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, <hi>and his Glory accounted as nothing.</hi> But wilt thou suffer; or canst thou hold thy hand from thy great and mighty strokes? Most High God, Most Mighty God, Most Honourable God, have mercy upon thy people; respect the Creation, (the Creation I say) of those, wherein thou hast delighted. Suffer not the Serpent to extol his head above thy Altars, neither let thy holy Vessel be poisoned with his venome; For thou art Mighty and overcomest all: and who can rebel against thy Prowesse? Bend down thy mereiful eyes, Behold this confusion: look upon thy Temple and see the desolation thereof. And then in thy mercy (O) shew thy self to be a God, and such a merciful Governour, as hath compassion upon those that are diseased, yea even unto death. Grant this <hi>Cama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scheth galsuagath garnastel zurah logaah luseroth.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>Œî. I pray you to declare unto us your name.</p>

                  <p>Œî. Note. At this Instant <hi>Tanfeld</hi> came rashly upon us, into my Study: we thinking that the Study door had been shut; the Lord <hi>Laskie</hi> being gone out of my Study, the other way through my Oratory, to take <hi>Tanfelds</hi> message from the Court, and having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched him, rested without: and <hi>Tanfeld</hi> having commendations to me, as he said, from <note place="margin">This <hi>Tanfeld</hi> served the Lord <hi>Laskie.</hi>

You sons of men, What do ye seek after? Do ye hunt after the swiftnesse of the winds; or are you imagining a form unto the Clouds? or go ye forth to hear the braying of an Asse, which passeth away with the swiftnesse of the air? Seek for true wisdom; For it beholdeth the brightest, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth unto the lowest. Cecill hateth him unto the heart, and desireth he were gone hence.

                  <p>Œî. Whiles I was writing certain prayers to good Angels, and <hi>ad proprios nostros Angelos</hi> for <hi>A. Lasky,</hi> there appeared one very big in the aire, all in a white Garment full of plaights, and tucked up very dubble, with a myterlike Attire on his head, and a crosse on the forepart of it; He <hi>willed</hi> E. K. <hi>to speak to me, and to tell me of his</hi> being there: But <hi>he refused, and expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it,</hi> partly by reason <hi>Galluah</hi> said that he would not deal with us, but every seventh day (being every Monday) till the actions were ended: and therefore he supposed this Creature to be an illuder, and partly he urged some evident token, or proof of their <hi>well-meaning</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in Act, &amp;c. He went down, and still this Creature followed <hi>him with a drawn sword, requiring him</hi> to declare these words to me; but <hi>E. K.</hi> a long while bad him declare them himself unto me, if he would: and said, why should he not, &amp;c. At length my Companion came, appeased, and contented to hear what this Creature would say, who at length said thus:</p>
                  <p>.... The Eagles have food for their young ones, by Divine providence, and not of themselves. Lord let me diminish the power of this wicked spirit that doth so provoke, and stirre him to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schief. <note place="margin">E.

                  <p>.... If the love of the fathers (O God) be great towards their Children, much greater are thy blessings in those whom thou hast chosen.</p>
                  <p>Œî. So, (O Lord) so.</p>
                  <p>.... Behold, I will draw threds together, and make him a Net, which shall alwayes be between <note place="margin">Now he came from the aire, he eared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my west-side, and came and stood by my .... on the Table.</note> him and the Adversary: neither shall it diminish his understanding from the true sight of me. It hath been said, <hi>The place</hi> is holy. Write that shall be here spoken, with devotion upon thy knees. Great is thy name (O God) and mighty art thou in all thy workings: Thy help is strong to those that delight therein. O magnified be thy name from generation to generation.</p>

                  <p>Gloria sit in excelsis, Deo nostro &amp; in terra Pax hominibus bonae voluntatis, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Œî. Upon the perusing and examining, this prayer <hi>Gabriel</hi> revealed unto us, I found certain imperfections, and some doubts, wherein we thought it good to ask counsel, and require <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel's</hi> advise: That the prayer might be perfect, as he might well like of to Gods honour and our comforts. At the length: Nothing appearing to the eye, but the noise of a sound about <hi>E. K.</hi> his head, and withall a mighty weight, or invisible burden on his right shoulder, as he sate in the green Chair, by the holy Table, or place: And unto certain places of the prayer, which I noted and repeated, those words, and answers were by <hi>Gabriel</hi> given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> .... The Preface must be in, for if our hearts be not prepared unto prayer, our prayers are in vain.</p>
                  <p>Quid differs Domine, Cor meum in melius Comfortare.</p>
                  <p>Per te &amp; in nomine tuo resurgam; id est, Halleluja.</p>
                  <p>The first way is more effectual. Say <hi>Angele mee,</hi> but the other is more effectual, <hi>Cura me sanum.</hi> Regard me, and look unto me, being whole.</p>
                  <p>Œî. As concerning the inscription, which I have written before the prayer: I would gladly know, whether it be to your well liking of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab. .... Fiant omnia ad laudem Dei.</hi> My doings are of no such regard: What I have done be it done, so that your additions be to the honour of God, it is sufficient. <hi>The effect of his prayer is greater, then is the form.</hi> The former is greater then the forming. That is to say, he that hath formed it, is mightier then any virtue, wherein it is formed. Wheresoever, therefore the mind formeth it with you with perfect humility and consent, there is also the former. As formed of him therefore, I leave you to the end of his workmanship, which continually formeth all things according to his own fashion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sins. .... Your sins</hi> have banished me, from saying those things <hi>I would.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Œî. <hi>O cleanse our hearts, and wash away our sins,</hi> amplius lava me ab iniquitate mea &amp; a pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato meo munda me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> .... Sins are never washed away, or forgotten with the highest, but with such as are <hi>sorry, and also make satisfaction.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Satisfaction.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>O Lord, full sorry I am for my sins, and what satisfaction is ... required I would gladly know.</p>
                  <p>Gab. .... <hi>The offence was not thine.</hi> Every one must satisfie, or else he shall be damned.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Good Lord expound to us the mystery of satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> .... When the Soul offendeth, and is consenting to wickednesse, he is then to make a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual satisfaction, which is the end and perfect fruit of Contrition. For those that are truely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, do truely satisfie. Another satisfaction there is, which is external. This satisfaction is to be made for sins committed against thy Neighbour: For if thou offend thy Neighbour, and do him wrong, or take any thing from him, by fraud, or violence, it is a great sin. For this, thou canst never be Contrite if thou make not satisfaction, not onely confessing it, but in satisfying <hi>his desire</hi> that is <note place="margin">NOTE. Good Angels are to be used reverently. E. K.</note> offended, and that with sorrow. This is true Doctrine, and shall never be overthrown by the spirits of false invention: which indeed is the first eye unto the Devil. If you may offend your brother, and be therefore accursed: How much more shall you be accursed, when you offend the messager of him that is your Father. Behold, he sayeth not, I have once done amisse. God be mercifull to you, that his mercies might be the greater upon you. Be mindfull of my sayings.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Deus misereatur nostri, &amp; benidicat nobis, Cor mundum Creet in nobis, &amp; spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum rectum ponat in proecordiis nostris,</p>

                  <p>Œî. While I was about to write the Title of the second side of the seventh leaf: and (<hi>E.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49588:57"/>
one to write the Book; and thereupon appeared to her (but unseen of <hi>E. K.</hi>) her Mother</p>
                  <p>..... <hi>Madimi</hi> said also, that she was now learning of Greek and Arabick, and the Syrian Tongue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mad.</hi> ..... Mother I pray you let him have one to write his Book.</p>
                  <p>Œî. I pray thee tell me <hi>Madimi,</hi> what was his name which yesterday tempted my friend and accused me most unduly and untruely to <hi>E. K. as a murderer,</hi> and hypocrite, and one that had injured a thousand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mad.</hi> ..... His name was Panlacarp.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Can the wicked Conjurers have their Devils to write Books at their commandments, and shall not an honest Christian Philosopher have the help of God his good Angels to write his holy Mysteries so greatly redounding to his Glory? And seeing you are the Mother of <hi>Madimi</hi> here, I beseech you tell me your name here: as the order of all our doings are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and orderly noted.</p>
                  <p>Mother. ..... I am of the word, and by the word: <hi>I say,</hi> Seal up those things thou hast: And I my self will take charge of <hi>Galvah to the end. Ad evitandum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Truth it is, it must grow to a great mislikeing grudge, that God should seem to have laid burdens on our shoulders, greater than we are able to bear: and then if we fail and faile under them, he would find a cause not to perform his promises made for carrying of those burdens.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Œî. You have eased my heart of a thousand pound weight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mother.</hi> ..... Because ye shall not fall into error. Dost thou believe?</p>
                  <p>Œî. Yea verily.</p>
                  <p>Mother. ..... <hi>Then verily will I do it.</hi> Fides tua erit instrumentum operationis meae; Erit, &amp; videbitis, &amp; nunquam peribit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galvah.</hi> ..... One thing I will teach thee. The End is greater than the Beginning, or the Midst; For the End is witnesse of them both: But they both cannot witnesse of the End.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mother.</hi> ..... He that appeared yesterday is fast enough, now: Maiden, Say your lesson, when I am gone.</p>

                     <hi>E. K.</hi> She flieth away like a fire. <hi>Madimi</hi> falleth down prostrate on her face a while.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Now I shall have leisure to follow my sute, and to do all Mr. <hi>Gilberts</hi> businesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mad.</hi> ..... My Mother will speak to the Queen for you shortly. Serve you God while I do pray.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E K.</hi> She prayeth vehemently. Now she cometh near to us.</p>

                  <p>This Letter being now written, and not yet folded up, my friend <hi>E. K.</hi> was ready and came out of his Chamber into my Study; and I told him, that I was even now sending word to the Prince <hi>Laskie</hi> of his rideing out, and return after five dayes; and so shewed him the Letter: who when he came to the phrase, <hi>Quid sit ipsa veritas,</hi> he was samewhat offended, saying, What secret meaning hath this, <hi>upon some of your two former conference?</hi> Truly (said I) even such as the circumstance of the Letter doth import, that is; Whereas you said that you intended to return within five dayes, or at the same dayes end, it is uncertain whether you will, or shall, return later or sooner: and therefore <hi>Quid sit ipsa veritas</hi> of your return, or intent to return, onely God doth know. He would by no meanes admit that my sincere exposition, but seemed suspitious of some other undue constructions of those former words; thereupon I took the Letter and tore it in three pieces, and sent none: But in my mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all to God his disposition, assuring my self <hi>of God his most constant proceeding in his own affairs.</hi> Shortly after said <hi>E. K.</hi> to me, Certainly here is a spiritual Creature in my right shoulder, who sensibly saith to me, Come away: So (said I) did one say to <hi>Sowle,</hi> when <note place="margin">

Nay said <hi>E. K.</hi> they have told me that if I tarry here, I shall be hanged; and if I go with this Prince he will cut off my head, and that you mean not <hi>to keep promise</hi> with me; And therefore if I might have a thousand pound to tarry, yea a Kingdom, I cannot: Therefore <hi>I release you of your promise of</hi> 50 <hi>pounds yearly Stipend</hi> to me, and you need not doubt but God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <note place="margin">Fifty pound yearly stipend.</note> you and prosper you, and can of the very stones raise up children to <hi>Abraham:</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>I cannot abide my wife, I love her not, nay I abhor her;</hi> and there in the house I am misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Brainford.</hi> After whose going, my Wife came up into my Study, and I said, <hi>Jane,</hi> this man is mervallously out of quiet against his Wife, for her friends their bitter reports against him <note place="margin">

                  <p>Note within three hours after, came <hi>E.

I have lent my Mare out (said he) and so am returned. It is well done said I, and thereupon he sate down in the chair by my Table where he was wont to sit: And it was ten of the clock then. He took up in his hand the Books which I had brought from <hi>London</hi> of the L. <hi>Laskie,</hi> written to him in his commendations, &amp;c. And as he was looking earnestly on them, a Spiritual Creature did put the Book on the outside of the parchment cover, divers times; and once would have taken it out of his hands: Divers times I heard the strokes my self; At length he said, I see here the handsome Maiden <hi>Madimi,</hi> and have done a pretty while. Then said I to him, Why told you me no sooner? Whereupon I took paper purposely to Note what should seem Note-worthy as followeth.</p>

                     <hi>Mad.</hi> ..... Hear me what I say. God is the unity of all things, Love is the unity of every Congregation (I mean true and perfect love.) The World was made in the love of the father. You were redeemed in the love of the Father and the Son. The Spirit of God is (yet) the love of his Church. Yet (I say): For after it doth Triumph, it is not called a <hi>Church</hi> nor a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: <note place="margin">Œî. we use to call it <hi>Ecclesiae Triumphans.</hi> Note. The Angels were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</note> But a <hi>Fruitful Inheritance</hi> and a <hi>Perfect</hi> Body in Christ. Take the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the World, and it perisheth. Take the love of our Redemption away, and we are dead. (I will not offend) put <hi>your</hi> instead of <hi>our.</hi> Take the light of the Holy Ghost, which is the love of the Father and the Son from the Church, and it withereth. Even so take love from amongst you, and you are members of the Devil; Therefore it is said unto you <hi>Diligite ad invicem.</hi> For love is the Spirit of God uniting and knitting things together in a laudable proportion. What dost thou hunt after? Speak man, What dost thou hunt after?</p>
                  <p>[This was said to <hi>E. K.</hi> upon some secret judgement of <hi>Madimi</hi> in him.</p>

                     <hi>E. K.</hi> I hunt after nothing.</p>
                  <p>The love of God breedeth faith; Faith bringeth forth (on the one side) Hope; and (on the <note place="margin">1. Faith. 2. Hope. 3.

Herein thou shewest the want of faith; Herein are thy bragging words confounded; for thou sayest, No man can accuse thee of evil. But thou <hi>hast no faith because thou hast no hope.</hi> Wilt thou say, that thou hast faith? Shew it me by thy love: Whosoever (therefore) loveth not God, is accursed. Thou lovest not God, Lo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou breakest his Commandments. Oughtest thou not to love him? And hast thou not faith through the love in God? Truely thou oughtest so to do. Wilt thou let me see thy hope on this side; Let thy workes stand on the other side. And shew thy self to have faith that therein thou mayest love God, and be beloved of him: But if thou hast none of these, thou hast hate. If thou hate God, the

                  <p>WE departed from <hi>Mortlack,</hi> about three of the Clock after noon: The Lord <hi>Albert Lasky, (Vaywode</hi> of <hi>Siradia,</hi> in <hi>Polonia)</hi> meeting me on the water, as we had appointed: And so brought night to <hi>London;</hi> and in the dead of the night, by Wherries, we went to <hi>Greenwich</hi> to my friend <hi>Goodman Fern</hi> the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his house: Where we refreshed our selves, and thither came a great Tylt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat from <hi>Graves end</hi> to take us in, (by appointment of me and Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>) to go to our ships, which we had caused to ly seven, or eight mile beyond <hi>Graves end.</hi> To which ships we came on Sunday morning by Sun rise: In the greater of them (being a dubble Fly-boat of <hi>Denmark</hi>) my Lord <hi>Laskie,</hi> I, and <hi>E. K.</hi> with my Wife and Children, &amp;c. went: And in another ship (by me also hired for this passage) went some of my Lord his men, two horse, &amp;c. that ship was a Boyer, a pretty ship. With little winde we straight-way hoysed sayl, and began our voyage in the ship.</p>
                  <p>This 22. day we were in great danger of perishing (on the sands, called the Spits) about <note place="margin">There arose great raging winde, N.E. almost.</note> midnight: We had (by force of winde contrary) anchored by them, and the Anchor came home, no man perceiving it, till the ship was ready to strike on the sands. Then, upon great diligence and pollicy used by our Marriners in hoysing sayl, and cutting our Cable, (to leave our shote anker) and committing our selves to the hands of God, and <hi>most earnestly praying for a prosperous winde:</hi> It pleased the Almighty, and most mercifull God, <hi>suddenly</hi> to change the winds, which served us to bear from the sands, and to recover <hi>Quinborrough,</hi> back again.</p>
                  <p>The 23. day (being Munday) we came to the mouth and entrance of <hi>Quinburrough Creek,</hi> or <note place="margin">The evident help of God at the very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of danger deadly.</note> Haven. And as we made to land in small Fisher-boats, the Lord <hi>Laskie,</hi> my Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in one boat, and <hi>I,</hi> with <hi>E. K. Marie, Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>John Crokar,</hi> in another, it fell so out, that at the ships side, our Fisher-boat his sayl-yard and sayl was entangled on the Mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of the Fly-boat (being stroke down) so that, in our setting from the ships side, the top of our Boat being fast above, and the windes and stream carrying the Boat off below, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined so much on the one side, that the one half of the Fisher boat (well near) was in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the water came so in (by the intangling before specified, not easily to be undone, or loosed) that my Lord, my Wife, and all that saw us thought that of necessity our Boat must sink, and so, we to have perisht. But God in his providence and mercy had greater. ..... of us, so that we became clear; the Boat half full of water, so that we sat wet to the knees, and the water with the billow of the Sea came still beating in more and more: And in this mean trouble; one of our two Boat-men, had lost his long Oare out of the Boat into the water; and so not onely we lacked the help of that Oare, but also by reason they would have followed the winde and ebb, for that Oar, (contrary to our course in hand, and not able to become by) with much adoe we constrained them with the sayl, our one Oare, and the Rudder to make such shift as they could to get to <hi>Quinborrough</hi> Town: And in the mean space <hi>E. K.</hi> with a great Gantlet did empty most part of the water out of the Boat, else it must needs have sunk by all mans reason. At length (to be brief) we came to the Town side, up the crooked <hi>Creek:</hi> where, when as the Master of our ship would have taken me out in his arms (standing in the water with his Boots) he fell with me in the water, where I was foul arrayed in the water and Oase. God be praised for ever, that all that great danger was ended with so small grief, or hurt.</p>

                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ..... And <hi>hereby</hi> I teach you, that those afflictions which you <hi>suffer</hi> in soul either for your offences towards God, or for the imperfections of your mindes, being void of brotherly charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your neighbours; (And so from you generally hereafter, how great, or how many soever) ought not to be manifested or made open to the world: but perfectly shadowed in Charity, bearing your own infirmities, and so the infirmity of others with quiet and hidden minde. For the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of the soul is compared with prayer, dwelling in one house which ought to laugh with the World, and to weep towards heaven. For <hi>every</hi> sin is noted, and the least thing as well amongst the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial bodies, as the Terrestiall is perfectly considered of. For sin hath his end, and his end is punishment. And so, contrarywise of Vertue, Wisdom (in the one and twentieth Ent ... ie or L ...,) His ground is upon mildnesse, which mildnesse purifieth the body and exalteth the soul, making it apt and ready to behold the heavens, receive glorious illuminations, and finally bringeth in the soul to participate, with us, not earthly, but everlasting wisdom. The Son of God was sanctified in his flesh, through mildnesse, and was not of this world, because he was the mildnesse of his Father. Therefore be you meek: Be fervent in meeknesse. Then shall you take up that Crosse which Christ spoke of, following him: which Crosse is the Compassion in mildnesse over thy brethren, for sin sake: Not as worldlings do, looking, but not lamenting. The other part is in suffering mildly the afflictions of the world, and flesh: Hereby you become Martyrs for that you mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your selves, which is true Martyrdom. He that forsaketh the world for the love of God, in his Son Christ, shall have his reward. But he that forsaketh himself, shall be Crowned with a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem of Glory. Thus saith the Lord, I am jealous over you, because you have vowed your selves unto me. But great are the temptations of the flesh, and mighty is his strength where the spirit is weak.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49588:64"/>
                  <p>But thus saith God: It is better to fill up the Soul with heavenly contemplation, and coelestical food, to reign in heaven, and to be beloved of him: Then to pamper the filthy flesh, whose delight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth both body and Soul. It is written, He that bridleth not his flesh, is given to riotousnesse, which is the sleep of death, and the slumber to destruction. But this is true abstinence, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the world you fly the delight therein: refraining from pleasures of the body, Temperating the flesh, and making it weak, and that, for the Lord his sake. For the flesh and spirit rejoyce not at once. Neither can the full belly grone out true prayers. Feed therefore the Soul with the love of our society. And bridle your flesh; For it is insolent. One thing, I say, look to your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. See, that in one house there dwell not delighters in vertue and holinesse, mingled with such as harbour vice upon vice: Whose drunkennesse is abomination, and whose diet stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up fornication. For wickednesse is amongst them: and they fear not God, neither do they abstain, according as the holy Ghost by his Church hath taught. Make them clean: Then shall you feel our presence amongst you. And we will all of us defend you from the rage of wickednesse. We delight in the God of truth, and in the worshippers of Justice. Thus sayeth the holy Ghost: Lo, I have made me a Tabernacle, where the God of Gods reigneth in Justice. And I will sanctifie those places which rejoyce in charity. Mingle therefore your Alms with charity. And let your prayers and fasting be mingled with Alms deeds. For he that prayeth and fasteth without mercy, is a lyar.

Manifold are the Mercies of God towards man, whose basenesse deserveth no such grace and most unspeakable blessing: But such is God; what he justifieth himself, in the strength of his mercy, and heveth his honour with his own holinesse. For what is man, that can justifie himself? or that hath any thing, wherein his bowels can rejoyce? Wherein can he determine happinesse to himself? Or how can be compare himself with the trees that are fruitful? If the life of man be sin, then is it hateful. But who is he that hateth it? But even he which is above, and is farthest from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. Great, therefore (O man) are thy miseries, when naturally thou art, and lovest to be hated of God, whose service is Justice, and whose delight Peace. Consider therefore the Mercies of God, through his loving kindnesse towards thy weaknesse: And acknowledge his Power which maketh those strong which have no force of themselves. Gather not up your own inventions; But be faithful servants, performing the will of him which sanctifieth you with obedience: for of dust you are become flesh, and of flesh the servants of sin; that at length you might be made free, through your own consents in the mercies of him which hath entred into your weaknesse, and weighed out his blood for your Redemption: Even he which hath payed the uttermost penny of your Ransome.

Vnto whom is Heaven a seat? but unto such as are faithful servants: Wherein the Dignity of your Master is known, of whom it is said, Blessed are those that serve the God of Hosts. If anything, now, happen unto you, that is the riches of your Master, Be thankful for it, and consider his liberalitie: And how much the more he openeth his Treasures to you, Be so much the more thankful; For unto such belongeth the ownership of more, and the reward of such as are ten times faithful. Happy are these to whom it is said, Thou good servant. Be no Gadders, for there is no house to the house of your Master. Take heed also, least you minister his bread, to such as are his enemies, and so, unworthy: for unto both these belongeth the reward of unfaithfulnesse. Be not high-minded, when you borrow your riches, lest the moths enter in and corrupt your garments: for Pride is the deph of sin .... Cease not to rebuke the dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers * as, o .... Neither maintain the honour of any other: For he that entertaineth you, hath seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you for others, And hath strengthened you with Authority, The Rod of his Justice. Generally these things have been spoken unto you, and these Lessons are not yet to learn: But happy are those whom God sanctifieth; being unholy, And ten times blessed are the Temples wherein his Holinesse dwelleth. True it is as thou sayest: Generally men are sanctified, the people of the Earth through all Nations, mystically: through the mercies of God: But where the sanctification agreeth not with the thing sanctified, there entreth wickednesse. The Spirit of God is not sanctified in Hell, Neither is his holy Temple beautified with the feet of the unrighteous. It is written, Dogs honour not bread, neither defiled places things that are holy: For as Hell dishonoureth Heaven, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of unrighteousnesse: So, those that are wicked dishonour the vertuous, and such as are truely holy, by society: and they stink of their wickednesse. For it is written, And Satan went from the presence of the Lord, leaving a stink behind him. The light of the Sun is taken from the Earth, by the congealed cloud. The sins of the people, and filthinesse of places, are put between vertue and the things Sacramental. <hi>Therefore, it is not true, that thou mayest lawfully call upon the Name of God in unhallowed places.</hi>

                  <p>..... Behold in Israel, the rough stones are acceptable Altars, And the stinking Caves have been known unto the Lord. And why? Because the place was holy, neither this filthinesse here, nor of any thing else created, hindreth: But the filthinesse of the place and Country wherein they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; for in pure places, the defield are blessed. <hi>David</hi> sanctified <hi>Saul,</hi> with the presence of his Annointing, and his Harp spake out the wonders of the Lord.

                  <p>E. K. <hi>Vincent Seve</hi> appeareth here, going down by Charing Crosse. There is a tall fellow with a cut berd with him in a skie-coloured cloak. <hi>Vincent</hi> hath a great ruff: This man waiteth on him with a Sword. He is going down into <hi>Westminster</hi> Ward: <hi>He</hi> is now talking with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man on horseback, who hath five men following him, with Cape-cloaks short, and mustaches; And he on horse back is a lean visaged man with a short Cloak and a gilt Rapier; his horse hath a Velvet foot-cloth.</p>
                  <p>E. K. In <hi>Vincent</hi> his forehead is written; <hi>Where power wanteth, rigor weakneth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K. Vincent</hi> laugheth heartily; and sheweth two broad teeth before. He holdeth a little stick within his fingers crooking. On his left hand he hath a skar of a cut, on the nether side of his hand. <hi>Vincent</hi> hath a pair of bootes on, which come straight on his legs, and very close. A great many boats appear at <hi>White-Hall.</hi> One is graffing in the Garden there. Many people are now coming out of <hi>Westminster</hi> Church. The Gentleman on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back alighteth now, and goeth down toward the Court before <hi>Westminster-Hall.</hi> He goeth now up a pair of stairs; and there standeth a fellow with a white staff. <hi>Vincent</hi> is gone in with him; The servant walketh without. The servant goeth to a Waterman there. The Waterman asketh him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be he; that is the <hi>Poland</hi> Bishop? The servant asketh him, what hath he to do? Now the servant goeth from the Waterman. Now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one down the stairs, and saith to the Serving-man, that his Master shall be dispatched to morrow. The servant saith, He is glad of it. Now all that Shew is vanished away.</p>
                  <p>Now come there two handsome men, they have Cloaks on their shoulders, and they have hats on like Tankard Crowns.</p>
                  <p>One of these said,</p>

                  <p>At length appeared a sword, two edged, firy, or rather bloudy, and a bunsh of rags hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the top of it. The rags seemed of Woollen, and Linnen Cloath: like a bundle of Rags gathered out of a Taylers shop. The sword stood upright in a manner, but leaning from <hi>E.

                     <hi>E.</hi> K. The svvord shaketh mightily. Many are the Harlots that svvarm upon the earth, and innumerable are their Children, and such as they foster. Their revvard is ready.</p>
                  <p>E. <hi>K.</hi> The sword now shaketh again mightily.</p>
                  <p>..... He that entreth into the house of the wicked is defiled: but he that consenteth with an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot is accursed. He that delighteth in her secrets, shall be stabbed. And Leprosie shall dwell in his house for ever.</p>
                  <p>Œî. O Lord, I trust, this respecteth none of us, in common sense to be understood.</p>
                  <p>..... He that delighteth in light, loveth not himself, but desireth the love of him, that illuminateth: But, thus saith God, I will not dally with you: Neither shall you handle me, as you have done. For, your <hi>Horedom,</hi> is wilfull: and your vanities worse. But this I leave amongst you, that you shall know that I am righteous. For, he that despiseth me, is accursed; and unto him that dissembleth my fashion, are miseries without number. So, unto them, that enterinto the house of blasphemy, is vengeance ready at hand.</p>
                  <p>Œî. O Lord, what is this? Man is but earth, where the heavens dwell: neither are the works of man acceptable, but with righteousnesse.</p>

                  <p>A voyce. I brought you from iniquity, to the intent you might be purified: But the more I cleanse you, the more you are defiled.</p>
                  <p>..... I have offered of old, and it shall be told. I have promised, and it shall be performed.</p>
                  <p>You have not kept my Commandments. And therefore you shall be plagued. He that goeth out of the way, shall receive the reward of errour. For stragglers, are spotted people. And none can be blessed, but such as dwell in the Tabernacle of righteousnesse. But behold, I will tell it unto you but with greater hardnesse. And I will make you know me, before I visit you in kindnesse. For thus sayeth Sathan. Lo, they erre still. Do Justice for thy glory sake. They enter into the houses of Idols: And laugh with blasphemers. They are silent, when thy name is blasphemed. Deal with them as a God: or else thou art not righteous. Therefore, be free from Sathan, that he may praise your righteousnesse. Yea, that he may say, as he hath said. Let me touch them.

Vntill then; I will be just. I will not forget this wickednesse, till you be made clean. For, behold, I have sealed it: and therefore it must be finished. For what is sealed of me, cometh to passe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A voyce.</hi> He that dissembleth the image of Christ, is a liar.</p>
                  <p>Œî.</p>
                  <p>..... Now cometh a grave man, all cloathed in white, with a Mytre upon his head.</p>
                  <p>..... The God of peace is a comforting Medicine, to such, as delight in him. The peace of the world, is the image of God: God and man, which is Jesus Christ, the son of the living God: Which knit with the father in the spirit of truth, (proceeding from them both ..... everlasting will,) ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his mercies to his Apostles, replenishing them fully and mightily with the will of the father, to the comfort of the world: Which, made messagers thereof, have delivered to the Church, full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Statutes (as the Will of him, whereunto she is united and married) to be kept inviolable, and without transgression. This Will, Covenant, or Decree, (sealed unto the end of the world in the number of the faithfull) whosoever breaketh, or dissembleth, is accursed, or damned. Therefore saith the word of God unto you: You have run astray, you have entred into the houses of Idols. I have brought you from fire, but you are entred into flames. And why? Because you defile your selves with the wickednesse of deceivers: Whose images you saw affirmatively, though not verily: Continually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with daily, and inextinguible flames: Continuing even so long, as their errour is exalted; Yea, even in the professors thereof, to their eternal damnation. For as Christ, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is light and truth: So seem the impositions of Sathan to agree, or take unto themselves, shapes or likenesses of the true image of him that saveth: Whereby he trusteth in himself under the colour of meeknesse, into the companie of the faithfull: Devouring their Souls with ravening, dissembling, and false likelyhoods of truth, <hi>unable to be decided by man.</hi> Happie are those that believe them not: For he, even he it is, that is a liar, and is oldest in deceit. But as the father is eternal: So is the son eternal, which eternity of the father and the son, is the holy Ghost eternal, proceeding equally, as the finger of God, and spirit of truth, to the general workmanship of Gods determination knit together, three Persons. <hi>[E. K. He maketh a great reverent cursie]</hi> in this omnipotency by spiritual illumination, and through the holy Ghost delivered unto the Apostles, as the pledge of God his mercie and promise, is alwayes certainly linked, joyned, and engraffed into the <hi>society</hi> of those <note place="margin">Œî Ecclesia Christi.</note> that fulfill the will of the highest perfectly, and without errour, whose strength shall continue, and glorie branch out, even unto the end of this world, and beginning of comfort. Therefore, believe: For the spirit of truth worketh wonders, raiseth the dead, and hath power to forgive sins. Through the power of him, unto whom it is ma ..... For, as Christ hath all power in heaven and in earth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ..... So hath he delivered all power in heaven and earth to his true Church. Therefore she cannot erre. For where power is without measure, errour hath no number: Believe not therefore those that lie: saying, The Church of God is infected with errours. For the offences of few are not counted errour, but unrighteousnesse: Neither can the <hi>stragling</hi> feet of a few drunken, bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy <note place="margin">Œî <hi>

                  <p>..... It lieth not in my power to deliver you, or reconcile you from death and Hell: The tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and filthinesse of the world, and the wrath of God. But yet, (That Cloud, set aside) which is between me and you) I speak afar of to you, saying, The Justice of God, is vengeance it self: Neither hath it any contrary, but even in the midst, and Centre of it self: Which is the drop and liquor of his eternal, great, and incomprehensible Majestie of himself, his mercie: Which, even in the midst of Justice is found out, by sorrowfull repentance, and reconciliation: Not in that it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie with God: But that it is a Medicine applicable, and most healthfull to the infirmities of that man, that coveteth to be healed, released, or recovered from his soares. This is it, that must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you. For, as Justice is the reward of sin, so is mercie the reward of repentance. But mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is the Center of light: and Justice to be cast off, and shut within darknesse. Therefore, be not negligent.</p>
                  <p>Œî. This whoredom, how is it committed, or of whom?</p>
                  <p>..... I teach the ..... Where thy habitation was, errour rained, God called thee from it: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered thee by many, but unknown wayes: means not to be uttered by man. These places also are shut up from the favour of God. For their obedience is counterfeited, and their prayers, out-cries. Therefore hath the Lord opened him unto you that invented the vanitie: that you might be partakers of his knowledge, and secret judgements of the wicked. Here also you entred, and are newly defiled: For the Devil entred in, and found him waking: And lo, he entred yet, and he was not asleep. But he was happie, being kindled with desire of God, else had the judgement of his bodie for this world been fulfilled. Wickednesse followeth him: and the spirits of evil counsel are at hand. You shall feel the sorrow thereof, and your family shall be discomforted. But pray unto God, that it fall not out, that Sathan goeth about: Neither that it come to passe, which he hath power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute. For, this token signifieth your miseries, and it is a sign of that, which is given to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p>I have said.</p>
                  <p>The peace of God be restored unto you.</p>

This is all I have to say. Wash your selves, and I also will make you clean. Resist you Satan diligently, and I will help you mightily.</p>

Behold, my mouth faltreth, and my lips are stayed: But pray you, and you shall not be rejected. For the stronger you be, the mercifuller is God, and the weaker is, and shall be, your adversary.

Pluck up thy heart and be merry, pine not thy Soul away with inward groanings; for I will open unto thee the secrets of Nature, and the riches of the World, and withal give thee such direction, that shall deliver thee from many infirmities, both of body and minde: Ease thee of thy tedious labour, and settle thee where thou shalt have comfort.</p>

                  <p>..... Who is he that leadeth out the Lion to prey? or who is he that lifteth up the feet of the young ones to devour? Who feedeth the smell of the roaring Bear, or hath taught him to remember the place of his recreation? Hath he also taught the fields, to put forth their voices: and the mighty Trees to flourish in pride? Are not the Hills glad when they bring forth Corn? When the Valleys rejoice with threefold waters. The beasts of the wildernesse have they not known Caves: and unto such as are made tame, is there not a ..... understanding? For, who is he that teacheth them, to make subject themselves, which are ravening, or to bridle such as are of their frowardnesse? Even he it is, that looketh down from Heaven, and beholdeth the earth, and measureth with his feet, saying,</p>
                  <p>It is done.</p>
                  <p>Which entreth also into the houses of men, and listeneth to that which they call wonders. Which openeth the gates of his knowledge with his own finger; And which sayeth unto you: How are ye become wise? Or from whence is your understanding, are your hearts become Caves to send out Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Or why are your spirits thus vexed with holinesse? Are you not a stiff-necked people, and such as are despised? Are you not poor, and therefore hated. Since, therefore, you are become Bastards, who teacheth your lips to speak of my Church? Or hath taught you to urge me with mine own spirit?</p>
                  <p>Behold, I am mighty,</p>
                  <p>Because I am the joy of the faithfull. For I am called the Temple of the Holy ones, and the beauty of <hi>Israel.</hi> The spirit of man crieth out, and pierceth into the Lord, as the swiftnesse of an Arrow: And he heard them. Therefore, thus doth the winde of <hi>Cabon</hi> open her mouth, and sweareth by the <hi>Jaspar</hi> Pillar that standeth in the Temple of Reconciliation, and it Thundereth, and is said,</p>
                  <p>Be it done.</p>
                  <p>And behold, the doors open, and the Holy Altar is covered. The beasts with many feet bring up burnt-offerings: And there is a sacrifice that ascendeth up, and it is a mighty winde, such as hath not been since the beginning of dayes. Open your ears therefore, and prepare your selves to hear: For this..... is mighty, for it is of peace. My Justice (saith the Lord) is sealed, and you have sinned mightily: My arm is stretched forth, and I must be magnified: For vengeance is gone forth, and is appeared already. But who is he that resisteth the venome of the earth, or instructeth man to avoid the Darts of poison? He saith unto you. Thus it is, because I have sanctified you, and have made you holy to the earth: Therefore will I help you: But not as you desire: For your prayers and unrighteous life shall become bands of yarn. And I will make a contention betwixt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and you. If therefore you labour hard, and open fervent mindes, such as are not of the world, and can binde this sword and cloud of vengeance fast from amongst you: Be it so unto you, for it is your own righteousnesse. For Sathan hath reviled, and hath said,</p>
                  <p>Then shalt thou see.</p>
                  <p>But so long as they are Holy, and become righteousnesse, they are become safe: but when they fall, Satan entreth in. For the power of righteousnesse is become a Conquerour, if it fight mightily. And Satan shall be confounded by a righteous judgement.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:49588:70"/>
                  <p>For I have decreed it: and by my self I swear it.</p>
                  <p>I will be a righteous Judge betwixt you. Therefore, take heed you sinnot not, nor go into death: For great is the fall of vengeance.

But he that is filled with the second, shall be drunken for ever. The first is power present, and a comfort inmeasurable, glorifying, and strengthning all things that are agreeable to it: But when they differ, it returneth. The other is the spirit of the first, and the second, Almighty, and everlasting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable, and inexplicable: drowning the will of man, that becometh strong in the fountain of gladnesse and understanding: true wisdom her self, and not returning.

But O you of little wisdom, you rise up against the windes, and yoke your wits against the mountains: Nay you cast your selves down headlong, where there is no mercy. For what blasphemie is it to say, <hi>If it be the will of God, it must follow?</hi> Is not man subject to the bringing in of his own labours? And are not they allowed to his comfort, being brought in?</p>
                     <p>The soul of man is the Image of God, after his form, which keepeth within himself the <hi>power</hi> of his divinity in the heavenly Spirit, whereby he hath Authority to consent with God in the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of his Will and Creatures: Which <hi>Power</hi> being sealed already, giveth unto man (as King of himself) to consent to his own salvation, conjoyning and knitting himself together, either with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance in the assured hope of mercy, or (with wilfull drunkennesse,) to the reward of such as fall. Therefore, Become Holy. For the soul beautifieth, when it is beautified in it self. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist not the Will of God, which is mighty on you: Be not obstinate.</p>
                     <p>Be humble, Rejoyce not for this World: But be glad that your names are sealed, and that <hi>you shall correct</hi> the World. Despair not through weaknesse; for from whom cometh strength? If puddles become Seas, the end is more wonderful: But yet greater when sinners are called to the knowledge and performance of God his Will, thorough his mercies. Even as one day perisheth, and is not, although he hath been; Even so it is, and shall be the state of this World. For the Earth must sing O Sanna with the Heavens, And there must be One veritie. And Hierusalem shall descend with an horn of glory to the end. The Sun and Moon shall be witnesses, and wonder at their stay. The Kings of the Earth shall become proud in themselves, and are unable to be tamed with man.</p>
                     <p>But I will yoke them (saith the Lord) <hi>with correction;</hi> And force them one to imitate ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers steps: Yea they shall tread the grapes alike; For in my Vineyard Corruption shall not dwell with Authority: Neither shall the Prince of Darknesse usurpe my further honour.</p>

                     <p>Œî. O Lord, for thy great mysteries declared unto us (this day) we most humbly thank thee.

Then appeared a Sea, endlesse one way, and a Haven mouth with a River which fell or ran into that mouth. And besides that River doing down into the Haven, did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other River appear by running into the Sea, without any Haven making or having.

He is very high: he hath a face, but with many eyes and noses, but not distinctly to be discerned. His body seemeth to be red Brasse. He standeth with his arms abroad, and no hands appear. His right arme is of the colour of silver; His left arme seemeth to be black, twinkling. His head is much of the colour of that Sea wherein his left leg standeth.

He standeth upon a white great round Table, like Chrystal, all written with letters, infinitely. On the middle of the Table is a great swelling or pommel of the same substance the Table is of.

Hear the Lord, That thy sins may be forgiven thee: For the Prophesies of the Lord are not uttered to the world, with the seales of the wicked. Therefore become holy, that thou mayest augment the benefit of God bestowed amongst you; and render it to the world, as the message of truth, with thanksgiving. <hi>Meum est pauca dicere.</hi>

                     <hi>Nal.</hi> ..... If they were not Devils and enemies of truth, they would praise and honour God in his Messengers of truth. But because these Actions are true, and the truth of them shall be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their kingdom; Therefore devilishly and enviously they resist the will of God. Deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Devils. This Doctrine what it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> the power; Blaspheming his truth, and infecting his vessels.</p>
                  <p>In our Doctrine there is nothing taught but the state of the world, here, and to come. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies of time, and the knitting up of God his mysteries, opened from time to time, to those that are his sanctified: as testimonies in the Creation and Operation of his Creatures; whereof this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is a part. The Prophets in their times were not ignorant by revelation of the good will of their Creator. The Apostles in Christ his Kingdom, were made partakers of the mysteries to come, of the state of mans salvation; and ending of this combat, which is in that day, when all Creatures shall receive their reward. The Church of God is alwayes garnished and furnished with spiritual Revelations: as a Mansion or Dwelling-place of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>These latter dayes, and end of harvest must have also Labourers: For no Age passeth away, but through the hands of God, who maketh the end of his doings known to the World: To the end, the World may consent unto him in Glory. So that this Doctrine, is the mysteries of the word of God, sealed from the beginning, now delivered unto man, <hi>for that Reformation which must be in One unity established unto the end.</hi> The very part of <hi>that Circle,</hi> which comprehendeth the <note place="margin">Reformation. Note this Circle.</note> Mysteries of the Highest, in his <hi>Prophets, Apostles, and Ministers yet to come,</hi> which <hi>are alive,</hi> and shall bear witnesse of eternal Comfort.</p>
                  <p>The fruit of our Doctrine is, that God should be praised. For of our selves we seek no glory: But we serve you to your comfort, teaching you the will of God, in the self same Christ, that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; <hi>sold and died in the Patriarchs,</hi> and published to the World by his Disciples, and is now taught unto you, in the remission of sins .... <hi>greatest in the World, for the end of all things.</hi> The very key and entrance into the secret mysteries of God, (in respect of his determination on earth) bringing with it reward in the end of eternal glory, which is the greatest Treasure. Those that tempt thee, do it in respect of the fear they have of the power of God, springing in thee.</p>
                  <p>Let this suffice. The World is vain in respect of eternal joyes. Heaven and Earth passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: The reward of the Righteous endureth.</p>

A year it is; Wherein nature looketh with many eyes through..... dwelling places: unto some as a Nurse: and to the rest as a step-mother. And so it is meant in the Scriptures. For, <hi>a time is an year, purposed by determination in the judgement of God; which is not known</hi> to man, how, or when it shall happen. Another year is a time established, and presently delivered, as the present judgement of God. This is that I speak of. A time is an year. The parts are known amongst you.</p>

                  <p>E. K. These shadows go up and down the side of the house, thrusting their Torches into the sides of it. The house is like this very house. They go round about the house. There are eight of them. They have claws like Eagles. When they sit, they are like Apes. They set a fire on it, and it burneth mightily; Now your wife runneth out, and seemeth to leap over the Galery rayl, and to ly as dead. And now come you out of door, and the Children stand in the way toward the Church. And you come by the yern door; and kneel, and knock your hand on the earth. They take up your wife; her head waggleth this way and that way. You look up to heaven still, and kneel upon one of your knees. The stone house quiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and quaketh, and all the roof of the house falleth into the house, down upon the Chests. And one of these baggage things laugheth. The house burneth all off. Your wife is dead, all her face is battered. The right side of her face, her teeth and all is battered. She is bare-legged, she hath a white Peticote on.

Hearken therefore to my voyce, I say, therefore hearken to my voyce: For the spirits of wickednesse, and confusion have risen up against thee: If therefore they prevail against my purposes; Then shall it be no world: Neither are there any heavens. But, this place is not for thee; yet, if thou wilt, be it unto thee. I will seal destruction, both for a time and for ever. Be mighty therefore in me. All the earth rageth in wickednesse.

                  <p>Œî. Did you not will us to have my chest from <hi>Torn</hi> before we go?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mad</hi> ..... Now you are become a new man, both we may dwell in one house. Sir, I promise you of my credit, you shall be to learn nothing of these things by <hi>August.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Œî. By <hi>August</hi> next?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mad.</hi> ..... Yea ... Next.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Perhaps my Lord his furniture of money will not be such, as to serve for our carriage anew, &amp;c. Besides that, I would wish <hi>Kesmark</hi> to be redeemed, before he should come to <hi>Cracovia:</hi> Perhaps then with the people, his credit would be greater.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mad.</hi> ..... Those that become Kings, care nothing for Farm-houses.</p>
                  <p>Œî I would that needlesse cost, here bestowed, had been saved: or that you had told us this sooner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mad.</hi> ..... Silence now, is my best answer.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Do you know, (O Lord, what say I?) Have we had any name of <hi>NALVAGE,</hi> heretofore in our Tables or Books expressed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mad.</hi> ..... What have you written, that have you written. He is a near kinsman to my Mother. We call him, with us, <hi>Fuga terrestrium.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Œî. We beseech God, that all intermedling, and saucinesse of the wicked in these Actions may cease. You know how one clawed him, here, on the head, as with Eagles claws.</p>

                  <p>Œî. The questions needful to be required of <hi>Madimi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Good counsel for my health recovering, and confirming.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Pedestal (for the holy Table) being here made, shall be carryed with us to <hi>Cracow,</hi> rather than to make a new there: both to save time, and to have our doings the more secret?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What is your knowledge and judgement of <hi>A. L.</hi> his wife, in respect of her life past, present, and to come; for we doubt she is not our sound friend?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is our very earnest desire, that the Danish Treasurer in <hi>England,</hi> in the ten places, (seised on by <hi>E. K.</hi>) might be brought hither, very speedily: whereby <hi>A. L.</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem <hi>Keysmark</hi> and <hi>Lasko</hi> lands, morgaged: and also pay his debts in <hi>Cracow,</hi> and about <hi>Cracow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, else, neither can he come with any credit, to <hi>Cracow,</hi> (as he is willed) neither can he come to us, there, so commodiously, and oft, as our conferences may be requisit. And thirdly, the day of <hi>Keysmark</hi> forfeiting (without the Emperour his favourable help) draweth nigh: as in <hi>April</hi> at St. <hi>George</hi> his Day next.</p>
                  <p>Œî. And by your speech of <hi>England,</hi> you give me occasion to enquire whether her Majesty doth cause my rents to be received, by my Deputy assigned or no?</p>
                  <p>Whether her Majesty, or the Council, do intend to send for me again, <hi>into England</hi> or no?</p>
                  <p>And as concerning the red p .... which <hi>E. K.</hi> found with the book in <hi>England,</hi> what it is: And what is the best use of it, and how that use is to be practised or performed?</p>
                  <p>Œî. after these Questions written, and a little our praying to God for his light, verity, and help, and to send <hi>Madami,</hi> according as she willed me to note many things, for that she could answer them briefly: we used silence a while; ... ath she appeared on my right hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and <hi>E. K.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>..... Blessed be his name that in truth, and for the truth, sendeth his Ministers to instruct them that love Truth. .... Even so ..... Be not pierced too much with sight of me. <hi>[to</hi> E. K. <hi>for he looked mervallously earnestly on her.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> She seemeth more bright than she was; And to ... and to stand in a more bright place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mad.</hi> ..... All honour be to him that liveth in Heaven and in Earth, and is mighty in all places. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> ..... Your health.</p>
                  <p>E. K. Now she is gone to the place on the Cushions on the bench, where she stood yesterday. She doth now as young children do, playing with her
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49588:79"/>
coats; and at length sitteth down on the Cushions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mad.</hi> ..... Even as spiritual and dignified illuminations, <hi>from ascension,</hi> and by descending, work the will of God, determined in all Creatures, diversly, according to the measured purpose of the Highest, in dispersing his will upon and into every one, particularly; whereby some become wise, one in this, another in that degree; other some mighty in works, whereby health and help, comfort and joy, is given to the faithful: Even so, ascending, doth Hell infect, sometime with error, and sometime with infirmities: So that from Heaven springeth health, from below infirmities of body and soul. Whereby we find two immediate powers, bringing forth two properties, The one Comfort, <note place="margin">Two imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate powers.</note> with Joy; The other Infection with sorrow.</p>
                  <p>But this may be objected: Hath it not been seen, that the wicked cure diseases? and restore health? Whatsoever is of death, is sorrow; which is the ground of spiritual and bodily infection so that evil cannot work good. How can it therefore be that the dead revive, or restore health? The cure therefore of all spiritual infection (I mean the infections of such, as are spiritual is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his weaknesse, and not of his strength; Because Satan infecting, may become weak (whereby he cannot prevail) and so give health, by reason of weaknesse: Otherwise, with power, bringing death all manner of wayes.</p>
                  <p>Œî. <hi>E. K.</hi> thought a thing, whereunto she answered. . and he said ... my thought: she answered .... in my degree, thoughts .... known to me. I, than an .... she is of God and in God, tha .... the thought of man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> She ... I hear ... a buz... eare.</p>
                  <p>..... These two immediate and supernatural properties are so dignified in Creation and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, that the good Angels cannot cure, or help such infirmities, as are brought in by the subtile infection of the wicked themselves: Vnlesse in body the immediate power of the second Person in Trinity be adjoyned in the aid and cure of the infected body; which is the true Physitian. And as he took upon him man his frailty, so he is chief Governour over the same in all degrees.</p>
                  <p>If the soul be infected, the Angels have no power to ... it or make it clean: but by the will of the Father which is the Holy Ghost, descending through the Angels into the propriety of the Church: whereby the Disease is cured. Therefore, considering, thou art infected not naturally, but by spiritual and wicked inflammation, stirring up thy body unto infection. We that are good Angels, cannot minister help unlesse we feel the immediate power of him which is the second, and the water of Life. Notwithstanding, as we know how the infection grew, either locally or really: So can <hi>we find contrary places and things for comfort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Herod</hi> was infected by the Devil to kill very Christ the Son of God; His purpose was not altered by contradiction to the Devil, but by the foreknowledge of God, which appointed <hi>Egypt</hi> for his safeguard. So it is said unto thee, It is thought good thou shouldst rest at <hi>CRACOVIA;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cracovia.</note> for it is a place sanctified, both in fore-determination, and now. Therefore use the Sabbath, and rest from labour: Reap now, and eat the fruit of thy labour; Presse the Vine, that thou mayest drink, and be comforted: For the promises of God, are not in vain; Neither are the Heavens fruitlesse. For as it is said, <hi>Thou art not bound,</hi> but for the service of God: Neither shalt thou <note place="margin">Riches.</note> be enriched by Princes: but shalt enrich them. Flesh may speak vainly, and be without comfort: But the promises of God, cease not, neither become uncertain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This year to come,</hi> is of great blood-shed: prepared to stop the mouth of the Earth, which gapeth for sorrow. Therefore <hi>thou</hi> must <hi>be separated,</hi> that the promises of God may be fulfilled: which cometh (not at your request, but at his Determination) most abundantly.</p>
                  <p>These Boords need not, The paviment shall serve; for it is neither the Earth, nor mans hands, (but the Finger of him that liveth.) that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Behold .... That the power of God might be known, therefore he hath chosen those that are not regarded, to the intent, it may be said: Lo, This is of God. .. Hast therefore, and stay not, for thy warning is great.</p>

                  <p>The Godhead in his secret judgement keeping in his Almighty bosom, the image and form of all things, universally, looked down upon the Earth; for he said, Let us now go down among the sons of men: He saw that all things grew contrary to their creation and nature; either keeping their dignities and secret vertues shut up in obscurity, or else riotously perishing, through the imbecility and frowardnesse of ignorance: So that it was said, Behold, I delight not in the World: The Elements are defiled, the sons of men wicked, their bodies become dunghills, and the inward parts (the secret chambers of their hearts) the dens and dungeons of the damned: Therefore I will draw my spirit from amongst them, and they shall become more drunken, and their ignorance such as never was: No, not since the fall of he avens.</p>
                  <p>For, lo, the time is come, <hi>And he that is the Son of Unrighteousnesse, is and liveth:</hi> Unto <note place="margin">Antichristas.</note> him therefore shall be given strength and power: and the Kings of the Earth shall become mad: yea, even raging mad; yea even in the third madnesse, and that in the depth of their own imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; and I will build my Temple in the Woods, yea even in the Desert places; and I will
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49588:82"/>
become a Serpent in the wildernesse: for I have tucked up my garments and am fled away, and <hi>She</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> shall mourn on the Mountains without comfort.</p>
                  <p>Lo, the Thunder spake, and the earth became misty, and full of fogge, that the Soul of man might sleep in his own confusion. The second Thunder spake, and there arose spirits, such as are for Sooth-sayers, Witches, Charmers, and Seducers: and they are entred into the holy places, and have taken up their seats in man. Woe be unto the earth therefore: For, it is corrupted. Woe be unto the earth, for she is surrendred to her adversary: Woe be unto the earth, she is delivered into the hands of her enemy: Yea, Woe be unto the sons of men, for their vessels are poysoned. But even then said the Lord, Lo, I will be known in the wildernesse, and will Triumph in my weaknesse.</p>
                  <p>And lo, he called you, and you became drunken, and foolish with the spirit of God: And it was said Descend, for he calleth, and hath called: and <hi>Raphael</hi> that brought up the prayers descended: <note place="margin">Raphael: This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> and he was full with the power, &amp; spirit of God: and it became a Doctrine, <hi>such was never from the beginning:</hi> Not painted, or carved: filed, or imagined by man, or according to their imaginations, which are of flesh: but simple, plain, full of strength, <hi>and the power of the holy Ghost:</hi> which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine began, as man did, nakedly from the earth: but yet, the image of perfection. This self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Art is it, which is delivered unto you an infallible Doctrine, containing in it the waters, which runne through many Gates: <hi>even above the Gate of Innocency,</hi> wherein you are taught to finde out the Dignity and Corruption of nature: also made partakers of the secret Judgements of the Almighty to be made manifest, and to be put in execution. Which knowledge in you is to be made perfect: two wayes, by power, mediate, and immediate. Immediately from God, in respect of his will, and secret Judgements, as unto the Apostles. By means and tradition, as from us, opening the substance <hi>and body of nature, according to our own image, which is the thing I have now in hand.</hi> I am therefore to instruct and inform you, according to your Doctrine delivered, which is contained in <hi>49</hi> Tables. In <hi>49 voyces,</hi> or <hi>callings:</hi> which are the <hi>Natural Keyes,</hi> to open those, not <note place="margin">48 Keyes, or calls, and their use.</note> 
                     <hi>49.</hi> but <hi>48.</hi> (for One is not to be opened) Gates of understanding, whereby you shall have knowledge <hi>to move every Gate, and to call out as many</hi> as you please, or shall be thought necessary, which can very well, righteously, and wisely, open unto you the secrets of their Cities, &amp; make you <hi>understand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the contained in the Tables.</hi> Through which knowledge you shall easily be able to judge, not as the world doth, but perfectly of the world, and of all things contained within the Compasse of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of all things which are subject to an end.</p>

                  <p>Thus therefore saith the Lord, Be patient, <hi>for the place is holy,</hi> and the power of the Highest is amongst you.

Nalvage</hi> denied it to be an <hi>X.</hi> and said he knew not yet the mystery: say the Lords prayer, for I cannot open it. Although my power be multiplied, yet I know not this Letter.

                  <p>But note, that every vision is according to the soul of man in power: and so is received of him <note place="margin">

                  <p>Œî. After a short prayer to God for remission of sins, and sending of his graces, and his good Ministers assigned for our instructions: and for the avoiding away of the great enemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who held conflict against <hi>Gabriel,</hi> &amp;c. The white Curtain appeared still drawn before in the stone for an hour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> There appeareth a face standing upon two Pillars, the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain yet remaining drawn: The face is fiery, and hath very great teeth. The Pillars are like Marble spotted gray, and the ground of the Pillars colour white. He said, the works of the highest are become a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block, and have entred into the breasts of a woman, and he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come angry. But when she thinketh her self happy, she shall stumble, where she would not, and become sorrowfull without comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> This face and Pillars became a great water swelling upward, and so vanished away.</p>
                  <p>Œî. After about an hour, the Curtain was opened. All appeareth as before: <hi>Gabriel</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his Chair, and <hi>Nalvage</hi> kneeleth.</p>
                  <p>Œî. I prayed divers prayers of God, &amp; help against the wicked enemy, yet present, and molesting us as he was permitted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nal.</hi> ..... Pray, for the mercy of God. Pray, for thou shalt not be heard? So, well said, fy upon him.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Thy judgement light on this wicked Rebel for this blasphemy, O God.</p>
                  <p>Œî. This Devil rayled against God.</p>

                  <p>Œî. I have counted them, and they seem to be 88.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> There is a great Crosse over all the stone that is red: Not onely over to be impressed through the stone.</p>

                  <p>Œî. I have numbred them, and they seem to be 169.</p>
                  <p>Œî. While I numbred, the great red crosse went away: and shortly after came in again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the stone as before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ..... More not, for the place is holy. You have <hi>Zurza ds Gono</hi> in the Call: the <hi>sd</hi> is <hi>too</hi> much.</p>

                  <p>As I was in my upper Study, and had gathered the holy words of the second and third call, and had conferred them with their <hi>English</hi> delivered also unto us: <hi>E.

K.</hi> to like<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the better of the manner of our friends, due, and Methodical, proceeding with us, and told him that unlesse of this strange language I should have these words delivered unto us Letter by Letter, we might erre both in Orthography, and also for want of the true pronunciation of the words, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions of the points, we might more misse the effect expected: But as on <hi>Tuesday</hi> last, so now again he said, our Teachers were deluders, and no good, or sufficient Teachers, who had not in two years space made us able to understand, or do somewhat: and that he could in two years have learned all the seven Liberal sciences, if he had first learned Logick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would have no more to do with them any manner of way, wished himself in <hi>England,</hi> and said that if these books were his, that he would out of hand burn them, and that he had written to my Lord (by <hi>Pirmis</hi>) that he took our Teachers to be decelvers, and wicked, and no good Creatures of God, with many such speeches, and reasons (as he thought) of force to diswade himself from any more dealing with them: But willed me to use <hi>John</hi> my Boy as my Skryer, for that these spiritual Creatures were not bound unto him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I answered unto all these parcels and reasons, as time served declaring <hi>my perfect trust in God,</hi> that seeing I have many years desired, and prayed for wisdome (such as these Actions import) at his hands, and by such means as to his Divine Majesty seemeth best, that he would not either <hi>mislike</hi> my prayer, or abuse my Constant hope in his goodnesse and mercy: Therefore <hi>I</hi> concluded that <hi>I</hi> referred all to the mercifull will of God, and doubted nothing at the length to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of my request, and prayer made unto him. So he went from me this second time.... God lighten his heart with knowledge of the truth, if it be his Divine will and pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Note. <hi>Permis.</hi> went on last Wednesday morning, and had received our Letters after noon, on Tuesday last: But on Monday before the wicked Prince of darknesse did what he could to hinder our proceeding.</p>

                     <hi>Saturday,</hi> Aprilis <hi>21.</hi> √† Meridie.</head>
                  <p>After our prayers made, appeared shortly <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Nalvage.</hi> E. K. propounded six questions orderly, which had bred great doubt in this fantafie, and requested their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:49588:90"/>
                  <p>Œî. He would have our spiritual friends to promise him the performance of the Prints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ...... If we were Masters of our own doings, we might well promise: But we are servants and do the will of our master. But let me ask thee one question:</p>
                  <p>Dost thou not think that all things are possible with God?</p>
                  <p>E. K. I do so, and I know so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ...... Then is there no cause why thou should distrust. Let him that is a servant, and is commanded to go, go: and let not the earth rise up, and strive against the plow man. What sin is it when the creature riseth up, and saith in his heart, <hi>Let the Lord make a Covenant with me,</hi> considering he is a bond man?</p>
                  <p>[<hi>E. K.</hi> They seem, both the voices at once, to come to my eare.]</p>
                  <p>None but he that becometh disobedient, and refuseth his Master.</p>
                  <p>Œî....... [Œî would do so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab. Nal.</hi> ...... These things, that is to say, this Doctrine, delivered by us, is of God, and of his mercies granted unto you, which cannot be in vain: <hi>and therefore to be performed;</hi> for the secret determinations of God are unknown unto us.</p>
                  <p>He never heard of any man that would ask, if God would perform his promises.</p>
                  <p>E. K. By <hi>August</hi> next?</p>
                  <p>What if it were a hundred <hi>Augusts?</hi> you may be a weary before <hi>August</hi> next, as the Children of Israel were of their Manna.</p>
                  <p>E. K. Why joyn you numbers with these letters, and added none with those of the former Table.</p>
                  <p>Brother, what is the cause that all the World is made by numbers? The Numbers we speak <note place="margin">

                  <p>Œî. I beseech you as concerning the powder whereof he thinketh that he hath made due assay of it, as if it should have been the Philosophers Stone, and so affirmed to be, by the minister of this action? I beseech you so to answer, the thing, as his reason may be satisfied.</p>
                  <p>Œî. They gave no answer hereunto, but proceeded in the former matter of Numbers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ...... Every Letter signifieth the member of the substance whereof it speaketh. Every <note place="margin">Note the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of this Method and Language.</note> word signifieth the quiddity of the substance. The Letters are separated, and in confusion: and therefore, <hi>are by numbers gathered together:</hi> which also gathered signifie a <hi>number:</hi> for as every greater containeth his lesser, so are the secret and unknown <hi>forms</hi> of things knit up in their parents: <hi>Where being known in number, they are easily distinguished,</hi> so that herein we teach places to be numbred: letters to be elected from the numbred, and proper words from the letters, signifying substantially the thing that is spoken of in the center of his Creator, whereby even as the minde of man moved at an ordered speech, and <hi>is easily perswaded in things that are true,</hi> so are the creatures of God stirred up in themselves, <hi>when they hear the words wherewithal they were nursed and brought forth:</hi> For nothing moveth, that is not perswaded: neither can any thing be perswaded that is unknown. The <hi>Creatures of God understand you not,</hi> you are not <note place="margin">Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Motion.</note> of their Cities: you are become enemies, because you <hi>are separated</hi> from him that Governeth the City <hi>by ignorance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Whether is this Language known in any part of the World or no? if it be, where and to whom?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ...... Man in his Creation, being made an Innocent, was also authorised and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Power and Spirit of God: whereby he not onely did know all things under his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Adam.</note> and spoke of them properly, naming them as they were: but also was partaker of our presence and society, yea a speaker of the mysteries of God; yea, with God himself: so that in innocency the power of his partakers with God, and us his good Angles, was exalted, and so became holy in the sight of God until that <hi>Coronzon</hi> (for so is the true name of that mighty Devil) envying his <note place="margin">.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49588:90"/>
the intent that the proportions may agree in themselves: for it is written, Wisdom sitteth upon an Hill, and beholdeth the four Winds, and girdeth her self together as the brightnesse of the morning, which is visited with a few, and dwelleth alone as though she were a Widow.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see there, the Necessity of this Tongue: The Excellency of it, And the Cause why it is preferred before that which you call <hi>Hebrew:</hi> For it is written, Every lesse, consentesh to his greater. I trust this is sufficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> As concerning the power, What is it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ...... What it is, that it is, for the knowledge of it may lead you to error.</p>
                  <p>Œî. This answer offended greatly <hi>E. K.</hi> and thereupon he left off, and would receive no more at their hands. God make him patient, and a favourer of this Action as soon as it is needful that he should be.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Laudetur, magnificetur &amp; extollatur nomen Jesu Christi in omne aevum. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>The Vail appeared as at first almost. After half an hour <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Nalvage</hi> appeared, after my manifold prayers and discourses.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Two keyes we have received by the mercy of the Highest and your ministers, the rest we attend, according to the merciful will of the Highest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ...... Move not from your places, for the place is holy.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Shew a token O Lord when thy will is, whereby to perswade thy merciful dealings with us, and the presence of thy faithful Ministers.</p>
                  <p>Œî. The frame of the Stone gave a crickling, no hand touching it, or otherwise any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <note place="margin">Note.</note> or worldly thing moving it. I heard it very certainly, and to <hi>E. K.</hi> it seemed the sound of a bunch of keyes, as if they had quickly been shaken and strongly.</p>
                  <p>E. K. Gabriel <hi>fitteth, and</hi> Nalvage <hi>standeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ...... My Brethren he arken to my voice, for I am the true servant of the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the dignity whereof is sufficient both for the verity of the Doctrine, and the confirmation, and perswasion of your mindes: for as God is the Father of the Faithful, so he sheweth himself unto the faithful: whereby you may prove the great comfort and consolation: that you may justly gather of the mercies of God, as touching your Election.</p>
                  <p>For at what time hath God appeared unto the unrighteous? or where do you read that ever he visited the reprobate? For the reprobate hath no visitation, but in the rod of Justice:</p>
                  <p>But you may rise up among your selves, saying lo, we are froward, we want faith. <note place="margin">An objection. Answer.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>True it is, the acts of faith, but not the roots of faith. But I say unto you, that the power of God in his Election, is the Basis of mans purity and acceptation.</p>
                  <p>But here there is a Caveat.</p>
                  <p>That man <hi>imagining</hi> his Predestination and perfect Election, <hi>justifieth not himself;</hi> for wheresoever this is found, or this Doctrine preached amongst you, either simply in man, or publickly in Congregation, it is the sure sign and token of their perpetual ignorance and confusion: For the Will and Power of God belongeth not to our measure (for it was the cause of rebellion amongst us) much lesse among men, which are fighting yet for the Glory of their reward. Behold it is a sin in him that judgeth of his brothers Conscience; Much more is it a threefold error, <hi>to form the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of sin, by whose imaginations they are.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be not proud therefore of the gifts of God, but become humble; Neither justifie your self in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that this is the word of God delivered unto you for your own selves: But the more you receive, be the more thankful; and the more you be in the strength of God, the more use you the purenesse of humility.</p>
                  <p>Of whom it is said, Behold my Spirit hath entred, yea into my servants, and they are become humble and meek in the sight of men: But if we be the servants of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then are <note place="margin">Good Angels.</note> we the spirits of truth and understanding, for our faith is dignified in the sight of the heavens, and we are become mighty in the power of the Almighty. Therefore ought we to be believed.</p>
                  <p>Now if you will confesse your selves to be the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then must you also accept of our Doctrine: For the meat whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> lived, is the same food we minister unto you: of whom it is said, He believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousnesse. Even so do you,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49588:91"/>
that you also may be righteous, wherein do you differ from <hi>Abraham?</hi> Were you not barren? Who hath made you fruitfull?</p>
                  <p>Did God make a Covenant with <hi>Abraham?</hi> Even so he doth with you. Did the Lord in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters <note place="margin">A Covenant.</note> appear unto him? so doth he, and will do unto you. Were the sins of <hi>Sodom</hi> (the fifth that perished) imported into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, as the secret determination of the Lord? Are they also not manifest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And shall you not also see the ruine of him that is the son of wickednesse. Yes, <hi>unlesse you hinder your selves. For the promise of your God is without exception.</hi> Be mindful therefore of your selves; and consider your calling: That you may be still blessed in him that is the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is your Father.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Nal.</hi> It is of two parts, the first in respect of the spirit and presence of him that is holy: present and teaching. Secondly in respect of your consent, which is obedience, for obedience confirmeth the will of God in man, and the will of God confirmeth mans salvation; wherefore it is said, <hi>move not:</hi> and why? because the place is holy. Move neither in mind, neither in body, for obedience is the conclusion, and confirmation of your separations from the Devils. Sacrifice is accepted, but obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is better.

                  <p>But the Prophet said unto them, GOE back and tell your King, that I found him on the way, and a stranger, and I had pity on him, and I took him for my own. Therefore strive not, for justice must prevail. And they began to stagger as drunkards, for they knew it was true. And the Prophet said, Now come with me, I will yet lead thee: and they ascended. The Prophet held up his hands, and SAID, I SEE, and behold, he that was naked arose: and said, I SEE ALSO.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now they are here: and <hi>Gabriel</hi> is all full of glory, he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to light all places.</p>
                  <p>Œî. O the mercies of God encreased, though his determination be all one</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he is as he was before: and in the time of this his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparition, <hi>Nalvage</hi> kneeled down, somewhat regarding towards <hi>Gabriel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:49588:98"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ..... Give unto him that hath his basket open: But from him that is not ready, depart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> There appear here, 7 other like Priests, all in white, having <note place="margin">BLRAHICAANHDL</note> long hair hanging down behind: their white garments traile after them: having many pleits in them. Me think that I have seen one of them before, and upon that creature appeareth a B upon his cloathes, an L in another place, an R upon his other shoulder, another A upon his other shoulder. There is an H upon his breast; there is an I upon his head, and a C upon his side on his garment; and an A under his wast behind: The Letters seem to go up and down enterchangeably in places. There seemeth an V on him, also an N, a D.</p>
                  <p>Now cometh a tall man by, all in white, and a great white thing rowled about his neck, and coming down before like a tippet. They all in the Stone (being 9) kneel down unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The tall man said</hi> ...... Take this Key, and power: ascend and fill thy vessel, for the <hi>River</hi> is not pure, and made clean.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he is gone (that said this) in form of a great Millstone of fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now they go up a Hill, with a great Tankard, as it <note place="margin">An Hill.</note> were, of Bone transparent; Now he openeth one door, he, I mean, that had the Letters on his back.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There appeareth a Partridge, but it hath one leg like a Kite: This Partridge seemeth to sit on a green place under the gate, one leg is much longer than the other, being like a Kites leg. This Partridge seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to halt.</p>
                  <p>He biddeth one of his Company take it up. There goeth a bridge to the top of that Hill, all upon arches, and under it goeth a River.</p>
                  <p>He taketh the Partridge and pulleth all his feathers, and they fall into the River: He cutteth off the longer leg just to the length of the other. They about him cry, O just judgement.</p>
                  <p>Now he turneth him off over the Bridge, and he flyeth away, for the feathers of his wings were not pulled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He goeth on, and cometh to another gate; and there the third man unlocketh it, as the second next him unlocked the first Gate; he himself having the Key first delivered him, as above is noted. There appeareth a thing like a Kite, all white, very great, it hath a fowl great head, he seemeth to be in a very pleasant Garden, and flyeth from place to place of it, and beateth down the Rose trees and other fruit trees. The Garden seemeth very delicate and pleasant. They go all into the Garden: and he saith, Thou art of the Wildernesse, thy feathers and carkase are not worthy the spoil of the Garden.</p>
                  <p>Now the Kite scratcheth and gaspeth at this man; but he taketh the Kite and cutteth her carkase in two equal parts, from the crown of his head, and throweth one half over one side of the Bridge, and the other half over the other side, and said, Fowles must be devoured of Fowles. The rest say, <hi>O justitia divina,</hi> clapping their hands over their heads.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:49588:98"/>
3. Now the next in order openeth another Gate (going up upon the same Bridge still.) The rest of the building from the Gate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, seemeth very round and bright: yet there appear no windows in it. It is a frame, made as though the 7 Planets moved in it. The Moon seemeth to be New Moon.</p>
                  <p>There standeth Armour, and this man putteth on, all white Harnesse. He seemeth to kick down the Moon, and her frame or Orb; and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to make powder of all; For <hi>there is no mercy here, saith he.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now another of them goeth forward to another Gate, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Gate, and goeth in; there appear an infinite multitude of men.</p>
                  <p>There sitteth a man cloathed like a Priest, having a great Crown on his head: here are many preaching in this place. He goeth to that Crowned Priest, and he taketh away divers patches of the Vesture which he had, and the patches seemed to be like Owls, and Apes, and such like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He saith</hi> ...... A King is a King, and a Priest is a Priest.</p>
                  <p>He taketh from the rest their Keyes and Purses, and giveth them <hi>a Staff and a Bottle</hi> in their hands. He goeth from them. He putteth all that he took from them in a house beside the Gate, and writeth on <note place="margin">He wrote <hi>Cognoscat.</hi>
                     </note> the door, <hi>Cognoscat quisque suum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now they proceed to another Gate, and another of them opened that Gate. The Bridge continueth still, ascending upward. Now there appeareth (that Gate being opened) a marvellous great Wildernesse.</p>
                  <p>There cometh a great number <hi>of naked wilde men to him.</hi> He sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that Gate with his hands, and it falleth in pieces, one falleth on one side into the River, and the other falls on the other side into the River,</p>
                  <p>........ Let both these places be made one. Let the spoil of the first, be the comfort of the last: For from them that have shall be taken, and unto them that have not shall be given.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he goeth, and the last of his Company openeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Gate; he is longer in opening of that Gate, than any of the rest.</p>
                  <p>There appeareth a bushy place, and there runneth a great River on the very top of the Hill, and a great Gate standeth beyond the Hill, and a very rich Tower all of precious Stones, as it seemeth.</p>
                  <p>Here he filleth his Tankard in the River, and holdeth his hands up, and maketh shew as he would return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He said</hi> ...... This was my coming, and should be my return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now they appear suddenly before the first Gate, and there the <hi>Principal man diggeth</hi> the earth, and putteth stones and brambles, and leaves aside. There he taketh out a dead carkase, and bringeth it to a fire, and stroketh it: a very lean carkase it is; it seemeth to be a dead Lion; for it hath a long tail with a bush at the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He saith</hi> ...... Come let us take him up, and comfort him; for it is in him.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lion seemeth to sit up and lick himself, and to drink of the water, and to shake himself, and to roar. The man taketh of the segs
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49588:99"/>
or flags by, and stroketh the Lion as he would make his hair smooth.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lion is become fair, fat, and beautiful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He saith</hi> ...... Tarry you here, till I bring you word again; for I must follow the Lion into the Wildernesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now all they are gone, except the two our <hi>School-masters, Gabriel and Nalvage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ...... This is the Judgement <hi>of God this day.</hi> Happy is he that hath judgement to understand it.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Thou O Lord knowest the measure of our judgement: Give therefore light, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and the grace to use thy gifts duely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ....... Listen unto my words, for they are a Commandment from above. Behold (saith he) I have descended to view the Earth, where I will dwell for seven dayes, and twice seven dayes: Therefore let them be dayes of rest to you. But every seventh day, I will visit you, as Now I do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> He speaketh as if he spake out of a Trunck.</p>
                  <p>Œî. I understand that this rest is, that every <hi>Monday,</hi> for three <hi>Mondayes</hi> else next after other, we shall await for our lessons, as now we receive, <hi>and that we may all the rest follow our affairs of study or houshold matters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> ...... It is so, <hi>for one day shall be as a week:</hi> But those dayes you must abstain from all things that live upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Œî. You mean on these three <hi>Mondayes,</hi> ensueing next.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ...... You shall cover this Table with a new linnen cloth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Pointing to the Table we sat at.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Most willingly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ...... Moreover a new Candlesticke, with a Taper burning.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Obediently (O Lord) it shall be done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ...... And the Candlesticke shall be set on the midst of the Table betwixt you two.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note</hi> ...... That a day may become a week, and a week as many years.</p>
                  <p>

                     </gap> the same Stone. In effect, all things as we had before us, after half a quarter of an hour, that shew of our furniture, and our selves, disappeared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K. Gabriel</hi> standeth up, and speaketh as followeth.</p>
                  <p>....... A mighty City was built on the top of a mountain, in the which dwelt many thousands. Round about the Hill, ran a fresh River, which was the onely comfort of the Town: for, of it they drank, their wives, their children, their man-servants, their maid-servants, their camels, horses, mules, and all the beasts of their fields. The beginning of which River was a Spring, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the City, by reason of the.. yth from whence it descended. It came to passe, that a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent groaned for her time, and lo, she brought forth: and ... were such as her self: and she lifted up her head and leaned upon her twice writhen taile: and beheld the Sun stedfastly, (for her envy was toward that City) and she said within her self: My children are yet young, the time grew, and they became big: and she went unto the Spring, and smiled and said with a laughing voice, The Earth is fallen into thee, thou art choked: but hearken unto my voice, Thou shalt receive comfort: But she would not. And she lifted up her voice and roared; for she was full of craft and deceit. And she said unto the shingles, through the which the Spring runs (or rather syeth) Thou art full of emptinesse, and void places. Let my children (therefore) hide themselves within thee for a season: and they were contented; And she departed willingly, and saith within her self: Now I know I shall be Lady of the City.</p>
                  <p>And after a few years, the young Serpents became great; so that the one half of their bodies dwelt within the Shingles, the rest troubled the passage of the Spring: So that the Spring groaned; for, the injury that was done against her, was great.</p>
                  <p>A great misery, for the Hill is become desolate without the water, and the City and the beasts perish for want of drink; for the people groan, and are ful of sorrow.</p>
                  <p>This City and Serpents are <hi>60..</hi> now, and judgement must be had, betwixt the Shingles and the Spring. for between lieth the life and death of the City.</p>
                  <p>Thus saith the Lord unto thee [<hi>pointing to</hi> E. K.] Gird up thy self, and fit down, Consider both parts, and give judgement: for thy mouth shall this day be the judgement of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Do you mean me?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>√ã. K.</hi> As the Lord hath put the Authority of Judgement into my hands, so I beseech him to give me wisdom and understanding to judge right. And because the judgement hereof is committed to me, I sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect some other mystery to lie hidden in this my judgement required: But if it shall please God that my friend here, Master <hi>Dee</hi> shall give me his advise, I shall think my self well satisfied.</p>
                  <p>....... Consider with your self (saith the Lord) and give judgement against the Shingles, for the fault is plain. Consider two points, the necessity of the Spring, that it must come that wayes: and secondly, the health of the City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> My judgement is that the Shingles and Serpent should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved away by an Earthquake from the place which they encumber and let, that there may be a fit new place, and course for that Spring, to the relief of that City as before it was.</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:49588:100"/>
                  <p>...... Be it so as thou hast said, for it is a just judgement.</p>
                  <p>Now hearken, what the Lord saith. The people and City of the Hill, is the world, which are from time to time by the mercy and spring of Gods wisdom, relieved.. quenched: according to the extremity and necessity of their thirsting: But the people and City are such as are of the Temple and Church of God, which drink of his mercy to their comfort. The Camels and other beasts are the people of the Earth, which delight in sin, and in their own imagination, which also are relieved with those that are of the City: but the diversities of their bodies, doth cause the diversity of the ends of their comfort. The Hill wherein the Spring is, signifieth <hi>his Prophets, and such as are drunken in the Lord:</hi> Thr<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ugh whom, inwardly the mercies and will of God and of the Highest are open from time to time, according to the <hi>secret will and determination</hi> of such as are within the City of his Elect. But the frailties and affections of their flesh and outward man, are their fond imaginations and loose Shingles wherein the Serpent, the old Devil, hath harboured her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the spirits of darknesse and deceit, which alwayes resist the Will of God, and are put between the mercies of God and his people. <hi>Moses, Daniel, Esdras,</hi> all the rest of the Prophets: Christ his twelve, <hi>Paul</hi> the Messenger of God, they did all hurt the Congregation of the Faithful in their flesh, <hi>until</hi> they gave sentence against themselves (as thou hast done) with amendment of life: for who is worthy to know the secrets of our God, but he that delighteth in righteousnesse, is obedient, full of faith, and the spirit of understanding? Be it therefore unto thee as thou hast said. Let the Shingles and Serpents be separated, that the Fountain may feed as before. All the trash that thou hast of the wicked, burn it.</p>
                  <p>E. K. I do not know, they are wicked.</p>
                  <p>...... Their doings with thee, are the hindrance of the Will of God, and therefore they are wicked.</p>
                  <p>...... Thou hast given judgement against thy self: Take heed thou offend not thy own soul.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Send down thy Spirit O Lord, and illuminate <hi>E. K.</hi> his heart with perceiving of his wrong opinion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> If <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were skilful in the Arts of the Egyptian Magicians, and were not thereby hindred for being the servants of God, Why may not I deal with these, without hindrance to the Will of God?</p>
                  <p>...... Darknesse yeilded unto light: the Greater excluded the lesser. The more a man knoweth wickednesse, the more he shall hate it, being called back. The more they knew the shadow, so much more they delighted in the body: For the doings of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> seem, and are not so. The doings of the Lord are, and continue; for as the Painter imitateth the gestures of man in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, so doth the Devil the substances and things created and made by God.</p>
                  <p>Stand up and look into the whole World, into her youth, and middle age, for they are past. Where are the monuments that Satan hath builded?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Hath Satan builded any monuments?</p>
                  <p>...... Yes: Hath he not builded him a Fort upon the whole Earth? Hath he not the victory over the Saints? Dwelleth he not in the Temple of the Highest? Triumpheth he not in the Cities of the whole World?</p>
                  <p>Yes. ...... But without comfort, are his victories: without pleasure his dwelling places. For he knoweth his time is at hand. He that now giveth freedom, shall become bound; And unto whom the whole World is as a Garden, shall there be no one foot left. Therefore are all his pleasures va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: all his Triumphs smoak, and his Authority, nothing indeed, but a meer shadow: For that that is not, cannot be; where, it is said of the Lord, it shall not be. <hi>Neither can truth, light, or wisdom, ascend from the Earth, but descend from the Heavens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Compare the Earth, (into the which the Devil is thrust as into his dwelling) with the Heavens, which are provided for the holy. Consider the pain of the one, and the pleasure of the other: The seat of Gods Justice, and Fountain of his Mercy: The Cave of Darknesse, and the Diadem of Light. And then cry, wo, wo, wo, unto such as erre, and whose lives are but shadows: For their felicity is such, as from whence it came; and their reward is all one, with the spirit and prince of Darknesse.</p>
                  <p>Compare fond knowledge, with true wisdom, <hi>Thy spirits of lying with us, that are the voice of truth:</hi> The vanity that they <hi>lead thee</hi> into, and the reward of our message: And say within thy self, <hi>peccavi.</hi> Wilt thou be perswaded by experience? Consider thy imprisonments, thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction <note place="margin">His life .. ned.</note> and shame of body. Consider the love of a few, and envy of a multitude. Weigh with thy self the vanity of thy life; Thy rash foot-steps, All that happned unto thee, by the society, and (as thou thinkest) comfort; but indeed the stinging pricks of thy enemies</p>
                  <p>...... Since, <hi>we came</hi> into thee, (sent from the Lord, and calling thee, to God) thou hast be<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

All which things thou hast by us in blessednesse, and in the knowledge of the <hi>will of God, above all men.</hi> Besides our continual presence with thee, to the comfort of thy Soul.

                  <p>But, this sayeth the Lord. I deal with you as a Childe: But the vessels that I must use, must be <note place="margin">Pure vessels.</note> pure and clean.</p>

                  <p>Consider with thy self: for the Lord speaketh not once more, <hi>till thou</hi> hast fulfilled thy own judgement.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Because thou art content to bury them; and withall, upon faith in the promises of God, <hi>to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure</hi> them in simplicity of heart, and external use .... simply, as a true meaning before the face of the highest: The Lord accepteth it, and it shall be sufficient.</p>
                  <p>Further, thou hast <hi>27.</hi> Confirmations of sin, <hi>and consent with the Devil,</hi> which your intention calleth <hi>Characters,</hi> whereby those seven and twenty, (like unto their mother) are become fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <note place="margin">Characters.</note> and pleasant with thee, <hi>they must</hi> be brought before the Lord: and offered into his hands. <hi>For so long as they are, the wicked alwayes vex thee: For the Obligation burnt, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is void.</hi> These must be buried with the rest.</p>

                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now is the Curtain pull'd away: and quickly pull'd again. Now it is open again. He is apparelled, of colour between a blew, and a red mingled; but blew seemeth to be the ground. From the shoulder on the arms, is a trunk of seven pendant labels, with laces. On his head a very broad Hat, between dun and black colour. His apparel is very long.</p>

I asked him the reason why: He would give none: But earnestly denied to proceed. I told him that his words <note n="*" place="margin">Those words he spake after the Action ended more than an hour in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber before my Study of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</note> yesternight (that he could not this day deale) did very much grieve me, &amp;c. whereof he made small account. So I went into my Study again, and committed the Cause to God.</p>
                  <p>After half an hour and lesse, he came speedily out of his Study, and brought in his hand one Volume of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> his works, and in one Chapter of that Book he read the names of Countries and Provinces collected out of <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> (as the Author there noteth) Whereupon he inferred, that our spiritual Instructors <hi>were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>This (<hi>quoth I</hi>) is to grosse your error, and to wilful your wrangling: But I do in nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower points peruse and consider their words and doings; In which though sometimes my writings (after your declaration) hath been amended by them, yet the occasion of miswrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the most part, hath been either in your misreporting what you saw and heard, or in my wrong hearing, or writing: and sometime by the spiritual present correcting of my writing, and sometime longer after, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But for all this, <hi>E. K.</hi> remained of his wilful intent; and so departed to his Study again: And I committed God his Cause, into his own hands, care and ordering, as may be best for his honour and glory. So be it.</p>

But I see, <hi>I must differre my self for a time,</hi> and <hi>must raise up a Table</hi> where there shall eat more worthy. Consider what it is to deal with Devils: Is it not to take part with Rebels? Is it not to be Traitors against the annointed in his own Kingdom? Is it not a greater sin then the sin of the Devil? For why, The Devil sinneth in himself, and therefore had his fall. But your sin is in your selves and by the Devil, and therefore it is the greater. But, as it is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Where is there a moniment upon the earth that the people have raised up, in the remembrance of wickednesse? Many there be that say, Lo, there is <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> Lo, there was the Lord buried. Lo, there the flouds divided themselves with all the rest; in remembrance of the Lord: But none there is that say, Lo, in this place the wicked have risen up and prevailed. Therefore to cleave unto the Lord is good, and to follow a sensible Doctrine, which bringeth with it self the loathsomnesse of wickednesse, and the study to do well, that the wicked may be confounded. Alas! let the whole earth rise up, [thrusting up his hand] even this hand, can gather them all together: what therefore can the Lord do when he frowneth? O unreasonable Creatures, and worse then beasts, more ignorant then the beasts that grase in the Mountains: Are you not afraid of the power of God, when it becometh a skourge? For, doubt you not, to deal with those that are wicked? (you of no faith) wherefore hath the Lord made the earth, but to be glorified in the creatures thereof? And what is he that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth God on earth but man? Think you [not] (therefore) that the Lord bath not care of his people? Think you that there is a Seat upon earth, wherein he hath not hidden the might of his free power? Doth Satan get a Soul that he is not privy of? Believe, O you of little <hi>Faith, for it is</hi>

                  <p>..... They would not suffer him to pray to Jesus Christ; but would rebuke him, saying, that he robbed God of his honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>And so. of very many other most blasphemous Articles and Points of Doctrine, whereof more shall be spoken in another place.</p>
                  <p>This forbearings of our Instructors presence, I did expound or conjecture to be done great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the honour of God, many wayes, if the same were recorded somewhat near to the very manner of the thing as it was: for so, should appear to the posterity, how truely it had been said before, that he should be converted to God: How truely God did prepare <hi>E.

                  </p>
                  <p>whereby the life of <hi>E. K.</hi> (now being amended, and his dealing with the wicked clean left off) should not be a scandal to the will of the Lord, and to the greatness of his works: as was noted unto us in the last Action.</p>
                  <p>Also I said, that not onely his Conversion recorded should be a more evident argument of his so oft repeated Election: But his <hi>patient attending</hi> this present day, ([Œî] two hours and <note place="margin">Œî We lest off <hi>

diverse times before, but a very harty and sincere conversion, such as without all doubt, will be found very acceptable to the highest.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, he declared that about nine, or ten dayes past, he did intend to have gotten away <hi>secretly by the help spiritual</hi> of those, with whom he had so long dealt: And therefore that <hi>till now, he dealt hypocritically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, whereas they to fore were ever accustomed to threaten him Beggery, (a thing which he most hated and feared.)</p>
                  <p>That now he careth not if he should have want; yea, he took it neither to be shame, or sin to beg: and that he now made more account of God his favour and life eternal, then he doth of all transitory wealth and riches, and to be entangled within the danger of these wicked spirits their snares, with all.</p>
                  <p>Also he now perceived his great errour wherein he was of late, when he would for an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured temporal maintenance have forsaken the dealing with the wicked, and so more willingly would have followed these actions without repining: Saying now, that he is no perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, who for money must be hired to forsake the Devil and his works, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And as for the issue of these actions <hi>he would never either doubt, or mislike, howsoever they fell out;</hi> assuring himself: That God would do all things best, and for his honour, &amp;c. Many other his sayings very glodly I omit, thinking these sufficient here.</p>

                  <p>Œî. After our prayers due, and thanks to the Almighty for his great mercies and power shewed in the conversion of <hi>E.

K.</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self said these sentences worthy to be recorded, as the evident token of his sound and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full turning, and intent to cleave unto the Lord.</p>

                  <p>Œî. It is first to be noted, that this morning (early) to <hi>E. K.</hi> lying in his bed, and awake, appeared a Vision, in manner as followeth: One standing by h s beds head, who patted him on the head gently, to make him the more vigilant. He seemed to be cloathed with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, strangely wreathed about him all over, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There appeared to him [<hi>E. K.</hi>] four very fair Castles, standing in the four parts of the world: out of which he heard the sound of a Trumpet. Then seemed out of every Castle a cloath to be thrown on the ground, of more then the breadth of a Table-cloath.</p>
                  <p>Out of that in the East, the cloath seemed to be red, which was cast.</p>
                  <p>Out of that in the South, the cloath seemed white.</p>
                  <p>Out of that in the West, the cloath seemed green, with great knops on it.</p>
                  <p>Out of that in the North, spread, or thrown out from the gate under foot, the cloath seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be very black.</p>
                  <p>Out of every Gate then issued one Trumpeter, whose Trumpets were of strange form, wreathed, and growing bigger and bigger toward the end.</p>
                  <p>After the Trumpeter followed three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>After them six ancient men, with white beards and staves in their hands.</p>
                  <p>Then followed a comely man, with very much Apparel on his back, his Robe having a long train.</p>
                  <p>After him came five men, carrying up of his train.</p>
                  <p>Then followed one great Crosse, and about that four lesser Crosses. <note place="margin">These Crosses seemed not to be on the ground, but in the aire in a white Cloud. The great Crosse seemed to be of a Cloud, like the Rain-bow.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Crosses had on them, each of them ten, like men, their faces distinctly appearing on the four parts of the Crosse, all over.</p>
                  <p>After the Crosses followed 16 white Creatures.</p>
                  <p>And after them, an infinite number seemed to issue, and to spread themselves orderly in a compasse, almost before the four foresaid Castles.</p>
                  <p>Upon which Vision declared unto me, I straight way set down a Note of it; trusting in God that it did signific good.</p>
                  <p>After noon, as <hi>E. K.</hi> sat by me, he felt on his head some strange moving: whereby he deemed that some spiritual Creature did visit him; and as we were continuing together, and I had red to <hi>E. K.</hi> some rare matter out of <hi>Ignatius</hi> Epistles, <hi>Policarpus,</hi> and <hi>Martialis;</hi> some of the Sacrament, and some of the Crosse, a voyce answered, and said, <hi>That it is true, that the sign of the Crosse is of great force and vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, the spiritual Creature seemed to <hi>E. K.</hi> to be very heavy on his right shoulder, as he sat by me in my study: And as <hi>E. K.</hi> considered the numbers of such as he had num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to passe out of the four Gates, (it is to wit, 1.3.6.1.5.) The spiritual Creature said, the number 16. is a perfect number, consisting of 1.3 6.1. and 5. He said further more, God the father is a standing Pillar.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Upon which word I asked him, if I should write such matter as he was to speak. And he answered to <hi>E. K.</hi> at his right ear.</p>

                  <p>On Friday, and especially Saturday, <hi>E.

                  <p>A voice said, likewise, to him, that <hi>A. L.</hi> should not go to the Emperours Court, for lack of money: for he should get none here. Likewise, it willed him to go up into his Study and he would shew him all the effect of our Instructions received. <hi>E. K.</hi> complained to me how he was thus greivously molested by such means, and almost brought in despair. But I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him as well as I could (my self being inwardly, most sorrowful) and made my moane to God by prayer when I was alone: for him, and our Cause. Moreover he could not be perswaded by me that <hi>good Angels would undertake</hi> to help us to any <hi>relief by money</hi> or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: affirming that it appertained to the wicked ones: seeing they were the Lords of this World; and the kingdom of God was not of this World, &amp;c. ....

                  <p>Then <hi>A.

                  <p>Over these higher in the aire, appear an infinite sort of small, little, blackish things, bigger then Motes in the Sun, and they go up and down, and sometime come among those <hi>worm-like</hi> Creatures.</p>

                  <p>And he sayed unto the Lord, Let there be remembrance of thy mercy, and let those that love thee taste
of this after me: O let not thy mercy be forgotten. And the Lord was pleased.</p>
                  <p>And after <hi>50.</hi> dayes <hi>Enoch</hi> had written: and this was the Title of his books, let those that fear <note place="margin">50. Dayes.</note> God, and are worthy read.</p>

And the Lord was vexed, and he sent in amongst them an hundred and <hi>fifty Lions, and spirits of wickednesse,</hi> errour, and deceit: and they appeared unto them: For the Lord had put them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those that are wicked, and his good Angels: And they began <hi>to counterfeit the doings of God and his power,</hi>

                  <p>Hereby they speak with the Devils: not because they have power over the Devils, but because they <note place="margin">Wicked Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians.</note> are joyned unto them in the league and Discipline of their own Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>For behold, as the knowledge of the mystical figures, and the use of their presence is the gift of God delivered to <hi>Enoch,</hi> and by <hi>Enoch</hi> his request to the faithfull, that thereby they might <hi>have the true use of Gods creatures, &amp; of the earth whereon</hi> they dwell: So hath the Devil delivered unto the wicked the signs, and tokens of his error and hatred towards God: <hi>whereby they in using them, might consent with their fall:</hi> and so become partakers with them of their reward, which is eternal damnation.</p>

                  <p>..... For above every crosse, standeth <hi>4</hi> letters: Not that <hi>Pilat</hi> knew it, but that it was the fore-determination of God.</p>
                  <p>They are thus to be read. In the upper left angle thou hast <hi>r z l a: pronounce, urzla:</hi> by <note place="margin">Œî. Another pronouncing of it.

                  </p>
                  <p>Œî. So that the third beginneth at <hi>l,</hi> whose last letter is the first of the second name, and is called <hi>Larz,</hi> and so of the last: as <hi>a r z l,</hi> to be pronounced <hi>arzel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Œî. So that you have, of those 4 letters, 4 Angels names, here thus gathered out: but how are they to be used? <note place="margin">The use.</note>

                  <p>..... Let it be sufficient that you know these names. I will teach you to use them.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Shall we labour by like order of every the 4 letters over the crosses to make 4 such <note place="margin">4 Angels over every crosse.</note> names?</p>
                  <p>..... They are also to be made.</p>

And thus she doth till they be <hi>12</hi> or <hi>13</hi> dayes old: Then she leadeth them a stones-cast, and exerciseth them both with fear, and hiding themselves; And when they sleep (being young and wearied with labour) she stealeth from them and maketh a noise amongst the leaves and small stones, with the moving of her hinder parts:</p>

                  <p>To the intent she might see what shift her wormes can make, which stirred up with fear, and missing their mother, so learn to couch themselves in the Chymnes of the earth; At length, after silence, the mother thrusteth out her self, and doubleth her tongue (with the sound whereof she useth to call them) They come together and rejoyce, wreathing themselves diversly about her body, for joy: She for a recompence, suffereth them to hang upon her back, and so waltereth to her hole; where she ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth the leaves of the earth: and after she hath chewed them small and tender, with her teeth, and mingled them with the dust, she spueth them out again, and beginneth to lick them by little and little, as though she hungered, which she subtlely doth, that her wormes might eat and forget their hungrynesse.</p>

When the Earth lieth opened unto your eyes, and when the Angels of Light, shall offer the passages of the Earth, unto the entrance of your senses, (chiefly of seeing) Then shall you see the Treasures of <hi>the Earth, as you go:</hi> And the caves of the Hills shall not be unknown unto you: <note place="margin">The Treasures of the Earth.

                  </p>
                  <p>If the Smith prove and temper his Gold by fire, his intent is to excell in the work that he hath in hand: that thereby it might be tryed, refined, and made apt, to the end wherein it shall be used: Much more, think you, doth the God of wisdom, forge, try, and beat out, such as he intendeth to use in the execution of his divine and eternal purposes. How therefore can you find fault with the Lord? How can you say, he dealeth not justly with you? when he suffereth you to be proved to the uttermost. If you pay the uttermost farthing, are you not become free? If you feel affliction and temptation, and withstand it, are you not the more pure? the more justified? for the Vineyard and Harvest of the Lord? O yes, my Brethren; for the more the wise man is afflicted, the more he rejoyceth; And the greater his adversity is, the more he prostereth.</p>
                  <p>Is it not written? No man cometh to the Lord but he is justified, purified, and accepted. Whence therefore (if you seek to come before the Lord, that is to say, to appear, to be blessed) shall your justification or purifying arise? Of your own nature it cannot; for you were born sinners: But by Christ you may: In whom you are justified, through patience, and resisting temptations. True proof, and touch of man: But me thinketh I hear you say, <hi>O, if we were rich,</hi> or of ability. True it is, for the dust of the earth many men excel you: But in that you <hi>speak with God, in us</hi>

                  <p>O my Brethren, their joy is a bitter-sweet: But the comfort that you have, is eternal, is sweet, and a food for ever. Therefore, if you will be eternal, and in perpetual comfort with joy, despise the world for the worlds sake: and delight in God for his mercies; which if you truly do, Then can no Tempest prevail, no affliction come amisse, nor no burden be too heavy for you: For it is written, <hi>Gaudium beatorum est Christus: Cui Mundus omnia mala fecit.</hi>

                  <p>Œî. As <hi>E. K.</hi> was saying to me, that he thought that the Angels might tell the certain day and times of things to come, and that Angels could now fall no more, &amp;c. Of such things touching Angels; suddenly a voice was heard, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A voice.</hi> ..... Herein will I talk with you, my brethren.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E.</hi> K. <hi>Gabriel</hi> onely appeareth: neither <hi>Nalvage</hi> nor the Table appeareth. He sitteth in a Chair, and with his fiery Dart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gabr.</hi> ..... The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> inspired with the Holy Ghost, were assured of the coming of their Messias, of their Christ: But what day, or in what year was not of mans understanding. Christ himself opened unto his Disciples his death, and the manner thereof; but the day and hour he never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49588:141"/>
So likewise the Scriptures speak of <hi>the coming of Christ,</hi> but the day and hour, the Son of <note place="margin">De secundo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventu Christi.</note> man knoweth not. But because in time to come, and for this action, (the message of the highest) And assured, and infallible Doctrine, (in respect that God appointed you no certain time) is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. For, for this cause you waver my brethren: and may lose the benefit of God his favour, and mercies. O weaklings examine the Prophets, look into the doing of the Apostles. There alwayes went a promise before the end: But the end was the benefit and fruit of the promise. Some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge <hi>Paul,</hi> some <hi>Peter,</hi> some <hi>Daniel:</hi> But in this case shall you alleadge <hi>the sayings of God,</hi> spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>in the spirit of truth by me</hi> Gabriel, the servant of the highest. God, for three causes hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the end, and the very time of his heavenly purposes. As after a little silence you shall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> A cloud covereth him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he appeareth again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ..... First, by reason of his own inexplicable <hi>Est &amp; non est esse,</hi> which is without the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, strength, capable vertue, and power of man, his intellectuality, whereby he appeareth to be verily one God, and incomprehensible.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because <hi>Lucifer</hi> with his <hi>yea sayers,</hi> (damned justly) should never taste of his light, nor understand his secret judgements: which he would, and might do, if they were delivered to mans imagination, and discourse: Because it is within the circumference and compasse of his Creation. Consider of these two.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he is covered in a white Cloud again.</p>
                  <p>Œî. The first reason, or cause we do not sufficiently understand, or conceive.</p>
                  <p>Deus est esse, <hi>Sanctis Deus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Non est esse, <hi>Impiis Deus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, In <hi>the judgement</hi> day, God in his son, Christ, shall shut up his perpetual and everlasting Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, wrath, and anger, with Hell and damnation. Leaving them, and forsaking them, and in no case to be called their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Thirdly, that man firmly perswaded of things spoken of by God above his capacity to come, and unknown, might worthily in the strength of faith, and through the effect of his promises merit his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in Christ, and receive eternal salvation, justly before God and his Angels. These are the three causes.</p>
                  <p>Œî. This last cause, if it would please you to make more plain, it should greatly enform us and confirm us.</p>
                  <p>..... These are the three onely causes, that the ends of God his determinations are secret.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> In the first, that God might appear omnipotent.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> In the second, sealed up in himself from the knowledge of such as have rebelled to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> In the third, that man might justly be made worthy of the places prepared for him.</p>
                  <p>Nalvage <hi>is called away, and cannot be in Action with you till</hi> Wednesday. Then shall you <note place="margin">Wednesday following.</note> have the Calls that you look for. And so enter into the knowledge and perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>of the</hi> 49 <hi>Gates and Tables if you will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Œî. O Lord, thy will and mercy be shewed upon us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ..... But understand that it is a labour, the hardest and the last.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Violenti nihil difficile: God strengthen our will and faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gab.</hi> ..... I have nothing else to say unto you. But God be mercifull unto you, and forgive you your sins.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Amen.</p>

                  <p>Œî. Is it true, that before the Creation of man this kinde of Malediction was pronounced, or when else shall we understand it to have been spoken?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A voyce.</hi> ..... True it is that one man weedeth out another. To avoid which fault it is said, and after God the brother as thy self.</p>
                  <p>One Kingdom riset<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>h up against another, the servant against his Master, the wicked son disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his father. All which fell upon man when God cursed the earth: For, perfect love was taken from amongst them, and the spirit of malice came amongst them, to the intent they might be alwayes at variance, and one weed out another, and so must be, and shall be unto the end. Answer me, why turned God <hi>Adam</hi> out into the earth.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Because he had transgressed the Laws to be kept in Paradise.</p>
                  <p>..... It is true. Then <hi>Adam</hi> offending, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

God (my brother) know he would offend: he knew also how to dishonour him. <note place="margin">Note. In the same instant. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>As Jesus Christ brought all blessednesse, and comfort into the world: So did <hi>Adam,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed, bring all misery and wretchednesse into the world, and in <hi>the same</hi> instant, when <hi>Adam</hi> was expelled; The Lord suffered the earth to be accursed for <hi>Adams</hi> sake, and <hi>then, said the Lord these things, and gave unto the world her time: and placed over her</hi> Keepers, Watch-men, and Princes, for years, moneths, and dayes: [I am easie, you may understand my rule.]</p>
                  <p>Œî. Note, All this was answered by a voyce, as concerning my question, or doubt hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expressed.</p>
                  <p>..... After this, a great pause was used: In which time in my minde, I discoursed of the Ministery Angelical, not all to have been committed to their charge with their Creation, but afterward in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, divers offices, both toward God and man.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> There appeared ten Pikes, all black on the ground in a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as it were, and 1 in the middle, a great Pike, standing up.

                  <p>Œî.

I craved therefore the expofition of this dark shew, and as yet nothing pleasant, or plain: My conscience is clear, and I trust in the Lord his mercies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> After this appeared a man all black, naked all over.</p>

                     <hi>Emperour:</hi> It was also said that he should make provision for this one voyage, and for the rest God had provided. So that seeing I was to go with him, and he hath not yet provided (doing what he can) what shall I say, or do?</p>
                  <p>..... True it is, thou hast had the victory, and thou, and thy Children have tasted mercy. Thou art one of those, that when I command thee to leave nothing with life, yet thou savest the fatlings to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer before him that abhorreth such sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Lord, I know no such act of mine: The Lord be mercifull to me. For when it should come to such a case, God knoweth, I would spare none.</p>
                  <p>..... O thou just man [shaking his head] thou art become a <hi>Saul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>..... Wherefore did God (answer me) take the Kingdom out of <hi>Saul</hi> his hands?</p>
                  <p>Œî. It appeareth in the Bible, because obedience was better then sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>..... Even so, if thou badst been obedient, thy obedience had been regarded. But I say unto <note place="margin">Reg. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>15.</hi>

                  <p>As for <hi>Lasky,</hi> I will <hi>give him over to the spirit</hi> of errour: and he shall become more poor, so <note place="margin">A. L. His plague threatned.</note> that his own Children shall despise him.</p>

                  <p>But true it is, That, Obedience pleaseth the Lord for thererin, his Creatures glorifie him most. <note place="margin">Obedience.</note> All Worship, all Honour, all Love, all Faith, all Hope, all Charity, all the knitting together of the Heavens consisteth in <hi>Obedience.</hi> For if you had been obedient, the very stones <hi>of the earth should have served your necessity.</hi> For the Lord will not be found a lyar.</p>
                  <p>Œî. O Lord, be mercifull to me: I could not do thy Commandment in going without <hi>A. Laskie,</hi> and him I was not able to cause to goe without provision: And to our judgement he seemeth marvellously to be carefull to make provision: but still he hath hinderance.</p>
                  <p>..... Thou (hearest thou?) the Lord forgiveth thee: but from henceforth, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dee,</hi> Is pardoned. No more secrets of God to be opened to <hi>A. L.</hi>

                  <p>Notwithstanding, in the midst of my fury I will be mercifull unto you, when you think I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken you, then shall the Rod break in pieces.</p>

                  <p>Œî. Lord make that plain unto us?</p>
                  <p>Thus sayeth the Lord, if you tarry, <hi>it is</hi> because I am, which am strength, and triumph against mine enemies, and so against the enemies of those that put their trust in me: And <hi>shall be,</hi> because I am just, and because it is.</p>

                  <p>Œî. We thanked God for his safe bringing us hither, to the place appointed by him: We desired him to direct us, as the rest of our Action requireth: And thirdly, for the Book with silver leaves, to be prepared, we required instruction, as we were promised.</p>
                  <p>Anon after <hi>E. K.</hi> his looking into the Shew-stone, he said, I see a Garland of white Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buds about the border of the Stone: They be well opened, but not full out.</p>
                  <p>Œî. The great mercies of God be upon us: and we beseech him to increase our faith in him, according to his well liking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> But while I consider these buds better, they seem rather to be white Lillies.</p>
                  <p>Œî. The eternal God of his infinite mercies, wipe away our blacknesse and sins, and make us pure, and whiter than Snow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E.</hi> K. They are 72 in number: seeming with their heads (<hi>alternatim</hi>) <note place="margin">Œî. 72 Angels.</note> one to bend or hang toward me, and another toward you. They seem also to move circularly toward the East: but very slowly. In the middest of this Circle, appeareth a little fire, of the colour of yern, hot; ready to melt: from which fire to every one of the said lillies, is a fiery beam extended; which beam toward the end, is, of more whitish fiery colour, than it is near the center.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A voice. -... E. K.</hi> A voice cometh shouting out from the Lillies, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy: and all the lillies are become on fire; and seem to tumble into that fire. And now they appear again distinctly, as before: And the fire remained in the center still: and the emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beams, came from it, still to the foresaid lilly buds.</p>
                  <p>E. K. I hear a sound, as though it were of many waters, poured or streaming down in the clifts of great Rocks and Mountains: The noise is marvellous great, which I hear coming through the Stone: as it were of a thousand water-mills going together.</p>
                  <p>A voice. ..... <hi>Est.</hi>

                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now I see beyond like a Furnace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, as big as 4 or 5 Gates of a City. It seemeth to be a quarter of a mile off: out of the Furnace-mouth seemeth a marvellous smoke or smother to come. By it seemeth to be a great Lake of pitch: and it playeth or simpreth, as water doth, when it beginneth to seethe. There standeth by the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49588:149"/>
pit, a white man, in a white garment tucked up: his face is marvellous fair; he saith very loud.</p>
                  <p>A white spiritual Creature. ..... <hi>Ascend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now there cometh out of the Lake, a thing like a Lion in the hinder parts, and his fore part hath many heads, of divers fashions: and all upon one trunk of a neck. He hath like feathers on his neek. He hath 7 heads: Three on one side, and three on another, and one in the middle: which branch from the neck is longer than the other, and lieth backward to his taile-ward. The white man giveth him a bloody Sword: and he taketh it in his forefoot.</p>
                  <p>The white man tyeth this Monster his 4 legs with a chain, that he cannot go, but as one shackled, or fettred. Now he giveth the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster a great hammer, with a seal at that end where the hammer striketh, and the other is fashioned like a hatchet.</p>
                  <p>The white man said. ..... <hi>A horrible and terrible beast</hi> .....</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> This the white man said with a loud cry.</p>
                  <p>A voice out of the little fire. ..... <hi>Seal him, for</hi> two years of the Seven: <hi>For, so long is his power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Stars, with the Earth, even to the third part, are given unto thee: The fourth part thou shalt leave untouched.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> The white man taketh the hammer, and striketh him in the forehead of that head which is in the middle, and lieth down backward toward his taile.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E.</hi> K. Now all this vision is vanished away. The Stone is clear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now <hi>Madimi</hi> appeareth, and she seemeth to be bigger than she was.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>VRIEL.</hi> ..... Wo be unto the world: for her light is taken away. Wo, wo be unto man, for the eye of light hath for saken him. Wo, wo be to the understanding of man, for it is led out, with a threefold spirit, <note n="*" place="margin">Aliquid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est forte. <hi>The Spirit of Pride. This Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon great displeasure else</hi>
                     </note> the spirit of errour and ignorance. And wo be unto such as believe not the glorious and supereminent light of this Testimony: for they are not written with the life, neither shall their portion be with the living.</p>
                  <p>Thus saith he that is a <hi>mere stone, (</hi> which sitteth between the seat of light and darknesse) whose wings are great, and more than mighty: wherewith he gathereth the Stars, and the powers that hang upon the firmament of the first and lesser light: placing them and <hi>powering</hi> them, in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth; and through his own power, the power of the word, whereby all things are, and are comprehended: in that he is as well in the heavens of Glory, Chastity, and Message, as also in <note place="margin">Heavens of Glory, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, Angels.</note> places unknown to us.</p>
                  <p>Behold, those that dig into Nature with dull Mattocks, and dull Spades, are such, as of every congeled substance can imagin, but not judge: are foolish, and of the world: whose imaginations, are become the instruments of vanity, and the piercers of him which is the father of ignorance. Wo be unto them, for their disputations and doctrines, are dogma's and dull. Wo, wo unto them, for they are such as please themselves, and are become fathers to many lewd children: of whom it is written, They are become stiff-necked and proud, and the followers of their father. Therefore have I gathered my self together, and am hidden from them; because they are proud and haters of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. These teach not unto you a doctrine, neither are you partakers of their Bankets; for the Spirit of God, is plain, pure, and most perfect. These breath not upon you, neither are the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your Garlands enterlaced by these: <hi>But by him are you lifted up, that is the God of Justice, and the Discloser of his own secrets:</hi> and the headlong drawer of things to an end. <note place="margin">God to us is the Discloser of his own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore believe, and dream not with the world: For the world shall perish, and all her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents: and shall be cast into the pit of wo everlasting. Read the Scriptures, and understand them: but wrast them not, with the wicked. Look into the simplicity, and nakednesse of God his Promise.: View the innocency of some that received them, And let not the wickednesse of those that the Lord made vertuous, go out of your remembrance. But so Triumpheth true power, so ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth he himself together to discomfort the Serpent: Of the lightest he maketh the heaviest, and of the weakest the strongest: And in the weakest vessels, worketh he his mercy. And why? Behold, lest the world, in her proud imaginations, in the ornaments of her pearls, and most pretious wits, should brag, saying, I can compare with the Lord. Hear my voice, for it is of God. The world bringeth forth no good thing, neither are the doings of man accepted; but where the spirit of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <note place="margin">Humility.</note> dwelleth. Out of the depth of darknesse, hath God made light: And lo, the light is great, and the darknesse comprehendeth it not. So, in the weakest will he be exalted.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit that speaketh unto you, is he that hath a Tower to build, a strong Tower and a mighty; yea such a one, as hath not been from the beginning: No, not from the beginning. Great is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vriel</hi> hath a Tower to build &amp;c.</note> thereof; for, it is of Iron; But greater are her walls; for they are of Diamond. Most great are her Turrets; for they are the seven Heads, that behold, judge, and gather: And they are made of Truth, the Spirit of Eternity. Vnto the laying of every stone, are you made privy, <note place="margin">Œî. and <hi>E. K.</hi>

                  <p>O you ignorant, and of weak faith: Know you not the times that are to come? O you that spit out the meat of comfort: yea when it is put lovingly into your mouths. Why are you sorrowfull? Why rejoyce you not, that the God of Justice is girded, and hath whetted his sword, upon a thousand thousand Mountains of fire? Why laugh you not the world to scorn? and deride her fornication? weep not upon her; for she is accursed: Neither wonder at her; for she will be more wonderful.</p>

                  <p>First, what was the cause of the errour recorded, <hi>Febr.</hi> 18. this <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. at <hi>Lasko</hi> of Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> his death?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In what sense is this to be understood, which <hi>Madimi</hi> willed me to say to <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, An Angel of the Lord hath appeared unto me?</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Madimi</hi> willed me to write to <hi>Rodulphus:</hi> And I have done, and caused it to be delivered to <hi>Don Wilhelmo de Sancto Clemente,</hi> the Spanish Embassadour, to deliver it to the Emperour. God prosper it. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>Œî. There was great disquietnesse in <hi>E. K.</hi> being come home from our Hosts house, where he had lyen all night upon a form: by reason he had been (which he never was the like afore, as he said) with wine overcome suddenly: yet intending with himself to take heed of being overshot in drinking of wine: being requested by the Hostes to give her a quart of wine upon the good bargain he had in a Clock he bought of her for five Suckats: In this company of drinking was <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Lord <hi>Laskie</hi> his servant, who came with us to <hi>Prage.</hi> Unto whom <hi>E. K.</hi> (when the drink on the sudden had overcome him) said he would cut off his head, and with his walking staffe did touch him fair, and softly on the neck, sitting before him: This <hi>Alexander</hi> being half drunken himself, by &amp; by took those words in great snuffe, and went to defend himself, and so took his weapon to him, and thereupon they by caused <hi>Alexander</hi> to go down: It was supper time; and I that night refrained to suppe, and so tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at my Lodging, and looking out, saw <hi>Alexander</hi> sitting on the great stone against our Lodging: I called to him, and told him that they were at supper: And he came over to me, and he had wept much; he complained of <hi>E. K.</hi> his former words, and the touch of the staffe, how it was against his credit to take that in good part, and spake many Souldiers terms of stout words, not worthy the recording. I, thereupon went to our Hosts house, and would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the very truth; and there I found <hi>E. K.</hi> fast on sleep on a form, most soundly: for which I was right sorry: And yet better pleased to perceive the words of <hi>E. K.</hi> which so moved <hi>Alexander</hi> (being half drunken) to have been spoken by <hi>E. K.</hi> when wine, and not wit, bare rule: and so pleaded long time with <hi>Alexander, that of words spoken so as they were, no such exact</hi> account was to be given to him, &amp;c. And after two hours perswasion caused <hi>Alexander</hi> to go to bed in our Lodging, where he used to lye, For he would have gone out,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49588:157"/>
to our former Inne, in those raging half drunken pangs, he was in: which I thought not good. This Monday morning <hi>E. K.</hi> coming home, and seeing <hi>Alexander,</hi> as he came in; he said, they tell I should have spoken words, which greatly offended thee yesternight, and that I touched thee with my staff, &amp;c. I know nothing of it, and shoke hands friendly with <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi> Well saith <hi>Alexander, Si fuisset alius,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>E. K.</hi> came up to me: I told him how sorry I was for this mischance, and told him of the Watchmen perceiving <hi>Alexander</hi> his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet mind, and hearing his words, they came to me and charged me to have a care of the peace keeping (as they did indeed) And farther said, that <hi>Alexander</hi> in his rage, said, that rather, or before, he should cut off his head, that he would cut <hi>E. K.</hi> in pieces. So soon as I had expressed that word of this drunken <hi>Alexander</hi> likewise, (whom now I saw quiet, and <hi>E. K.</hi> also quiet) suddenly <hi>E. K.</hi> fell into such a rage, that he would be revenged of him for so saying, and for railing on him in the street, as he did, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Much a do I, <hi>Emericus,</hi> and his brother, had to stop or hold him from going to <hi>Alexander</hi> with his weapon, &amp;c. At length we let him go in his dubblet and hose, without a cap or hat on his head: and into the street he hasted with his brothers Rapier drawn, and challenged <hi>Alexander</hi> to fight: But <hi>Alexander</hi> went from him, and said. <hi>Nolo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </hi> Kelleie, <hi>Nolo.</hi> Hereupon <hi>E. K.</hi> took up a stone, and threw after him, as after a dog, and so came into the house again, in a most furious rage for that he might not fight with <hi>Alexander.</hi> The rage and <note place="margin">Satan his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> fury was so great in words and gestures, as might plainly prove, that <hi>the wicked enemy sought</hi> either <hi>E.

                  <p>This may suffice to notifie the mighty temptation and vehement working of the subtile spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <note place="margin">Note the cause of this recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> enemy Satan, wherewith God suffered <hi>E. K.</hi> to <hi>be tempted, and almost overcome:</hi> to my great grief, discomfort, and most great discredit: if it should (as the truth was) have come to the Emperours understanding, except he had known me well, &amp;c. I was in great doubt, how God would take this offence, and devised with my self how I might, with honesty, be aleared from the shame and danger that might arise if these two should fight, &amp;c. At the least it would crosse all good hope here with the Emperour, &amp;c. for a time, till God redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it.</p>
                  <p>After I had brought <hi>E. K.</hi> to some quietnesse, (by yeilding much to his humour, &amp;c. and <note place="margin">1 Comfort in time of need.</note> saying little:) not long after, came my messager from my wise at <hi>Cracovia:</hi> and <hi>Hugh</hi> my servant with him, <hi>to my great comfort</hi> through her letters, and the full satisfying of me by <hi>Hugh</hi> my servant his knowledge farther than conveniently could be written.</p>
                  <p>About 2 of the clock after Noon, came this letter to me, <hi>of the Emperour his sending</hi>

And that these things be true, I protested, and took to witnesse the God of Heaven and Earth, by <hi>whose Commandment</hi> I am now before your Majesty, (said I) and have a message from him to say unto you; and that is this:</p>
                  <p>The Angel of the Lord hath appeared to me, and rebuketh you for your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If you will <note place="margin">My message to the Emperour <hi>Rodolph</hi> done.</note> hear me, and believe me, you shall Triumph: If you will not hear me, The Lord, the God that made Heaven and Earth, (under whom you breath, and have your spirit) putteth his foot against your breast, and will throw you headlong down from your seat.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Lord hath made this Covenant with me (by oath) that he will do and perform. If you will forsake your wickednesse, and turn unto him, your Seat shall be the greatest that ever was: and the Devil shall become your prisoner: Which Devil, I did conjecture, to be the Great Turk, (said I) This my Commission, is from God: I feigne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, neither am I an Hypocrite, an Ambitious man, or doting, or dreaming in this Cause. If I speak otherwise then I have just cause, I forsake my salvation, said I.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour said, he did believe me, and said, that he thought I loved him unfaignedly, and said, that I should not need so earnest protestations: and would not willingly have had me to kneel, so often as I did.</p>
                  <p>Farther I said, His Majesty was to see and understand nakedly, from the beginning, the <note place="margin">All the course of our Actions and Visions, nakedly to be shewed to the Emperour.</note> whole course of this Angelical leading, instructing, and comforting of me: for so I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that I should from the beginning, nakedly open unto <hi>Rodolph,</hi> the manner of God his visitation, and shew unto him the holy Vision: Which my charge I am ready to do. The Emperour said, at another time, he would hear and understand more. I spake yet somewhat more in the purposes before, to the intent they might get some root, or better stick in his minde. To be short, he thanked me, and said he would henceforward, <hi>take me to his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>re,</hi> and some such words (of favour promised) he used, which I heard not well, he spake so low.

                  <p>All things being seen and heard, that in six hours I could shew him: at length he required of me what conclusion, or summary report he should make to the Emperour.

That his Majesty was to thank God for his <note place="margin">My counsel to Doctor <hi>Curtz.</hi>
                     </note> great mercies and graces offered: and that by me one, who most sincerely and faithfully gave his Majesty to understand the will of God herein, and that his Majesty was to do, as <hi>Mary</hi> (the blessed Virgin) did, to lay up all these my informations in his heart, and to say <hi>Ecce</hi>

                     <hi>1.</hi> For first, he sinneth against his Creator, which created all things in truth.</p>

                  <p>But, I say, give ear unto my words: For, I will sift the dust, and finde out the Pearle, that of a long time hath lyen trodden under the feet.</p>

                  <p>He it is (I sa) that when he hath lyed, and spoken against the truth doth not frowardly drown'd, and keep down his sin in silence.</p>

                  <p>I teach you briefly: that, he whosoever, opening his mouth against the spirit of truth; and with <note place="margin">Reconciliation to the Church.</note> wilfull frowardnesse continueth in his lying, <hi>without reconciliation</hi> to the Church sinneth against the holy Ghost, and shall be damned eternally.</p>

                     <hi>Note:</hi> As I had finished this Action, and was come to my Study door; <hi>Emericus</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again from the Spanish Embassadour, to whom I had sent him desirous to know his leasure for me: who had now sent me word by <hi>Emericus</hi> to come to diner, &amp; so he would have leasure, &amp;c. Whereof I was right glad; and went thither to diner: who into his inermost Study (where he himself was writing of letters) caused me to be brought. And after I had complained of injury and violence done unto me, by foul slanders, and that, at his Honours Table: (to which his Honour, in my behalf had replied: and therefore most humbly, and sincerely I did thank him) I said that the Emperous Majesty himself could bear me witnesse, that I used this phrase unto him, that I came not for his riches as, <hi>Non veni ad vos O Serenissime Caesar propter divitias vestras, ut inde ego dives fierem, sed √† Deo missus, non audeo aliter facere quam ejus ad ve tram Caesaream Majestatem voluntatem declarare,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore, How falsly they slandered me, it was evident: and because I perceive that Doctor <hi>Curtz</hi> hath not dealt neither with due entertainment of me as of a stranger, or a Sudent, or a Mathematitian, or of one whom (to my face) he gave great praise unto, as of one long since of great fame in <hi>Germany,</hi> and so in his good estimation, &amp;c. And least of all, as of one, who offered so great curtesies to the Emperours Majesty as he was made witnesse of: I thought good to send unto the Emperours Majesty this letter following, and so read it unto him after diner, when I shewed him <hi>Librum Pragensem sive Caesareum;</hi> and moreover <hi>Librum decimum,</hi> (whose former title was <hi>Libri Sexti Mystici Tertiarius</hi>) and there shewed him divers Actions in Latine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready translated, because now to translate so to him of the English, did seem to me both te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and to him not so readily pleasant.

And that the same man was called <hi>Raymondo Lullio:</hi> and that he made that which is called the Philosophers Stone, as in <hi>England</hi> (said he) I understand is good record of it: Therefore I see, quoth he, that it is a truth and possible: and as he hath granted the knowledge of it to one man, so he may grant it to another, &amp;c. And as for the other higher matters, <hi>I perceive that God intendeth some great matter in this world.</hi> But I am not able to judge or determine of it: But I am of this mind, wherein I can any way further the service of God, I will be ready and obedient, &amp;c. And as for the Emperours person himself, I find him of a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, curteous, and most zealously Catholick: yea ready to shed his blood in the cause, if opportunity required. He understandeth the Latine well, and speaketh sufficiently well: That is true (quoth I) for he spake well in Latine to me divers things. Moreover (said he) as <hi>concerning you, I saw him very well affectionated, making great account of your book,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore you are not to regard these <hi>Dutch mens ill tongues, who hardly can brook any stranger,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Upon farther matter that I had to shew him, I offered my ready repair unto him at all times of his good leasure being called or warned. And he desirous to see the Stone brought to me by an Angel, willed me to come to morrow also, to Diner: I promised him, and so with thanks yielded to his honour, I departed toward my Lodging at <hi>Bethelem</hi> in old <hi>Prage.</hi>

                  <p>The Doctor seemed not to know what I meant. I told him, that at a Noble-mans Table, There was, of great account, who said, that there was an <hi>English</hi> man, come to the Emperours, <hi>A bankrupt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

were not used in my causes as was reasonable, and for the Emperours honour it should not be laid to any other mans charge but to his, &amp;c. He promised that he would deliver all in the best words he could, in friendly sort, &amp;c. After this he shewed divers his labours and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Mathematical, and chiefly Arithmetical Tables, both for his invention by squares to have the minute and second of observations Astronomical, and so for the mending of <hi>Nonnius</hi> his invention of the Quadrant dividing in 90. 91. 92. 93. &amp;c. I then opened to him my secret of my glasse, for battering in a dark night, &amp;c. He said that conclusion would be very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Majesty, I told him that the glasse was at <hi>Cracovia,</hi> and his Majesty should see it by Gods leave.</p>
                  <p>After this I told him that I would full fain have a Pasport, or safe conduct to passe quietly and safely in any of the Emperours Dominions. He thought his Majesty would willingly grant that, and willed me to write three, or four lines as I would have it, and he informed me thus:</p>

I shewed him these last written: And he said they use to limit no time, but to make them indefinite. So he took the last, and I had the former Letters back again. He went with them into the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Chamber, he said, I should not need to send for the Letters, but he would send them home by his man, and I went from him toward the Ambassadour <hi>Don Gulielmo de Sancto Clemente,</hi> whom I found coming with the Ambassadour of <hi>Spain</hi> (who came three, or four dayes before, to give the golden Fleese to the Emperour) and the Marshall of the Court to go to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour presently to have audience: And as I stood in the Court of the Ambassadours lodging, and they three on hors-back coming, the Ambassadour my friend did put off his Cap, so did the new Ambassadour and Marshal twice very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The North Door is bright black, not to be thorough seen, as the rest. The West is green, like an Emerauld Stone: So is the South Door like a Ruby. The Doores be all plain.

                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now come out of that Rock, seven lean men, with Spades, and Shovels, and Mattocks, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>..... Follow me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now they be come up to the foresaid Hill.</p>

                  <p>..... Come on, Dig till you finde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Every one standeth distinctly one from another, and they dig on the foresaid Hill, which before seemed covered with Earth and Grasse: But now it appeareth to be a Rock, and they dig that the Fire flieth out again of their stroakes, and some have broken their Mattocks, some their Spades, all except two, one with a Shovel, an other with a Pickax.</p>
                  <p>The Workmen. <hi>O Lord we labour in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>..... So you are sure to do, unlesse you have better Tooles.</p>
                  <p>The Workmen. <hi>Alas we labour in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of them. <hi>This is long of you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>..... I bad you provide Instruments to labour with, but you asked not me, wherein you should la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Therefore have you digged away that which you saw, and have repulse with that you know not.</p>
                  <p>A dark man thou art, and hidden from men, and so are thy doings. <note place="margin">One of them said to the man covered with Hair-Cloth of Ash colour.</note>

                     <hi>E. K.</hi> They stood gazing one on another.</p>
                  <p>..... Have you not better Instruments? Go, provide your selves, and return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> They runne a great pace to the foresaid Rocky Cave from whence they came out first. Now they come againe with great Beetles of Iron, and Wedges. They knock their Wedges (as we use in Wood) and so break off great Slakes of Stone, like Slate, and throw it down the Hill.</p>
                  <p>One of them. <hi>What a thing is this, that this Wedg is broken?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another</hi> We are in worse case then ever we were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Their Wedges are broken, the most part, and the Fire flieth out of the Stone in great abundance.</p>
                  <p>..... The nature of this Stone is not to cleave: Therefore if you have no other Instruments you must cease.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> They are in great disquietness among themselves.</p>
                  <p>..... Those that go a Journey, provide them Cloathes against all weathers: He that is worthy of the Name of a Conqueror, carrieth with him all Engines: Where the Bridges be broken down, he stayeth not, because he is prepared: Behold, he hath victuals for time to come, and his Study is as well the event, as is the mean. So should true Labourers do: considering what they work in. For the Earth is a Monster with many faces: and the receptacle of all variety. Go home, stand not idle. Provide by Arts for the hardnesse of Nature, for the one Sister weepeth without the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> They go away speedily.</p>
                  <p>..... They have their Tooles to harden, and their Steeles to temper. It will be more then au hour space before they return. Therefore may you spend the time in your necessity, and use the time of day as you are acquainted or wonted. I also must over-see them, or else their labour will be without fruit.</p>

                     <hi>E. K.</hi> They fall to work. They make like square holes, and put in their wedges, and break up the rock or blackish stone (like yron-mine, or Magnes stone) in roundish lumps as big as a two-peny loaf, about two or three inches thick. They pick or dig round about the hole first, and so after use their wedges. The Pickaxes have three heads, every pick thereof bigger then the other. The first as big as one finger: the second as two: the third as broad as four fingers. And so after the first digging they fetch three or four cakes or pieces out of one hole, and then they go to another. Now one of them is faln into the ground, up to the arm-pits. Now another is faln in, to the knees. Now the house standing thereon beginneth to shake, and waver from one side to the other. Now the men be gotten out of the holes they stuck in.</p>

                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he is here again.</p>
                  <p>..... In the Lesson which I have taught you is this knowledge, with the rest contained.</p>
                  <p>Therefore seek, and turn the <hi>earth upfide down.</hi> Labour, that you may receive fruit, for unto <note place="margin">Note</note> him that worketh, and hath strength, strength shall be given, and the reward of a workman. Many years, the daughter of long time, are not necessary to the opening of this Mystery. Many moneths have nothing to do here: For lo, it is <hi>a labour of one day,</hi> for in one day you may understand to tear this Lesson in pieces, and to understand what every word signifieth.</p>
                  <p>But here is to be considered, in the learning of this Lesson, three things: the place that every <note place="margin">Note The place of words and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> word occupieth; the place that every letter occupieth, and the number and place that every word and letter is referred unto. For here <hi>place and number are apart, and bear an Image of the work</hi> that they intreat of.</p>
                  <p>But number and place must be joyned together, and thereby shall you taste of that which followeth, <note place="margin">The number of words and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> true wisdome.</p>
                  <p>Be therefore diligent, and pray for the grace of God, that you may learn and understand. The <note place="margin">The joyning of number and place.</note> manner of mans teaching look not for, in me; for I have nothing to do with man. See, how you can digest this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> He is stept aside.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> He is here again.</p>
                  <p>Œî I discoursed.</p>
                  <p>..... ¬∂ Now hear of what I shall say unto you. I will open unto you a <hi>Mystery, the key</hi> and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation into the entrance and knowledge of the divine wisdome, delivered unto you in a Science pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, <hi>conteined in letters and words unorderly placed, as a Chaos:</hi> and therefore not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood but <hi>by order to be reduced</hi> and drawn into their places, and thereby to be understood.</p>
                  <p>For you have not <hi>a letter,</hi> nor the <hi>form</hi> of a letter, nor <hi>the place</hi> of a letter, but they are all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Cabalistically</note> with <hi>us,</hi> as the stars <hi>are counted with God.</hi> The letters and words working into all reason, as the stars do into the lower creatures: Therefore humbly receive that which I have to say unto you, or shall open unto you as obedient Scholars, kneeling.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> prayed the 142 Psalm, <hi>Domine exaudi orationem meam,</hi> and I with heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, and greatly rejoyced in the aptnesse of the prayer: as <hi>E.K.</hi> his case chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and mine also.</p>

                  <p>..... Let the heavens prepare themselves to hear, the earth scatter her self before my voice: for I am the Trumpet of the Highest, and the piercing Spirit, dispersed into all creatures, which are from the beginning in God, and made to his glory, and the use of man-kind, that in man he might be glorified.</p>
                  <p>Give ear therefore, gird up your garments, and seatter your hair abroad before the Lord, which is glorified in me, and through whom I speak; and these are my words.</p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:49588:178"/>
                  <p>Harden not your hearts against the Lord, neither exalt your selves above him that hath created you. But humble your selves, and consider you are flesh, mortal, transitory, and full of sinne.</p>
                  <p>My brethren, my brethren, sinne and flesh appear not before the Lord, neither such as are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and fleshly vessels apt or fit for the Lord to dwell in.</p>
                  <p>Understand what the Lord is, and how great he is: a Judg to the wicked, great and terrible: a father to the holy and sincere, just, full of mercy, and loving kindnesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If you</hi> now therefore be holy, and put on the garments of Innocency, and walk before him in <note place="margin">If</note> righteousnesse; Then look to have the reward of Children; Then look for his fatherly mercies, and loving kindnesse; Then, then rejoyce at the <hi>garments of glory prepared for</hi> you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if</hi> you seek him in judgment, and stir him up to wrath and anger: if you cause him to call the <note place="margin">But if</note> terrible thunders (provided for the wicke) about him, in the most furious flames of his indignation, to gather you together like whirl Winds: if you <hi>draw his holy Angel from you,</hi> and spoil you of your armes: if he sit down upon the mouth of vengeance, and arm himself with righteousnesse against your wickednesse.</p>
                  <p>Then look for the horrible and unspeakable reward of the wicked, and the consuming fire of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, sharper then the two-edged sword.</p>
                  <p>Who hath stood before the Lord in Justice? or who dare quarrel with the highest? What flesh hath seen the Lord in his Majestie? or can appear before him, as righteous?</p>
                  <p>Tear your selves therefore in pieces, and fall down before the Lord, worship him as a father, and become his children: for his Judgments (my brethren) are terrible, and his wrath is without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Many wayes you are bound and tyed unto God; As by discipline you learn.</p>
                  <p>But three special wayes you have been advanced by him more then your brothers or sisters have bin:</p>
                  <p>The first in the visitation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that with his own hand, yea, with the beck of his own eye, beyond the ministry of Angels, he hath <hi>divers wayes protected you:</hi> defended you, yea, and snatched you from imminent and violent <hi>envy, and prepared destruction</hi> of Satan, <hi>at home, abroad, and diverse other wayes,</hi> secret and not to be opened.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, that by their meanes and ministry, which are his good Angels, and minister unto him, he hath guarded you from the wickednesse of your own Country, and hath brought you, ready to place you into the lap of a Virgin, <hi>with whom, if you take part, you shall ascend into that Hierusalem,</hi> which shall descend, and there live for ever.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ought you, above all men, to lift up the horn of the Lord, and to blow his praises a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ought you when others are full of idlenesse, the dalliances of sinne, to humble your self upon the earth before the Lord, and to praise his Name.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ought you, though all flesh forsook the Lord, and cried out against his anointed, to stand stifly against <hi>the malice of the hills, and to be without fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O my brethren, therefore ought you (in very dee) to shake off your wickednesse, and to cleave (before the Lor) unto the innocency of Angels, delighting in the one as an eternal food, despising the other as a fire-brand for Hell-fire and the wicked.</p>

                  <p>Œî After a good while, in which mean time we had discoursed of the Sacrament receiving, and of the Philosophers stone making, he appeared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Here he is now.</p>
                  <p>.....Note well what I say unto you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> He openeth his face, he putteth on a white garment, he taketh up the four corners of his garment, and putteth them under a broad girdle he hath: on his head is nothing, but <hi>hair reddish wavering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>.....God, in the beginning, of Nothing, by himself, made, created, and gathered together all Creatures; of Nothing, because in himself he is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> He holdeth up his hands, and looketh up to heaven, and seemeth to pray <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentis manibus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>..... If he Be, then doth it follow, that nothing is, but that which is God. But God made not all things (made and create) of himself, neither out of himself: therefore of nothing.</p>
                  <p>Understand therefore, that God from beginning, and beyond the beginning in himself, in himself as God, conteined I am and is, proper to himself, and for himself: But also by the knowledge of himself, he conteined also that <hi>Nothing,</hi> of the which in his secret and determined purpose separated from himself, he intended to make all things. It followeth necessarily (therefor) that that which was not, had no power of it self, must remain after the Image of <hi>IS,</hi> brought or knit together by the Wisome of God, substantially in himself, whereby Jesus Christ appeared in his God-head.</p>
                  <p>But behold, when God the Father and the Son, through one spiritual substance and illumination, from one centre, had gathered together <hi>(Ictu Divino)</hi> that <hi>Nihil</hi> separable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> He seemeth to be consumed to ashes in a fire, and so lyeth as it were in ashes prostrate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he is up again I know not how.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> He seemeth now to be very clear, and in manner transparent.</p>

Note here that the Trinity, first, second, and third, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally not moved, but by himself, in himself, time bringing forth all things according to his Word, made all things except Man. For why? when all things had pleased him, not because they were, but because by the Word (the Image of himself, and wherein he is delighte) they were made, he made man, as the Scripture teacheth you, how by the Spirit of God in <hi>Moses,</hi> that he should injoy and use the benefit of all this something proceeding from nothing in the Creatures of God in their kind: that in him God might be glorified; not onely in this world, which is your earth &amp; vail of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; but also and chiefly that the memory of his exceeding and great mercy &amp; omnipotency might remain before him in heaven, in the image of man, and the most excellent Creatures, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</p>

                  <p>Consider (my brethre) unto what use should the body of Christ be, if the <hi>Body</hi> it self were not a <hi>Sacrament, and the holy sign of the peace between</hi> God and man.</p>
                  <p>Behold it is said, unlesse thou eat of the flesh and drink of the blood, thou canst not, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If the Disciples did eat the body of Christ, Christ ministring himself, and <hi>standing by,</hi> not yet crucified, why therefore shouldest not thou eat the body of the same Christ, <hi>which dwelleth in thee, and in whom thou hast to dwell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here is to be considered the manner of eating.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he falleth in ashes again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he is up again.</p>
                  <p>..... But at whom shall we learn this manner of cating? My brethren, of his Disciples. For although Christ himself alive, visibly and substantially <hi>stood beside them,</hi> and ministred unto them: Notwithstanding took bread, brake it, and gave it unto them, saying, <hi>This is my body:</hi> They simply did believe it, considering and acknowledging his Omnipotency (which <hi>Peter</hi> had grounded in saying, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> the Son of the living God)</p>
                  <p>If therefore he be acknowledged of us (I speak for yo) to be the Son of the living God. Then must we truly confesse, that all things are possible unto him, <hi>and that by faith, we ought to believe the mysteries, works</hi> and wonders of God, <hi>Sacramentally</hi> opened and to be used for the cure of our own sores.</p>
                  <p>[He speaketh I know not what, nor to whom.]</p>
                  <p>..... Read.</p>
                  <p>Œî I read: But at whom? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And not as the wicked use to do; Tie the power and majesty of God and his Omnipotency to the tail or end of reason, to be halled as she will.</p>
                  <p>If his Apostles have left us examples of belief, have taught us how to believe, and upon what rock and foundation to fasten our belief; Then simply and nakedly follow the steps of true <hi>Faith,</hi> and laying reason aside, believe.</p>
                  <p>But here note, that this Sacrament is to be ministred amongst the Apostles, amongst the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and true Servants of God, in his Church, and not in the temple of the Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites, and Deceivers, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> they tear Christ Jesus and his body after the frowardnesse of their own sense, do eat (as <hi>Judas</hi> did) and so perish eternally.</p>
                  <p>But I say unto you, and teach you, that wheresoever in the true Church of God remembrance is made, and the use of this Sacrament is celebrated of the true body and blood of Jesus Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, there is also the true body of Christ, God and man substantial, and bread of eternal comfort and food, to such as humbly, nakedly, and penitently receive it, propitiatory for the quick and the dead; not unto such as are dead in sin, and in hell, and out of this life, but unto such as are here <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and so dead,</hi> and to be revived. For he that dwelleth in Christ is quick, because he dwelleth in life and light. But he that goeth out of Christ through sin, and in whom Christ dwelleth not, he is dead. <hi>For this, I have said.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Œî Lord, what shall we say to the Priests, when they would have us to acknowledge Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>..... The bread that was ministred by Christ unto his Disciples, was <hi>not a figure of his</hi> body, but <note place="margin">Œî The words of Consecration pronounced. <hi>Sub forma pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi>
                     </note> his true body. So <hi>the Minister</hi> using the office and person of Christ in office, pronouncing the <hi>[Œî]</hi> words, doth also give unto the people <hi>not</hi> Bread, <hi>but the true body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But hear me, Thou must consider it as a Sacrament, and must believe as the Disciples did, that it is the true Body of Christ, that thou eatest <hi>in the form of Bread.</hi>

This is the Office of a Preacher.

                  <p>You lesser Prophets, where are you?</p>
                  <p>You number without number, (whom the Lord hath talked witha) wherefore shew you not your selves?</p>
                  <p>All these were full of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>All these mortified their flesh for the love of God. Yet, what, are you not able to render account or to shew the true cause why God hath visited you?</p>
                  <p>Goa visited you so long, and so oft, so mercifully and so abundantly, and are you silent and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant? Why?</p>
                  <p>Mandata tua justa sunt Domine.</p>
                  <p>What, was this the cause that God visited you for, that you should fulfill his Commandments, and teach his people the way of salvation?</p>
                  <p>True it is, it was the cause that moved you to obedience. But the very cause <hi>why</hi> God appeared unto you, you know not.</p>
                  <p>Behold, the Commandments of God are just &amp; true, whose sons you are: if therefore you follow not the Commandments of your father, you are disobedient. But why, your Father hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you: Lo, I teach you.</p>
                  <p>When God of very God, the true light, beauty and honour of his Father, conteined or was full of the image of an heaven and earth, and by the omnipotent, conjoyned, and equal power and strength of them both, joyned in one, was brought forth, and had his real beginning, he determined also, in the self-same Image and Idea, the due and proper order, just law and determination, of all things that were comprehended, which law and things together have their course co-essential both in heaven and earth, distinguishing all things into their real beginnings, limitation of time, and determination between their extreams. This order or law, begun in the bosome of the Word of God, keepeth so his proper course, and order, and law of his own establishment, That those things that before were wrought in God, might also receive working and being substantial to the end of God his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</p>
                  <p>This is the self-same that we spoke of before, in the name of divine Necessity, against the which no prayer prevaileth, nor resistance can be made.</p>
                  <p>This Necessity was the cause, O you Prophets and Children of God, that God dwelt amongst you.</p>
                  <p>This Necessity was the instrument that brought you to the stage of your election.</p>
                  <p>This Necessity was the cause that God chose you.</p>
                  <p>This Necessity maketh of wax, honey; of tar, milk; of long ranging, return, of Infidels, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; of disobedient, holy ones.</p>
                  <p>Finally, of the unperfect and evil, rage and roming astray of mankind, the true number of such as return from wickednesse, and are chosen to eternal joy from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>But this may seem unto you a strange and stumbling Doctrine.</p>

                     </gap> the Basis.</p>
                  <p>Œî We read the premisses, which seemed to us very pithy, and ponderous, and full of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:49588:186"/>
                  <p>Œî I noted two Prophets names, not before.</p>
                  <p>..... This Necessity is two-fold, one (that is to say, the firs) contemplative and fix.</p>
                  <p>The other, working and leading to an end.</p>
                  <p>In the first do dwell two great and mighty Judges, Justice and Mercy.</p>
                  <p>In the second dwelleth the son and image of Justice, leading on by order for the course of things, that are led on by the later, have not true Justice, but the image of Justice.</p>
                  <p>This is the cause that the elect and chosen may erre and go astray, and lose the benefit both of the end of his Election and first determination.</p>
                  <p>For why: All things come on, and keep their course, even as they are led, by the image of Justice, Man onely excepted: which by reason of his free-will draweth out of order, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>[<hi>E. K.</hi> He teacheth himself.]</p>
                  <p>In the which evil, whilst he dwelleth and continueth, lo the course of necessity taketh hold upon him, and draweth him unto the scope or end whereunto he inclineth himself.</p>
                  <p>For, behold, Although he be before sanctified unto the Lord, and made a chosen vessel, wherein if he continue, necessarily he shall enjoy the reward and glory of the sanctified. Yet if he lose that <note place="margin">If he continue.</note> Necessity, and fly from his own law and condition, taking part with the filthinesse and iniquity of his enemy, through Satan or his flesh, of Necessity he must perish.</p>
                  <p>For as those that are good, tied unto the law of goodnesse, are glorified, <hi>if they</hi> continue: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">If</note> are the evil tyed unto the law of wickednesse, the Necessity whereof is damnable.</p>
                  <p>This is the cause that the Prophets are visited.</p>
                  <p>Because God found them punishing their flesh, despising the vanities of the world, and resisting Satan.</p>
                  <p>For lo, the Lord looked down unto the earth: And he saw them <hi>despising wickednesse, fearing him, and grounded in the faith of redemption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore he thrust himself in amongst them, and through the first part of necessity (in merc) he visited them.</p>
                  <p>Take heed (√¥ yo) that the Lord of necessity visiteth in Justice, for your burden shall be great and intolerable.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>..... Now unto the rest.</p>
                  <p>What is (therefor) that necessity divine against the which there is no prayer nor resistance? For why it is evident, That sinners may return, and those that erre, may be brought into the right way, and that by Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Behold, no man is penitent, but he useth Prayer. <note place="margin">Prayer.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>No man satisfieth, but he useth Prayer.</p>
                  <p>No man taketh part with the Church, but in Prayer, for Prayer is the Key, sanctified by the</p>
                  <p>Holy Ghost, which openeth the way unto God.</p>
                  <p>Necessity had determined the destruction of <hi>Ninevee,</hi> necessity also saved it.</p>
                  <p>For lo, when they should necessarily have received reward for their wickednesse, they prayed, and resisted necessity.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth, therefore, not yet, what necessity that is, that Prayer prevaileth not against.</p>
                  <p>Note here, The later necessity is necessity, leading <hi>malum ad malum, &amp; bonum ad bonum;</hi> which necessity is that, which is tyed unto every thing leading it <hi>unto the end</hi> that it desireth.</p>
                  <p>Even as God, seeing the Prophets for sake the loathsomnesse of their flesh, and framing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the necessity which leadeth unto good, of his meer mercy, in the first, thrust himself amongst them, fixing their later and desired necessity, with a necessity of his Omnipotent and unspeakable mercy wherein there dwelleth two things;</p>
                  <p>Joy, and Perseverance.</p>
                  <p>These therefore (as the Prophet) which are visited with God in mercy, are fed, nourished and fostered as the Prophets were, with these two dishes,</p>
                  <p>Whereof the greatest is <hi>Perseverance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Herein I teach you, that he that is first elected and applyeth himself to the necessity of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, doing the works that are righteous before the Lord, and receiveth comfort by the visitation of Gods mercy, is sealed to the end of his Election, in gladnesse, and through the value and strength of Perseverance, and cannot fall so far, that he shall be bruised, or run so far astray, that he shall not be able to remember himself.</p>
                  <p>Happy are those that are elected.</p>
                  <p>But happy, happier are those that persevere in their Election.</p>
                  <p>These are those unto whom God imputeth not their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>These are those that sinne and Satan are a weary of, for they are not able to prevaile.</p>
                  <p>These are those which are numbred in the Book of God, and whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But is there a mercy fixed, and doth this mercy also fix Justice; Or as I have called it the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Justice.</p>
                  <p>It is evidont; So also is there a Justice that is fixed, a Justice triumphing, a Justice mighty' a Justice unable to be resisted, a Justice that Prayer prevaileth not against, yea, a Justice that Hell and the Devil are condemned in.</p>
                  <p>This is that Justice, this is that two edged sword, this is, that Iron Mall, wherewith those that refuse their Election, or are not elected, following the necessity of wickednesse, are and shall be cut in pieces with, beaten into small powder, and be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone.</p>
                  <p>This is he that sealeth up the second Hell, with the second death.</p>
                  <p>This is that you, √¥ you starvelings, you vagabonds, you stiff-necked and stinking sinners ought to dread and fear!</p>
                  <p>Hath God elected you, and do you disdain it?</p>
                  <p>Hath he provided a Seat for you, an Honour for you, a Crown for you, a Wedding Garment for you, his eternal glory for you. And will you force him to cast it into the fire.</p>
                  <p>Shall the finger of God write you, and shall the vengeance of God root you out.</p>
                  <p>Repent I say, and flie from your iniquity.</p>

                     <hi>Wednesday,</hi> √† meridie circa 3¬Ω. Œî As we sat together in my Study, and talked of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and of the Philosophers stone, <hi>E. K.</hi> felt a thing heavy upon his head, and heard a voice, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will teach thee. Hereupon I set the stone in place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Here is Levanael, covered as he was wont.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Levan.</hi> ..... Why are you not pure, that you may learn?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> So we will receive at Easter, as the time of the year doth require.</p>
                  <p>Œî Lord, thou hast said, we should at length be of one minde, through thy mercies, Lord help us herein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> He seemeth to have had his lips sewed: for the vail is so thin, that it permitteth his face in manner to be perfectly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Levan.</hi> ..... See that you take the season, and gather while it is time; if you let this Harvest passe, you shall be desirous to gather, and you cannot. <note place="margin">NOTE. Thrice.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thrice I must come unto you, <hi>if I finde you not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lo, I have done, for <hi>I</hi> come no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> I pray you to deal with another: here is John, a boy in the house, you may use him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Levan.</hi> ..... Thy talk is <hi>humane folly:</hi> But before I go, I will not be hidden from you.</p>
                  <p>Read your Lesson, it is now a stale lesson.</p>
                  <p>Œî I read, Take Common Audcal, &amp;c. Take hold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Levan.</hi> ..... You are best to do so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> Now he hath heaved up his vail, his face is bare, it was not his lips that had those stitches as it were, but it was in his vail, his face is a very fair beautiful face.</p>
                  <p>Œî We beseech you for God his sake, his glory and honour, to give light, and to make plain this Lesson or Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Levan.</hi> ..... This Conclusion wherein man is exalted being the last and the first, is as necessary for you, <hi>and for the avoiding of</hi> temptations <hi>that are</hi> to come, as your garments are to cover your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, or the houses to keep off the storms.</p>
                  <p>Œî Give us therefore this help, this hand, this staff, this counsel, O Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Levan.</hi> ..... How much the more you neglect it, and the time wherein it is to be gathered, so much the more shall you be tedious unto your selves and the businesse which you must fulfill in the will of God, if you have this; it will first <hi>cause you to forsake; secondly, it will plant you there,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I speak not this, for that you should murmur, saying, Cannot God plant us without this? But to make it evident unto you: That God useth <hi>his Creatures visible to introduce or lead in (yea, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural) force and wisdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things will demonstrate the will and power of God grafted in you, that it is found perfect, and from above. <note place="margin">The divers commodities of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers stone known.

                  </p>
                  <p>For if you say, lo these things hath God taught me, and these things hath God opened unto me: <hi>Whilest they wonder at the one, they shall be forced to believe the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, they shall leave their <hi>Table-talks, which object poverty unto you,</hi> and they shall be forced to say, (even in despight of their teet) what need had he of us? he sought us not of the world, for lo, he leadeth her as his slave.</p>
                  <p>These things, if you consider not, <hi>I</hi> put you in remembrance, that you may know you lose time, yea, that you lose a benefit, desired of many, and so forth.</p>

                  <p>We desire God of his great and infinite mercies, to grant us the help of these heavenly mysteries, that we may by them be directed how or by whom to be aided and relieved, in this necessity that we are in, of sufficient and needful provision, for meat and drink for us and our Family, wherewith we stand at this instant much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed: and the rather because that might be hurtful to us, and the credit of the actions wherein we are vowed and linked unto his heavenly Majestie, (by the ministry and comfort of his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) to lay such things as are the ornaments of our House, and the coverings of our bodies, in pawn either unto such as are Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his divine Majestie, the Jews, or the people of this City, which are malicious and full of wicked slanders: I Jane Dee humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly request this thing of God, acknowledging my self his servant and handmaiden, to whom I commit my body and soul.</p>

                  <p>Friday.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aprilis</hi> 12. A meridie we came to <hi>Cracovia,</hi> and as we were within an English mile of the City, being a fair and calm day, there passed about half a mile before us, crossing from the right hand to the left Whirlwinds, divers one after another, wreathing up the dust with great vehemency on high, and shooting forward still, and then mounting into the air, and so went Southerly from us, and likewise some began on the right hand, and came furiously, raising up and wreathing the dust up into the air Southerly also, and did not crosse the way.</p>
                  <p>When we came to our house, we found that a stranger was set into it, by the Landlords (Mr. <hi>John Long,</hi> the Judge, and <hi>Martin Plutner</hi>) and having by me the keys of the Store-house, and of the Street-door, I caused my stuff brought with me to be set in, and that night we made hard shift for lodging. But the new and forced in tenants gave me leave to have one of my Bedsteads, which was in one stove, and emptied the same to us, with much ado.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi> we were sore out-faced or rather threatned, that we should have no house there, and also one <hi>Bonar</hi> his arms were set upon the door, as if the house had been allowed to him <hi>ex officio. Monday</hi> I made the Rector privy of the Injuries I indured, and he courteously sent two Masters of Art with me to the <hi>Proconsul</hi> to have Citation for the Landlords to appear on Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day by 7 of the clock, to answer to our complaint.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Monday-night</hi> came the Lord <hi>Lasky</hi> from <hi>Lasko,</hi> upon a Letter he had received from me from <hi>Niso,</hi> of my coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tuesday</hi> (<hi>Aprilis</hi> 16) the Lord <hi>Lasky</hi> came to the house, and in the morning would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently cast all their stuff out of doors, but by entreaty he permitted them to empty all into the lower stove.</p>
                  <p>In the mean space I appeared with my Lawyer or Attourney Mr. <hi>Tetaldo,</hi> (an Italian) an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Practitioner in the <hi>Polish</hi> and <hi>Cracovian</hi> Causes: And to conclude, I had a Decree against my Landlords, that I was to have at least an half years warning; whereupon <hi>John Laugh</hi> gave me warning to avoid at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and so we came from the Court or Town-house, called <hi>Praetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> in Latine. This same <hi>Tuesday</hi> afternoon, my Lord <hi>Lasky</hi> went to the King of <hi>Poland</hi> up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Castle, and told him of my comming, and how evilly I was used: and he said, why did he not cast them out of doors? so have I now, quoth the Lord <hi>Lasky;</hi> and the King granted the House to be holden <hi>ex officio: And the next day the King was desirous to speak with me.</hi>

                  <p>Aprilis <hi>17.</hi> Wednesday, <hi>I went with the Lord</hi> Lasky <hi>to the King, to whom I said, to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> Consolatio, pax, &amp; misericordia Dei sit tibi, √¥ serenissime Rex: Coram quo, Divinitus reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi admonitionem, ut me sustinem, quod nunc humillime facio: paratissimus cum omni fidelitate &amp; sinceritate ea cum Regia vestra Majestate tractare, quae mihi divinitus injungantur, Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum mysteriorum historias de ordine in ordinem referre, prout occasio dabitur, non recusabo aliaque omnia peragere, quae Deo &amp; vestrae Majestati <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Hereupon I made Coursy, as was appertaining, and stepped back somewhat from the King, and so the Vice-Chancelor and other Officers, the chief Secretary brought Bills to be read, and subscribed, or assigned with the Kings own hand, which he did: and after the Lord <hi>Lasky</hi> had watched a fit time to tell the King of his desire to speak a few words to his Majesty of some of his own astairs, and was bidden to resort straightway after dinner to his Majesty, we took our leave with reverence doing, and so went out of the privy Chamber, or rather with-drawing Chamber through his privy Chamber, where he had said Masse when wecame, and so into the Guard-chamber, and down, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> A Spirit appeared to me this morning by my Bed-side, and bid me be quiet.</p>
                  <p>Bad me will you to go to morrow with both your servants to my Lord, as secretly as you could.</p>
                  <p>Bad you comfort him.</p>
                  <p>Bad you bring him with you.</p>
                  <p>Bad you to go to the King as you came homeward.</p>
                  <p>Bad me to board in the mean space with the Italian <note n="*" place="margin">Gregorius, Jordanus, Venitus.</note> Doctor at Perins house.</p>
                  <p>Bad me lie here every night.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon I was most glad and joyful, and praised God for his marvellous mercies, loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and goodnesse toward us, and declared my self assured that God had put out his term, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the degree: For the performance of his purposes and promises made to us, for his own honour and glory: And so with joy and thanks given <hi>E.

                  <p>Note, I had in my prayers alledged to God, that albeit I was in great perplexity and agony of mind, yet since <hi>I was willed to cease my voice for having at any angelical presence,</hi> I said he of his divine clemency and care over us, in these great desires might counsel us and direct us, though we did not urge our request as we were wont. The conclusion and shame which many wayes would follow, if this intended purpose of <hi>E.

Do you count it nothing to sit in judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spirit of God: leaving him no place, but at your limitation. Is it lawful before the Sonne of God, to spend the whole dayes, yea, many yeares, with the Sonnes of Satan, the lying imps, and deceivers of the World?

The Sonne of God spake not his own words, in that he was flesh, but the words of his Father; His Disciples taught not, but through the holy Ghost; Dare you (therefore) presume to teach, and open the secret Chamber of the Highest, being not called?</p>
                  <p>Tell me, have you left your Merchandize, and the counting of your mony deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gotten, to beome Teachers of the Word of God? Are you not ashamed to teach before you understand? yea, are you not ashamed to lead away, where you cannot bring home? Hypocrites you are, and void of the Holy Ghost, lyars you are become, and the enemies of Christ, and his holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Peradventure you will say, in reading the Scriptures we understand But tell me, by what spirit you understand them: what Angel hath appeared unto you? or of which of the Heavens have you been instructed?</p>
                  <p>It may be you will say of the Holy Ghost, O thou fool, and of little understanding! Dost thou not understand that the Holy Ghost, is the School-master of the Church, of the whole Flock &amp; Congregation of Christ? If he be the School-master (therefore) over a multitude, it followeth then, that one doctrine taught by the Holy Ghost, is a lesson or an understanding of a multitude: But what multitude are of thine understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or of what Congregation art thou? Wilt thou say, thou art scattered. Thou speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est fasly, thou art a runnagate. But, behold, I teach thee, and thy error is beforethy face.</p>
                  <p>Whosoever doth understand the Scriptures must seek to understand them by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and spiritual tradition. But of what spiritual tradition understandest thou? or by what Ordinance are the Scriptures opened unto thee? Thou wilt say thou art infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Holy Fathers, and by the same Spirit that they taught, by the same Spirit thou understandest. Thou sayest so, but thou dost not so. Which of thy Fore-fathers <hi>hath tied reason to the Word of God?</hi> or the understanding of the Scriptures to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Heathen? I, say unto thee, that thy Fore-fathers were dear unto Christ, were pertakers of the heavenly visions and celestial comforts, which visions and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial comforts, did not teach unto them, a new exposition of the Scriptures, but did confirm and give light unto the mysteries of the Holy Ghost spoken by the Apostles, the ground-layers and founders of the Church. Whatsoever, therefore, thou learnest of thy Fore-fathers, thou learnest of the Apostles, and whatsoever thou learnest of the Apostles thou hast by the Holy Ghost. But if thou expound the Fathers after thy sense, &amp; not after the sense of the Apostles, thou hast not the Holy Ghost, but the spirit of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <p>AS <hi>E.K.</hi> stood at the end of the Galery by his Chamber, looking over into the Vineyard he seemed to fee the little man the <hi>Gardiner,</hi> in all manner of behaviour and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, who is the chief workman or over-seer of Mr. <hi>Carpio</hi> his workmen in the same Vine-yard. He seemed very handsomly to prune some of the Trees: at length he approached under the wall by <hi>E. K.</hi> and holding his face away-ward he said unto him, <hi>Quaeso dicas Domino Doctori quod veniat ad me.</hi> And so went away as it were cutting here and there the Trees very handsomly, and at length over the Cherry-trees by the house on the Rock in the Garden he seemed to mount up in a great piller of fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> bade his Wife to go, and she who was in the Garden. She came up, and brought him word, No body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>E. K.</hi> then came to me and said, I think there is some wicked spirit that would allude me, and he told and said to me, as is before noted. Then said I, I will go into the Garden, and bade <hi>E. K.</hi> come with me. We went down that way which this Creature did go: but nothing we saw, went to the Banqueting-house in the Vine-yard, but that place pleased us not: so, we went along in the way by the cliff side, and sat down on the bank by the great pyle of Vine-stakes lying in the very South end of the Vine-yard. And we had not sat there half a quarter of an hour, but I espyed under the Almond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and on the South-side of it, being the Westerly Almond-tree, that is it which is standing on the Westerly side of the straight path which leadeth from the North toward the South in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. <hi>I espyed</hi> (<hi>I say</hi>) <hi>like a sheet of faire white paper lying tossed to and fro in the wind.</hi> 
                     <q>I rose and went to it, and (to the prayse of God his truth and power,) there I found three of my Books lying, which were so diligently burnt the tenth day of April last.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 The three Books were, <hi>Enoch his Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The 48 <hi>Claves Angelicae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 And the third was the Book of my gathering of the thirty Aires, and entitled <hi>Liber Scientia terrestris auxilii &amp; victoriae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thereupon <hi>E. K.</hi> comming to me, I fell on my knees with great thanks yeilding to the God Almighty, and so did <hi>E. K.</hi> whose mind and body were mervailously affected at the sight of the <q>said Books, having no shew or signe that ever they had been in the fire, neither by colour or savour, or any thing wanting.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after we had set half an hour under the fore-said Almond-trees praysing God and wondring at the Miracle. Suddenly appeared by us the self-same Gardiner like person, but with his face some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what turned away, and nothing thereof to be adjudged as of <hi>Ave</hi> the custome is. He said, <hi>Kelly,</hi> follow me, <hi>E. K.</hi> went, and I sat still, awaiting his return.</p>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:49588:204"/>
                  <p>This Gardiner went before <hi>E. K.</hi> and his feet seemed not to touch the ground by a foot height. And as he went before <hi>E. K.</hi> so the doores did seeme to open before him, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

K.</hi> hath his new Study, and then the door going out of that to the stairs opened of it self, and he went up those stairs, &amp; <hi>at length brought him to the Furnace mouth where all the Books and papers had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the</hi> 10 <hi>day of this April.</hi> And coming thither, there the spiritual Creature did seem to set one of his feet on the post on the right hard without the Furnace mouth, and with the other to step to the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace mouth, and so to reach into the Furnace (the bricks being now plucked away which stopped the mouth of the Furnace, all saving one brick thick) and as he had reached into the furnace there appeared a great light, as if there had been a window in the back of the Furnace, and also to <hi>E. K.</hi> the hole which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>

                        <hi>and so over his shoulder backward he did reach to E. K. all the rest of the standing Books, excepting the Book out of which the last Action was cut, and</hi> Fr. Pucci <hi>his Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, also to E. K. appeared in the Furnace all the rest of the papers which were not as then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That being done, he bade <hi>E. K.</hi> go, and said he should have the rest afterward. He went before in a little fiery cloud, and <hi>E. K.</hi> followed with the Books under his arm all along the Gallery, and came down the stairs by <hi>Fr. Pucci</hi> his Chamber door, and then his guide left <hi>E. K.</hi> and he brought me the Books unto my place under the Almond-tree.</p>

                  <p>He told, that he had often prayed, since unto God for the forgiveness of his sins, and to open his eyes how he might serve him; and to make it to be evident unto him whether he is to marry or no, and where, or in what stock or kindred. And if it were his divine will, that he might receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and instruction by me, and that these and such matters, and somewhat earnestly he had prayed also for his Mr. the Emperour, that he might bend himself to enjoy God his favour, yea, for his own mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and amending of his loose life, while he yet sat at dinner this day at the Archbishops table, his heart and thought did come very much upon it, &amp;c.</p>

                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> prayed &amp; that the answer which I read unto him was so filty applyed unto his prayer as he also himself, did perceive with great comfort and spiritual joy. He entreated much that I would pray to God that the Emperour might be restored to the favour of God, as he was when I declared my message unto him from the Highest, I answered, that whatsoever the God of Heaven and Earth should appoint me to say or do unto his Majesty, I most willingly rejoyce in the faithful doing of it: and that it was my duty (as a Christian) to pray for his Majesty: but I should not make my promise of my prayer to be heard, but would highly rejoyce if his Imperial Majesty would so use himself in God his judgment, as might be meritorious in the sight of our Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>Such words and matters as this passed between us. And he said that he would in all points, fulfil the advice and warning of God, in this Action expressed, &amp; would marry a Maiden as he was willed. <note place="margin">Votum &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missum <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helmi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>These and other such good seeds for the service of God being sown between us; he went towards his Palace in the Court, and I to the water-side, and so over to the Coach awaiting for me, and so came home. God be praysed.</p>

                           <hi>May</hi> 11 I came to <hi>Leipsig,</hi> on Sunday the 11 of <hi>May,</hi> and was at <hi>Peter Hans Swartz</hi> his House lodged.

                        <p>I perceived by his diverse expresse sayings, that he was but a hollow friend unto me, and seemed half afraid to deal either with me, or my man.</p>

                              <p>ALbeit I have (almost) in vain come a hundred miles (from <hi>Prage</hi> to this <hi>Leipsich</hi> Mart) hoping either to meet my Servant there, with answer to my former Letters, sent in <hi>November</hi> last to her Majesty (when also I wrote unto your Honor, and divers other). And so with speed from this <hi>Leipsich</hi> to have sent again, most speedily as occasion should have served. And now, I find, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther servant, neither Letter from him, neither word of mouth: yet all this notwithstanding: and whatsoever the hindrance or delay hereof be (whether the keeping back of my Letters from her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, or the manifold and importune, most weighty affairs publick hindring or delaying her Majesties most gracious, discreet and wise resolution herein: or what other occasion else hath and doth cause this long and wonderful delay of answer receiving. All this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, I thought good, before I set up to my Coach, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, and most humbly to salute your Honour very faithfully, dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sincerely, with great and the same good will, that my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some yeers since written to your Honour, (butt hen, a sinmbling block unto your Honour and other, for the strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Phrases therein) doth pretend, so it is, right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the merciful providence of the Highest, declared in his great and abundant graces upon me, and mine, is so wonderful and mighty, that very few, unlesse they be present witnesses, can believe the same. Therefore how hard they are to be believed, there where all my life and doings were construed to a contrary sense: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              <p>I am forced to be brief. That which <hi>England</hi> suspected, was also here, for these two yeers, almost (secretly) in doubt, in question, in consultation Imperial and Royal, by Honourable Espies, fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about me, and by other, discoursed upon, pryed and peered into. And at length, both the chief Romish power, and Imperial dignity, are brought to that point, resolutely, that, partly they are sorry, of their so late reclaiming their erroneous judgment against us and of us, and seek means to deal with us, so as wee might fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour both the one and the other: And partly to <hi>Rome</hi> is sent for as great Authority and Power as can be devised, and likewise here, all other means and wayes contrived, How, by force, or for feare, they may make us glad to follow their humours. But all in vain, for force humane we fear not: as plainly, and often, I have to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces declared: And otherwise then in pure verity, and godlinesse, we will not favour any (my words may seem very marvellous in your Honours ears: But mark the end, wee have had (and shall have to deal with no babes) I have full oft and upon many of their requests

and questions, referred my self to her Majesties answer, thus, in vain, expected. <hi>Nuncius Apostolicus, (Germanicus Mala Spina)</hi> after his yeers suit unto me to be acquainted with me, at length had such his answer, that he is gone to <hi>Rome</hi> with a flea in his eare, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But the God of Heaven and Earth is our Light, Leader, and Defender. To the Worlds end, his mercies upon us, will bread his Praises, Honour and Glory. Thus much very rhapsodically, (yet faithfully) <hi>tanquam dictum sapienti,</hi> I thought good to commit to the safe and speedy conveyance of a young Merchant here called <hi>Lawrence Overton:</hi> which if it come to your Honours hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Servant have his dispatch, I shall or may by your Honour be advertized. Your Honour is sufficient from her Majesty to deal and proceed with me, if it be thought good. But if you make a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Table Case of it, <hi>Quot homines, tot sententiae.</hi> And my Comis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from above is not so large: <hi>Qui potest capere, capiat.</hi>

                              <p>Sir, I trust, I shall have Justice for my House, Library, Goods, and Revenues, &amp;c. Do not you disdain, neither fear to bear favour unto your poor Innocent Neighbour. If you send unto me Master <hi>Thomas Diggs,</hi> in her Majesties behalf, his faithfulnesse to her Majesty, and my well liking of the man, shall bring forth some piece of good service. But her Majesty had been better, to have spent or given away in Alms, <hi>a Million of Gold, then to have lost some opportunities past.</hi> No humane reason can limit or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine God his marvellous means of proceeding with us. Hee hath made of <hi>Saul</hi> (E K.) a <hi>Paul:</hi> but yet, now and then, visited with a pang of humane frailty. The Almighty blesse her Majesty both in this World, and eternally: and inspire your heart with some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of his merciful purposes, yet, yet, not utterly cut off from her Majesty, to enjoy</p>

At his going from <hi>Prage</hi> he had that <hi>Nuncius</hi> blessing, &amp;c. In the meane space, and after his return to <hi>Prage</hi> again it happened so, that the <hi>30</hi> of May last, I received the Emperours commandment, I, my Companion, and all mine to depart within six dayes out of <hi>Prage</hi> aud consequently out of all his Kingdomes, Dukedomes and Lands. Which we did, and were come to <hi>Erphurd</hi> in <hi>Thuringa,</hi> and sometimes to <hi>Cassel</hi> whether we had removed our goods and family by reason the Senators of <hi>Erphurd</hi> would give as no leave to hire any house there as both by the Lord <hi>Schonberg</hi> in the name of the Lord <hi>Rosenberg,</hi> I was assayed, with repulse received, and also again by me and <hi>E.

                  <p>Now remember that <hi>Francis Pucci</hi> came to <hi>Erphurd</hi> on Thursday after our supper, July <hi>10 (stilo novo)</hi> on horse-back on a horse which he had bought at <hi>Mawnberg-faire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>July the 11th he discoursed with <hi>E. K.</hi> and me, that he thought we might obtain favour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Prage</hi> again if we would.</p>
                  <p>That he had found this <hi>Nuncius Apostolicus</hi> more courteous then <hi>Malaspina,</hi> of whom he reported also, that is was credibly informed that he was sore offended that we gave him no more honourable title in our speeches to him, then <hi>Reverendissima Vestra Paternitas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Pucci</hi> framed the discourse of his talk to perswade us to think well of this <hi>Episcopus Placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> that he was charitable towards us, and sorrow that we were so uucourteously used, that he meant nothing else in his sute to the Emperour against us, but that we might be examined, and <hi>thou being</hi>

                     <hi>found faulty, we should</hi> be sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> but after that he had begun to move against us, that he <hi>found the Emperour more eagerly bent</hi> against us, than he himself was.</p>

                     <p>The Lord <hi>Rosenberg</hi> told us that when he did (in our behalf) advise the Emperour of his error committed in our extermination, that the Emperour answered that this <hi>Nuncius</hi> from his first Audience did urge so vchemently against us, and also the Pope had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But if the commandement or his Decree were to be made again, that it should not passe, or if this <hi>Nuncius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>

                        </hi> had not sent this Decree away to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he should not send it, &amp;c. This I note in respect of the contrariety in the <hi>Nuncius</hi> assertion, and the Emperours, of our so hard usage.</p>
                     <p>The foresaid eleventh day of <hi>July,</hi> the foresaid <hi>Fr. Pucci</hi> to prove this his intended perswasion of the <hi>Nuncius</hi> good meaning toward us, and to make us beleeve that great benefit would ensue our going to <hi>Rome,</hi> did bring forth unto us a writing of his own hand which he read unto us, and at the hearing of it we mused much for many causes I asked him then why the <hi>Nuncius</hi> had not subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed this writing. It is all one said he for that; Hath he heard this read (quoth I,) yea, that he hath heard me read this three several times, arise unto him (said he;) And if you like of it saith he, wherein his power serveth him not to performe as much as is specified in the writing, he will make and use meanes to have it from his Holinesse; well, said I, take a copy hereof Mr. <hi>Kelly,</hi> for I was riding toward <hi>Salfeild</hi> about a house getting; Thereupon said he, contented, but I think it meeter to save and keep the original it self said <hi>E. K.</hi> Well, said <hi>Pucci,</hi> and so the original was delivered to <hi>E. K.</hi>

                     <head>NOTE.</head>
                     <p>After 10 of the clock the same Friday, being the eleventh day of this moneth, after break-fast I rid toward <hi>Salfeild</hi> about the house of the Earl <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Swartzenberg,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But after I was out of <hi>Erffurd</hi> until my return again, I was so sore vexed in mind to think of <hi>Pucci</hi> his return to our company, <hi>as well for his unquiet nature in disputations, as for his blabbing of our secrets without our leave, or well liking, or any good doing thereby;</hi> either in God <hi>his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A bait.</note> or our credit, but rather the contrary, ensuing albeit not of his intent, but by either his undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet handling of it, or of his undue hearers of him, &amp;c. And also for his Houshold behaviour, not <note place="margin">A spie.</note> acceptable to our wives and family, and also because we were warned <hi>that he should be cut off from our company,</hi> &amp;c. And chiefly, now to consider that he had laid <hi>such a bait</hi> for us with our mortal enemy, to entrap us by fair fawning words, which by no meanes the Emperour would consent to do before by his authority, but rather to put us out of his Kingdomes, &amp;c. And imagining that he was a mighty Explorator upon us, for this <hi>Nuncius Apostolicus,</hi> and his adherents, that now he might perceive what we had done hitherto, what we were doing, and what we intended to do, and considering that he urged at our hands in answer to the former writing, wherein also lay a trap for either in not answering it, or refusing to grant some points of it, or in our consenting to the whole, this <hi>Nuneius</hi> would put matter against us to our great disadvantage. Thus being tormented in mind in my absence, how we might be rid of this <hi>Fr. Pucci,</hi> by quiet and honest meanes, I devised to write to this <hi>Nuncius</hi> to know if this writing were of his contriving onely, or of <hi>Pucci</hi> his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving onely, or joyntly, or if at the least the writing were according to his will, and offer unto us, and so to send him away; wherein he could make no refusal, I intending not to make him privy of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of my Letter; And in the mean space of his absence I hoped that some good way and better meanes would appear or fall out, whereunto we might trust, &amp;c. Thus I note my imaginations and discourses in the time of mv absence.</p>
                     <p>I returned to <hi>Erphurd July</hi> 13. <hi>hora</hi> 5. <hi>√† meridie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I found <hi>Fr. Pucci</hi> desirous to have answer to the foresaid writing, and very much perswading this Roman voyage, using arguments out of our actions, as that God said we should go to <hi>Rome,</hi> in a certain moneths space; That we ought to obey the Roman Bishop, and to love him, &amp;c. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and said, that he was not <hi>to urge God upon any his sayings to us,</hi> but to referre all to his most free disposition, his will was to be done and not ours, God was not bound to us, &amp;c. He answered ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vehemently, and often, that <hi>Deus est nobis obligatissimus, &amp; Deus dixit nos itur os Romam, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

now he had offended much more in curiosity, and half in conspiracy against us with our mortal enemy this <hi>Nuncius Apostolicus,</hi> upon whom he did fawn, in whose favour he is, who joyneth, counsaileth with him in our affaires, who dare prescribe us what we have to do in so weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires as our Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> who hath framed a bill, accusing us coufusedly of Heresie, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Magick, both falsely in one part, and dangerous to life, and infamous at the least in the other, and hereto requireth, urgeth, and in manner in God his name argueth by our actions past, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And therefore he hath separated himself from us, and hath set himself against us, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>With great vehemency he said, He intended nothing, but well to us, and <hi>was Explorator with this Nuncius</hi> for our behalf; We require none (said I) neither we need any, for God seeth all, and doth all, for our benefit, if we will constantly love and serve him; so be brief, he would seem to be worthy to be thought well of for his zealous good will and fidelity to us ward, in all his doings and sayings; The truth whereof God knoweth, to whom we commit the cause between him and us.</p>

                     <p>For the better ground of any manner of answer making hereunto I asked the same <hi>Fr.

He seemed to be unwilling now directly to affirm the <hi>Nuncius</hi> consent. We replyed that he had already told us that he had read it thrice over to the said <hi>Nuncius,</hi> and that he liked well of it, and did mervail that now he would make strange to affirm the same again, seeing I had now, (according to his purpose) written a plain and perfect humble answer to the same Letter, and much more matter, true and needful for this <hi>Nuncius</hi> to know. Well, said he, <hi>Eatenus ex ejus consensu est, si velitis ire</hi> Romam, <hi>ea praestare conabitur, quae in eisdem literis continentur,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>This day, <hi>Francis Pucci</hi> said to us both, how can you doubt of my fidelity toward you (whom I love as my own life,) and against this Monster of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom my chief desire is, and long <note place="margin">

                     <p>Therefore <hi>Fr.</hi> is false to the Pope, or us, or both, or rash, foolish, blind, &amp;c. And (as our spiritual Schoolmaster, divers times termeth him) leprous: Therefore I commit this his doings to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: But also it is greatly to be remembred and noted that he now also discoursed again with <hi>E. K.</hi> as concerning the Birth of Christ, that it could not be proved by the Scriptures, that Christ came of the line of <hi>David,</hi> unlesse he were begotten of the actual copulation of <hi>Joseph,</hi> with <hi>Mary,</hi> and said that, because it was the gift of the Holy Ghost, that at <hi>Joseph</hi> his first and onely carnal copulation with <hi>Mary,</hi> Christ was conecived; Therefore she was accounted (in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)

                     <p>It is evident hereby that this <hi>Pucci</hi> is very leprous, both in this Heresie (what other he is infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, God he knoweth) and also the former infidelity proved.</p>
                     <p>On Thursday 17 <hi>July Fr. Pucci</hi> entred his Voyage toward <hi>Prage</hi> with my Letter to the <hi>Nuncius Apostolicus,</hi> and with Letters to <hi>John Caerpio</hi> from <hi>E.

                     <p>Remember that <hi>Fr. Pucci,</hi> the morning before his going required of me our Letters Testimonial to our friends, of his fidelity toward us. What needeth that (said I) for as much as your deeds were as well known to them as to us, your own conscience to your self may serve abundantly. But our friends divers, who have warned us of you, and have marvelled why we would suffer you any longer in our house and company, would neither credit our Letters as yet in this case. And would also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us of light judgment, or great blindness to judg the cause between you and us.</p>
                     <p>But truly I observed in him, now, a more proud presuming over us then hitherto, before, when he was sore rebuked, for over-crowing us, so as he began to do.</p>

Ex quibus verbis nescio quid mihi visus sum adorari minus candidum, quam in re tanta, opus esset. Sed Dei esto judicium de ejus interiori sensu.

Canst thou hide thy self where I cannot see thee? or canst thou do that which lieth hid from me? Look again upon thy self, and consider what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and root thou hadst thy beginning in Nature: behold, they and their fathers are become the dust of the earth; even so shalt thou do. And even as of them is a straight account of life required, even so shall it be of thee: for, <hi>I that made thee, and gave thee breath,</hi> made thee partaker and user of my creatures, led thee in and out, gave thee the Sun to shine upon thee, and the <hi>Moon as the mother of your radical moisture.</hi> I that lifted thee up, either to the honour of a King, or Magistrate, and made thee a governour over thy brethren, will at last take a straight account of thee, how thou hast used thy self to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and where thou hast advanced my Name in such things as I have lent thee: And be right sure, that thou shalt pay, even the uttermost farthing.

Therefore while thou hast time and space, look, look up unto me; for I am <hi>the Well of comfort, and the God of peace;</hi> the true reward of righteousness to all such as faithfully love and trust me.</p>

K. if he would utterly refuse the same office</hi> (hitherto by him executed, and by him to be executed, until the seven actions general finished) And that the same Childe and Son, in the mean space (that is to say, between the day of the part of Action recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the end of the same: determined to be fourteen dayes after) should be exercised before God. I thereupon thinking that <hi>E. K.</hi> would, should, or best could instruct and direct the Childe in that exercise, did alwayes await, that <hi>E. K.</hi> would of himself call the Boy to that Exercise with him; and so much the rather, because he said, that <hi>he was very glad now that he should have a Witness of the things shewed and declared by spiritual Creatures:</hi> And that he would be more willing to do what should be so enjoyned to him to do, then if onely he himself did see, and that for divers causes. But when <hi>E. K.</hi> said to me, that I should exercise the Childe and not he, and that he would not, I thereupon appointed with my self to bring the Childe to the place, and to offer him, and present him to the service of Seeing and Skrying from God, and by Gods assignment, and of the time of fourteen dayes yet remaining, being the 15, 16, 17 dayes of <hi>April,</hi> and next before the 18 day, (the day assigned to end the Action in) to have the Childe exercised in them.

                  <p>Hereupon, <hi>Wednesday</hi> morning, (the 15 of this <hi>April</hi>) I brought the Childe to the holy Table, being in order of the furniture thereto belonging, and set before him the Stone in the frame, (my first sanctified Stone) and caused him on his knees, to say the foresaid Prayer. And I also praid to the Childs hearing, other Prayers to God for the purpose in hand: and at his coming to look and see in the Stone,</p>
                  <p>There appeared to him (as he judged) divers little square figures, with pricks, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other figures and lines, which I caused him with his own hand to imitate upon a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with pen and ink.</p>
                  <p>The lines were white, and some of the pricks also, but other of the pricks were black, as of ink.</p>
                  <p>Arth. Two old men with black beards, and with golden Crowns upon their heads, do appear. One is now gone: this holdeth his hands before him like a Maid.</p>

                  <p>Arth. Now in the place of those square marks, I see two Lions, the one very exactly, and gaping. About the upper brim of the Stone they appear: and the Lions feet be waxen greater and greater.</p>
                  <p>I see another man from the breast upward. I can see no hair on his head.</p>
                  <p>I see a great company of feet, and their garments skirts somewhat above their ankles: and they are like womens kirtles with gards about them.</p>
                  <p>I see another man without a doublet, in his shirt, and with a white Cloke about him, hanging his hands down by his sides.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Nothing else esteemed or judged to be shewn in the Stone, by the Childe, we cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that Exercise, and committed all to Gods mercies.</p>
                  <p>Œî. On <hi>Thursday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> I determined each of them two dayes that the Childe <note place="margin">

                  <p>There appear now two other, without Crowns: of the which one standeth whole before, and of the other I see nothing but the head, which standeth behinde the first.</p>

                  <p>I see no hands of him. I see nothing now.</p>

                  <p>The first man is here still. Now he hath no arms but a B before his doublet, but no lines, but only on each side two pricks in stead of the lines, thus: :</p>

Hereupon we were in great amazement and grief of minde, that so hard, and (as it, yet seemed unto me) so unpure a Doctrine, was popounded and enjoyned unto us of them, whom I alwayes (from the beginning hitherto) did <hi>judge and esteem, undoubtedly, to be good Angels:</hi> And had unto <hi>E K. offered my soul as a pawn,</hi> to discharge <hi>E. K.</hi> his credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, as the good and faithful Ministers of Almighty God. But now, my heart was sore afflicted upon many causes: And <hi>E. K.</hi> had (as he thought) now, a just and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause, to forsake dealing with them any more. As his prayer to God of a long time hath been (as in the former part of this Action may appear.)</p>
                     <p>After our going out of the Chappel, and at our being at dinner, when we four (whose heads so were united, in a pillar shewed, as is before set down, I found means to make some little declaration of our great grief (mine chiefly) now <hi>occasioned,</hi> either to try us, or really to be executed, in the common and indifferent using of Matrimonial Acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst any couple of us four: Which thing was strange to the women: And they hoped of some more comfortable issue of the cause. And so we left off.</p>
                     <p>After Dinner, as <hi>E. K.</hi> was alone, there appeared unto him little creatures of a cubit high: and they came to the Still where he had the spirit of Wine distilling over out of a <hi>Retorto:</hi> And one of them (whose name they expressed <hi>Ben</hi>) said that it was in vain so to hope for the best spirit of the Wine: And shewed him how to distill it, and separate it better. And moreover how to get oyl of the spirit of Wine, as it burned in the lamps: And began to ask <hi>E. K.</hi> what Country-man he was? And when he had answered an <hi>English-man,</hi> he asked then, how he came hither? he answered by Sea: Then said he, And who helped you to pass the marvellous great dangers of the Sea. And so took occasion to speak of the benefits which God had hitherto done for us, very many. And this <hi>Ben,</hi> said than among very many other things (as Mr. <hi>E.

                     <p>After all these, and many other things told me by the same Mr. <hi>E.K.</hi> we departed each <note place="margin">About 2 of the clock af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night <hi>

                     <p>Thereupon she fell a weeping and trembling for a quarter of an hour: And I pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified her as well as I could; and so, in the fear of God, and in believing of his Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, did perswade her that she shewed her self prettily resolved to be content <hi>for God his sake and his secret Purposes,</hi> to obey the Admonishment.</p>

                     <p>Œî. <hi>Note .....

But among divers apparitions he noted this of one that said unto him.</p>
                     <p>..... Joyn Enoch his Tables.</p>
                     <p>..... Give every place his running number.</p>

                     <p>Œî. Note: When <hi>E. K.</hi> had shewed me this Note, I by and by brought forth my book of <hi>Enoch</hi> his Tables, and found the four letters <hi>r T b d</hi> to be the four first letters of the four principal squares standing about the black Cross: and that here they were to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced otherwise than as I had set them. And in the first placing of them together, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I had doubt how to joyn them; for they were given apart each by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I found out the 4 Characters; saving they were inversed somewhat, and one of them closed: wherof I found none like, but very near. These Characters were of every square one.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I did take these numbers contained between the lines (some more and some fewer) to be words to be gathered out of the Table of letters: so many words as were distinct companies of numbers; it is to wit, 41.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon we began to number the squares wherein the letters stood in <hi>Enochs</hi> Tables as I had them, but we could not exactly finde the words, but somewhat near. Hereupon being tired, and desirous to know the sense of that Cypher, we left off till after supper, and then we assayed again: but we could not bolt it out, though we knew very near what was to be done by the instruction of <hi>a spiritual Voice,</hi> now and then helping us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the practise.</p>
                     <p>At length <hi>E. K. was willed to go down</hi> into his Chamber, and I did remain still at our Dineing Table till his return, which was within an hour or somewhat more. And at his return this he brought in writing.</p>

But thus much I do, to let thee understand, that thou mayest consider thy self to be a man: And beneath this understanding, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less thou submit <hi>all into the hands of God, for his sake;</hi> who else leaving you, all naked, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth in his creatures to his own glory.</p>

                     <p>..... I admonish you as the children of God, to consider your vocation, and the love of God towards you; and not to prefer your reason before the wisdome of the highest, whose mercy is so great towards you, <hi>That you are chosen from the number of men to walk with him, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his mysteries, and with all to execute his justice and praise throughout the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and people of the earth.</hi> Consider that if he finde you obstinate, the plagues of haynous sinners, and contemners of the gifts of God shall fall upon you, to your great overthrow: This is the last time of your trial.

                     <p>Œî. Thus, am I resolved, O Almighty God, as concerning the case, so hard to flesh and blood, to be resolved in, thus: And thus I desire, that we all four, might with one minde and consent, offer and present unto thee, this writing as a Vow, Promise, and Covenant, if it so please thy divine majesty to accept it.</p>
                     <p>WEE four (whose heads appeared under one Chrystalline Crown, in one pillar uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and inclosed) do most humbly and heartily thank thee, O Almighty God (our Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier) for all thy mercies and benefits hitherto received, in our persons, and in them that appertain unto us: And at this present, do faithfully and sincerely confess, and acknowledge, that thy profound wisdome <hi>in this most new and strange doctrine</hi> (among Christians) propounded, commended, and enjoyned unto us four only, is above our <hi>humane reason, and Christian profession to like of:</hi> For that in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew of words, it seemeth to us expresly to be contrary to the purity and chastity, which of us, and all Christians, thy followers, is exactly required. Notwithstanding, we will, herein, captivate, and tread under-foot all our humane timorous doubting of any inconvenience, which shall, or may fall upon us, or follow us in this world, or in the world to come, in respect or by reason of our imbracing of this Doctrine, listened unto, of us, as delivered from our true and living God, the Creator of heaven and earth; who only hath the true original power and Authority of sins releasing and discharging: And whose pardoning, and not imputing of fin unto us, through our lively faith in the most worthy merit, and precious blood of the Lamb Immaculate, shed for us, is and shall be our justification and salvation. We, therefore (according to blessed <hi>Raphael</hi> his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel last given) most humbly and sincerely require thy Divine Majesty, to accept this our Covenant with thee (for that, thy merciful promises made unto us, may be to us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and thy divine purposes in us and by us, may be furthered, and advanced and fulfilled.) <hi>That,</hi> as we acknowledge thy divine wisdome and grace offered unto us in this thy last mystical Admonishment: And dost most earnestly will us to <hi>accept the same, as lawful and just with thee;</hi> Which Admonishment standeth upon two parts: That is to wit, upon our true Christian charity spiritual between us four, and also upon the Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial licence and liberty, indifferently among us four <hi>to be used:</hi> So we the same four (which hereunto will subscribe) covenant with thy Divine Majesty, upon the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal respects before rehearsed, truly and unfainedly to accept and perform hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward amongst us four, in word, thought and deed, Christian charity, and perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and all that belongeth thereto: And as for the Matrimonial-like licence, and liberty,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49588:228"/>
we accept and allow of it, and promise unto thee (O our God) to fulfill the same, in such sort, as the godly are permitted to fulfill, and have been by divers testimonies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for, and by Divine doctrine willed to fulfill, in Matrimonial conversation, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thy motions and allurements (Matrimonial-like) shall draw and perswade any couple of us. Beseeching thee, as thou art the onely true Almighty and Everlasting God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, Thou wilt, in thy infinite mercies, not impute it unto us for sin, blindness, rashness, or presumption, being not accepted, done, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon carnal lust, or wanton concupiscence; But by the way of <hi>Abraham-like faith and obedience,</hi> unto thee, our God, our Leader, Teacher, Protector and Justifier, now and for ever. And hereunto we call the holy Heavens to be witnesses, for thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory (O Almighty God) and our discharge, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                           <p>I Edward Kelly by good and provident (according to the Laws and ordinances of God) determination and consideration in these former Actions, that is to say, appearings, shews made, and voyces uttered, by the within named in this Book, and the rest whatsoever Spirits have from the beginning thereof (which at large by the Records appeareth) not only doubted and disliked their insinuations and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine uttered, but also divers and sundry times (as coveting to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew and avoid the danger and inconvenience that might either by them, their selves, or the drift of their doctrine ensue, or to my indamagement divers wayes, happen) sought to depart from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises thereof: and withal boldly (as the servant of the Son of God) inveighed against them: urging them to depart, or render bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reason of their unknown and uncredible words and speeches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; and withall often and sundry times friendly exhorted the Right Worshipful Master JOHN DEE (the chief follower thereof) as also in the Records appeareth, to regard his souls health, the good proceeding of his wordly credit (which through Europe is great) the better maintenance to come of his wife and children, to beware of them, and withall to give them over: wherein although I friendly and brotherly laboured, my labour seemed to be lost and counsel of him despised, and withall was urged with replies to the contrary by him made, and promises, in that case, of the loss of his souls health, if they were not of God: Whereunto upon as it were some farther taste of them, or opinion grounded upon the frailty of zeal, he ceased not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to pawn unto me his soul, &amp;c. which his perswasions were the chief and onely cause of my this so long proceeding with them: And now also at this instant, and before a few dayes having manifest oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to think they were the servants of Sathan, and the children of darkness; because they manifestly urged and commanded in the name of God a Doctrine Damnable, and contrary to the Laws of God, his Commandements, and Gospel by our Saviour Christ as a Touchstone to us left and delivered, did openly unto them dislike their proceeding, and brotherly admonished the said Worshipful, and my good friend Mr. JOHN DEE to beware of them: And now having just occasion to determine what they were, to consider all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49588:229"/>
these things before mentioned by me, and wisely to leave them; and the rather because of themselves, they (as that by their own words appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) upon our not following that Doctrine delivered, gave unto us a <hi>Quietus est,</hi> or pasport of freedome: But the Books being brought forth <note n="*" place="margin">April 22. at night.</note>, after some discourse therein, after a day or two had, and their words perused spoken heretofore, did as it were (because of the possible verity thereof, <hi>Deo enim omnia sunt possibilia</hi>) gave us cause of further deliberation: so that thereby, I did partly of my self, and partly by the true meaning of the said Mr. DEE in the receiving of them, as from God; and after a sort by the zeal I saw him bear unto the true worship and glory of God to be (as that was by them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised) by us promoted, descend from my self, and condescend unto his opinion and determination, giving over all reason, or whatsoever for the love of God: But the women disliked utterly this last Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <note place="margin">The women.</note> and consulting amongst themselves gave us this answer, the former actions did nothing offend them but much comforted them: and therefore this last, not agreeing with the rest (which they think to be according to the good will and wholesome Law of God) maketh them to fear, because it expresly is contrary to the Commandement of God: And thereupon desiring God not to be offended with their ignorance, required another action for better information here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; in the mean, vowing, fasting, and praying, Mrs. DEE hath cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with God to abstain from the eating of fish and flesh untill <note place="margin">An actiou required by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> his Divine Majesty satisfie their mindes according to his Laws esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, and throughout all Christendome received. To this their request of having an action, I absolutely answer, that my simplicity before the Highest is such as I trust will excuse me: And because the summe of this Doctrine, given in his name, doth require obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which I have (as is before written) offered, I think my self dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged: And therefore have no farther cause to hazzard my self any more in any action. Wherefore I answer that if it be lawful for them to call this Doctrine in question, it is more lawful for me to doubt of greater perril; considering that to come where we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely answered were folly, and might redound unto my great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. Therefore beseeching God to have mercy upon me, and to satisfie their Petitions, doubts and vows, I finally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that I will from this day forward meddle no more herein. 22. of April, 1587.</p>

                     <p>Œî. Not long, lo, there appeared a great flame of fire in the principal Stone, (both standing on the Table before <hi>E. K.</hi>) which thing though he told me, I made no end of my Prayer to God. And behold, suddenly one seemed to come in at the south window of the Chappel, right against <hi>E.

Then after, the man that came in at the window seemed to have his nether parts in a cloud, and with spred-abroad arms to come toward <hi>E. K.</hi> At which sight he shrinked back somewhat, and then that Creature took up between both his hands <hi>the stone and frame of gold,</hi> and mounted up away as he came.. <hi>E. K.</hi> catched at it, but he could not touch it. At which thing being so taken away, and at the sight thereof <hi>E.

                     <p>E. K. From the beginning of this our coming, there appeared a purple Circle as big as a star in the Circumference of the holy Stone, which yesterday was brought again: And that it should so be, Madimi had forewarned E. K. when she shewed it unto him, when also she gave the prints of the letters of the backside of the bottome of the gold frame of it.</p>
                     <p>..... E. K. There appeareth here a great man all in bright <note place="margin">Equus albus</note> harness sitting upon a white horse: he hath a spear all fiery in his left hand, he now putteth into his right hand: he hath a long sword by his side: he hath also a target hanging on his back, it seemeth to be of steel: It hangeth from his neck by a blue lace; it cometh up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him as high as the top of his head. The horse is milk white, all studded with white: a very comely horse it is. The man is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat harness, the top of his helmet hath a sharp form.</p>
                     <p>Upon his Target, are many Cherubins, as it were painted in Circles: there is one in the middle: About it as a Circle with six in it, and then a Circle with eight, and then a great Circle with ten in it, and in the greatest are twenty; and about the Circle of twenty <note place="margin">Sum.</note> are seven parts: at each of which points is a Cherubin; Their faces be like burning gold, their wings be more brighter and as it were their wings coming over their heads do <note place="margin">Cherubin.</note> not touch together. His horse is also harnished before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. The horse legs behind are harnished as with boots mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilously contrived, for defence as it were of his hinde legs.</p>
                     <p>E. K. He is ridden away, he seemeth to ride through a great field.</p>
                     <p>E. K. Here is now come Madimi.</p>
                     <p>E. K. She is gone into the field, that way which he rode.</p>
                     <p>E. K. Here is another, like a woman all in green.</p>
                     <p>E. K. Here cometh another woman: All her attire is like beaten gold; she hath on her forehead a Cross chrystal, her neck and breast are bare unto under her dugs: She hath a girdle of beaten gold slackly buckled unto her with a pendant of gold down to the ground.</p>

My feet are swifter than the winds, and my hands are sweeter than the morning dew. My garments are from the beginning, and my dwelling place is in my self.

Now <hi>John Dee,</hi> I <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> am n w come at Gods pleasure, and at his commandment to speak with thee, and make known unto thee as far forth as in my power lieth to speak God hath sent me to declare unto thee: the cause of thy desire now at this time, <hi>John Dee,</hi> as thou art an earthly man., if thou dost desire to have help from God of such things as earthly men cannot he without while they have time here in this mortal life, thou desirest to have knowledge as concerning things hid, the which I <hi>Raphael</hi> have no delight, neither pleasure in speaking of any such earthly matter, or earthly cases. But my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in the Almighty, and in his wisdome. But notwithstanding at this request, and thy inward desire in God to be certified of this treasure, the which these two men whom thou knowest do speak of, they ever had a time appointed of God for it, and it was not used accordingly as they should have done. Now this second time, because you have a desire to have help and knowledge at the hands of the Almighty, I <hi>Raphael</hi> do command thee and those men whom thou knowest, that they shall not intermeddle, or to take it in hand before the tenth day of <hi>January</hi> be past, f r if they do, they shall not prevail, for that is a time that God hath best appointed for the said purpose, and for the quiet enjoying of it; so when that day is past, then let them in the name of God enter into that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>. And if they will be such men as they ought for to be, and as Gods will is that they should be, to deal faithfully and truly one with the other in deed and in word, God will then bless their good purpose, and bring it to their head when they shall take in hand to open the earth, God will presently at that instant then suffer their good purpose to take effect, and the matter to be effected and had, so that they shall not be put off, if they shall heare or see any thing that they shall dislike, but safely to stand in the <hi>hope,</hi> and craving at Gods hand to have that good help to be a warrant between them, and all hurt and danger whatsoever may behappen, and so overcome. I say, If they will faithfully pray unto God with their whole trust in God, God will bless their good success, if they be otherwise, then as good never stir, and their good success will be against them. So I <hi>Raphael</hi> have made kuown unto thee Gods purpose in this thy request.</p>

Thou shalt take such course .... thou mayest obtain it again, and when thou hast it, thou shalt put it into the same chest again, and commit it into the custody and keeping of thy very friend <hi>John Pontoys,</hi> and he shall, and will deal faithfully and friendly with thee in keeping the same until such time as by that ... the which thou knowest is promised unto thee, that thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the perfect understanding of the hid knowledge and secrecie of God that is not as yet made known unto thee, and ..... as hath been said, so shalt thou have such wisdome delivered unto thee by me <hi>Raphael</hi> that shall come in such ... and order as hath been late made known unto thee for thy good in such short and speedy time to be performed, and so thus much I have made known unto thee, as God hath in store for thee to be performed. Thus much I have now said, and given thee cunning to keep it in such maner as I have spoken, or else thou wilt be disappointed of that, and ... it will hide such purpose as God will have come to pass, so in his mighty power command me to come. I have for this matter finished; If thou have any thing speedily, ask in ... for I am to depart.</p>

And now to come to the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to lot thee to understand why thou hadst not <hi>thus</hi> these rare gifts and promises performed unto thee, it was the will f God to keep them away, and to suffer the heart of thy supreme head and governour, under God, to be hardned against thee, that thou art no better account made of unto him, but to be such an one that doth deal with Devils and by Sorcery, as you commonly term them Witchcraft: and who doth, and who hath informed him, to be thus evil and hardly informed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, but only the Devil, and by the hatred of thy secret enemy whom thou knowest <hi>(Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> I mea) and all malice and enemies that he can by his Devils, <hi>Maserien, Hermeloe,</hi> the four wicked ones, the which are accounted the four Rulers of the Air, whose names be <hi>Ories, Egym, Paynim,</hi> and <hi>Mayrary:</hi> They be the Devils that he doth deal withall, that he through their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing and his, he thinketh to be pleasant and good wisdom that he receiveth at their hands; <hi>That he and his Devils do seek thy overthrow in all good things, and doth and shall,</hi> so far forth as God will suffer them, seek all the malice and hindrance in all good causes <hi>to be done to thy good.</hi> Therefore now <hi>John Dee</hi> I am to let thee to understand plainly what Gods will and his great purpose is to have thee to do, although it may seem hard to thy good liking, considering as thou dost think, the weakness of thy body, and course of age: yet notwithstanding, that same God that hath been thy protector and keeper until this present time of years, that same merciful God shall keep thee, and make thee able to perform things that shall be made known unto thee; for God will not bestow such rare gifts as I have before said, amongst those which be unworthy of such great blessings from the Almighty. For God will not bestow Pearls amongst those that will not believe nor understand that God hath any such blessings to bestow upon men: for I say unto thee, <hi>John Dee,</hi> that if God should or would bestow those blessings upon thee, even at this present, or at any time <hi>to be shortly performed</hi> and delivered unto thee: Then, except that thou shouldst make all things plainly known of Gods secrets delivered unto thee, unto thy supreme head under God here upon earth, and likewise thy enemy to be partaker in these secrets and great gifts of God, if thou wouldst not perform as much unto them, as God should give wisdom unto thee, therein, thy life would and should, by the envy and malice of those wicked ones, and by thy great enemy thou shouldst speedily be cut off from this life, but God will not have it so. So if thou wilt do as God shall command thee by this message, <hi>thou shalt have all these</hi> messages, promises and wisdom, both for the <hi>Philosophers Stone,</hi> the <hi>book of S. Dunstans,</hi> the secret wisdom of that <hi>Jewel</hi> that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, as thou knowest, in what manner it is plainly known unto thee.</p>
                  <p>So now it is the will of God to <hi>suffer thy supreme Head his heart to be hardned against thee;</hi> and likewise for thy great enemy for his wicked instructions against thee, God doth suffer it so to be, even as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his heart was hardned against the children of God, so standeth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against thee with them. It is the will of God so to suffer it to their great account that they shall have to make, when it shall please the Almighty that that time shall be, that they must render unto God their accounts. Now <hi>John Dee</hi> it is the will of the Almighty to send me <hi>Raphael</hi> to deliver unto thee this <hi>Message, the which will seem unto thee to be very hard:</hi> yet as thou art the servant of God, and one whom God doth favour and love (although the world by wicked enemies doth hate thee) <hi>willingly and obediently follow</hi> that course the which God in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies at this time shall make known unto thee.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>John Dee,</hi> I am <hi>Raphael</hi> that last appeared unto you, and I through Gods good pleasure did set down and made known unto thee, what pretended course God would have thee to enter into, and his will is such, that so far forth, and so speedily as thou canst, to proceed in it, because <hi>that God hath great service for thee to do,</hi> when thou shalt be there placed.</p>
               <p>And now I do let thee understand, that as concerning <hi>Eccleston</hi> his suit and matter that I did <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston.</hi>

And so in the Name of the Highest for this I do now end, giving praise to the Almighty. And furthermore, <hi>John Dee,</hi> in few words, for thy sake, <hi>If this Window by his</hi>

For, <hi>John Dee,</hi> God hath declared, and made manifestly known unto thee at my last appearing, what service God would use thee unto, and all such purposes that were the last time spoken of, shall be by Gods favour and his merciful good gift performed unto thee: <hi>and fear thou not, but God will safely help and preserve thy body in thy Journey, to that end, that thou shouldest be in that place wherein thou mightest have time to enter into all such service as God hath by me made known unto thee.</hi> For, <hi>John Dee, such hath Gods mercies been in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked men to prevail against thee, and they have and do make a scorn of thee here in this thy Native Countrey:</hi> So it is with thee as it was with Christ and his Apostles, being most cruelly used in their own Native Countreys; so <hi>John Dee,</hi> God hath suffered those wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men to <hi>pluck thee down in worldly affairs,</hi> the which should be maintenance for thee and for thine, and without such maintenance man cannot be without, while be is here in this vale of Misery. Such wicked men have most cruelly used thee, even as <hi>Job</hi> by Gods sufferance, who suffered the Devil to prevail against him: yet Gods mercies be so great unto thee, that although they (most wickedly) have robbed thee of thy possession, yet God would not suffer those wicked ones by any of their malicious practices to prevail in any wise <hi>to hurt thy body,</hi> as <hi>Jobs</hi> was: For if they (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> their wicked purposes) could have wrought such cruelty against thee, thou hadst not been a man living here upon earth until this time. So <hi>John Dee,</hi> thou dost know who is thy mortal enemy, <hi>who, rules next unto your earthly King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Œî.</p>
                  <p>Why thou maist well know, for I have made it known before time unto thee, that he is not thy friend, though thou hast not offended him in any wise. Therefore, because that this thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey is not a place fit for Gods <hi>purposes in his wisdome to be bestowed upon thee here,</hi> Therefore at my last Message, God did send me to make known unto thee, whether he would have thee to go, that there thou <hi>mightst be a man; and that man, whom God hath appointed to make his Wisdome known:</hi> for thou art that man whom God hath chosen, that (accordingly as it was said yesterday) <hi>that no mortal man in flesh, but onely</hi> Enoch, <hi>had or shall have the like wisdome made known, plainly to be understood by any man,</hi> or thou thy self shalt understand and receive at the hands of the Almighty. Therefore it is his will and purpose of God, that he would have thee in that Countrey, for this thy <hi>Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is not worthy of gifts that thou shalt receive at the hands of God, to come, and to be made known unto those which be not worthy of such great gifts of Gods wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to come amongst those that be unworthy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, <hi>John Dee,</hi> in all these matters the which in favour at this time made known unto thee, the chief and greatest cause of this my coming unto thee, is to make the matter plainly known, that God in his mercies would have thee with all diligence that thou canst possibly, to haste thee to that Countrey where God doth command thee, and at my last being here thou
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49588:241"/>
knowest what was my Message, therefore do thy diligence to fulfil it as thou canst, and God will put his great helps unto thee, in strengthning of thy body, and otherwise, which shall be to thy good. And thou being once in that place where God would have thee to be, thou shouldst well perceive and plainly understand, that God will most mercifully work with thee for thy good in <hi>performing all such promises,</hi> the which hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <hi>John Dee,</hi> I do put thee in remembrance, that whereas thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> say, that thou hadst a portion of money <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> thee from the <hi>Emperour</hi> unto thee; I tell thee, that the Devil in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the heart <hi>of one of thy enemies</hi> (Cook <hi>I mean</hi>) <hi>did seek some wayes by his false important ill speeches, in most false manner, unto one that did in somewhat let the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to understand, what he had most falsely, to thy discredit (as he thought) to hinder thee, that thou shouldst not come to any help or credit at the Emperours hand.</hi> But <hi>John Dee,</hi> be of good comfort, <hi>The Emperour of all Emperours will be thy comfort,</hi> and aid thee, and evermore put down thy enemies, that the Emperour (that thou shouldst have received that portion o) it shall be so with thee, that he <hi>shall have more need of thee,</hi> in such wisdome as God shall deliver unto thee; for thou shalt have no need of him, but onely to keep good will and friendship betwixt him and thee, in shewing thy self friendly unto him, as God shall hereafter give thee plainly to understand.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>John Dee,</hi> I have made known unto thee what Gods will is in this my message. This is the greatest and the most principal cause, why God hath sent me unto thee at this present time. And now I have through Gods mercies delivered this his Commandment unto thee: and for this I have now said and finished.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Blessed be the Almighty God, now and for ever.</p>
                  <p>Gladly I would have understood how much the portion was which the Emperour would have sent me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Dee,</hi> let it go, and speak no farther of it: for thou maist <hi>be joyful,</hi> whereas it is said unto thee, that <hi>he should have need of thee,</hi> and not thou of him. Therefore reason no more in that matter.</p>
                  <p>Œî. As concerning Mr. <hi>Eccleston.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Dee,</hi> in few words I answer thee, He hath dealt with the parties in those affairs, but the chief party will not, as yet, yield any thing to be made known, but doth stubbornly and stoutly stand in his own defence: And Gods Creatures <hi>have wrought with him,</hi> and nothing he will (as ye) yield unto, except that those Creatures should deal so cruelly with him, as it were to pull him apieces: this is his wicked stubbornness. But God will <hi>bring the matter to light;</hi> but <hi>Eccleston</hi> hath not dealt so in the matter as he might have done, he is too too slack in his own cause. Therefore if the fault be in him, then do not blame the Creatures of God. For God could <hi>(as you very well do know it) command that said Treasure to be brought: but he will not have it so to be,</hi> because it shall come by other means among men: So God hath a great care and purpose to do all for your good, to keep matters <hi>out of blame and slander</hi> of the world, as it might come to passe, if it should come by any other wayes, but by this plot which is laid down to decline. And when it is the will of God that it shall be delivered, God will so perform it, if man will do as he <hi>should do, in all reverend manner towards God-ward.</hi> And so now I let you to perceive, and to know, that it is not as yet obtained.</p>
                  <p>Œî. Whether hath the other party confessed any thing?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Raph.</hi> He hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> as yet yielded openly: but he hath in secret manner perswaded his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the matter might be made known unto <hi>Eccleston,</hi> in confessing of all the whole matter, but the other will not yet yield: but it were better for him to yield at the first, then to tarry any longer, the lesse would be his punishment from God therein. And so I let you to understand, that you shall give God his time to work in that matter at his pleasure, and then shall it be to the good of the owner, and of you likewise. And now I have said.</p>
                  <p>Œî. As concerning the bereaving me of my own goods, I would gladly understand who hath my silver double gilt bell-Salt, and other things here of late conveyed from mee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Raph. John Dee,</hi> This is the will and purpose of God to command thee, although thou dost suffer wrong because thy goods be so taken away from thee, yet Gods will is such, that he will have thee to be a peace-maker in this cause: <hi>for it is past help to have it again:</hi> But as thou art a mortal father, so use that <hi>matter as a father, for thy son had it,</hi> although he would not, neither will confess it. And likewise for such things of late missing about this house, thou shalt hereafter as plainly know who had them, and how they were gone, as thou dost plainly understand for thy Salt, but thou shalt stay and proceed no further, till such time as I <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> shall speak further of it, for God will have all things to be done well, and to his best liking. So for that I have now said.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49588:241"/>
                  <p>Œî.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Dee,</hi> it is in the hands of God and his power to send thee such helps as thou dost seek of the <hi>Treasure to be brought</hi> unto thee, but God will not have it so to be, <hi>the while thou art in this place (England</hi> I mea) for God will not have thee to come into any disdain, or slander might take some advantage against them, but be content with that little that can be made of thy right in the Colledge matters. And furthermore, thou shalt see that God will send thee <hi>soon</hi> some such small helps by man, that thou shalt have some feeling of help, to help thee whither thou shouldst go; and therefore I <hi>Raphael</hi> have now said.</p>
                  <p>Œî .... John Pontoys.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Dee,</hi> be not too much inquisitive, but what shall be best to your liking in any good cause what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever you or he shall think good to be done for your good, God will put his assistance and help that you shall perceive Gods favour therein. And thus much I have said: at Gods commandment I came, and so on his mercifull goodnesse, and his power, I must presently depart.</p>
                  <p>Œî ... <hi>Bartholomews</hi> request of <hi>George Sherman</hi> his earnest oft and dreaming of Treasure to be under the foundation of the wall called <hi>De la pry</hi> wall, a Nunry in times past with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half a mile of <hi>Northampton,</hi> Sir <hi>William Tate</hi> his house is within that wall in three parts.</p>
                  <p>That man may lawfully have it, if he take heed in the breaking of the the three places, for <note place="margin">500.</note> it is for the greatest part under the bottom of the wall, and many roots of thorns and trees that will let and hinder the working for it, if he do not <hi>work much as slope as you can,</hi> to go under the roots, the which he may well and lawfully do. So doing, he may well obtain his purpose; and <note place="margin">300.</note> now you have plainly understood the truth.</p>
                  <p>The one part of that <hi>Treasure</hi> was laid by an old Nun, that was of that house, at that time, and one that was her brother, and the other was laid even at the same time, that the same travel the which you took the last day saving one, to know of that battel, it was hid at the same time by one of the Lords that was there killed, and so it hath remained ever since, the one place more easier to come at then the other, but with the favour of God, and in his mercy, <hi>that good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be desired</hi> at parties hand, it may be had and compassed <hi>by the said party.</hi> And so now I have made the matter known unto you. And now in the name of the Almighty, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God, at whose will and pleasure I came, so now I depart in Gods peace. The mercies of God be upon you, both for this life, and for that which is to come, his name be glorifyed for evermore <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

                  <p>Œî .... As concerning Mr. <hi>John</hi> of the Isle of <hi>Man,</hi> his pitiful case hath moved my compassion.</p>

                     <hi>Raph. .... John Dee,</hi> for thy sake he shall know his good Angel, but let it not be with him hereafter to have a pride in mind, that God hath made known unto him his good angel, for no man upon the face of the earth can have a better then he hath, for <hi>Uriel</hi> is his appointed Angel from his birth to this day, and so shall continue with him to the appointed time, that God will take his life away in separating his soul from his body, for <hi>Uriel</hi> hath been under God his deliverer forth of many dangers, and so he shall be his defence under God to his lifes end. And for this, I have made the matter plainly known unto you. Procede.</p>

As concerning the man and the Treasure, I am desirous to know whether he will be content to assign his title to <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> upon some portion thereof delivered unto him; and what other he hath made acquainted with the matter; and whether it may not by Gods good liking be set up without digging.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Raph .... John Dee,</hi> in all this I hear thee, and I know thine intent herein.

If he will not be ordered in such sort and good councel as I <hi>Raphael</hi> shall give unto this <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew</hi> at that time, that then he shall have no part of it, but I certifie you that he will be ruled; but onely the others, which I have made known unto you, they will not come to so good course in the matter as he will. Therefore let it rest, I will direct <hi>Bartholomew</hi> in the matter which shall be to his good, or else it shall not come to his hand, the which you have to know of. And for this, now I have said.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Dee,</hi> it is the will and purpose of God, that it shall come by breaking of the ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that God will have all things done well, that no discord may break out betwixt the parties hereafter. And so now in Gods name I have said.</p>
