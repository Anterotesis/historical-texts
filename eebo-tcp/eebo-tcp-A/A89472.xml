         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The MANIFEST of the County of KENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the <hi>innocency</hi> of our <hi>intentions,</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> of all our <hi>undertakings,</hi> may more clearly
appear to all men of <hi>uncorrupt underſtandings,</hi> &amp; <hi>hearts</hi> not made <hi>too ſervile</hi> by the long &amp;
odious cuſtome <hi>of oppreſsion:</hi> VVe the <hi>Knights, Gentlemen, and Franchlins</hi> of the <hi>County
of Kent,</hi> the moſt <hi>free people</hi> of this <hi>late flouriſhing Nation;</hi> by the <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>valour</hi> of
our <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> delivered from the <hi>Laws</hi> of a <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and to theſe late daies of unhappy <hi>confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>diſtraction</hi> enjoying the ſame, through all the <hi>Reignes</hi> of the moſt glorious and victorious
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>this Nation:</hi> Doe hereby declare and manifeſt to all the world, That our
aſſembling and meeting together at this time, is no other then for a vindication of our ſelves and
purpoſes, from the ſcandall, and aſperſions of <hi>the Committee of this County;</hi> who upon occaſion of a
<hi>Petition</hi> in behalf of <hi>the County of Kent,</hi> aſſented and ſubſcribed to by <hi>the Grand Jurie</hi> at the <hi>Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Judges</hi> upon an eſpeciall Commiſsion of <hi>Oyer and Terminer</hi> executed at the <hi>Caſtle of
Canterbury</hi> the 11. of <hi>May</hi> laſt, for the ſaid County; have not onely made <hi>Orders againſt</hi> the
ſame, and commanded them <hi>publickly</hi> to be <hi>read in all Churches,</hi> ſentencing and condemning the
ſaid <hi>Petition</hi> and all the <hi>Abettors</hi> thereof: and have ſummoned the <hi>Troups of Horſe,</hi> and <hi>forces of
Foot</hi> of this <hi>County</hi> for <hi>ſuppreſsion</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Petition:</hi> which tends not only to the <hi>ſuppreſsion</hi> of the
<hi>Liberty,</hi> even of the moſt <hi>enſlaved perſons</hi> of the world; but alſo, as much as in them lies, ſhew an
endeavour upon any cauſes whatſoever, which ſuits not with their humours, to over-awe the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of other men, and upon oppoſition therein think they have ground enough to take away the
<hi>lives</hi> and <hi>fortunes,</hi> or both, of their ſaid oppoſers.</p>
            <p>In conſideration of which, and that now the ſaid <hi>Committee</hi> finding themſelves unable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
this <hi>County in bloud,</hi> have made their addreſſe to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> &amp; <hi>Army;</hi> and make ſtrange
and malicious repreſentations of our purpoſes, thereby diſcovering nothing ſo much as their own
pride &amp; malice. VVe the ſaid <hi>Knights, Gentlemen,</hi> &amp; <hi>Free-Yeomen</hi> of the <hi>County of Kent</hi> do herein
appeale to all the world to judge, If it were not high time for us to put our ſelves into <hi>a poſture of
Defence;</hi> and doe further declare, that we will proſecute our ſaid <hi>Petition</hi> with our <hi>lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,</hi>
not doubting of a fair <hi>reception</hi> from the <hi>two Houſes of Parliament;</hi> whom we know to have
been inſtigated againſt us by the ſaid <hi>Committee:</hi> And therefore ſaving to our ſelves the <hi>enlarging</hi>
of the ſaid <hi>Petition,</hi> we have reſolved to charge the ſaid Committee with encreaſing the <hi>Taxes</hi> of
this County above the due proportions, and onely for maintaining their owne private luxury &amp;
pride; with uſurping a power over the Eſtates &amp; fortunes of the <hi>Free-men</hi> of this County not
granted to them by any power of Parliament; with a <hi>tyrannicall</hi> &amp; imbitter'd ſpirit naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted
in them, and expreſſed by words &amp; actions, all along the exerciſe of this power, (which
makes them unfit for rule) to the exaſperating of the peoples hearts into all animoſity, &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
of all love and peace in this County: which alſo hath been followed to that height of
perſecution, That had not the <hi>two Houſes</hi> given a ſtop to their <hi>exorbitant proceedings,</hi> we had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
much more under the torment of theſe mens projected deſignes: wherein we acknowledge
our ſelves alſo to have been ſecured in the temper and moderation of the <hi>Houſes.</hi> VVe have no
more to ſay or do, but to defend our ſelves, till we <hi>can have a right underſtanding of our purpoſes and
actions before the Houſes;</hi> In the mean time, <hi>we ſhall looke upon all oppoſition, as the provocation of a
conſcious &amp; enraged Committee:</hi> &amp; in reſpect of the <hi>Invaſion</hi> lately made upon the <hi>perſons</hi> of our <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi>
we <hi>think fit</hi> not to lie at the mercy of Souldiers; but to have refuge to our Armes, from
which no <hi>threats,</hi> or face of Souldiery ſhall drive us, knowing well the juſtice of our cauſe,
and the temper of our owne <hi>hearts.</hi>
