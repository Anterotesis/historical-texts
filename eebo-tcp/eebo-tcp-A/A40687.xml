            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the Resurrection of our blessed Saviour by three several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, foretold and now fulfilld. The Law saith, <hi>in the mouth of two or three witnesses the truth shall be established.</hi> Two may, Three must do the deed; Two make full measure, <hi>Three make measure pressed down and running over.</hi> And such doth the Apostle give us in the proof of this point.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The first place he citeth <hi>Psalm</hi> 2.7. <hi>Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee:</hi> The second, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 55.3. <hi>I will give you the sure mercies of</hi> David: The last, <hi>Psalm</hi> 16.11. <hi>Thou shalt not suffer thy holy one to see corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It is observable, that the same Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.31. is also alledged, expounded, applyed and pressed by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to prove the Resurrection of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy uncorrupted. See here the holy Harmony betwixt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63783:4"/>
the two Apostles. Though <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had a short and sharp contest at <hi>Antioch, Galat.</hi> 2.11. where <hi>Paul withstood him to his face</hi>; yet here their hearts, and hands, and tongues, meet lovingly together in the improving of the same portion of Scripture: Both of them shew first <hi>negatively,</hi> how it could not litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be meant of <hi>David,</hi> (whose body was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and his Sepulchre remained amongst them unto that day) and therefore <hi>positively</hi> must be meant mystically and prophetically of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Now as I am charitably confident that all who hear me this day, are satisfied and assured herein, That our Saviours body saw no corruption, so give me leave to be jealous over you with a godly jealousie, for fear some mistake the cause of this his incorruptibility, and bottom it on a false foundation. Some perchance may impute it to the shortness of the time he lay in his grave, being but a day and two pieces of a day, <hi>numero rotundo,</hi> though <hi>currente stilo</hi> they commonly be called and counted three daies. These do <hi>ponere non causam pro causa</hi>; for the time was long enough in that hot Countrey, to cause putrefaction, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that our Saviours body was much bruised and broken with the whips, nails, and spears, (besides the effusion of much blood) which would the sooner have invited corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Others perchance put the untaintedness of his body upon the account of the great quantity of <hi>Myrrh</hi> and <hi>Aloes (about an hundred pound weight)</hi> and other precious spices, wherewith <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus, Iohn</hi> 19.39. imbalmed it. This also is an unsound opinion; for all the spices of <hi>Arabia</hi> cannot secure a corpse from putrifying, though they may preserve it that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63783:4"/>
such putrifaction shall not be noysom to others in the ill savour thereof, not keeping it from <hi>corrupting,</hi> but from <hi>offending.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The true reason is this, Though Christs soul was parted from his body, (and where disposed of, God only knows, during his remainder in the grave) yet the union with the Deity was never dissolved, which priviledged his corpse from corruption. So that had it been possible (which was impossible, as is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Gods promise and pleasure) for his corpse to have lien in the grave till this instant, they had been perpetuated in an intire estate, whilst it is true of <hi>David</hi> as it is in the Text, <hi>after he had served his own generation by the will of God, he fell on sleep, and was laid unto his Fathers, and saw corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Observe in the words four principal parts;
<list>
                  <item>1. What a generation is.</item>
                  <item>2. What it is to serve ones generation.</item>
                  <item>3. How <hi>David</hi> served his own generation.</item>
                  <item>4. How we after his example are to serve ours.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Of these in order, and first we will consider what a generation is.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
               <hi>A Generation is a company of men and women, born, living and dying much about the same time:</hi> I say, much about the same time; for seven years, under or over, sooner or later, breaketh no squares herein, but that the said persons are reducible to the same generation. Thus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.17. <hi>All the Generations from</hi> Abraham <hi>to</hi> David, <hi>are fourteen Generations: and from</hi> David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the carrying away into</hi> Babylon, <hi>are fourteen Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: &amp; from the carrying away into</hi> Babylon <hi>unto Christ, are fourteen Generations.</hi> Now all generations are not of equal extent; so admirable the Longevitie of those
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63783:5"/>
before the Flood, compared to our short lives, since God for our sins hath contracted the <hi>cloth</hi> of our life to <hi>three score and ten years,</hi> and all is but a course <hi>List</hi> which is more then that measure, <hi>Psalm</hi> 90.10. <hi>And if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow, for it is soon cut off, and we flie away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> It is remarkable, that Three Generations are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies at the same time on foot in the world; namely,
<list>
                  <item>1. The Generation rising.</item>
                  <item>2. The Generation shining.</item>
                  <item>3. The Generation setting.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For should God clear the earth of all men at once, mankind could not be recruted but by miracle; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, neither humane Arts nor Sciences; nor could the Scripture hansomly be handed and delivered from one Generation to another. God therefore of his goodness doth so order it, that rather then any empty Interval should happen betwixt them, one Generation should fold and lap over another. These three degrees were most visibly conspicuous in the Levites, which till five and twenty years of age, were <hi>learning Levites,</hi> thence till fifty, <hi>acting Levites,</hi> (as being then in the strength of their age) imployed in the portage of the Tabernacle, and after fifty, had a Writ of ease from bodily labour, though they may be presumed to be busied in the teaching of others.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Pass we now to explain what it is to serve our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. To serve it, is to discharge our conscience according to Gods will in his word, to our superiours, equals, inferiours, all persons to whom we stand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63783:5"/>
in our generation. And the more eminent the person is in Church and State, the more are his refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences multiplyed, and the more publick and ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the service is which he is to perform. Nor must it be forgotten, that <hi>David</hi> was a King, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it was proper for him to rule and command his own Generation; and yet it is said, he served the same. Princes are not priviledged by their greatness, only to tyranize over others, but are accountable to God, how well they discharge their duty to all such to whom they are respected.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Proceed we to see how <hi>David</hi> served his generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he did in an eight-fold capacity. First as a dutifull son to his Father and Mother. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.3. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>went thence to</hi> Mizpeh <hi>of</hi> Moab, <hi>and he said unto the King of</hi> Moab, <hi>Let my Father and Mother, I pray thee come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me. And he brought them before the King of</hi> Moab, <hi>and they dwelt with him all the while that</hi> David <hi>was in the hold.</hi> The case was thus, <hi>David</hi> foresaw that the tempest of <hi>Sauls</hi> fury would fall full heavy on his Fathers family; he soresaw also that though he himself might be alwaies on the <hi>wing,</hi> hunted from place to place as a Patridge on the Mountain, yet his aged P<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rents could not keep pace with his suddain, uncertain, unseasonable, late and long removeance, and therefore as a dutifull son he provided for them a private place of peaceable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Secondly he served his generation as a very loving Brother, witness the dangerous visit (which at his Fathers command) he gave his Brethren in the Camp, (when <hi>Goliah</hi> was in the field) victualling
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63783:6"/>
them with all necessary provision, on the same token that he received nothing for his pains save a jeer from <hi>Eliab</hi> his eldest brother. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.28. <hi>Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down, that thou mightest see the battle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Thirdly he served his generation as a kind and carefull Husband I will not excuse his Polygamie, having many wives at once, nor dare I flatly condemn it, God conniving thereat in the antient Patriarchs. However <hi>David</hi> cannot be charged with want of love amongst his store of wives. Once I confess he made a tart and sharp return to <hi>Michal,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.21. mocking him for dancing before the Ark.

Once when he had <hi>Saul</hi> in the Cave, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. and his heart smot him for being over-bold with Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, though he did but cut off a skirt of his Garment. Again, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.12. <hi>when he found</hi> Saul <hi>asleeping, and (if so disposed) might have left him a sleeping,</hi> till the sound of the last Trumpet should summon him to awake. A surly General walking the Round, and finding one of his Centinels asleep, nailed him with his spear to the earth, and excused his act with this jest, (whether witty or cruel, let others judge) <hi>Dormientem inveni, Dormientem reliqui; Sleeping I found him, and sleeping I left him. David</hi> might have done the like, especially seeing <hi>Abisha</hi> (not to say Providence) impelled him thereunto, but would not (as having a principle of piety within him, which remonstrated against such proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.)</p>

I confess his son <hi>Absolom</hi> taxed him with neglect of the affairs of State, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.3. that no man was deputed by him to hear the causes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress the grievances of his oppressed subjects. But what saith our plain proverb, <hi>Ill will never speaks well.</hi> And therefore I listen to <hi>Absoloms</hi> words as to a loud Libell; and we should be no less injurious to our own judgements then to <hi>Davids</hi> innocence, in giving cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to a proud ambitious son, against an holy and humble Father.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Eightly and lastly, <hi>David</hi> served his generation as a gracious Saint; this was the Diamond of the Ring, and I have kept the best wine for the last, to close and conclude <hi>Davids</hi> character therewith.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Yea this is a very comfortable consideration, That though there be many faults, failings and defects in our performances, yet if there be sincerity (Gospel perfection) therein, if our hearts be set to seek the Lord God of our Fathers, God will be mercifull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, though we be not purified according to the purification of the Sanctuary.</p>

their badness will serve for a foyl to set off his goodness, and render it the more conspicuous, making him, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.15. <hi>to shine the brighter as a light in the world in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation.</hi> Alas, thy little Faith would have made no show, hadst thou lived in the age of <hi>Abraham</hi>; thy Patience would have seemed but a dwarf to the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> hadst thou been his contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary; thy meekness had appeared as nothing, if mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured with the meekness of <hi>Moses,</hi> had you been partners in the same generation.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> Secondly, I suspect this to be nothing else but a device of thy deceitfull heart, thereby to cozen thine own self. The Objection speaks the state of thy soul to be much like the temper of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.30. <hi>If we</hi> (say they) <hi>had been in the daies of our Fathers, we would not have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with the blood of the Prophets.</hi> Yet these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended pittifull persons were indeed more cruel then their Ancestors. Their Fathers killed the Men, they the Master; their Fathers the Servant they the Son; their Fathers murdered the Prophets of God, they the God of those Prophets, so far forth as he was murderable in his humane nature; and it is vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be suspected, that if thou beest bad now, thou wouldst not have been good, had the time of thy Nativity answered thine own desire. It is a shrewd presumption, that he who behaved himself as a <hi>Woolf</hi> in his own generation, would not have

However, though she hath not the same comfort, she hath the same cause of submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, obliging in conscience to Gods command; husbands must love their own wives, wives obey their own husbands; husbands and wives with <hi>David,</hi> must serve their own generation.</item>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> I must conclude with you Reverend Fathers, whom my loyalty cannot pass by without doing my due Homage to the <hi>Crown of your Age,</hi> especially if it be found in the way of truth. Give me leave to tell you belong to that generation which is passed out of this world: not only the Van or Front, and also the main body and battle of your Army are marched to their graves (and their souls I hope to heaven) whilest Divine Providence for reasons best known to himself, hath reserved you to bring up (as I may say) the very rear of the rear of your generation. O do not mistake this Reprieve for a Pardon; and here give me leave to use a plain but expressive Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>

Man is born to labour, as sparks do fly upward, some presently go out wafted from the womb to the winding-sheet; others live to ripe men, others to be old men; some whose temper and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance are more signal then in others, to be countect wonderous old, but all at last die and fall to the earth.</p>

bodies, may extend themselves to a vast (though finite) proportion. But you, though meet men, and weak men, must stride a greater distance; having your left foot already in the Grave, endeavour to have your right foot in Heaven, and waving all love of this world, set your minds and meditations alone on God and godliness. In a word, whatever our Age be, rising, shining or setting, Men, Brethren or Fathers, let us endeavour with <hi>David</hi> in my Text, according to the will of God to serve our own Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>

A child is like a man in the similitude of parts, though not of degrees, and in some measure he did sincerely with <hi>David</hi> serve his Generation. He was a dutifull Son unto his aged Mother, as she cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, and will I hope (as occasion is offered) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and reward it to his wife and children.
