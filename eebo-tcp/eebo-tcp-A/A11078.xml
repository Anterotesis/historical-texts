            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> made by a reuerend and right worthy Diuine, of his Most Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Majesties Resolution and Decree, to oppose <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> I thought it a fit time to put in order some pieces, which being set together, might amount to an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Proofe and Testimonie, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, herein hath merited most glorious and incomparable Titles, euen such as haue in them the Weight and Substance of High and supreame Excellencie.</p>
            <p>For first, herein Hee is the Successor of his Father (as in Bloud and Royalty, so) in his excellent Thoughts, Designes, and Actions: for this is a proceeding and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in the same worke, wherein the most learned King, and absolute Iudge of Doctrines, began a most noble Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His zeale in this matter, would not bee bounded with the seas, but on the wings of an heauenly fire flying beyond them, it there consumed the fifties and their Captaines, it dissolued the Bands of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27654:3"/>Secondly, herein the Title of Nursing Father of the Church, a Title giuen to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Kings by the heauenly Oracles, more strongly fastneth and spreadeth the Roote of it. So that at once the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, hereby acquireth the Dignitie, both of a perfect Sonne, and a glorious Father. When the Doctrine of a Church is cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the life of a Church is cherished; and when a contrary Doctrine is opposed, then the Doctrine of a Church is cherished.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, hereby the Title of Defender of the Faith, hath still more Realitie put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and it is made more vnlike to those empty Titles, that haue the Word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and not the matter within.</p>
            <p>Each of these I hope shall appeare in that which followeth. For though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of many seuerall pieces, like vnto broken accounts, yet I hope, being all set together, they will arise to make vp the promised summes, both in weight and number.</p>

            <head>The Doctrine of Predestination deliuered, and approued by King IAMES, our late Soueraigne of Famous MEMORY.</head>
            <p>GOd hath two wills, a reuealed will towards vs,<note place="margin">Medit. on the Lords prayer.</note> and that will is here vnderstood; hee hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a secret will in his eternall counsell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all things are gouerned, and in the end made euer to turne to his glory: often-times drawing good effects out of bad causes, and lightout of darknesse, to the fulfilling either of his Mercy, or Iustice, &amp;c. The first Article of the Apostles Creed teacheth vs, that God is Almightie, how euer <hi>Vortius</hi> and the <hi>Arminians</hi> thinke to rob him of his eternall Decree, and secret will, making things to bee done in this world, whither he will or not.</p>
            <p>Wee doubt not but that their Ambassadors which<note place="margin">Declar: against Vorstius.</note> were with vs about two yeares since, did informe them of a fore-warning that we wished the said Ambassadors to make vnto them in Our name, to beware in time of seditious and hereticall Preachers, and not to suffer any such to creepe into their state. Our principall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was of <hi>Arminius,</hi> who though himselfe were lately dead, yet had he left too many of his disciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him.</p>
            <p>Wee had well hoped that the corrupt seed which that<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> enemy of God, <hi>Arminius,</hi> did sow amongst you some few yeares since (whose disciples and followers are yet too bold, and frrequent within your Dominions) had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27654:4"/>
giuen you a sufficient warning, afterwards to take beede of such infected persons, seeing your owne Countrey-men already diuided into factions vpon this occasion, a matter so opposite to vnitie (which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the onely prop and safety of your state next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God) as of necessitie, it must by little and little bring you to vtter ruine, if wisely you doe not prouide against it; and that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> time. <hi>Thus while his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie is an enemie to the enemies of Praedestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is a friend and protector to that Doctrine, whose enemies he doth oppose.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>The Articles of</hi> Ireland <hi>agreed on in his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The cause mouing God to praedestinate to life, is not<note place="margin">Num. 15.</note> the fore-seeing of faith, or perseuerance, or good works, or of any thing which is in the person praedestinated; but ONLY the good pleasure of good himselfe. For all things being ordained for the manifestation of his Glory, and his Glory being to appeare both in the workes of his Mercie, and of his Iustice, It seemed good to his heauenly wisdome, to chuse out a certaine number, towards whom hee would extend his vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued Mercy, leauing the rest to bee spectacles of his Iustice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that wee may yet more punctually know this Doctrine there allowed by Him, to bee verily his owne Doctrine, we reade thus from his owne Dictates.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>that hee cannot turne and prepare himselfe, by his owne naturall strength, and good workes, to Faith and calling vpon God. Wherefore wee haue no power to doe good workes pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of Godby Christ preuenting vs, that wee may haue a good will, and working with vs when wee haue that good will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here wee see first, the seruitude of the Will vnder sinne in the state of naturall corruption. There is an impossibilitie of turning and preparing by naturall strength; and secondly the power of Grace on the Will in conuerting it; the Grace of God by Christ, doth so effectually preuent vs, that it makes vs to haue a good will.</p>
            <p>And as the Church teacheth vs this Doctrine, by Articles, so doth shee also teach and confirme it by practice. For in her Liturgie shee plainely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, both the slauery of the Will vnder sinne, and the effectuall power of grace on the Will. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the bondage of the Will vnder sinne, it is said in a Collect: <hi>The frailtie of man without thee, cannot but fall.</hi> And in the Catechisme. <hi>Know this that thou are not able to doe these these things of thy selfe, nor to walke in the Commandements of God, and to serue him, without his speciall Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And concerning the efficacie of Gods grace on the Will in turning and changing it, the Church di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly makes it the foundation and ground-worke of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27654:11"/>
diuers prayers: yea, in expresse tearmes she acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth Gods effectuall power on the Will to bee the ground of a prayer for the King. <hi>Almightie and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting God, wee be taught by thy holy word, that the hearts of Kings are in thy Rule and Gouernance, and that thou dost dispose and turne them, as it seemeth best to thy godly wisdome.</hi> In which words Gods effectuall power on the Will is laid as the ground, and now see the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er built vpon it, which is of the same substance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wee beseech thee so to dispose and gouerne the heart of our most gracious King and Gouernor, that in all his Thoughts, Words, and Workes, hee may euer seeke thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory.</hi> There is also another for the King in the Letany, <hi>That God would so replenish him with the Grace of his Spirit, that hee may alway incline to his Will and walke in his Way.</hi>
            </p>

               </gap>h both obeyeth the Scripture, and performeth her dutie: but on the other side it is considerable, whether that Doctrine bee not a kinde of <hi>Betraying</hi> and <hi>Disloyalty,</hi> that denies these prayers, by denying the effectuall power of God on the will of man. For how can he pray for the efficacy of Gods power on the will of his Soueraigne, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues no such efficacie of Gods power to be at all on the Will?</p>
            <p>Againe, the efficacie of Grace is yet more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged by our Church, as wee may see in these patternes taken out of her Liturgy. <hi>By thy speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Grace preventing vs, thou dost put into our mindes good desires.</hi> Againe, <hi>Lord wee pray thee that thy Grace may preuent and follow vs, and MAKE vs continually to be giuen to all good workes.</hi> And againe, <hi>O God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:27654:12"/>
               <hi>as without thee, wee are not able to please thee, grant the working of thy mercy may in all things direct and rule our Hearts.</hi> But omitting diuers others, I adde these following, to shew that the efficacie of Grace, doth not onely moue our wills to good, but establisheth vs in goodnesse. <hi>Giue vs grace that we be not like children, carried away with euery blast of vaine doctrine, but firmely to be established in the truth of the holy Gospell.</hi> (To which prayer in these times especially it will not be amisse to say <hi>Amen.</hi>) Againe, <hi>Almighty God which doest MAKE the mindes of all faithfull men to bee of one</hi> Will, <hi>grant vnto thy people that they may loue the things, which thou commandest, and desire that which thou doest promise, that among the sundry, and manifold changes of the world, our hearts may surely there be fixed where as true Ioyes are to be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, the <hi>Letany</hi> is a president of diuers pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes; one while praying for the King, <hi>That his heart may be ruled in the Faith, feare, and loue of God:</hi> and another while, <hi>That the Church may be ruled and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vniversally in the righs way.</hi> And againe, <hi>that God will bring into the way of truth all such as haue erred, and are deceiued.</hi> Now these prayers while they begge of God, that good desires may bee put into the heart, that hearts may bee disposed and turned by God, &amp;c. they doe plainely acknowledge the efficacy of Gods grace on the wills and hearts of men. For when they begge that Gods Grace may worke such effects; they acknowledge such effects to be the proper and kindly workes of Gods Grace.</p>

            <head>THE DOCTRINE OF THE Church of <hi>England,</hi> for Certaintie of Saluation.</head>
            <p>THe Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth the certaintie of Saluation, and she hath done it so constantly and and generally, that it will be very hard to produce any one of her <hi>Sonnes,</hi> that durst (before very late dayes) to affirme and defend to the contrary, by any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like worke and writing. Shee hath taught this Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie by her owne <hi>Articles:</hi> Shee hath re-enforced it by an exposition of Her <hi>Articles,</hi> it hath beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and enlarged, by <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> it hath beene taught by Her most eminent <hi>Sonnes,</hi> the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers the Bishops of this Church, and the Professors of Divinitie, who are trusted by her, to deliver her true thoughts, and Tenents in Divinitie to her children. And wee see that it hath also beene
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27654:18"/>
sealed vp and settled in Articles of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> betweene which Church, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to make a contraritie and opposition is a thing of extreame danger and absurditie.</p>
            <p>And first for her owne Articles. In the Article of Praedestination, our Church teacheth the Certaintie of <hi>Saluation</hi> diuers wayes. One way, by making <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation</hi> to depend on such a constant and sure <hi>Election,</hi> that it bringeth the Elect constantly to <hi>Salvation.</hi> A constant Decree of Election, brings the Saints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly &amp; assuredly through the way of <hi>Saluation,</hi> vnto the wayes end, even Salvation it selfe. This constant bringing of the Elect to <hi>Saluation,</hi> wee may finde in these words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God hath constantly Decreed by his Counsell secret to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Article. 17.</note> 
               <hi>vs, to deliuer from Curse and damnation, those whom hee hath chosen in Christ out of Man-kinde, and to bring them by Christ to euerlasting Saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence is it plaine and easie to argue.</p>
            <p>Those whom God hath constantly Decreed to bring to Salvation, they are constantly and certainly brought to <hi>Saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here God hath constantly Decreed to bring his Elect to <hi>Saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the Elect of God are constantly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely brought to <hi>Saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this bringing to Salvation, is not in the wayes end only, but in the way it selfe, the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars by which the Elect are brought to Salvation plainly shew, which are to follow in the next conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But here by the way, let vs note, that this bringing to Salvation, by a constant and certaine
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27654:19"/>
Decree, carries with it a certaine, and assured Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even by the confession of the Enemies of it. For in this very respect, because it induceth a certaine and constant Salvation, they reiect it; as that which cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth their inconstancie and mutabilitie of <hi>Salvation.</hi> This Doctrine of certaintie crosseth their doctrine of Incertaintie, and therefore their doctrine of incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, crosseth and reiecteth this doctrine of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. For well they know that it must be a certaine <hi>Saluation,</hi> which is wrought and brought to passe by a constant and absolute Decree of Election. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to plant this Apostacie, and that men though E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, may haue leaue to fall from <hi>Saluation</hi> if they will, they make an Election, which follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>th a man, vpon the condition of his sore-seene perseverance. So that as in the doctrine of our Church, a constant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Election, constantly bringing to Salvation must needs withall giue a finall perseverance in the state of grace, their Doctrine not enduring this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant perseuerance and saluation, issuing from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Decree of Election, haue deuised an Election that waites vpon man, to see whether hee will giue to himselfe finall perseuerance, by his owne Free-will. An Election by which no man is actually Elected vntill hee be no man, that is, vntill hee be parted the soule from the body. But (as I said before) our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may be knowne to be a Doctrine of Certaintie, that doth oppose and reiect this falling away, because the fallers away doe oppose and reiect it, there being indeed an incompatibility betweene, a constant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that brings men constantly to Saluation; and a dependant and contingent Decree, that waites on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27654:19"/>
mans vncertaine Will, to see whether his will will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally perseuer, and so bring his owner to Election.</p>
            <p>A second way, by which our Church teacheth the certaintie of Saluation in this Article is this; Because shee sayeth the same grounds that St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, when hee planteth and buildeth a certaintie of Saluation. Yea, shee almost vseth the same words. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> first in a generall sheweth that there is a constant and vninterrupted progresse of good and happinesse to the Saints that loue God, and are called of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. This generall hee makes good by particulars; for hee bringeth them in as proofes of the generall. Therefore hee begins with the word, For: <hi>For whom her did fore-know, hee also did praedestinate to bee made like to the Image of his Sonne, whom hee did praedestinate them he also glorified.</hi> Behold, the Apostle hath made good his generall by these particulars. His generall of the constant good and happinesse of the Saints, is proued by these particulars, because God from his first fore-knowing or taking notice of them, neuer leaues doing them good from one degree of good to another, vntill hee hath brought them to eternall glory and blessednesse. So that this place is no other but a proofe of the constant and vndefeasable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Saints. Now let vs see how our Church doth paralell this Doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> with the Doctrine of her Article. Our Church first in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall teacherh, that God by his constant Decree bringeth his Elect to Saluation; And then shee also descends to particulars in the like manner. <hi>Wherefore they which be indued with so excellent a benefit of God, be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>alled according to Gods purpose, by his Spirit working in</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:27654:20"/>
               <hi>due season; they through grace obey the calling; they hee iustified freely; they be made sonnes of God by Adoption, they be made like the Image of his only begotten Sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; they walke religiously in good workes, and at length by Gods mercy they attaine to euerlasting felicitie.</hi> Behold here also the particulers, by which that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bringing to Saluation is perfited, so that to ioyne both together; The businesse of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and our Church is both one, or rather the purpose and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is the purpose of our Church, euen to shew that the Saints and Elect are constantly and infallibly brought to Saluation and happinesse by Gods loue and Election. And indeed there is such a continued, and indissoluble chaine beginning in Gods purpose and Decree, and not ceasing vntill it bring the Saints to Gods to be glorified, that there is no roome, nor gappe for this full and finall Apostasie to breake in, and interpose it selfe.</p>
            <p>And that wee may be yet more sure, that this place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> did intend this very thing to proue the infallible, stedfast, and perpetuall blessednesse of the Saints; as before it hath appeared, both by his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall position at his entrance, &amp; after by the particulars in his progresse, so it may also most fully appeare, and strongly (for a three-fold cord cannot be broken) by the vse that he makes in his egresse. It were too much to stand vpon each particular of his inference and application: I will take notice of a few. First, he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs like a conqueror, beholding the safetie and assured victory of the Saints: <hi>What shall wee then say to these things? If God be for vs, who can bee against vs?</hi> God is for the Saints all the way from the first fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:27654:20"/>
vnto the finall glory, what <hi>Arminius</hi> or <hi>Bertius</hi> can make any Apostacy to be against vs, when God is throughly for vs. God being stedfast with vs from Election to glorification, no interloper can come in with intercision to cut off and put a sunder this continued chaine of happinesse, which God hath ioynd together and guardeth all the way. And that yet more plainly you may see that this was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> very meaning and purpose, behold it in his owne words, <hi>Who shall seperate vs from the loue of Christ?</hi> See here a challenge sent to the whole world, for hee defieth any thing that would seeme to seperate Gods beloued from the loue of God. Wherefore let the <hi>Arminians</hi> take heed how they come within Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> defiance. For the truth is, they doe vndertake to accept Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> challenge, and giue an answer to his question; for when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Who shall seperate vs from the loue of Christ?</hi> They answer, that there are many things that may seperate Saints from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>he loue of Christ. But let them take heed how they make St. <hi>Paul</hi> their aduersary. For it concernes them neerely to agree with <hi>this aduersarie while they are in the way lest their aduersary deliuer them to the iudge, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is Saint <hi>Paul</hi> contented to defie their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy &amp; separation only by way of a question in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall termes, but he passeth on to particulars and most weightie ones, which (if any) might cause an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy and separation of Saints from the loue of God. But both these particulars he denyeth to bee able to separate, yea, generally all or any creature hee deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to bee able to separate vs from the loue of God in Christ Iesus. Here also I will spare to insist on euery
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:27654:21"/>
particular; but I desire the Reader to consider of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> few of them which I thinke include all other, if the rule be true, that the greater includes the lesse. First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Life and Death</hi> cannot separate vs. Now the Author of Apostacy himselfe could say, <hi>Skin for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>kin, and all</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 24.</note> 
               <hi>that a man hath will he give for his life. Touch therefore his bone and his flesh, and hee will curse thee to thy face.</hi> But both the example of <hi>Iob</hi> and the Doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> shew that death, nor paine doe not separate the Saints from the loue of God. For <hi>Iob will trust in God though hee kill him; and Paul</hi> saith, <hi>That in all thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> things wee are more then conquerors.</hi> Now if this <hi>maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum terribilium</hi> cannot separate the Saints from the loue of God, what can lesser terrors doe? surely they can separate lesse.</p>
            <p>But here by the way, let me giue a note of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or at least remembrance, to the Doctors of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy,</hi> that in this case of <hi>Iob</hi> and other <hi>Saints,</hi> of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, <hi>it is God that loued vs</hi> who makes vs to conquer, and not our owne Free-will: for certainly, if God did not hold vs by his loue, but wee held him only, there were quickly an end of the businesse; death and many things else would sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from the loue of God. Especially if among those many things, wee take notice of those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: <hi>Angels, Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers.</hi> These are the mightiest creatures of all, and yet these cannot sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from the loue of God. Now if these that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in power cannot separate vs, how can any lesser, and inferior powers separate vs? But here also wee must carefully and humbly acknowledge, that we haue no defence, safetie and securitie against these mighty
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:27654:21"/>
powers, but the preuailing power of God, which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth those whom he loueth, and makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, For these are the sonnes of <hi>Anah,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>who can stand against the Sonnes of Anah.</hi> This is the strong man whom none can binde but one that is stronger then hee. And indeed this is the very cause of our ouer comming if we beleeue S. <hi>Iohn, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>hee that is in vs, is greater then hee that is in the world.</hi> Therefore <hi>Gods</hi> constant loue is still to bee lookt vnto, as the only cause of our safetie, which keepes our wills by grace against these ouer-mightie enemies; and wretched were wee, if our wills were put to keepe themselues by grace. For then if we were but as <hi>Adam,</hi> these principalities and powers would prevaile with vs as with <hi>Adam,</hi> especially having a body of sinne about vs which hee had not. But the only cause of our standing against these principalities, vnder whom <hi>Adam</hi> fell, is the constant loue and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God; By that as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>We are more then</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>conquerours,</hi> and thence it is, that Principalities and Powers cannot separate vs from the loue of <hi>God.</hi> And as by this constant loue of God we are constantly and safely preserued from separation and Apostasie, so let our constant saftie ever acknowledge this constant loue and purpose of God to bee the cause of it. But both this safetie and the cause of this safetie the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Apostasie <hi>doe denie,</hi> so robbing God of the glory of mans stabilitie, and robbing man of the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and stabilitie which hee hath from God. Finally, that yet wee may know our selues to be fully and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally safe, the blessed Apostle is not contented to speake of safetie from separation and <hi>Apostacie</hi> onely
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:27654:22"/>
in the present time, but he denies Apostacie, beth by future things, and in the future time. <hi>Nor things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, nor things to come, &amp;c. shall bee able to separate vs from the loue of God.</hi> Behold a finall and full perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in safetie, for things present cannot separate vs, and things to come shall not be able to separate vs, yea, no other creature, that is, nothing can separate vs, and therefore not the <hi>Arminians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third way by which our Church in this Article doth teach Certaintie of <hi>Saluation</hi> is this: shee saith that the <hi>consideration of Election doth establish in the Saints a Faith of their saluation to bee enioyed through Christ.</hi> For the Saint finding in himselfe the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and vivification of the Spirit, hence ascendeth vp to the knowledge, view, and consideration of his Election, and from this constant Election hath a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and sure Faith that hee shall enioy eternall salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ. Now from hence plainly issueth this argument.</p>
            <p>That saluation is certaine, whereof there is an esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Faith.</p>
            <p>But there is an established Faith of the <hi>Saluation</hi> of of the Saints.</p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>Saluation</hi> of the Saints is certaine.</p>
            <p>The first proposition cleareth it selfe by its owne light. For there is not an established Faith of vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and fallible things; but of certaine Yea, if there were no other word but the word of Faith, this Faith presumeth and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>esupposeth a certaine and infallible truth, for the obiect of it: and consequently in this place a certaine and infallible saluation of the <hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second proposition is raysed plainly out of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:27654:22"/>
words of the Article. For the consideration of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is there said, vpon the view of Sanctification to establish a Faith of <hi>Saluation</hi> to be enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I may conclude in the words of the ninth Article.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no condemnation to them that beleeue and are baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which the Article of <hi>Ireland</hi> thus resembleth;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Howsoeuer for Christs sake, there be no condemnation</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 34.</note> 
               <hi>to such as are regenerate and doe beleeue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first of which is a position of our Sauiour: <hi>They that beleeue and be baptized shall be saued:</hi> They<note place="margin">Mark. 16. 16.</note> are not onely now in the state of <hi>Saluation,</hi> but they shall hereafter be saued, for hee that <hi>beleeueth shall not</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 24.</note> 
               <hi>see condemnation.</hi> And the other resteth on the saying of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who saith that to the Saints there is no condemnation; <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of life which</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
               <hi>is in Christ Iesus, freeth a Saint from the law of sinne and death.</hi> Now if a Saint bee free from death, who can make him a bondslaue of death? This were flatly to affirme that which the Apostle denyes both here and else-where. <hi>Wee haue not receiued the spirit of bondage to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> 
               <hi>feare againe, but the spirit of Adoption; by which wee cry Abba Father:</hi> And <hi>if a sonne, then no more a seruant:</hi> Behold Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>wee haue not receiued the spirit</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 46. 7.</note> 
               <hi>to feare againe,</hi> who then dares to put vpon the Saints a spirit of bondage to feare againe? and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith by the Spirit of God, <hi>If a sonne, then no more a seruant:</hi> And how dares flesh and blood to say, if a sonne, yet againe a seruant? But let vs stand fast in the libertie wherewith Christ hath made vs free, neither let vs againe be intangled with the yoke of bondage.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:27654:23"/>
Let vs say with Saint <hi>Paul, once a sonne, and no more a seruant; once a sonne, and a sonne for euer.</hi> And indeed Christ himselfe saith, <hi>That a sonne abides in the house</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 9. 35.</note> 
               <hi>for euer,</hi> onely let vs remember, that therefore we are deliuered from this feare and house of bondage; <hi>That</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 74.</note> 
               <hi>being deliuered from our enemies wee might serue God without feare; In holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of our liues.</hi> Our safety is giuen vs mainly<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 3.</note> for an incouragement to holinesse: <hi>For hee that hath this hope purgeth himselfe as God is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now that it may appeare, that I haue not wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted a priuate sense out of these publike Articles, let vs see whether the same truth hath not beene publikly taught by others.</p>
            <p>There is a worke (formerly alledged) which hath this Title, <hi>The Faith, Doctrine and Religion, professed and protested in the Realme of England, and Dominions of the same, expressed in thirtie nine Articles, the said Articles analysed into propositions, &amp;c.</hi> This worke was made by a Chaplaine of Doctor <hi>Bancroft,</hi> late Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and to his Grace Dedicated. But it is well knowne Arch-bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> did not fauour any Puritanicall or Schismaticall Doctrine, neither is it to be thought that his Chaplaine, would or durst offer any such vnto him. Neither is it to be beleeued, that he would be so shamelesse as to say to the same Arch-bishop, in his Dedicatorie Epistle, That these Propositions <hi>shee</hi> (that is the Church of <hi>England) publikely maintaineth,</hi> if there had beene any Puritani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Doctrine maintained in them.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Perseuerance in good, beginneth not in the will, but in Gods protecting Grace, that vpholds the will from desist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: whence it followes that to euery new worke, the will needes a new Grace, as Organs giue sound no longer then while the bellowes are blowing. Against this our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries teach, that a iust man when himselfe will can practise any Righteousnesse, internall, or externall by doing good workes, and keeping Gods Law, neither needes he ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a new Grace to excite him, but onely to helpe him; And in case of falling into sin, when it is said, the will cannot</hi>

            <p>The Title of another <hi>Digression</hi> (43) is this: <hi>Prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Gods children without miracles or extraordinary Reuelation, may be and are infallibly assured, that they haue grace, and are in the state of saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There we reade in the <hi>Digression</hi> it selfe: <hi>The manner how we know wee haue grace, and shall be saued, is by the meanes of the holy Ghost, whose worke it is to assure vs</hi> (I thinke then it is the euill spirits worke to take away this assurance) <hi>the which he doth, first, by producing in vs the effects of sauing Grace, and Praedestination, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> the constant reforming of our life within and without. Whereupon it followes that he which giues himselfe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and stedfastly to a godly life, may infallibly bee secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereby of his Saluation, because God whose promises are infallible, hath promised saluation to all such.</hi> Where the Reader may note, That the constant Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our life is an effect of Praedestination, and a worke of the Spirit. Now if this constant Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be wrought in vs by the spirit, and is giuen to vs as a fruite of Gods constant Decree of Praedestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how can wee fall away? for a constant Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and falling away cannot stand together; But here we see Gods Spirit giues vs a constant Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, and therefore falling away is excluded.</p>

               </hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as when a Countrey-Gentleman would borrow money in this Citie, though his estate be neuer so great in the Countrey, yet commonly hee must haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a Citizen bound for him that is knowne to the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so since Doctor <hi>Reynoldes,</hi> though well knowne for his learning in the place where he liued, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance may faile to haue trust among some men. I must take leaue to get a surety for him, euen one that is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and whose wordes I thinke will be taken in the Citie.</p>
            <p>The man whome I produce to giue his word for Dr. <hi>Reynoldes</hi> is Doctor <hi>Francis White</hi> Deane of <hi>Carlile,</hi> I haue already indeede produced him for a witnesse, but now I produce him for a surety; yea since he can here be a witnesse also, let him be both a witnesse and a surety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:27654:28"/>First therefore, I take him as a witnesse of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance</hi> in that which I formerly cited out of him. <hi>That our Tenet concerning Praedestination is no other then what Saint</hi> Austen <hi>and his Schollers maintained against the</hi> Pelagians. Now it may plainly appeare by diuers of Saint <hi>Austens</hi> workes, that the Praedestination taught by Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> gaue to the praedestinaite an infallible perseuerance, a perseuerance by which a Saint could not but perseuere. And that I may not send away my Reader presently to reade or buy the workes of Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> let him but looke backe to the allegation of Doctor <hi>Fulke,</hi> and there he shall plainly see that which here I tell him: so that thence will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise a plaine Argument,</p>
            <p>The Tenet of our Church concerning <hi>Praedesti nation, is the Doctrine of Saint</hi> Austen.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Doctrine of Saint</hi> Austen <hi>teacheth a Praedestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that giues a sure and infallible Perseuerance</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the Tenet of our Church teacheth a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination that giues a sure and infallible Perseuerance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither may aman dare to meddle with any thing but the Conclusion, for the former proposition is guarded by Doctor <hi>White,</hi> and the second by Saint <hi>Austin</hi> and Doctor <hi>Fulke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Doctor <hi>White</hi> comes somewhat nearer, and<note place="margin">RePly <hi>to</hi> Fisher.</note> Proues that <hi>A member of Christ, and the Catholicke Church in the Creede</hi> (which consists of the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ) can neuer fall away vnto damnation, and therefore must needs be possessed of finall perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Church (or the Catholicke Church in the Creede) hath the remission of sinnes, and life eternall, and</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:27654:28"/>
               <hi>passeth not to Hell.</hi> Ioh. 10. 28. Aug. de Doctr: Christi: lib. 3. cap. 32.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>The testimonies of St.</hi> Austen <hi>obiected by the same Aduersary, which are, that the Catholicke Church is the Body of Christ, whereof he is the Head, and that out of this Body, the holy Ghost quickneth no man, make altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against himselfe. For none are vitall Members of Christs mysticall Body, but Iust and Holy persons. And it is the same Fathers Doctrine,</hi> Impii non suntreuera corpus Christi. <hi>wicked persons are not in Deed &amp; Veritie the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in another place,</hi> In corpore Christi non sunt, quod est Ecclesia, quoniam non potest Christus habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re membra damnata. <hi>They are not in Christs Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ CANNOT haue DAMNABLE mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus are Christs members sure of Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause safe from damnation, they cannot be damned, therefore they must be saved, and I thinke that they will not deny that finall perseverance is an insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble companion of Salvation.</p>
            <p>And now wee come to another place in the same worke, which though it begin in <hi>Witnessing,</hi> yet it ends in <hi>Suretiship.</hi>

               </gap>thhr.

For they imagine a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of things not indeed severed, and then they raise an argument from the seperation which is onely in their owne braines, and not in the thing. So that the ambition and vtmost hope of such an argument is onely this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If such a thing were that indeed is not, then that would not be, that indeed is. If iustifiyng Faith were wholly severed from Repentance as it is not, then perseverance would not be Persverarance. Wee haue seene out of <hi>S. Austen,</hi> Our Church &amp; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that the same Election which Decreeth to the <hi>Saints</hi> glory &amp; Salvation, Decreeth also perseverance.</p>
            <p>Now Perseverance, must needes haue that suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Repentance without which it cannot be perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And therefore the same Decree that decreeth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27654:31"/>
Perseverance, must needes also Decree that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without which Perseverance cannot be. And in deede one and the same Seede of God (Decreed to all the Elect) is an immortall seede, both of repentance and perseverance. Briefely then, though a man were to be excluded from Salvation, for not performing a condition, yet if he be sure to performe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, he is still sure of Salvation. As on the other side, if he be sure of Salvation, then he is sure to performe the condition: without which he cannot be sure of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Now those whom our Article saith, God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly Decreed to bring to Salvation, they are sure of Salvation. And therefore are they sure of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and all other conditions or qualifications, without which they cannot be sure of Salvation.

And <hi>Peter</hi> when he had denyed<note place="margin">Luke. 22. 61.</note> Christ, as soone as Christ looked vpon him, he went out and wept bitterly. Whence it appeareth, that the seede of Repentance in these great falls of the Saints is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:27654:32"/>
not dead but sleepeth; it lyes in the earth during this winter of grace, being ready to bud, as soone as the frost of Tentation is dissolved, and the Sunne of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse warmeth it with a new accesse, and increase of beames and heate. And here I thinke it is worth the obseruing, that there are certaine sins that are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne to be sins, yet while the strength of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vpon the Saints, they partake very much of the concealement of secret sins. For the same lust and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that preuaileth vpon the Will of a Saint to do so great a sinne against which his Will was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bent and resolued, casteth also very commonly a mist on the vnderstanding of the same Saints, that the thing formerly appearing out of measure sinfull, now doth not looke like a sinne; for the flesh hauing darkened the vnderstanding for a season, that appeares not in the shape and odiousnesse of sinne to the flesh, which most plainly and euidently appeares sinfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seene by the spirit. And therefore a Saint after a great sinne, when he comes truely to discerne it, is like a man awaked; awaked I say out of a slumber of the flesh, wherein his eyes were closed. and hee saw not sinne to bee sinne, and awaked into the light and sight of the Spirit by which alone a man spiritually discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. So <hi>Dauid</hi> had neede of a plaine similitude, to conuince him of a sinne that was in it selfe plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but no doubt by lust so couered and hid from appearing in the true shape of sinne, that before this discouery which awaked the Spirit in him, he had not the full and true sight of the odious and vgly face of his sins. Briefly, <hi>Vzzah</hi> who dyed in his sinne, was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or damned. I thinke no man will be so cruell as to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:27654:32"/>
say he was damned; wee see he had a good affection to the Arke of God, and no doubt a good loue to God, for whose sake he loued the Arke, but his good loue was ill managed, &amp; the wrath of God came vpon him, because hee serued that God in an ill manner, whom no doubt he loued, with a good zeale and affection. Now if <hi>Vzzah</hi> was saued, by this Doctrine he must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually repent of this sinne, which was so mortall to him. But first wee reade of no such actuall Repentance, and next the suddennesse of the stroake may seeme to preuent it. But on the other side, if he did actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, then may any Saint else be thought actually to repent, and so this question is againe needelesse, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was proued to be absurd. And surely he which gaue <hi>Iezabel</hi> that sedu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d the seruants of God, <hi>a space to repent,</hi> may be thought to be at least as gracious to the spouse of Christ, (his Saints and members) euen to giue them this space to repent, to whom wee know he hath giuen the grace to repent.</p>
            <p>If they doe now reply, are Saints immortall having sinned? I answer by asking againe, Was <hi>Iezabell</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, when God gaue her lpace to repent? Besids, no death can prevent Gods mercy; God knowes the time of his Saints, and if <hi>Sparrowes</hi> fall not to the ground without Gods prouidence, much lesse doe Saints. God hath the time of Saints in his hand, and the same God hath also Grace in his hand; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing can hinder him, but that he may prevent the time which he hath in one hand, with the grace which he hath in an other. Yea as he is the Lord both of life and grace, so is he of tentations. Therefore as hee can command time to stay and grace to hasten, so
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:27654:33"/>
also can he command tentations to take what time he pleaseth, and can make them to keepe what distance he will, to the last time of the Saints. Yet I may adde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I thinke that <hi>Arminians</hi> can hardly disproue it; If a Saint haue in him the grace of Repentance, which would bring forth the Act of Repentance if it had time, it were somwhat strange that a Saint should be damned, not for want of grace (but) only for want of time. Now the remaining grace of Repentance, after the fall of Saints, apeares before in <hi>Dauid Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> who readily repented vpon their sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. And even <hi>Bertius</hi> himselfe confesseth, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dauid</hi> nor <hi>Peter</hi> in their falls, did wholly loose the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this question is grounded on the Popish distinction of sins mortall and veniall: A distinction which Doctor <hi>Francis White</hi> in his <hi>Orthodoxe,</hi> hath with sound reasons and allegations mightily battred There it is said by him, <hi>That concupisence is as verily sinne as Adultery;</hi> And that there is a plaine Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement against it; now the breach of any Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (especially the body of it) must needes be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, So when a man couets his neighbours wife, yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his neighbours Oxe, hee hath mortally sinned. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon appeares a diuers fault and mischiefe of this question or obiection. First a man is in perpetuall feare &amp; torment, because such lusts do so often arise in him. Secondly, this obiection hath but onely vanity or nothinges in it. For it is an argument raised out of nothing, and nothing in the hands of the creature will make nothing. The distinction of sins into veniall and mortall is nothing, for euery sinne is mortall. Death
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:27654:33"/>
runs along with the whole breach of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Cursed is hee that continueth not in all things which</hi>

               <hi>are written in the booke of the Law to do them.</hi> Now if the curse and wrath of God bee annexed to the breach of any part of the Law, surely the breach of any part of the Law makes a man subiect to wrath &amp; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 23.</note> to death. <hi>For the wages of sinne</hi> (euen of all sinne without exception) <hi>is death.</hi> Now if all sinne be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and the mortalnesse of sin be the reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatibility of grace and saluation, then euery sinne and breach of the Law is incompatible with grace, and so a Saint may fall from the state of Grace many times in a day; and many times in a day he had neede to be againe regenerated. But on the other side, if they will allow Grace to stand with mortall sinne in the breach of one Commandement (as the tenth) they must bee forced to allow it likewise in the breach of another; at least if they will allow Grace to be compatible with the mortall breach of one halfe of a Commandement, they may be inforced to allow it in the breach of the other halfe. For mortalnesse of sinne being the cause of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatiblenesse with Grace, this mortall sinne run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all along through the whole breach of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, the effect of incompatibility must needes runne along with it throughout the whole breach of the Commandement. Or else as Grace may stand with the breach of one halfe of the Commandement, so may it stand with the breach of the other halfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept men will stint the Grace of God, and say it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach home to ouercome the whole breach of a Commandement, especially one of the second Table as that of Adultery, which is vsually reckoned one of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:27654:34"/>
their mortall sins. Yea, it were fit that these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>inters of Gods Grace, should giue vs a Table of all the breaches of euery Commandement, and then put downe their finger iust on the place, where the breaches leaue to be veniall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; begin to be mortall; This seemes very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary for the full discerning of a matter of so great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence and concernment, as falling from the state of grace; for without this knowledg a man may fall from the state of Grace by some sin which he knowes not to be mortall, and then forgeting it or neglecting it, there is an end of him, he must be damned for euer. But to make such a Table by Scripture is altogether impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and without Scripture it is vaine and friuolous. How much better were it to say with the Scripture, That in the Iustice of God sin &amp; life are incompatible, euen any sin with life eternall. But by the Grace of God, sin and life are not incompatible; for God in his Saints leaues euen now a remnant of the body of sin,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. &amp; 8.</note> that often leades them captiue to the Law of sin; and yet at the same time there is the Spirit of life which is in Christ Iesus, freeing them from an absolute reigne of sin &amp; death. There is a remainder of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; a seede of the new <hi>Adam,</hi> and the motions, yea single acts of the old remainder, doe not kill the whole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall seede of the new <hi>Adam.</hi> As one action doth<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. Pet.</note> not make a habit, so one action doth not destroy a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, especially these infused habits, which are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a godly nature, and an incorruptible seede.</p>
            <p>But that I may shew them the cause of their mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, (which is the way to remidy it) I giue them to vnderstand, that their error come from hence, because they do not weigh these things in the Balances of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:27654:34"/>
               <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> They do not weigh spirituall things, with the weights of the Spirit. For it in these vpright Balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they did weigh sinne and grace together, they should finde, that in the old man there being buds and leaues and fruits of sinne, sinfull thoughts, words, and actions, and the like in the new man the buds and leaues and fruits of sinne, cannot ouer weigh more, then the buds and leaues, and fruites of grace, but it is a reigne and whole body of sinne, that must counter. poyse, and equall a reigne and body of grace. More plainly thus, one particular sinne, may preuent and cut off for the time some act of grace which should haue preuented it, but one act of sinne, doth not cut of and expell, the whole new man and body of grace. The whole seede and roote of Grace is not digged vp, but by a whole body and reigne of sinne, and indeede this whole reigne of sinne, is absolutely a sinne which the Regenerate cannot commit. There are diuers places that confirme this in the Scripture, yea, diuers places in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohns</hi> first Epistle. I take notice of one: <hi>Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is borne of God doth not comit sinne, for his seede remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi>

               <hi>sinne is the seruant of sinne.</hi> But this seruice of sin and the seede of God are incompatible, and therefore the seede of God still remaining in the Regenerate, (which the Apostle affirmeth) this raigne of sinne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand in them with it. So are the Regenerate still safe, while single actuall sinnnes do not destroy the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:27654:35"/>
whole seede of Grace, but onely a whole seruice of sin, from which the Regenerate are preserued, by the seed of God that remainet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> in them. Briefly a remaining seede is neuer lost, neither by actuall sinnes which are committed, which do not ouer weigh and preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, not by a body of sinne, which the seed of God remaining for ever excludeth.</p>
            <p>And hereupon in the second place these men may also plainly perceiue their error, in saying that a Saint by some actuall sinne is in the whole state of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the seede of God remaining in the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, hee cannot be wholly in the state of wrath and damnation, for there is something in him with which God will not be angry, euen the remaining seede of God. But you will aske me perchance, Is not God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with sinne? Yes, and very angry with a very great sinne; but yet his whole wrath doth not arise when there is a seede of Grace that abaites the wholenesse of his wrath. Therefore let vs againe set vp the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances of the Sanctuary, and as before wee laid the whole seed of Grace in one balance: against one single sinne in the other balance: so now let vs lay the seede of Grace together with some single sinne in one ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and the whole or full wrath of God in the other. And let vs withall know that our mercifull Father loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon these balances through his beloued Sonne Christ Iesus. and then wee shall soone find that single sinnes ioyned with a seede of Grace, will not draw moue, and counter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> weigh a whole and intire wrath.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:27654:38"/>
and corrosiues of the flesh, will bee comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably profitable to the spirit, and not hurtfull to the puffing vp of the flesh. The Grace of God in a Saint seeing the goodnesse of the Lord sealed to him on the one side, and the terrors of the Lord on the other side, hath sufficient grounds of a full and awfull resolution, to serue God with reuerence and feare. It is the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an holy man neare 200 yeares since, <hi>Doctus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Gratiae, et eruditus verbare substractionis, &amp;c.</hi> A Saint being taught by the gift of grace and by the Rod of Gods frownes and temporall desertions, takes heede of pride, takes heede of security. And <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, hath an excellent passage wherein he saith, that God doth keepe the soule of a Saints in so even a ballance, counterpoysing vertues with Tentations, <hi>(Miro modo agitur, vt nec de virtute, quispiam extolli de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat, nec de tentatione desperet) That hee neede not to be lifted vp with his virtues, nor dispaire for his tentations. Greg.</hi> in Iob. lib. 9. cap 5. So it will be vnnecessary as it is vntrue to say that a sonne of God may be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for euen therefore are they scourged here, that they may not be damned hereafter but that they may be receiued. <hi>They are scourged with the scourges of men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1 Cor. 11. 32.</note> 
               <hi>but the mercy of God is not taken away from them; they are iudged of God, that they may not be condemned with the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the same men that are so hard against the Saints, yet they are very kinde to the Reprobates, and they that will not allow a particular grace to giue vnto the Saints a sure salvation, will allow a generall grace to giue vnto all, (Reprobates and all) an vncertaine salvation; Yea, to speake the truth vnder the shew of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:27654:38"/>
a generall saluation, they giue no saluation at all. For man fallen will not stand, by that grace wherein man perfect did fall: so that if effectuall grace be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, saluation is taken away. But what say they? Christ dyed for all. True, but what of that? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men haue grace to be saued by Christs death. A miserable inconsequence. There can nothing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low but this, <hi>Therefore Christ gaue himselfe a sufficient ransome for all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The ransome is sufficient for all, it is offered to all, but all men doe not receiue it. Man by his fall hath depriued himselfe of grace, by which hee may accept the promises of grace, so that his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity, hinders him from accepting this generall remedy. A King at his Coronation giues a generall pardon; yet this doth not proue that all men are able particularly to apply this generall pardon. There are some that thinke themselues <hi>rectos in Curia,</hi> and that they neede it not, some are negligent and carelesse of their estates; and a third sort are ignorant of it, and a fourth is poore and cannot sue it out. So in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pardon offered in Christ Iesus, there are some <hi>Ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiaries,</hi> as the Scribes and Pharises that thinke they they neede it not, there are some that with <hi>Esau</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise it for carnall prophanenesse, there are some that<note place="margin">Rom. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> are hardned and blinded being ignorant of Gods Righteousnesse in Christ Iesus, though they haue it Preached, yea though they haue a zeale of God and such are the <hi>Iewes;</hi> and there are some that neuer heard of Christ Iesus, and they cannot sue out a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don by beleeuing in him of whom they haue not heard. But this is the summe of the truth: Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly fallen by Free-will though assisted with a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:27654:39"/>
generall and sufficient grace, lost his Free-will, grace and life eternall. God in his mercy giues a Sauiour<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 2. Heb. 9. 15.</note> with a sufficient ransome for all the sinners of the world, that of all the world he may take whom hee pleaseth, anb by effectuall grace ioyne them to Christ in an eternall vnion of blessed felicity. If Christ had not dyed for all, God could not of all haue saued whom he pleased. If hee had giuen effectuall grace to all, all would be saued; and then God had bin all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no Iustice; If hee had giuen effectuall grace to none, none would be saued, and then God would haue bene all Iustice, and no Mercy. But God purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to shew, both Mercy and Iustice, leaues some in the state of the fall, to which man voluntarily cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and by effectuall grace ioynes others to Christ vnto eternall saluation. His Iustice cannot be accused, but his Mercy ought to be magnified: And wee are infinitely more bound to God for his sure Mercyes in that <hi>Effectuall Grace,</hi> by which hee certainly saueth millions, then to <hi>Arminians</hi> for their generall grace, by which they goe about certainly to damne all.</p>

            <p>Another <hi>Naturall</hi> ground of <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> is the <hi>Naturall wisedome of man,</hi> or the <hi>wisedome</hi> of <hi>Naturall</hi> man. This <hi>Naturall wisedome</hi> approues that onely for true wisedome which it selfe comprehendes, and the wayes <hi>which are past finding out,</hi> or are contrary to that which it hath Decreed for <hi>Wisedome,</hi> are meere <hi>foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> to it. Wherefore euen the <hi>Wisedome of God,</hi> and the <hi>Iustice of God,</hi> if they bee not wise and iust that way, in which the <hi>Naturall</hi> man thinkes <hi>Wisedome</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> onely to bee, hee censureth the one to be Folly, and the other Iniustice. Thus by the fall of man, man is fallen into this drunkennesse, that hee thinkes the <hi>wisedome</hi> creating, can bee measured and iudged by the wisedome created, yea, not by the wisedome created, but by the wisedome corrupted. The wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of man fallen, is set for a Iudge of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible wisedome of him who made man in his perfection; and hee that is now lesse then himselfe,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:27654:44"/>
will comprehend him, that was infinitely greater, then man, when hee was greater then himselfe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this a stone that wee stumble at, for lacke of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. For God hinselfe hath shewed vs this Rocke of offence. <hi>The naturall man, perceineth not the thinges</hi>

               <hi>of God, but they are foolishnesse to him.</hi> And, <hi>The world in the wisedome of the world knew not God.</hi> Now by the same reason, the more of this wisedome that knoweth not God, and that counts Gods wisedome to be foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse, the more doth the wisedome of God seeme folishnesse to it. Therefore there were no greater ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and opposers to the Doctrine of God, then Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians and Philosophers, both which were vnited in that most able <hi>Naturall man,</hi> and most venemous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary of <hi>Christianity, Iulian the Apostate.</hi> And that God may glorify this wisedome of his which they count foolishnesse, and make it to triumph ouer their foolishnesse which they so seriously and reuerently thinke to bee wisedome, hee takes simple, weake, and base men euen foolish thinges, and by his spirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them his diuine wisdome, hee confoundes the wisedome of the worldly wise, while these foolish thinges are saued by the wisedome of God, and the wise men perish by the wisedome of man. So that there remaines no other remedy for this disease of humane wisdome. but <hi>that such men become fooles, that they may bee wise.</hi> They must put off humane wisdome, and esteeme it to bee folly, if they will put on the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. The <hi>Naturall</hi> wisedome must bee cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuated by the Spirit, and a spirituall Doctrine must be receiued by a spirituall vnderstanding; for spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all truths are not kindly to bee receiued but by a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:27654:45"/>
hand. And surely if <hi>Humane</hi> wisdome had neede to bee put off in the receiuing of any spirituall Doctrine, it had neede especially to bee laid aside in receiuing the Doctrine of the <hi>Grace of God.</hi> For that Doctrine is very spirituall, it flyes high, and the top of it pearcheth the cloudes, and hides it selfe in heaven, to bee adored rather then to bee discerned. And so the great <hi>Apostle</hi> him-selfe doth leaue it. Now these high, and most spirituall doctrines, offend the eyes of naturall wisdome, which enioyeth those secrets chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which it selfe comprehendeth, and accountes a transcendent wisdome to bee foolishnesse. So the <hi>Owle</hi> thinkes day to bee <hi>night,</hi> and the <hi>sunne</hi> to bee a cause of blindnesse; but the <hi>Night</hi> goes for day, and the setting of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> to bee the Spring of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Therefore the witt of man, offended with the purity of this spirituall doctrine, hath invented a doctrine of its owne which exceedingly agreeth, with the wit of man that bare it; for here (though not in a better case) the Mother is the <hi>Nurse,</hi> The wit of Man hath made a Foard in the depths of God, it hath found out the wayes that are past finding out, and where St. <hi>Paul</hi> cryes out <hi>O depth,</hi> there they leade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their schollers, that they passe through it allmost with dry feete The plot of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and these men will tell you the reasons of Gods Counsell; Neither is it a new devise of mine, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse Mans wisdome of this folly, it hath long since beene done: yet will I bring a witnesse whom I may call an <hi>Oracle</hi> of these last times, a man of the most sound and definite Iudgment, that these latter Ages haue brought forth, And his discovery may very well serue for a remedy.</p>

               <hi>The Diuines of greatest name, held that Article (of free Praedestination) for Orthodoxe, and the contrary for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, because good writers of the Schoole, as Saint</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Scotus <hi>and others, did commonly thus beleeue, That God before the foundation of the world, out of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall masse of mankind, by his onely and meere mercy did chuse some to glory, to whom he prepared effectuall meanes for the obtaining of the same, and this is called, to Prades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate.

hath beene rooted, and from which it hath sprung vp, and spread abroad the branches of it. My Author hath discouered one of the Friers; it serues their turne best for Rhetoricall perswasions, and plausible decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. And I wish other Clergy-men had not also their Politicke endes, and did not seeke to get glory to themselues, by selling the glory of God. No ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it were an outward and seeming glory to them, if when a man hath killed the seed of God in him, they without any seed of God could make this man to liue againe, &amp; to enter into heauen, not being regenerated, that is, hauing wholly lost his <hi>Regeneration.</hi> But in these gaines, God looseth; for his seede looseth the glory of being incorruptible, that corruptible man may get the glory of God.</p>
            <p>But I hasten to another <hi>Policy,</hi> and that is, <hi>The plot of<note place="margin">3</note> bringing in Popery.</hi> Whosoeuer will bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> into a country strongly fixed in the <hi>Protestant Doctrin,</hi> must not presently fly in the face of the whole <hi>Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Doctrine,</hi> but his onely way, is to worke into it by these degres of plausible <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> euen to put in these little theeues (they seeme litle to naturall men) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the window of a Church, &amp; then they may vnlocke the dores of a <hi>Church,</hi> and let in all <hi>Popery.</hi> Our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is contained in diuers &amp; seuerall Articles, &amp; they run vpon one Thred of Establishment &amp; Authority, now if you can cut this Thred but in one place, and breake through the Authority which established the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you may easily see, that all the rest like beades will run out.

            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Arminianisme</hi> being a kind of twilight,<note place="margin">4</note> and a double-faced thing that lookes to two Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:27654:46"/>
at once, <hi>Protestantisme</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> hee that is in it, is like him that stands in the borders of two adioyning Kingdomes, who is ready to dwell in either, as either serues his turne best. So that an <hi>Arminian</hi> is like a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fish, if preferment be among the birds, he is ready to fly after it with the birds, and if it be among the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, then among the fishes he will swimme after it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, it seemes to be a factious ground wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">5</note> Politicke men may worke their owne ends, &amp; that I may vse the wordes of one that perchance will be more pleasing to some, and one that seemes to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge such a thing <hi>de facto.

now hath gotten the name of <hi>Arminianisme.</hi> But farre bee it from vs, so to devide our selues, by opinions, that wee should make our selues weake and our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies strong. Let vs much rather like brethren, which quarrelled before, cast away the quarrels, and ioyne together against a common Enemy, both of Church and State. Let vs striue to put our selues into the same Religion, into the same vnity, wherein God protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and prospered vs, against this deuourer of <hi>Europe,</hi> and his <hi>Inuincible Nauies.</hi> Wee neede no other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, no other vnity to prevaile against him hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then that wherein wee haue miraculously preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against him hertofore. The same God of truth and peace, will defend vs in the same Truth and the same Peace. And I doubt not but the heart of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to this Truth and Vnity, and fully resolued, to passe by that path vnto all due seruice, and fit supply that may tend to the strength of HIM, who is called in the Scripture <hi>The breath of our Nostrills,</hi> and to the confusion of His and our Enemies.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I thinke it fit to cleare the pertinencie of the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which perchance by some may be miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>First in the point of praedestination; I thinke those since <hi>Austen</hi> are most of them without exception, and speake to the poynt it selfe; which is a free choice of some, from the whole corrupted Masse, they being
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:27654:47"/>
like the rest when they were chosen, but made to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by choosing.</p>
            <p>Those before <hi>Austen,</hi> if they bee not so full and punctuall, <hi>Austen</hi> himselfe (there alledged) doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them, yet I doubt not but they do shew a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of men, made by the meere grace and pleasure of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly in the point of Freewill: I thinke the maine point of supposed freedome is this. An indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency or aequilibriousnes of the <hi>will</hi> no way partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined, but aequally able to incline it selfe any way. In this freedome the <hi>will</hi> is imagined of some, to bee set by a generall sufficient grace, whereby it is freely able to bleeue or not to beleeue, to receiue the grace of saluation or to resist it. And in this opinion, the will it selfe is the fountaine of receiuing saluation; and grace doth not phisically and effectually moue the will to an assured receiuing of it, but the will freely moues it selfe, yea moues grace toward the receiuing of it. Yet further some do not only put <hi>freewill</hi> where there is a state grace, but even there where is onely the state of nature, and vnregeneration, and to this end they, peruert the place of <hi>Paul; To will is ready with mee;</hi> but there wantes power to effect it, by reason of the loade and chaynes of sinne which hinder the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For here they say St. <hi>Paul</hi> spake of himselfe as hee was vnregenerate: though it cannot bee denyed but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was regenerate when hee spake it, yea, hee sayes in the same place that <hi>hee serued with his mind the Law of God,</hi> which no vnregenerate man doth! <hi>Rom:</hi> 8. 7.</p>
            <p>Now these places which shew the power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:27654:48"/>
of <hi>Grace</hi> on the <hi>will,</hi> not leauing it in an aequilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and indifferency to all wayes, but inclining it certainly and effectually one way, these I thinke are pertinent to disproue the supposed freedome of will, which rather moueth grace, then is moued by grace. They disproue the kingdome of the will ouer grace, and do proue the Kingdome of God in grace on the will.</p>
            <p>Againe those places which shew the power, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and tyranny of Lust and the Law of sinne on the will, they are also pertinent to disproue the same supposed freedome of will. For they shew the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and effectuall power of sinne on the wil, in the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity of the will vnder the Law of sinne. For where there is a Captiuity, there cannot bee this imaginary Freedome, Againe this very Captiuity of the will vnder Concupiscence, necessarily inferreth, a subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the will in Regeneration vnder effectuall and raigning Grace, as profound <hi>Bradwarden</hi> excellently gathers in the place alledged vpon this point of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will. For the strength of Concupiscence must be conn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoysed in the will at least by an aequall strength of grace: wherefore if Concupiscence haue so much power to incline the will from God to the Creature, surely Grace in the conuersion of a sinner must haue so much power as to incline the will to the Creator from the Creature.</p>
            <p>If it bee sayd, That some of the Fathers, do speake somwhat more largely for freewill in other places, that moues mee litle. The one may bee the sayinges of preiudice, the other of Iudgment, the one may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from an opposition to the <hi>Manichees,</hi> the other
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:27654:48"/>
from a single, and irrespectiue consideration. And it is acknowledged generally that before <hi>pelagins,</hi> there was an inconvenient largenesse in many speaches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Freewill</hi> Sure I am that seemes most to come from the Spirit, that attribute (especially in first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto God) lest glory to man, and most to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Dictates of the Spirit should onely bee of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in points of Diuinity.</p>
            <p>Lastly, for the point of <hi>Certainty of Saluation;</hi> I know there is a two fold <hi>Certainty.</hi> Thinges are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in themselues, or they are certaine to vs; And places that affirme either of these concerning the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Saints, do also affirme a finall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perseuerance of Saints. For if our saluation bee certaine in it selfe, our perseuerance without which there is no saluation, is also certaine. And if our saluation bee certaine to vs, our perseuerance without which there can bee no saluation, is also certaine to vs.</p>
            <p>And howsoeuer some may perchance obiect other places of the Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that from temporall desertions, great falls of the Saints, and finall Apostalyes of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary beleeuers (Matt. 4. 16. 17.) do seeme to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate a generall possibility of falling from grace, yet it is worthy to be noted, that among and amid these doubts which humane frailty suggesteth, the voice and testimony of the Spirit breatheth forth, that layes hold on heauen, as an vndoubted inheritance, infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring now in these Saints, as before in <hi>St. Paul, If sons, then heyres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>exed with Christ.</hi> And one tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of this Spirit of Truth, is of more worth then all the doubts of humane frailty.</p>
            <p>True it is and wee acknowledge it, that the best
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:27654:49"/>
Saints are sometimes terrified with their owne great infirmityes, Gods temporall desertions, and the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full falls of others: And in these agonyes they say; <hi>Is</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 77. 8 &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>his mercy cleane gone for euer, doth his promise faile for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore:</hi> But withall being receiued by the Spirit, they acknowledge, <hi>This is mine Infirmity: Gods way is (high &amp; spirituall) in the sanctuary, &amp; with his strength hee redeemeth his people.</hi> And euen this very terror of the Saints, from which some would make an obiection against <hi>Certainty of saluation,</hi> is an answere to another obiection made against the same <hi>Certainty.</hi> For these terrors serue for a remedy against that carnall securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they doe vsually obiect against Spirituall <hi>Certaintie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To summe vp all these Doctrines into a chaine and connexion of blessednesse: while God of his free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy chuseth some to saluation, from others aequally wrapped in one masse of corruption; while by effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Grace hee rules in their hartes and wills, and lastly while hee dwelles &amp; continues his kingdome in them by an immortall seed, keeping and leading them infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly<note place="margin">1.
