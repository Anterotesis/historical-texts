         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Diſputation. For
when the Book was read,
the deſigne was Generally
approved, (as farre as I

credible.</hi> Of tolerable ignorance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP. IX.</hi> It is evident that Magiſtrates,
Miniſters and people, have each a
power of Judging: but different, as
they have different works. How far
Miniſters are Judges. Proved by ten
Reaſons, againſt the popular claim, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
How far the people muſt Judge: How
far the Magiſtrate muſt Judge Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
for theſe Matters, and Miniſters
obey them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP. X.</hi> To this Miniſterial Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Profeſsion and Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Expectant, there is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
<pb facs="tcp:120705:10"/>
a Miniſterial <hi>Inveſtiture</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of the Benefit expected. How
many Sacraments there are. 1. More
than ſeaven in the largeſt ſenſe.
2. Five in a large ſenſe (not intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.)
3. Two only in the ſtricteſt ſenſe,
as we define them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP. XI.</hi> The ſolemn Miniſterial <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture</hi>
of Profeſſours into the right of
the Church-Priviledges of the Adult,
is either 1. Of the <hi>Unbaptized,</hi> who
are now firſt entred. 2. Or of the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi>
in Infancy, that never proved
ungodly, nor violated that firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
3. Or of thoſe Baptized (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Infancy or at Age) that have
ſince proved wicked and broke the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
The firſt of theſe <hi>Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
is to be by <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> the ſecond
by <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and the third by
<hi>Abſolution.</hi> So that the ſolemn <hi>Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
that now I am pleading for, is by
<hi>Confirmation</hi> to one ſort, (that never
proved ungodly ſince their Baptiſm) and
by <hi>Abſolution</hi> to the other ſort (that
<pb facs="tcp:120705:10"/>
broke their Covenant) which yet hath
a certain <hi>Confirmation</hi> in, or with
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP. XII.</hi> This ſolemn <hi>Inveſtiture</hi> on
perſonal Profeſsion, being thus proved
the Ordinance of God, for the ſolemn
renewing the Covenant of Grace,
between God and the Adult-Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it muſt needs follow that it is a
<hi>Corroborating</hi> Ordinance, and that
<hi>Corroborating</hi> Grace is to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in it from God, by all that come
to it in ſincerity of heart: And ſo it
hath the name of Confirmation upon
that account alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP. XIII.</hi> Miniſterial <hi>Impoſition of
hands,</hi> in <hi>Confirmation</hi> and the
foredeſcribed ſort of <hi>Abſolution,</hi>
is a Lawfull and Convenient action,
or Ceremony, and ordinarily to be
uſed, as it hath been of old by
the Univerſal Church. But yet it is
not of ſuch Neceſsity, but that we
<pb facs="tcp:120705:11"/>
muſt diſpence in this Ceremony with
ſcrupulous Conſciences, that cannot be
ſatiſfied to ſubmit to it: Impoſition of
hands is allowed in Scripture to be uſed
Generally by Spiritual <hi>Superiours,</hi> to
ſignifie their Deſire, that the Bleſsing,
Guift or Power, may be conferred on
the Inferiour, for which they have a
call to mediate. Proved. Particllarly,
1. We find in Scripture a Bleſsing of
Church-members, with laying on of
hands. 2. And that the Holy Ghoſt is
in a ſpecial manner promiſed to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
over and above that meaſure of
the Spirit, which cauſed them to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
3. And that Praier, with lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands, was the outward means
to be uſed by Chriſts Miniſters, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
this, or inveſting them of it.
4. And that this was not a temporary,
but fixed Ordinance. All proved. <hi>How</hi>
the Holy Ghoſt is given <hi>before Faith,</hi>
and after Faith, and how ſealed in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and how not? What Hope of
the ſucceſs of Impoſition, with Praier
<pb facs="tcp:120705:11"/>
for the ſpirit. Scripture and Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for it. Reaſons for the non-neceſsity
of it to the the ſcrupulous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP.</hi> XIV. Though in receiving Adult-perſons
out of Infidelity by Baptiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church; a ſudden Profeſsion,
without any ſtay to ſee their Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may ſerve turne, yet in receiving
theſe that were Baptized heretofore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the number of Adult-members, or
to the Priviledges of ſuch, their lives
muſt be enquired after, which muſt be
ſuch as do not confute their Profeſsion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP.</hi> XV. It is not of flat Neceſsity,
that the Profeſsion of the Expectant be
made in the open Congregation, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
many, in order to his Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or admittance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP.</hi> XVI. When a perſon is admitted
an Adult-member of a particular
Church, as well as of the Univerſal,
his Profeſsion and Admiſsion muſt be
either before the Church, or ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily
<pb facs="tcp:120705:12"/>
made known to the Church, at
leaſt, who muſt approve of it by a
Judgment of diſcretion, in order to
their Communion with him: and this
among us is the ordinary caſe; becauſe
it is the duty of all, that have opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to joyne themſelves to ſome particu-Church,
and it is in ſuch Churches, that
Communion in publique Worſhip and
order muſt be had, either ſtatedly, or
tranſiently and temporarily. Reaſons to
prove this Intereſt of the People. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of difference between Paſtours and
people reſolved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP.</hi> XVII. It is convenient (though
not of neceſsity) that every Church
do keep a Regiſter of all that are thus
Inveſted, or admitted into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Adult-members.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP.</hi> XVIII. Thoſe that were never thus
Miniſterially and Explicitly Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
Confirmed, or Abſolved (after
an ungodly life) but have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
without it, to joyne uſually with
<pb facs="tcp:120705:12"/>
the Church in prayer and praiſes, and
the Lords Supper, are Approved and
Confirmed, eminently, though not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
though in ſo doing, both the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
and themſelves might ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, by the violation of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
order. Such therefore may be a true
Church, and are not to be called back
to ſolemn Confirmation, though in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
caſes they may be called to Tryall by
their Overſeers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP.</hi> XIX. So exceeding great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are the Miſchiefs that have befallen
us by the neglect of a ſolemn meet Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
from an Infant into the Adult
Church-ſtate, and which undoubtedly
will continue till this be remedied, that
all the Magiſtrates, Miniſters &amp; people,
that diſſemble not in profeſsing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be Chriſtians, ſhould with ſpeed
and diligence attempt the cure. The ſtate
of our Pariſhes anatomized. Twenty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
miſchiefs, that follow the
taking all into our Church-communion,
<pb facs="tcp:120705:13"/>
and neglecting this Confirmation: ſuch
as all Chriſtians ſhould lay to heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP.</hi> XX. So many and great are the
Benefits that would follow the generall
practice of this duty of trying, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and confirming (or Abſolving)
all thoſe that enter into the number of
Adult-Chriſtians, that it ſhould migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
provoke all Chriſtian Magiſtrates,
Miniſters, and people to joyne in a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and vigorous execution of it. Twelve
excellent Benefits that will come by
Confirmation. It's like to be an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
increaſer of knowledg, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Church-Reformation. It's a

            <p>Twenty Objections againſt this Approved
Profeſsion and Confirmation, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
How little reaſon have Princes,

here from overdoing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:120705:13"/>
The Duties that lie upon us all, for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of this Work: and 1. on Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
1. We ſhould Agree upon an
unanimous performance. 2. In thoſe
Agreements, we muſt leave men to
their Liberty in all unneceſſary modes,
and circumſtances. 3. In taking mens
profeſsion, we muſt avoid both extreams,
<hi>viz.</hi> Looſe formality, and overmuch
4. What courſe muſt be taken with all
our Pariſhe, where ſome have without a
Perſonal Approved Profeſsion already
been admitted to the Lords Supper and
ſome not particularly opened? 5. We
muſt require of all the notoriouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
a Penitent Confeſsion in order to
Abſolution, as well as a Profeſsion of
Faith, and future obedience. 6. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates
to be choſen by particular
Churches, to meet with the Paſtours
for thoſe and other Church-affaires.
7. The Paſtours and Churches ſhould be
all Aſſociated, and the Churches that
we hold Communion with, differenced
from the reſt: that thoſe that are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb facs="tcp:120705:14"/>
and Received by them, may be
capable of Communion with all. 8. We
muſt be diligent in publike and private
Teaching the Catechumens, and walk
inoffenſively, condeſcendingly and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantly
among them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Duty of the People, eſpecially the
Godly, in order to this Work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Magiſtrates Duty hereto. 1. To
cauſe thoſe People that are unfit for
Church-Communion, to live quietly
in the ſtate of Expectants, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to publique and perſonal Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and Catechizing, to prepare
them. 2. To compel Miniſters thus to
Teach and Catechize them, and ſee that
great Pariſhes have ſo many Teachers
as may be able to do it. Reaſons for
compelling us. 3. To lay ſome penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on all Paſtors, that will not guide
the Church by Diſcipline, as well as
preach: Not forbidding them to be
Preachers, but to be Paſtours and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
Sacraments, that will not do
it, as Chriſt hath appointed. To theſe
<pb facs="tcp:120705:14"/>
ends it may do well, for the Magiſtrate
to have his Agent or Church-Juſtice
to joyne in the Church-meetings, and
to inform the Commiſsioners for Eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
who may be impowred hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
4. To promote and command
the Aſsociations and correſpondencies
of Paſtours and Churches. With what
limitations, and to what ends. 5. It
would much further this Work, if Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
were appointed in all parts to ſee
it done, or put on Miniſters: Not that
any Miniſters ſhould have a Power of
ſilencing, ſuſpending, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to
let a Civil Viſitor, and a Viſitor of
the Miniſtry be ſtill joyned together, and
let the Miniſter have only a power to
perſwade, and the other as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
to compell, or to bring the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which are exempt from his power,
to the Superiour Commiſsioners. 6. It's
the unqueſtionable Duty of Magiſtrates
(not to drive men to Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that are unmeet, but) to reſtraine
Seducers, from taking advantage of
<pb facs="tcp:120705:15"/>
their diſcontents and drawing them
away, while they remaine Expectants:
Ten Reaſons, that deſerve the ſerious
conſideration of the Magiſtrate, that
ſhew the great Neceſsity of this his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
aſsiſtance, for keeping of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
eſpecially Papists, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the prophane and ignorant
people in quietneſs and ſubmiſsion to
inſtruction in an expectant ſtate till
they are fit for Church-Communion.
7. To ſatisfie the Magiſtrate that is
afraid of perſecution, certain Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Toleration are propounded.
1. Let all that pretend ſcruple of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the perſonal or publique Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Teacher of the Pariſh where
he lives, be compelled to ſubmit to ſome
one elſe, who may give it under his hand
that he takes that care of him. 2. Let
Commiſsioners be appointed (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws given them) to guard
the door of Toleration, as now they
are to guard the door of publique Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
and Maintenance: and let
<pb facs="tcp:120705:15"/>
none be Tolerated to preach or openly
perſwade (though for nothing) that
have not an Inſtrument of Licence
ſealed by theſe Commiſsioners: Or elſe
Blaſphemers and Heathens may preach
for all your Laws againſt them. 3. Let
thoſe that have a ſealed Toleration be
as reſponſible to the Commiſsioners, for
their violating the Laws of their
Toleration, as we are for breaking the
Laws that bind us: and let their Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
be forfeitable, as well as our
Maintenance. Reaſons for this. To
conclude, if as before the daies of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
the Conquerour, Magiſtrates and
Miniſters might ſit together, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
having no power but to perſwade,
and the Magiſtrate the ſole power of
Compulſion, and ſo 1. Approvers keep
the door of Toleration. 2. A Church
Juſtice, or Agent of the Magiſtrates
keep the peace of every Church, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.
3. And the Civil and Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Viſiters aforeſaid ſhall be appointed
to take Cogniſance of the ſtate of
<pb facs="tcp:120705:16"/>
Pariſhes. 4. And the Commiſsioners
for Ejection of ſcandalous Miniſters,
be equally enabled to eject the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and blaſphemous from their To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration;
the Magiſtrate might aſsiſt
us without danger of perſecution.</p>

ſuch as the wiſeſt have cauſe to

our endeavours to redreſs. And for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of this bleſſed Work, two
things muſt be done: The firſt is, to Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Principles that muſt Reform and heal
us, if ever we be healed; and to acquaint
the world with the neceſſary means. The
ſecond is, to concur for the execution, in the
application and uſe of the Remedie, when it
is diſcovered. The firſt is a work, that is
uſually done beſt by a few at firſt: Though
the more Receive and Approve of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
the better it will be brought into
uſe. But it's here, ſaith <hi>Pemble,</hi> as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning
a thing a farre off, where one clear
eye will ſee further then many that are dimme,
and the greateſt conjunction of unfurniſhed
intellects affords not ſo much aſſiſtance for
the Diſcovery, as the greater ſight of a few
may do. But in the executive, part, there
muſt be many hands to the work. If the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
and people do not conſent, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

be accompliſhed; and if they barely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

will lie dead, and nothing will go on: And
if the Chriſtian Magiſtrate afford not his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
his Guilt will be great, and the work
will go the more heavily on. Though all
the body be not an Eye, and therefore be
not as good at Diſcovering as the Eye is; yet
muſt each member perform its own office,
and none be idle, or withdraw its helpe,
becauſe it is not an Eye; but all muſt execute
by the Guidance of the Eye.</p>
               <p>In order to the Diſcovery of the Healing
Meanes, among others, this Rule is worthy our

a mutual ſolemn Covenant.</p>
               <p>The Servants of God before Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
were enabled and required to enter their
Infants into the Covenant of God, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
(and ordinarily) in Circumciſion, and
ſometime (as in the wilderneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29)
without it. And they have the ſame <hi>Natural
Intereſt,</hi> and as <hi>large a diſcovery</hi> that <hi>it's the
W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll of God,</hi> for the <hi>Dedicating</hi> of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to God, and <hi>Chooſing</hi> for them, and
<hi>entering them into the holy Covenant,</hi> now as
then. If <hi>then</hi> a Child that had no exerciſe of
its <hi>own will,</hi> might by the <hi>Will of his Parents
chooſe the Lord,</hi> and be <hi>entered into Covenant</hi>
with him, it is then ſo ſtill. God hath no
where reverſt or abrogated that Command,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:120705:19"/>
which obliged Parents to enter their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
into Covenant with God, and Devote
them to him. Nay Chriſt chid thoſe that
would keep them from him, becauſe his
Kingdom, that is, his Church, is of ſuch.
A place that doth purpoſely and plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the continuance of his Love to Infants,
and yet the Goſpel entertaineth them as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
as the Law or Promiſe before did. Oft
and again doth Chriſt ſignifie to the <hi>Jews</hi>
that he would have gathered them wholly to
his Church, and not have broken them off,
if they had not by unbelief been broken off,
and in the ſame Olive hath he engraffed the
Gentile Church. Infants are members of all
Commonwealths on the face of the earth,
though they know not what a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
is, nor yet what ſoveraignty or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
mean. And he that ſhould ſay they
are no members, becauſe they are Imperfect
members, would but be laughed at. And
Chriſt hath not caſt them out of his family
or Commonwealth, nor ſhut the door a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them.</p>
               <p>And that in this Infant ſtate they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of many Priviledges is apparent. They
have Original ſinne, which muſt be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
or they are loſt. Moſt of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi>
that I hear of, do hold that all the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:120705:20"/>
Infants in the world are pardoned by Chriſt,
and ſhall be ſaved if they die in Infancy, and
run in the downright <hi>Pelagian</hi> road. But
this is not only utterly unproved, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Scripture, which telleth us, that
ſinne is not pardoned by the bloodſhed of
Chriſt, till men be brought into Union with
him, and participation of him, and for
all his bloodſhed, no man ſhall have pardon
by it, till it be given him by the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
in the Goſpel. Now the Goſpel no
where gives out Pardon to every Infant in
the world: Nay it frequently and plainly
makes a difference. The Parents <hi>Will</hi> doth
<hi>Accept</hi> the offer, and chooſe for them that
cannot chooſe for themſelves. For others,
what ever God will do with them, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they have no promiſe of Mercy. And it's
ſtrange that they ſhould deny Baptiſm to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
that deny not Salvation to them, yea
that think (though ungroundedly) that
they are all in a ſtate of Salvation. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Infants have Original ſinne, or not:
If they have none, then they need no Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and muſt be ſaved without a Saviour;
for the <hi>whole</hi> need not the Phyſician, but the
<hi>ſick.</hi> If they have Original ſinne, and that it
is pardoned to them by Chriſt, then how
can men deny them the ſign and ſeale of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:120705:20"/>
or the ſolemn inveſting means. If they
are ſure that they are waſht with Chriſt's
Blood, how can they deny to waſh them
with that water, that is appointed to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and inveſt?</p>
               <p>Moreover, Infants are capable of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Priveledges; and of being the Adopted
Sonnes of God, the Members of Chriſt, the
Heirs of Heaven, as having Right thereto;
and being the members of the Church, and
being under the Special Protection and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of God, and in a ſpecial ſort parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the Prayers of the Church, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
more. As in the Commonwealth, an
Infant is capable of having Honour and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
in Right, though not Actally to uſe
them; and of the protection of the Laws for
Life, Reputation and eſtate; and of being
Tenant, and obliged to pay a certain Rent
and Homage when he comes to age, and in
the mean time to have Proviſions from the
Eſtate that he hath Title to.</p>
               <p>But all this I have fuller expreſt elſewhere:
And I have altely read M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Tombes</hi>'s laſt and
large Reply, to part of my Book, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others; and muſt needs ſay that it leaves
me ſtill perſwaded that it is the will of Chriſt
that the Infants of his Servants ſhould be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to him in Baptiſm, and members of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:120705:21"/>
his viſible Church; and though upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of my Arguments I find that I have uſed
too many provoaking words, for which I
am heartily ſorry, and deſire pardon of God
and him, yet I muſt ſay, that I am left more
confident then before, that the cauſe is Gods
which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Tombes</hi> oppoſeth: Of which if

it is not <hi>Eccleſia, caetus evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus;</hi>
and then <hi>Heathens</hi> and
<hi>Infidels</hi> have right; which are
things that no Chriſtian, I

Not by <hi>Name;</hi> for we find the contrary.
Scripture doth not <hi>Name</hi> all that have Title
to Church Priviledges. If it be by <hi>Deſcription,</hi>
it is either by meer <hi>Phyſical,</hi> or by <hi>Moral</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications

if <hi>Prerequiſite,</hi> then either as <hi>Means</hi> or <hi>no

going againſt ſo much light, as ordinary
Chriſtians have ſtill ready at hand to confute
them with: And if they are required as
<hi>Means,</hi> then either as <hi>Cauſes</hi> or <hi>Conditions:</hi>
And I think you will ſooner yield them to be
<hi>Conditions</hi> then <hi>Cauſes,</hi> though either Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
ſufficeth to the end that is before us.</p>
               <p>But of this we need to ſay no more, both
becauſe it is commonly confeſſed, and becauſe
that the words of the Promiſes are ſo plaine,
and undenyable, being uttered in Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
terms.</p>
               <p>Nor is this either inconſiſtent with, or
any way unſuitable to an <hi>Abſolute Decree:</hi>
For as a <hi>Threatning,</hi> ſo the <hi>Conditionality of
a Promiſe,</hi> are <hi>Inſtruments</hi> admirably ſuited
to the accompliſhment of an <hi>Abſolute Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>
or Decree. He that is fully Reſolved to
ſave us, or to give us the Priviledges of his
Church, will deal with us as men, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to the poſſeſſion of the intended bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits;
and therefore will by <hi>Threats and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional

promiſes</hi> excite us to a careful perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Condition: and that Grace which
is <hi>reſolved</hi> to <hi>effect</hi> the very <hi>Condition</hi> in us,
is alſo reſolved to make a <hi>Conditional Promiſe,</hi>
yea and a <hi>Threatening</hi> the <hi>Inſtrument of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Note, that the great Queſtion, whether
all the Infants of true Believers are certainly
Juſtified, or whether ſome of them have but
lower Priviledges, is not here to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but, in a fitter place: And therefore I
determine not what Priviledges they are that
will ceaſe, if our Infant Title ceaſe. But that
according to the tenour of the Promiſe, the
Continuance of them, with the Addition of
the Priviledges proper to the Adult, are all
laid upon a New Condition.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Note alſo, that when I call it another or
different Condition, I mean not that it is
different in the Nature of the Act, but in the
Agent or Subject. It is the ſame kind of Faith
which at firſt is required in the <hi>Parent,</hi> for
the Childs behoof, and that afterward is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in <hi>our ſelves.</hi> But the Condition of
the Infants Title is but this, that <hi>he be the
Child of a Believer. Dedicated to God:</hi> But
the Condition of the Title of perſons at Age
is, that they be <hi>themſelves Believers,</hi> that
have Dedicated themſelves to God. The
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:120705:24"/>
Faith of the Parent, is the Condition of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
Title; and the Faith of the perſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
is the Condition of the Title of one
at Age.</p>
               <p>That <hi>their own Faith</hi> is not the Condition
of an Infants Title, I think I need not prove:
For 1. They are uncapable of Believing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Miracle: 2. If they were not (as ſome
<hi>Lutherans</hi> fondly think). yet it's certain that
we are uncapable of diſcerning by ſuch a ſign.
I think no Miniſter that I know will judge
what Infants do themſelves believe, that he
may baptiſe them. 3. And I think no man
that looks on the Command, or Promiſe,
and the Perſon of an Infant, will judge that
he is either Commanded then to believe, or
that his Believing is made the Condition of
his Infant Title.</p>
               <p>But that a <hi>Perſonal Believing</hi> is the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
of the <hi>Title of them at Age,</hi> is as farre
paſt doubt: and it's proved thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg. 1.</hi> The <hi>Promiſe</hi> it ſelf doth expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a Faith of our own, of all the Adult
that will have part in the Priviledges: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a Faith of our Own that is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of our Title, <hi>Mark 16 16. He that
Believeth and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved, and
he that Believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Act. <hi>8.
36, 37. And the Eunuch ſaid, See here is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:120705:24"/>
what doth hinder me to be baptized? And
Philip ſaid, If thou believeſt with all thy
heart, thou maiſt,</hi> Act. <hi>2. 38, 41. Repent
and be baptized every one of you in the Name of
Jeſus Chriſt for the Remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>Then they that gladly received his word were

15.</hi> &amp; 30. 32, 33. Rom. <hi>10. 12, 13, 14.</hi>With many other Texts, do put this out of
doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 2. We were engaged in our
Infant baptiſmal Covenant to Believe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
when we came to Age, as a means to
our reception of the Benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
proper to the Adult: therefore we
muſt perform our Covenant, and uſe this
means, if we will have the benefits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If another Condition were not
of Neceſſity to the Aged, beſide the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that was neceſſary to them in Infancy,
then <hi>Turks, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> ſhould
have right to Church-memberſhip, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the Adult: But the Conſequent is
notoriouſly falſe: therefore ſo is the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of the Conſequent is evident.
Becauſe a man that hath believing <hi>Parents,</hi>
may turn <hi>Turk</hi> (as is known in thouſands of
<hi>Janizaries</hi>) or <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Pagan:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:120705:25"/>
if it were enough, that he was the
Child of a Believer, his Title to Church Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
would ſtill continue. And ſo among
profeſſed Chriſtians, the Child of a Believer
may turn <hi>Heretick,</hi> or notoriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and ſcandalous, and yet have Title to
Church Priviledges, if his firſt Title ſtill hold,
and a perſonal Faith be not a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his Right. Adde to theſe the many
Arguments tending to confirm the point in
hand, which I have laid down on another
occaſion in my D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſputations of Right to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.
But I think I need not ſpend more
words to perſwade any Chriſtians, that our
Parents Faith will not ſerve to give us Title
to the Church Priviledges of the Adult, but
we loſe our Right even to Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
it ſelf, if when we come to Age, we
adde not a perſonal Faith (or profeſſion at

               <p>I only adde that this is a truth ſo farre paſt

               <p>THis Propoſition alſo, as the Sunne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth

diſcoveries of the heart, by outward ſignes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If Profeſſion of Faith were not
neceſſary <hi>Coram Eccleſiâ</hi> to mens Church-memberſhip
and Priviledges, then Infidels
and Heathens would have Right, as was
ſaid in the former caſe, and alſo the Church
and the world would be confounded, and the
Church would be no Church: But theſe are
conſequents that I hope no Chriſtians will
have a favourable thought of: and therefore
they ſhould reject the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. It is a granted caſe among all
Chriſtians, that Profeſſion is thus neceſſary:
the Apoſtles and Ancient Churches admitted
none without it: nor no more muſt we.
Though all require not the ſame <hi>manner</hi> of
Profeſſion, yet that <hi>Profeſſion</hi> it ſelf is the
leaſt that can be required of any man, that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
claim to Church Priviledges and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
proper to Adult members: this we
are all agreed in, and therefore I need not
adde more proof, where I find no Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
               <p>But yet as commonly as we are agreed on
this, yet becauſe it is the very point which
moſt of the ſtreſs of our preſent Diſputation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:120705:27"/>
lieth on, it may not be amiſs to foreſee what
may poſſibly be Objected by any new comers
hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Perhaps ſome may ſay, 1. That
we find no mention of Profeſſions required
in Scripture: 2. It is not probable that
<hi>Peter</hi> received a Profeſſion from thoſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
whom he ſo ſuddenly Baptized. 3 Our
Churches have been true Churches without
ſuch a Profeſſion, perſonally and diſtinctly
made: therefore it may be ſo ſtill. To theſe
briefly, yet ſatisfactorily.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture gives us abundant proof
that a plain Profeſſion was made in thoſe
times by ſuch as were baptized at Age, and
ſo admitted (by reaſon of their ripeneſs and
capacity) into the Church, and to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Communion and Priviledges of the
Adult at once. To ſay much of the times of
the old Teſtament, or before Chriſt, would
be but to interrupt you with leſs pertinent
things: Yet there it is apparent, that all the
people were ſolemnly engaged in Covenant
with God, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> more then once:
and that this was renewed by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and
other godly Princes; and that <hi>Aſa</hi> made the
people not only <hi>enter into a Covenant to ſeek
the Lord God of their fathers, with all their
hearts, and with all their Soul: But that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:120705:27"/>
whoſoever would not ſeek him ſhould be put to
death, whether ſmal or great, man or woman:
And they ſware to the Lord with a loud voice,
and with ſhoutings, and with trumpets, and
with cornets,</hi> 2 Chron. 15. 12, 13, 14. So
following Princes called the people to this
open Covenanting. But this is not all: To
take <hi>the Lord only to be their God,</hi> (with the
reſt of the Law) was the very eſſence of an
<hi>Iſarelites</hi> Religion, which they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
openly Profeſs, but exceſſively ſometimes
glory in. As Circumciſion ſealed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
(and therefore ſuppoſed the Covenant)
to Infants and aged whoever were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
ſo had they many ſorts of Sacrifice, and
other worſhip, in which they all were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to profeſs the ſame Religion and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Many Purifications alſo, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyings
of the people they had: and many fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of the Covenant. <hi>I am the Lord thy
God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me,</hi> &amp;c. was the tenour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> expreſsly and by
frequent acts profeſſed to conſent to: The
Law is called a Covenant, which all were to
own, and avouch the Lord to be their God,
and themſelves his people. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17,

               <p>And yet I hope no Chhiſtian would wiſh
that we ſhould deal no more openly and
clearly with God, the Church, and our
ſelves, in daies of Goſpel Light and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
then the <hi>Jews</hi> were to do in their
darker ſtate, under obſcure Types and
ſhadows.</p>
               <p>We find that when <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſet up his
Miniſtry, he cauſed the people to <hi>Cenfeſs their
ſinnes,</hi> Matth. 3. 6. And <hi>if we confeſs our
ſinnes, God is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our
ſinnes,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 19. And whereas ſome ſay,
that <hi>John</hi> Baptized them, that he calleth <hi>a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of Vipers;</hi> I Anſwer, 1. We will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that when they prove it. It ſeems rather
that he put them back. 2. If he did Baptize
them, it was not till they <hi>Confeſſed their
ſinnes</hi> (before that all did,) and it ſeems by
his charge, till they promiſed to <hi>bring forth
fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> Matth. 3. 8.</p>
               <p>Chriſt would not have ſo inſtructed <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi>
in the Nature and neceſſity of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
before he was a Diſciple, if a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
or Apparent preparation had not been
neceſſary. Nor would he ordinarily have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:120705:28"/>
taught men the Neceſſity of <hi>denying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
and <hi>forſaking all for a treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
with ſuch like, if they would be his
Diſciples, if the Profeſſion of ſo doing had
not been Neceſſary, to their viſible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipleſhip.</p>
               <p>I grant that ſo full a Profeſſion was not
made before Chriſts Reſurrection as after:
For many Articles of our Belief were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
made Neceſſary: And the Apoſtles
themſelves were unacquainted with what the
weakeſt Chriſtian did afterwards believe. But
ſtill the Eſſentials of Faith, then Neceſſary in
exiſtence to mens Juſtification, were Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
in Profeſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> mens viſible Chriſtianity
or Church-memberſhip.</p>
               <p>As to thoſe <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 37. &amp;c. It is plain,
that they made an open Profeſſion, if you
Conſider 1. That they were openly told the
Doctrine which they muſt be baptized into,
if they did conſent: 2. It is ſaid, <hi>They that
gladly received that word, were baptized.</hi>
3. It is certain therefore that they firſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
their <hi>glad reception of the Word.</hi> 4. We
may not imagine that <hi>Peter</hi> was God, or
knew the hearts of all thoſe thouſands, and
therefore he muſt know it by their Profeſſion,
that <hi>they gladly received the Word.</hi> 5. Their
own mouths cry out for advice in order to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:120705:29"/>
their Salvation. 6. It had been abſurd for
the Apoſtles to attempt to baptize men, that
had not firſt profeſſed their Conſent. 7. The
Scripture gives us not the full hiſtorical Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all that was ſaid and done in ſuch
Caſes, but of ſo much as was Neceſſary.
8. The Inſtitution and Nature of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
tells us, that Baptiſm could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
without a Profeſſion, to the Adult:
For they were to be <hi>Baptzed into the Name
of Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and
therefore were to profeſs that they <hi>believed
in Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Yea the
very <hi>receiving</hi> of Baptiſm was an <hi>Actuall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi>
9. The conſtant Practice of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church, hath given us by <hi>infallible Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
as full aſſurance of the order of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and in particular of an Exprſs Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and Covenant then made, as of any
point that by the hands of the Church can be
received by us. 10. And it was in thoſe
daies a more notorious Profeſſion to be ſo
Baptized, and to joyn in the holy Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
then now it is. When the Profeſſion
of Chriſtianity did hazard mens liberties,
eſtates, and lives, to be openly then Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
upon Covenanting with God the Father,
Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, and openly joyn
with a hated, perſecuted ſort of men, was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:120705:29"/>
an eminent ſort of Profeſſion. It being alſo
uſually Private in houſes, as ſeparated from
the main body of the people, and not in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
places like ours, where men are (juſtly)
driven to come as leaners for inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it's ſaid of all that were Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
(being then at Age) that they firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved:
And how could the Baptizers know
that they believed, but by their Profeſſion:
Yea, it's ſaid of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that he Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and was Baptized; which (though he
might really have ſome hiſtorical Faith, yet)
implyeth, that he openly Profeſſed more then
he indeed had, or elſe he had ſcarce been
Baptized. Which hath cauſed Interpreters
to judge, that by <hi>Faith</hi> is meant <hi>a Profeſſion of
Faith.</hi> And if ſo, then ſure a Profeſſion
was ſtill Neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Yea, Chriſt in his Commiſſion directeth
his Apoſtles to <hi>make Diſciples,</hi> and then <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
them;</hi> promiſing, that <hi>he that believeth
and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And who can
tell whether a man be a <hi>Diſciple,</hi> a <hi>Believer,</hi>
or an <hi>Infidel,</hi> but by his Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>How was it known but by their Profeſſion,
that <hi>the Samaritans Believed Philip, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the things concerning the Kingdom of God,
and the Name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> before they
were <hi>Baptized both men and women?</hi> Act. 8. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:120705:30"/>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> cauſed the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to profeſs before
he would Baptiſe him, that he <hi>believed
that Jeſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God;</hi> which
upon his teaching the reſt, did import the
reſt, if it were not more fully (as is likeſt)
Profeſſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 8 37, 38.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> had more then a bare Profeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 5, 15, 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company had a Profeſſion
and more, for they had the Holy Ghoſt
powred on them, <hi>ſpeaking with tongues,</hi> and
<hi>magnifying God:</hi> (that uſe of the gift of
tongues imparting more then the gift it ſelf,)
<hi>Acts</hi> 10. 46. Yea, the Spirit bid <hi>Peter,
Go and not doubt,</hi> Acts 11. 12 And it was
ſuch a gift of the Spirit, as cauſed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
to conclude, that <hi>God had granted the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
Repentance unto life,</hi> Acts 11. 18.</p>
               <p>How was it known but by their Profeſſion?
<hi>Acts</hi> 11. 21. That that <hi>great number Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved

               <p>And when <hi>Saul</hi> after his Baptiſm <hi>aſſayed
to joyn himſelf to the Diſciples at Jeruſalem,</hi>
they ſo ſuſpected him, that they would not
receive him, till <hi>Barnabas</hi> took him and
brought him to the Apoſtles, and declared
to them, how God had dealt with him, and
how boldly at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> he had preached in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:120705:30"/>
the Name of Jeſus; which ſhews that they
admitted not men to their Communion, till
their <hi>Profeſſion</hi> ſeemed <hi>Credible</hi> to them.
For no doubt but <hi>Saul</hi> told them himſelf that
he was a Believer, before he was put to make
uſe of the teſtimony of <hi>Barnabas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Converted Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48.
ſhewed their <hi>Belief and gladneſs,</hi> and openly
<hi>glorified the Word of the Lord.</hi> How but by
a Profeſſion did it come to paſs, that the <hi>great

were known to be Believers,</hi> Acts 14. 1.
The ſame I may ſay of the Jaylour, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.

               <p>In a word, it is the ſtanding Rule, that <hi>If

               <p>To this let me adde, that <hi>Poenitentiam age<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was judged by the Ancient Doctours, the

               </p>
               <p>Gods order is (to the Adult) firſt to ſend
Preachers to proclaim the Goſpel; and when
by that men are brought ſo farre, as to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
or manifeſt that <hi>their cies are opened, and
that they are turned from darkneſs to light,
and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> then
muſt they be <hi>Baptized,</hi> for <hi>the Remiſſion of
their ſinnes, and to receive the Inheritance
among the Sanctified by Faith in Chriſt,</hi> Acts
26. 17. 18.</p>
               <p>As their <hi>ſinnes are not forgiven</hi> them till

Seeing to the Church <hi>non eſſe, &amp; non ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parere</hi>
is all one. <hi>Repentance towards God,

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:120705:31"/>
the ſumme of that Preaching that maketh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21. And therefore both
theſe muſt by Profeſſion ſeem to be received,
before any at age are Baptized.</p>
               <p>If as many as are Baptized into Chriſt, are
Baptized into his death; and are buried with
him by Baptiſm into his death, that like as
Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, ſo we alſo
ſhould walk in Newneſs of life, <hi>Rom. 6. 4, 5.
Then no doubt but ſuch as were to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
did firſt Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a conſent to be buried and revived with
Chriſt, and to live to him in Newneſs of life.
For</hi> Paul <hi>was never ſo much for the</hi> Opus
operatum <hi>above the</hi> Papſts, <hi>as to think that the
Baptizing of an Infidel, might effect theſe
high and excellent things. And he that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
not Faith, nor ever did, is to the
Church an Infidel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In our Baptiſm <hi>we put off the body of the
ſinnes of the fleſh, by the Circumciſion of
Chriſt, being buried with him, and riſing
with him through Faith—quickned with
him, and having all our treſpaſſes forgiven,</hi>
Col. 3. 11, 12, 13. And will any man, yea, will
<hi>Paul,</hi> aſcribe all this to thoſe that did not ſo
much as <hi>Profeſs</hi> the things ſignified, or the
neceſſary Condition? Will Baptiſm, in the
judgment of a wiſe man, do all this for an

Infidel, or one that Profeſſeth not to be a
Chriſtian?</p>
               <p>Baptiſm is ſaid to <hi>ſave us,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21.

                  <hi>As many as have been Baptized into Chriſt,
have put on Chriſt, and are all one in Chriſt
Jeſus: and are Abrahams Seed, and Heirs,
according to promiſe,</hi> Gal. 3. 27, 28, 29. This
ſpeaks the Apoſtle of the <hi>Probability</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on a <hi>credible Profeſſion.</hi> And therefore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
is clear, that the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> was preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that might ſupport this charitable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Our Baptiſm is the <hi>Solemnizing</hi> of
our <hi>Marriage with Chriſt.</hi> And its a new
and ſtrang kind of Marriage, where there is
no Profeſſion of Conſent.</p>

The Baptized are in Scripture called men
<hi>Waſhed, Sanctified, Juſtified,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 6.
11. 1 Cor. 14. 33. They are all called
<hi>Saints, and Churches of Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.
2. All Chriſtians are called <hi>Sanctified ones, or
Saints;</hi> therefore its certaine that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed

               <p>But why ſhould I go any further in this,
when the main ſubſtance of my Diſpute of
Right to the Sacraments proves it? I intreat
the Reader that would have more, to prove
not only the Neceſſity of a Profeſſion, but
alſo of the Profeſſion of a Saving Faith, to
peruſe that Book, or at leaſt the ſecond Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation,
where are Twenty Arguments
for it; and the ſence of all the Ancient
Churches there cited out of Mr <hi>Gatakers</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections.
See alſo Dr <hi>Hammonds</hi> many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
to prove the uſe of the <hi>Abrenuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Paraeneſ.</hi> pag. 18, 19, 20. I love not
needleſly to recite whath others have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
cited. But he that knows not, that the
Univerſal Church from the daies of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
hath baptized the Adult, upon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Profeſſion of Faith, and Repentance,
and Vow, or Promiſe, or Covenant for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
knows little of what the Church
hath Practiſed. And I hope few ſober men
will be found that will be ſo ſingular and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:120705:33"/>
as to contradict the Practiſe of
the Univerſal Church in ſuch a caſe as this,
and ſet up their own private judgment againſt
it, and go about to perſwade us to a new
way of Church enterance, and admiſſion,
now in the end of the world. Blame me not
to be confident with you, where I have ſo
good ground as Scripture, and ſo good
company, as the Primitive Univerſal Church.</p>
               <p>To this let me adde, that moſt, or too
many, that we are to receive to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of Adult members, have violated their
Baptiſm-Covenant, and proved ungodly
after Baptiſm, and that by open, notorious
Scandals. Now Scripture, and the Practice
of the Univerſal Ancient Church direct us, to
require of theſe an open Confeſſion of ſinne:
For they need an Abſolution, and not a
meer Confirmation. It is paſt all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
that ſuch have both an open Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Profeſſion to make. Yea, how ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
the Ancient Church was of Receiving
and Abſolving ſuch violators of the Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Covenant; and on how ſevere terms
they did it, is known to all, that know any
thing of thoſe times. I pray amongſt others
ſee what <hi>Grotius (Diſcuſ. Apol. Rivet.</hi> pag.
221, 222.) citeth from <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,
Pacimus, Hierom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ad</hi> pag. 235. <hi>n.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:120705:33"/>
And as to the laſt Objection (that <hi>our
Churches were true Churches, when we made
no particular Profeſſions.</hi>) I Anſwer 1. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome Profeſſion of true Chriſtianity, our
Churches could not have been true Churches.
And therefore againſt thoſe that would prove
them no Churches, we plead (and juſtly)
that a Profeſſion was made by them. 2. But
I pray you mark, that that will prove a
Church to be a true Church, which will not
prove every perſon in the Pariſh, to be a true
Member of that Church. 3. And he that
thinks it enough, that our Churches have a
meer Metaphyſical Verity, (ſuch as Biſhop
<hi>Hall,</hi> and multitudes of Learned Proteſtants
allow the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf) is as good
a friend to it, as he is to his wife or child,
that will let them go naked; yea, and be
contented, that they catch the plague, or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie,
yea, and plead for it too; and all,
becauſe they have ſtill the Truth of Humane
Nature.</p>
               <p>I know that any thing that may truly be
called a Profeſſion, will (in that point)
ſeem to prove the Being of the Church. But
as it will not ſeem to prove the well-being;
ſo an obſcure Profeſſion doth but obſcurely
prove the Being of it: which an open, plain
Profeſſion doth more clearly prove. Let us
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120705:34"/>
not befriend either the Kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or the Seperatiſts ſo much, as to leave
our Churches ſo open to their exceptions,
and ſo apt to cheriſh and befriend their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and infidelity of the world. If com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Church, and ſitting there be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a probable argument, that men do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
believe, as that Church believes; yet,
it's a very dark proof, that they underſtand
what the Church believes: eſpecially when
experience hath acquainted us with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
of many of them.</p>
               <p>But now I have ſaid this much for a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and plain Profeſſion, I would faine know
what any man hath againſt it. The Church
through the great mercy of God, hath yet
liberty to uſe it. And we ſee how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
make a blind kind of ſhew of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
going from one publike duty to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and knowing not what
they do.<note place="margin">

that they ſhould be brought
out into the open light, and
ſee their way? If Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghoſt, be the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of our Chriſtianity; in
the Name of God, I deſire
you to conſider whether it be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:120705:34"/>
a thing to be hudled up in the
dark? Unleſs it be mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to hide the Nature of
Chriſtianity, and keep peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in deſtructive ignorance,
and delude their Souls with a
name and ſhew of a Religion,
which they underſtand not;
they will ſurely be willing that
men ſhould know the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
that they make, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what they do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they enter into a Marriage
bond with Chriſt, (if at Age)
or own it, if they have been entered in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Why ſhould we chooſe Darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then Light? Why ſhould an Implicit
Covenant and Profeſſion be pleaded for?
when the being of a Profeſſion is <hi>palam fateri,</hi>
openly to make known; and when we know
by ſad experience, that when we have all
done the beſt we can, to make our ignorant
people underſtand, we ſhall find enough ado
to accompliſh it. Ignorance hath no need of
frendſhip: eſpecially from Miniſters it deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
none: eſpecially in ſo great a point as
the Covenant that men make with Chriſt.
We have wares that deſerve the light, and
need not a dark ſhop. We have a Maſter
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:120705:35"/>
that we need not be affraid, or aſhamed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
and publickly to confeſs. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemes
not ſo high and honourable a Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as that of a Chriſtian, to be lapt up in
obſcurity. Such a Glorious ſtate as Sonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to God, to be an Heir of Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
ſhould be entered into with great ſolemnity,
and owned accordingly at our firſt rationall
acceptance and acknowledgment. Kings are
Crowned more ſolemnly, then poor men
take poſſeſſion of their cottages. Chriſt
will be aſhamed of them before the Angels,
that are aſhamed of him before men, and
will confeſs them before his Father, that
confeſs him before men. Chriſtianity is not
a game to be plaid under board. Why then
ſhould any be againſt an open Profeſſing,
and Covenanting with Chriſt? If it be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that we Covenant, certainly the plaineſt
and moſt explicite Covenanting is the beſt.
And what will be his portion, that hath a
male in his flock, and offereth the worſt,
yea the halt and blind to God?</p>
               <p>Let us therefore deal as openly, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and underſtandingly in the Covenant of
God as we can, and not contrive it in the
greateſt darkneſs that is conſiſtent with the
Eſſence of a Church. Nay let us not tempt
men to unchurch us, or ſeparate from us,

Qualifications of this Profeſſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>General,</hi> as to the <hi>Object</hi> of our Faith,
it muſt be a <hi>Profeſſion of true Chriſtianity,</hi>
and no leſs. It muſt be a Profeſſion of our
entertainment, both of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the
Goſpel, and of the <hi>Good</hi> therein Revealed
and offered. More particularly, it muſt be
a Profeſſion, that we believe in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, as to the
Nature, perſons, and works, which they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:120705:37"/>
have done or undertaken for us. Yet more
particularly, and explicitly: It muſt be a
Profeſſion, 1. That we Believe in God the
Father, and ſo the pure Deity, as our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour,
Soveraign, and chief Good, who
gave us the Law of Nature, by breaking of
which, we have loſt our ſelves, and all our
part in Everlaſting Life. 2. That we
Believe in Jeſus Chriſt, God and Man,
that taking our Nature, fulfilled the Law,
overcame the Devil, dyed as a Sacrifice for
our ſinnes, Roſe again, and conqured death,
aſcened into Heaven, where he is Lord of
all, and the King, Prophet, and Prieſt of
his Church, in Glory with the Father: That
he hath offered himſelf with Pardon, and
Eternal Life, to all that will accept him, on
his terms: and that he will come again at
laſt to Raiſe us from death, and judge the
world, and Juſtifie his Saints, and bring
them to Eternal Glory, and caſt the wicked
into utter miſery. 3. That we Believe in
God the Holy Ghoſt, that Inſpired the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles, to deliver, and confirm
the Word of God, and who is the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier
of all that ſhall be ſaved, illuminating
their underſtandings; &amp; changing their hearts
and lives, humbling them for their ſinne and
miſery, cauſing them to believe in Chriſt,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:120705:37"/>
the Remedie, and heartily and thankfully
accept him; Poſſeſſing them with an hearty
Love of God, and a heavenly mind, and a
hatred of ſinne, and Love of Holineſs, and
turning the principal bent of their hearts and
lives, to the Pleaſing of God, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of Eternal Life. This much muſt be
believed, and the Belief of this much, muſt
be ſomehow Profeſſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Acts</hi> of the thing Profeſſed, it
muſt be, not only the naked Aſſent of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;
but both this Aſſent that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is true, and a <hi>Conſent</hi> of the Will, to
take God the Father, Sonne, and Holy
Ghoſt, to the forementioned Ends, in the
forementioned Relations; and to give up our
ſelves unfeignedly to him, renouncing the
fleſh, the world, and the Devil.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the Nature of the Profeſſion it
ſelf. 1. It muſt in General be <hi>Credible:</hi> For
no man is bound to Believe that which is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.
The words are the ſigns of the
mind, and as ſuch they are to be uttered, and
received. If they be contrary to the mind,
they are falſe; and if wilfully contrary, they
are a lie: And God doth not make a lie to
be the Condition of Church-memberſhip,
or Priviledges; nor doth he bind his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
or Church, to believe a known lie:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:120705:38"/>
Nothing but Real, or ſeeming truth is to be

More particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Profeſſion which we
ſpeak of, muſt have theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be, or ſeem to be
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding. Ignorant is non
eſt Conſenſus.</hi> If a Parrat
could ſay the Creed, it were
not a Credible Profeſſion of
Faith. Therefore the Ancient
Church was wont by Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſts,
to prepare them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
the Doctrine which
they were to believe, and
profeſs. This is paſt Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.
I think no Miniſter
would take that mans Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that ſeemeth not to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what he ſaith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No Profeſſion is Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but that which is, or
ſeems to be <hi>ſerious.</hi> He that ſpeaks in ſcorn,
or jeſt, is not to be believed, as one that
ſpeaks his mind; nor is it to paſs for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No Profeſſion is credible or ſufficient,
but that which is, or ſeems to be Free and
Voluntary. Though ſome force, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:120705:38"/>
urgencies in ſome caſes may help to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the will, yet <hi>willing</hi> it muſt be; or it
is not a Credible Profeſſion. He that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
himſelf a Chriſtian, when a ſword or
Piſtol is at his breſt, is not to be Credited, if
he continue it not when he is free. And alſo
that which is done in a meer Paſſion without
Deliberation, is not to be taken as the act
of the Man, and a true expreſſion of the
bent of his mind; unleſs he afterwards ſtand
to it upon Deliberation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It muſt be a Profeſſion not nullified by
a contradiction in word or deed. Though
their may an obſcure contradiction, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
conſiſt with it; or a contradiction
only in Degree; <hi>as Lord I believe, help thou
my unbelief:</hi> yet there muſt be no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Eſſentials of our Profeſſion,
that nullifieth it, by ſhewing that we lie, or
ſpeak againſt the bent of our hearts. If a
Miniſter can by contrary words or deeds diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the Profeſſion of the party, he is not
to believe it, or accept it. For we are not
to believe without Evidence of Credibility,
much leſs againſt it. I have given inſtances
of this in the foreſaid Diſputation of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<hi>pag.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When by Covenant-breaking, and
Perfidiouſneſs, or often Lying, a man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:120705:39"/>
come Incredible, having forfeited the Credit
of his word, with wiſe and charitable men,
this man muſt give us a Practical, as well as
Verbal Profeſſion, before we can again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him, to the Priviledges of the Church.
For though we are not to be ſo ſtrict, as ſome
old Fathers ſeem to have been, and the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi>
were, that would not admit ſuch
Penitents again into the Church at all, but
leave them to Gods own Judgment; yet
muſt we not go againſt Reaſon and Scripture,
and the Nature of the thing, in believing
that which is not to be believed; nor to caſt
by all Order and Diſcipline, and proſtitute
Gods Ordinances to the luſts of men, and
make them a ſcorn, or level the Church of
Chriſt with the world.</p>

1. If every man ſhould be the ſole Judge
of the ſoundneſs, and validity of his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
then Hereticks, and Heathens, and
Infidels may all croud into the Church: for
when there is any outward advantage, or
other common motive to induce them to it,
they would all joyn with the Church: as if
they were Chriſtians. And we ſee that it is
the cuſtom of Hereticks to intrude: And who
ſhall ſay to any of them, why do you ſo,
if themſelves are the only Judges? We meet
daily among our own neighbours, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
that know not whether Chriſt be God
or man; nor who he is, nor what he hath
done for us, nor why he came into the
world, and are ignorant of almoſt all the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials
of the Chriſtian Faith; and with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
more that live in common drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſcorning at holy duties, and at a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life, and hating thoſe that uſe it, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
up themſelves wholly to the fleſh, and
the world: And yet all theſe men are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of the ſoundneſs, and validity of their
own Profeſſion, that they will hate that
Miniſter, that ſhall make any queſtion of
their Right to the Priviledges of the Church.
I ſpeak not by hearſay, or conjecture, but
by ſad experience. And if they be their own
judges, all theſe will be approved, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120705:41"/>
and indeed, what man would not be
admitted where Chriſtianity is in credit, or
hath any worldly advantages? ſo that it's
certain, that this would pluck up the hedg,
and lay open the Vineyard of Chriſt unto the
wilderneſs. For <hi>ſelf-love</hi> is ſuch a powerfull
blinding thing, that it will make every man
almoſt, eſpecially of the worſer ſort, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of that which is their <hi>Own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If every man ſhould be the ſole Judge
of his own, Profeſſion, and fitneſs for
Church Priviledges, then there could be no
<hi>Communion of Saints:</hi> For all the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and impious perſons, would intrude
into our Communion; and it would be a
Communion not only of actual, but of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
impious men. But the conſequent is
intollerable, as being contrary to an Article
of our Belief, and a principal part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
practice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If each man, were the only Judge of his
own Profeſſion, then there could be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of Church Diſcipline, nor keeping, or
caſting out the wicked: But the conſequent
is unſufferable: Therefore.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If each man be the only Judge of his
own Profeſſion, then the Church is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided,
ungoverned Society: but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent

2. And now I prove that it belongeth to
the Office of the Miniſters to judge of, and
approve, the Profeſſion of ſuch as ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pect
admiſſion, or the Priveledges of the
Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If perſons are not the ſole Judges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
then it muſt belong to the Miniſter to
judge: But the Antecedent is before proved:
The Conſequence is proved thus: It muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
either to the Paſtours, or the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
only, or the people only; or to all,
or ſome of theſe conjunctly. Not to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
only:</hi> for 1. No man that I know of
affirmeth it. 2. It is another mans office.
Not to the <hi>people only:</hi> for 1. None that I
know of affirmeth this, They all include the
Paſtours. 2. As I ſaid, it is made part of the
Paſtours office. If you ſay that it belongs to
<hi>Magiſtrates, People, and Paſtours jointly,</hi>
then you include the Paſtours: And I grant
that in ſome ſort it belongs to them, but in a
different ſort, as I ſhall tell you under the
next Propoſition.</p>
               <p>2 It is to Miniſters as ſuch that the Keys
of the Kingdom of Heaven are committed:
but to approve of the Profeſſion of ſuch as
are to be admitted into the Church, or to its
Priviledges, is part of the exerciſe of the
Key's of the Kingdom: therefore it is Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:120705:42"/>
to whom it belongeth thus to judge
and approve.</p>
               <p>I have proved in another place, (and ſo
have many others, more at large) that the
Key's were not given to <hi>Peter,</hi> or to the
Apoſtles, as to private men, for ſo they
<hi>were not;</hi> nor as to a Church of private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
for ſo they <hi>were not,</hi> nor the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives
of any ſuch: nor yet as to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
only; for then they ſhould have belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to none but themſelves; the contrary
whereof is certain: nor as to fixed Dioceſan
Biſhops; for ſuch they <hi>were not:</hi> and it's
generally granted that the Key's belong alſo
to Presbyters, either wholly, or the chief of
them, and particularly, that in queſtion:
Nor yet were the Key's given them only as a
Synod, or Presbyterie; for <hi>Peter was not
ſuch:</hi> and this in queſtion hath <hi>ever been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
by ſuch Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Church are the
lawful Judges, or Approvers of the Profeſſion
of thoſe that come into the Church, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Priviledges of it: But it is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Chriſt, that are the Rulers of the
Church, as is expreſt, 1 <hi>Theſ. 12. Acts</hi> 2.
28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. &amp; 17. 24. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:120705:43"/>
of the Myſteries of God, and Rulers over his
houſhould, to give them meat in due ſeaſon,</hi>
which they muſt do as <hi>faithfull and wiſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
till their Lord cometh;</hi> are the men
that muſt judge of, and approve the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of thoſe that come under their <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip,
Government, and Adminiſtration,</hi>
of theſe <hi>Myſteries.</hi> But ſuch are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

46, 47. Therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. To whom it belongeth, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
men at age</hi> into the Church; to <hi>reſtore by
Abſolution,</hi> them that fell off, and to <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter</hi>
Chriſt's Ordinances to thoſe that are
within; to them doth it belong to try, judge,
and approve of them, that are to be thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
abſolved, or that expect the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the Church: But it belongeth to
Chriſt's Miniſters to receive men, abſolve
them, and adminiſter the Ordinances to
them: Therefore. The Antecedent is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
granted, and plain in Scripture. The
Conſequence hath Reaſon ſo evident, as
needs no confirmation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If <hi>all that enter</hi> into the Church,
or that are <hi>reſtored by Aſolution,</hi> or are ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a Right to Church Priviledges of the
Adult, are therewithall <hi>engaged into a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
voluntary Relation to Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:120705:43"/>
then muſt their Profeſſion be judged of
&amp; approved by Chriſts Miniſters: but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
is certain: Therefore ſo is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.
The Antecedent is cleare, becauſe
1. All that enter into the Univerſal Church,
do enter under the hand of the Miniſterie, and
thereby acknowledg their Relation to them,
and Authority to admit them. 2. Becauſe
all ſuch do engage themſelves to be Chriſts
Diſciples, and learn of him as their Maſter,
not as coming down from Heaven, to teach
them perſonally, but as teaching them by
his Word, Spirit, and Miniſters conjunctly,
ſaying (<hi>Luke</hi> 10 16) <hi>He that heareth you,
heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me.</hi> 3. Becauſe they all engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to take Chriſt for their King, who
ruleth them by his Laws and Officers; and
his Miniſters are his <hi>Ruling Officers,</hi> 1 Tim.
5. 17. Heb. 12. 7. &amp; 17. 24. 1 Theſ. 5. 12.
4. Becauſe they are all engaged to take Chriſt
for the great High Prieſt of the Church, who
hath appointed his Miniſters, to officiate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, in leading them in publike Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Church; and in offering up the
Praiſes of God, and bleſſing the people, and
praying for them and celeberating the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration,
and Repreſentation of Chriſts
Sacrifice on the Croſs. 5. Becauſe they that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:120705:44"/>
enter into a particular Church, where only
the conſtant ſtated uſe of holy Ordinances,
and Priviledges, are to be had, (though
occaſionally elſwhere) do enter into a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Paſtours of that particular
Church; as members of their flock and
Church; whom they muſt overſee, and
watch over: all this is paſt controverſie.</p>
               <p>And then for the Conſequent of the major
Propoſition (that <hi>therefore Miniſters muſt
approve of their Profeſſion</hi>) I prove it thus.
Miniſters are naturally free-men, as well as
others: and therefore no man can become a
member of their charge, and put them upon
ſo great duty as the Relation doth require,
againſt their wils, without their conſent,
and contrary to their Judgment, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.
It is an exceeding great burden
that lieth on us, and a great deal of work
that is required of us, to each particular
Soul: in our charge we muſt <hi>exhort, inſtruct,
admoniſh, in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likly,
and privately, and watch over, and
govern them, viſit them in ſickneſs, comfort,
ſtrengthen them,</hi> &amp;c. O what a mountain
lieth on me, and how ſhould I bear it, if
God did not ſupport me? And if every
man that <hi>will,</hi> ſhall make me <hi>more</hi> work, and
put himſelf under my <hi>Care, without my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:120705:44"/>
then I am ſo far from being a free-man,
as all other are, that I am enſlaved, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
in ſlavery For 1. They may <hi>oppreſs</hi> me
when they will with <hi>Number;</hi> and <hi>ſo many</hi>
may flock in to my charge, in deſpight of
me, as ſhall nullifie the particular Church,
and by the magnitude make it another thing,
by making it uncapable of its ends, 2. And
hereby they may force me to leave undone my
duty, both to them and others, by oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
me with work: For when I have ten
times more then I can teach and overſee, I
muſt needs neglect them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all or moſt. 3. And
they may abuſe the Church, and me with
the evil qualities, as well as the exceſſive
quantity of members; and we ſhall be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to give that which is holy to dogs, and
to uſe thoſe as Church members, that are
enemies to the Church; and to adminiſtrate
Sacraments to any, that will have them,
how unfit ſoever; and to prophane all Gods
Ordinances, and turn them to a lie. 4. And
by this means, the Church will be utterly
ruined, and made a den of thieves, and a
ſtie of ſwine: For beſides that all the worſt
may at pleaſure be members of it, all men
that are faithfull, (or moſt at leaſt) will
runne away from the Miniſtry, and ſooner
turn Chimny ſweepers then Paſtours. For
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:120705:45"/>
what man dare venture his Soul on ſo great a
charge, for which he knows he muſt give
an account, when he is certain to leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
the work of his Office, in ſo great a
meaſure, and when he knows he may be
thus oppreſt in ſoul and body, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
by wicked men, when ever they pleaſe:
yea, if they purpoſely do it to deſpight
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. That which belongeth to all
other Superiors, in voluntary Relations, is,
not to be denied to Miniſters in theirs: but
a free conſent, and Approbation of them,
that they are related to, belongs to all other
Superior, voluntary Relations: Therefore
to us.</p>
               <p>A Schoolmaſter, is to Approve the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of his Schollars; and a Phyſician is to
judge of the fitneſs of a perſon to be his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and his fitneſs for this or that medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
in particular. Not only a Maſter would
take it ill, if he may not have the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his own ſervants, but have as many,
and as bad thruſt on him, as ſhall pleaſe;
but a husband would think it hard, if he might
not have the approbation, and choice of his
own wife, but that any might force him to
take them that they pleaſe. And are the Paſtour
of Chriſts Church, the only ſlaves on
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:120705:45"/>
earth? How improbable a thing is this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. That Relation which muſt be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
regularly, and faithfully managed,
muſt be rationally, regularly, and freely
entered (for otherwiſe we cannot ſo manage
it) But the Relation of a Miniſter to each
member of his charge muſt be thus managed:
Therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. It is plainly expreſt in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Commiſſion, that he is to approve of
the Profeſſion of Diſciples: therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to his Office, <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Go
Diſciple all Nations, baptizing them—teaching
them to obſerve all things—</hi>
Which plainly manifeſteth, that it's they
that muſt judge, when a man is <hi>made a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple,</hi>
and when not, or elſe how can they
either Baptize them as ſuch, or teach them
the Precepts of Chriſt as ſuch? So when he
giveth to his ſervants the <hi>Key's of the
Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it ſheweth that
they are to judge who is to be admitted, and
who not, as is aforeſaid: or elſe he would
never have ſet them at the door, and made
them the Porters, and Key-bearers of his
Church, to let men in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. No man in the Adminiſtration
of holy Ordinances, is ordinarily to renounce
his own Reaſon and Conſcience, and to act
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:120705:46"/>
againſt them. But thus it would be if we have
not the approving of the Profeſſion, or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of thoſe that we muſt adminiſter
them to: Therefore—He that is to <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi>
here is to <hi>judge:</hi> For 1. Elſe you will
force Miniſters to go againſt their Reaſon,
and Conſcience in all adminiſtrations. 2. You
will deny them ſo much as <hi>Judicium Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi>
which you allow to every Chriſtian,
much more <hi>Judicium Directionis,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to their Office. Every man muſt
judge and underſtand what he doth, and why
he doth it: you will not force the people to
<hi>participate of Sacraments,</hi> againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.
Why then ſhould Miniſters be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to <hi>Give</hi> them againſt <hi>their</hi> Conſciences?
Adminiſtring is their work: and therefore
they muſt know why they do it, and on
what grounds: Elſe you will make them but
like hangmen, or worſe, if they muſt do <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution</hi>
againſt their judgments, becauſe it is
<hi>anothers</hi> judgment. And whoſe judgment is
it, that we muſt follow, when we go againſt
our own?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 11. If it belong to Chriſt, to paſs
an open Approbation, of the Qualification
of ſuch as are to be admitted into his Church,
or to his ſpecial Ordinances, or Church Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
then doth it belong to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:120705:46"/>
of Chriſt, as his inſtruments: But it
doth belong to Chriſt. 1. For all that enter
either into an Infant, or Adult Church-ſtate,
do joyn themſelves into a neer Relation to
Chriſt: And will Chriſt have men married
to him, and made his children, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and ſervants, without his Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, or againſt his particular will?
2. All that thus come into the Church, or
are reſtored, and claim Church-priviledges,
do expect, and claime the Benefits of Chriſt,
and the greateſt benifits in the world. And
ſhall any man have Chriſts great, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Benefits againſt his will, and without his
Approbation? It may be you'l ſay, that <hi>he
hath already expreſſed his conſent in the free
Promiſe of the Goſpel, to all believers.</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
He hath ſo to <hi>Believers:</hi> but he hath

               <p>Object. <hi>But it's ſufficient, that my own

and the Church hath to do with

muſt know what they do, and why, and
muſt have ſome expreſſion, of what you ſay
your Conſcience teſtifieth to you.</p>
               <p>And the Conſequence of the Major is
plain, (that <hi>if it belongs thus to Chriſt to

1. Becauſe he appointeth not perſonally on

2 Cor. 11. 2. Yea, and hereupon they are
to <hi>give up themſelves to the Lord firſt, and

But it is to Miniſters that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>

it is to Miniſters, that the power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth.</p>
               <p>The Major is undoubted: for elſe we muſt
be bound by God, to do that which we have
no Power (or Authority) to do, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
muſt have Power to do it, and not be
bound to it, which are both ſenſeleſs. The
Minor I prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the frequent Commands of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that lay this burden on the Miniſters,
but not Magiſtrates or People. (in the way
that's now in Queſtion) All the directions,
and Canons which <hi>Paul</hi> giveth to <hi>Timothy,
Titus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Acts 20. and
other Paſtours, together with the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to performance, and terrible charges
given them to be faithfull, do ſhew that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:120705:48"/>
it's they that muſt do the work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From common conſent: all would have
the honour and Power: but who beſides the
Paſtours would have the work, and care,
and ſevere Obligations to perform it? Will
Magiſtrates, or all the people <hi>undertake it,</hi>
to try, and judge of the Profeſſions of every
<hi>man</hi> that enters upon Adult Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
or Priviledges, of ſuch as are to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
They that will undertake this work muſt
<hi>attend</hi> it, and <hi>give themſelves wholly to it,</hi> and
conferre with the perſons, and do ſo much
work as our people would be hardly brought
to do (if they were able) It's unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Raſhneſs, and perverſneſs, that makes
them ſo jealous of the Miniſters Power in ſuch
caſes, and ſome of them to reproach us for it.
Ah blind unthankful Souls! Do you know
what the Miniſtry and this Power is? It is a
power to be the ſervants of all; a power to
ſpend and be ſpent, even for the unthankfull.
It's a Power to do the moſt toylſome, and
diſpleaſing work to fleſh and blood, one of
them in the world; ſuch as fleſh calls a very
drudgery. I profeſs unfeignedly that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God
had left it to my choice, and I ſhould conſult
with fleſh and blood, I had rather preach
twice or thrice a week for nothing, and do
no more, then to have this Power (a duty
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:120705:48"/>
of judging and governing this one Pariſh,
though I had for it many hundred pounds a
year. Nothing doth bring ſo much trouble
upon us, as that Power which unthankfull
perſons ſcorn at. I had rather, if I might
conſult with fleſh and blood, be advanced to
the Power, of holding or driving plow for
you, if not of ſweeping your ſtreets.
(Though yet becauſe of Gods intereſt, and
the ends of the work, I count it the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
life in the world.) And do you grudg us
ſuch a Power as this? Would you grudg
me the Power of threſhing your corn? Or
will you grudg a Phyſician the Power of
judging of your diſeaſe, and the Remedy,
to ſave your life? Or a School maſter the
Power of examining, and teaching your
children? Do the work, and take the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
if you are able, and can go through with
it, and ſpare not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 13. It is only the Miniſters of Chriſt,
that are <hi>Able</hi> and <hi>Capable</hi> to receive the
Power, and do the work: and therefore it
is they only that have Authority thereto.</p>
               <p>Nothing but the Antecedent needs proofe.
And that I prove by three ſeveral En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablements,
which Miniſters have, and others
wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. 1. Miniſters only have ability of
Mind, for the work of this tryal, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:120705:49"/>
Here I ſpeak of them <hi>Ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and I have theſe grounds for it. 1. God
hath commanded that the moſt knowing,
able, faithfull, holy men, ſhall be deſtinated
to this work, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. Tit.</hi> 1. &amp;c. And
therefore it is ſuppoſed that uſually they are
ſuch, or elſe it's the ſhame of the Magiſtrate
that ſhould ſee to it. 2. It's they only that
ſet themſelves a part to the work and ſtudy
from their youth, for the accompliſhments
that are requiſite, (unleſs here and there one
of other ſorts) And men are likelieſt to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in that, which they have all their
daies ſet themſelves to ſtudy. 3. We ſee by
experience that they are the moſt able, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be (alas how few) here and there a
godly ſtudious Gentleman, or other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
who are moſt of them too blame,
that they become not Miniſters, I think.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is only the Miniſters, who being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
to the Goſpel and Work of God,
do lay by all other buſineſs, and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
wholly to theſe things. Gentlemen,
(much leſs all the people of the Church,)
cannot lay by their callings to attend this
buſineſs of trying, and judging of mens Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
as Miniſters muſt do, if they will be
faithfull. Should private members have ſo
mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h Church governing work as ſome cut

out for them, and ſhould they bear ſuch a
burden, as ſome would lay upon them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of Power and Priviledges, it
would undo them ſoul or body, or both:
they would find time little enough for it in
ſome places, if they all caſt off their outward
callings.</p>
               <p>And 3. The Paſtours only are capable,
becauſe of Unity. For ſhould the People
have this work, as ſome would have it, the
multitude would hinder execution, and they
would turn all to wrangling. 1. Such bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
move ſlowly. 2. Multitude with that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſity
of parts and minds that is among them,
would ſet them by the eares; and the Church
would be almoſt alway in a flame. If every
man that is to make Profeſſion of his Faith,
on this or the like occaſion, muſt be tryed
and judged by all; ſome would approve,
and others would diſapprove and reject, in
moſt or very many caſes. Whereas the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
being ſingle, or not many, and more
experienced, and able, and vacant for a full
enquiry, have leſs reaſon to be partiall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious,
or diſagreed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 14. The Practice of the Apoſtles,
Evangeliſts, and the Paſtours of Chriſt's
Church in all Ages, doth put us quite out of
doubt, that it is not only belonging to the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:120705:50"/>
Miniſterill Office, to judge and approve of
ſuch Profeſſions, but that it is a <hi>very great
part</hi> of that Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> received, and judged of the
Profeſſion of his Penitents, before he did

<hi>Eunuch</hi>'s Profeſſion, <hi>Acts 8. 37, 38. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
was ſcrupulous of admitting <hi>Paul,</hi> but
as God himſelfe Approved of him to <hi>Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>

Who judged of <hi>Lidia</hi>'s Profeſſion, and the
<hi>Jaylours,</hi> (Acts 16) but the Apoſtles, or
other Miniſters of Chriſt? What need we
inſtance any more, when we all know, that
no Convert entered at Age into the Church,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:120705:50"/>
but under the hand of ſome Miniſter of
Chriſt, that did Baptize him, or appoint
him to be Baptized.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But this is not our Caſe, for we
were Baptized in Infancy, and are in the
Church already.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You entred not into the number of
Adult and more perfect Members in your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy;
nor did you make any perſonal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
in your Infancy: That's yet to be
done. Your Parents Profeſſion will ſerve
you no longer then your Infant ſtate. Theſe
being not in the Goſpel Church before, were
at once Baptized, and entered thereby into
the Number of the Adult members. So
would we do if we converted thoſe that were
the ſeed of Heathens or Infidels. But though
this be not your Caſe in reſpect of Baptiſm,
and an Inſant Church-ſtate, yet this is your
own Caſe in regard of perſonal Profeſſion,
and Adult Church-ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Miniſters of Chriſt in Scripture
time, admitted none into an Adult Church-ſtate,
and to the Priviledges of ſuch, but
upon a Perſonal Profeſſion, approved by the
ſaid Miniſters, then neither muſt we do ſo
now. But the Antecedent is paſt doubt:
Therefore.—</hi>

               <p>The Reaſons of the Conſequence is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:120705:51"/>
the Scripture is our Rule, and the
Reaſons of the Caſes are the ſame. If you
ſay with the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that I may as well
argue from the Apoſtles example, for the
Baptizing of the Aged: I Anſwer ſo I will,
when the Caſe is the ſame: when they are
converted from Infidelity, or are not born
and baptized into the Goſpel-Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
The Apoſtles did not Baptize at Age,
any perſon that was born of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in the Goſpel-Church, after Baptiſm
was inſtituted. As to them that ſay, that
<hi>Mary was a Chriſtian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anabap. Object. Anſw.</note> 
                  <hi>and
yet Chriſt was not Baptized till
full Age.</hi> I Anſwer, 1. That
<hi>Mary</hi> was not a Baptized perſon: 2. That
Baptiſm into the Name of Father, Sonne,
and Holy Ghoſt, was not Inſtituted in
Chriſts Infancy: How ſhould he be Baptized
in Infancy, when there was no ſuch Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God in the world, as Goſpel-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
or <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm? If you think Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and Profeſſion, or Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſo inſeparable, that we muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſuch a Profeſſion, but in order to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
1. You ſpeak without proof. 2. You
ſpeak even contrary to the experience of the
Jewiſh Church: where in the wilderniſs,
Circumciſion was ſeparated from Profeſſion,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:120705:51"/>
and Church-memberſhip, both of Infants,
and Adult, the later being without the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
3. If we may be Baptized in Infancy,
without a Perſonal Profeſſion, then they are
ſeparable: but the Antecedent is proved in
due place. 4. No man denieth that I know
of, but that Perſonal Profeſſion approved
by the Miniſters, is neceſſary in ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
after Baptiſm. But all the examples of
the Baptized Adult in the New Teſtament,
will fully prove, that all men ſhould enter
into the ſtate and number of Adult Church-members,
upon a Perſonal Profeſſion appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Miniſters of Chriſt: for ſo did all
in the Scripture terms, on Reaſons common
to them and us: and no man can put by the
obligation of the example, by any pretence
of an imparity of Reaſon, but what will be
as ſtrong to evacuate almoſt all Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and much of the commands. But as
to the Baptizing perſons at Age, we will do
the ſame, when the perſons are ſuch, as the
Apoſtles baptized: aud that they baptized
none others, was never yet proved; but
more ſaid for the Affirmative.</p>
               <p>And ever ſince the Apoſtles daies, it hath
been the conſtant Practice of the Church,
that the Profeſſion, and claim of the Adult
ſhould be tried by the Miniſters of Chriſt.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:120705:52"/>
1. In Caſe of Infant Baptiſm, the Miniſter
was to receive and approve the Parents Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
2. In Caſe of the Baptiſm of the
Aged, they alwaies entred under the tryal,
approbation, or hand of the Miniſter. 3. In
Caſe of the Confirming of thoſe at Age, that
were Baptized in Infancy, it was alwaies
done under the hand and judgment of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.
4. In Caſe of Abſolution of thoſe
that fell after either Infant, or Adult Baptiſm,
it was alwaies upon a Profeſſion approved by
the Miniſter. To prove theſe things is vaine,
it being the Subject of ſo many Canons, and

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:120705:54"/>
of a Profeſſion, and of what ſort of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and that the Paſtours of the Church
are by Office appointed by Chriſt, to try,
approve, and receive it.</p>

                  <hi>Prop. 8.</hi> Though it belong to the Paſtours
Office to judge of the Profeſſion of ſuch expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctants,
yet are they bound up by the Laws
of Chriſt, what Profeſſion to accept, and
what to refuſe: and if by breaking theſe Laws
they ſhall dangerouſly, or groſly wrong the
Church: it belongeth to the Magiſtrate to
correct them, and to the people to admoniſh
them, and diſown their ſinne.</head>
               <p>IN ſumme, as is aforeſaid, <hi>It is a credible
Profeſſion of true Chriſtianity,</hi> which they
muſt accept. And as that which ſeemeth not
to be Underſtanding, and ſerious, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
and deliberate, is not credible;
nor that which is Nullified by Verbal, or
Actual Contradiction; nor that which is
made by one that hath forfeited the credit of
his word; ſo on the other ſide, a Credible
mans Profeſſion is his Title-condition, in the
Judgment of the Church, or that Evidence of
the Condition that we muſt take up with:
And if a man produce the Poſitive Evidence of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:120705:54"/>
his Title, we muſt be able to diſprove, and
invalidate it, before we reject him: ſo that
it is a <hi>Profeſſion of true Chriſtanity, which we
cannot prove to be falſe, at leaſt by a Violent
Preſumption,</hi> (as the Lawyers ſpeak) which
we muſt accept.</p>
               <p>By this it appears, 1. That a groſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
perſon, that knoweth not the Eſſentials
of Chriſtianity, is not to be taken for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
Chriſtian. For tryal of ſuch, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Parliament, of <hi>October</hi> 20. 1645.
doth give us ſatisfaction (recited in the form
of Church Government, of <hi>March</hi> 29.
1648.) 2. Nor one that denieth any of the
ſaid Eſſentials Heretically. 3. Nor one that
ſpeaketh Ludicrouſly, and jeſtingly. 4. Nor
one that ſpeaks in a Paſſion, not deliberatly.
5. Nor one that is manifeſtly forced and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing.
6. Nor one that ſaith and unſaith.
7. Nor one whoſe life doth prove his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
to be incredible. 8. Nor one that
hath perfidiouſly been a breaker of Covenant
with God already, till his reformed life ſhall
recover the credit of his word. So that with
a <hi>Credible perſon,</hi> his bare Profeſſion is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
fefore the Church of his Right; and
we muſt prove him a Lyar, or falſe in his
Profeſſion, before we can reject him. But
a man that hath been wicked, <hi>after</hi> open
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:120705:55"/>
Covenanting with God, or Profeſſion of
Chriſtianity, hath forfeited his credit, and
therefore muſt ſhew us a new life, as well as
a verbal Profeſſion, before he is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to his Priviledges. In the firſt caſe
(with a Credible perſon) <hi>we muſt prove his
Profeſſion falſe,</hi> before we reject him: but
in the ſecond Caſe (with an incredible perſon)
<hi>he muſt Evidence his Profeſſion to be true,</hi> by
probable Evidences, that ſhall make it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.
If I thought that the very light and
law of Nature, joyned with the known Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rules of Scripture, did not put this
paſt Controverſie, with moſt judicious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
I ſhould ſtand to prove all this by
parts.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, it is hence manifeſt,
1. That the Paſtours of the Church, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
no man that hath the leaſt degree of
Grace, or makes a credible Profeſſion of the
leaſt. 2. And that we muſt nor require as a
matter of Neceſſity, ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ipe, or clear,
and judicious expreſſions, from the ignorant,
baſhful, or ſuch, as for want of uſe and good
breeding, are unable to expreſs their minds,
as we may from others. If a man, or woman
be unable in good ſence to expreſs their Faith,
in the very Eſſentials, or to reveale the
Grace of God within them: yet if upon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:120705:55"/>
our Interrogations, and helping them, they
can do it in any intelligible manner, ſo that we
do but perceive that it is a ſound Profeſſion in
the Eſſentials, which they <hi>Meane,</hi> though
they cannot handſomly utter it, we may not
reject any ſuch as theſe. 3. Note alſo, that
defects in Knowledg muſt be indeed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
groſs., where the perſon is willing to be
taught, and Ruled by Chriſt, and uſe his
means, and thus ſeems to Love God, and
Holineſs, before they will warrant us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
them. Should the Judgments of ſuch
perſons ſeem unacquainted with ſome funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,
about the Trinity, and the like
myſteries, I ſhould ſearch them better, and
I ſhould plainly tell them preſently of the
truth, and if they received Information, I
ſhould not reject a willing Soul. The very
Apoſtles of Chriſt had the Sacrament admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to them by himſelf, when they did not
underſtand and believe, the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of Chriſt. I know that this will
not warrant us to give ſuch perſons the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt
now; becauſe that thoſe great Truths
were not then of ſuch great Neceſſity, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chriſts Death and Reſurrection they did
become; as being not ſo fully revealed, nor
the Actual belief of them ſo peremptorily
impoſed. But yet it ſhews us this much,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:120705:56"/>
that even in perſons admitted to the Lords
Supper, if there be but a Belief in God the
Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, and the
Points of Abſolute Neceſſity, (though in
rude and unperfect conception) and a Love
to Chriſt, and a willingneſs to Learn of him,
and obey him, a great deale of lamentable
ignorance may be born with, in thoſe that
have wanted either Means of knowledg, and
clear diſcoveries of the Truth, or natural
ripeneſs of underſtanding to receive it. You
ſee then that Paſtours are not Arbitrary, nor
meerly left to their own wills.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>Prop. 9.</hi> It is moſt evident that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
People, and Magiſtrates, have each
a Power of Judging; but different, as they
have different works.</head>
               <p n="2">2. VVHen the Queſtion is, <hi>To whom
the Sacraments, and other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and Church-Relations, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
are to be Miniſterially deliverd as from
Chriſt, and to whom not?</hi> Here the Miniſters
of Chriſt are the Judges. And ſo are they,
when the Queſtion is, <hi>Whom muſt we teach,
direct, and perſwade, and in Chriſts Name
command the people to avoid, or to hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:120705:56"/>
with?</hi> For thoſe two are our own
work in the <hi>Execution.</hi> And if either Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
people, or any other muſt be Judge,
where Miniſters muſt <hi>Execute</hi> and <hi>work;</hi>
Then 1. We have not that common <hi>Judicium
Diſcretionis</hi> to guide our own actions, which
is allowed, and Neceſſary to every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
2. Then the Rulers of the Church, are
not only degraded, and made no Rulers,
but are put into that ſlavery, and ſubjection
to them, that are commanded to obey them,
which no Paſtour muſt deſire the People, or
any one of them to be in. For we muſt not
deny them a Judgment of Diſcretion, about
their own actions. 3. And by this courſe,
Miniſters that are the Eies of the Body, muſt
not only be guided by other parts, but they
muſt execute <hi>againſt</hi> their own Knowledg,
and Conſcience, when other men miſs-judge.
4. And if ſo, either God commandeth us
to ſinne, when ever people, or Magiſtrates
bid us, (which none dare ſay) or elſe it is
no ſinne, when it doth but get their Vote:
and ſo we may warrantably do what the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
bids us, (as <hi>Hobbs</hi> thinks) or what
the people bids us, (as others as unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
think) As if it would be a ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for me, to ſay, <hi>Lord I did what the
Magiſtrate, or the Major Vote of the people
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:120705:57"/>
bid me, though it was that which thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideſt.</hi>
5. If the people have no ſuch Power
over <hi>one another,</hi> then they have none over
their Rulers or Guides: But they have none
ſuch over one another. Indeed in order to
Unity, a Major Vote may (not effectually
oblige) but occaſion an obligation: But as
to Government, let them ſhew us if they
can from Scripture, where the Major Vote
of a Church hath the Government of the
Leſſer part, or that the Leſſer may go againſt
their own Judgment, and Conſcience, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe the greater part requireth it. This
Governing Vote, is as ſtrange a thing to
the Scripture as a Pope is. 6. Paſtours, or
General u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

into the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi> ſometime,
without receiving them into any particular
Church: And what have any people there
to do with the tryal, or Approbation of
their Profeſſion or Qualifications? One can
lay no more claim to it then another. And
ſure all the world muſt not have the tryal of
them. 7. What people did <hi>Philip</hi> adviſe
with before he Baptized the <hi>Eunuch?</hi> Or
who but <hi>Philip</hi> alone was judge of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion?
What Vote approved of the 3000
Converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2 or of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. or
of <hi>Lydia,</hi> or the <hi>Gaoler,</hi> Acts 16. or any
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:120705:57"/>
other that ever were admitted by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Chriſt in Scripture times. And what
Magiſtrates were the Approvers for 300
years after Chriſt? No nor after. 8. If
in this part of our Office we muſt obey men,
againſt God (whether Magiſtrate or People)
then in other parts: And ſo if the Vote of
the Church, or Magiſtrate, forbid me to
pray or preach againſt Pride, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Drunkenneſs, I muſt obey them,
that is, I muſt obey men before God, and
pleaſe men, and be no longer the Miniſter of
Chriſt. 9. What can be more plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Scripture, then for the people by a
Major Vote, to Rule thoſe whom God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
to obey, as their Rulers? <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.
7. &amp; 17. 24. 1. <hi>Tim. 5. 17. 1 Theſ.</hi> 5. 12.
<hi>Acts</hi> 20, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Paſtours have but a Miniſterial
Ruling Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who doubts of that? But is a
Miniſterial Rule no Rule? No man on earth
hath more then a Miniſterial Power: For all
are under God, and the Redeemer. All
Judges, Juſtices, and other Officers in the
Commonwealth, have but a Miniſterial Rule
as Officers: But is that no Rule? Or ſhall
the People therefore Rule theſe Rulers? We
are Chriſts Miniſters for the people: we are
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:120705:58"/>
theirs <hi>finally,</hi> but have our Power from
Chriſt only Efficiently. If the People are
the Rulers, who are the Ruled? It's a
ſtrange ſociety, when the Ruling, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
part is the ſame; where all the Body is
a Head and an Eye. 10. If People or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
will oblige the Miniſters by their
Power, whom they ſhall Baptize, Confirm,
or Abſolve, and what Profeſſion they ſhall
accept; then muſt the People and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
undertake to Anſwer it before God,
and to bear all the blam, and puniſhment,
if we miſcarry in obedience to them. And
truly if they dare undertake this, we ſhould
gladly accept of the condition, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
thankes, if we could but be ſure that
God would give us leave, and thus acquit
us, and accept of our ſervice on theſe terms.
O then how eaſy a thing were it to obey,
rather then to Rule. So much for the Power
of the Miniſters in this (and other ſuch like)
worke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether ſuch
a Profeſſor be fit for our own Communion or
not, and whether it be our duty to avoid him
or not,</hi> then the People have a Judgment of
Diſcretion: Not a Governing Judgment, as
the Paſtours have; but a Judgment that muſt
be the Immediate Guide of their Actions.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:120705:58"/>
Yet this is to be thus exerciſed: They are to
look to Gods Word as the Rule, and to
truſt that with a Divine Faith: They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to look at the Judgment and Directions of
the Paſtours, that are their authorized
Guides; and to truſt them as the Officers of
Chriſt. For the Word is their Regulating
Guide; the Paſtours are their authorized
Directing Guides; and their own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
are their Immediate Diſcerning
Guides. So that they muſt not be wiſe in
their own conceits, nor leane to their own
Underſtanding, without the uſe of Scripture,
and Miniſtery; but uſe their Underſtandings
for the improvement of theſe. So that if
they know not that the Poſtours of the
Church do miſlead them, contrary to the
Word of God, they cannot deny them obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
(For the command to obey them is
unqueſtionable.) Or if they have not a
grounded ſtrong preſumption, or probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of it, they may not ſuſpend their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
but muſt leave the Paſtours to the
work of their Office, and truſt them in it,
and avoid thoſe whom they reject, and hold
communion with thoſe whom they accept,
and introduce, confirm, or reſtore. But
in caſe they know that a Paſtour leadeth them
into ſinne, they are not to follow him: and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:120705:59"/>
if they have juſt ground for a ſtrong ſuſpicion
of it, they muſt ſuſpend, and conſult with
other Paſtours, and get full information:
For Chriſtian People are not to be Ruled as
beaſts, but as the Children of God; and
muſt underſtand what they are required to
do, and why, as being free Subjects,
(though Subjects) in the Kingdom of Chriſt,
and to be governed accordingly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are to be puniſhed for abuſing their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Receiving or Rejecting men to the injurie
of the Church, and contrary to the Word of
God:</hi> here the Magiſtrate is the Judge. For
as forcing, or puniſhing corporally is his
work, ſo he muſt be the Judge, where he is
the executioner, or elſe he ſhould be forced
to go againſt his own Judgment, and to be
a meer ſervile executioner, which were to
him an inſufferable injury.</p>
               <p>But here, 1. The Magiſtrate muſt not give
the Miniſter a Law to Govern the Church by;
(unleſs the determination of circumſtantial
appendants) but muſt ſee that we Govern
it according to the Word of God, our only
and ſufficient Rule. 2. And he muſt not be
over buſy, nor unneceſſarily intermeddle in
the works of another Office, nor be too
confident of his own Underſtanding in the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:120705:59"/>
matters of the Paſtours work, as if he knew
better then they. 3. But he muſt correct
or caſt out thoſe Miniſters that will not obey
the Word of God; Puniſhing us for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the old Rule, and not making new Rules
for us, is their work, ſo be it, he can procure
a better ſupply; 4. In this caſe, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
Judgment be right, he doth his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Miniſters muſt obey him: If he erre,
he may be guilty of perſecution, in hindering
good, under pretence of puniſhing evil. If
his errour tend not to the deſtruction, or
great and certain hurt of the Church; the
Miniſters whom he caſteth out, are bound
to obey him, and give place to others, and
beſtow their labours, in ſome other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or in ſome other kind at home: But if
his errour lead him to deſtructive perſecution,
we muſt Paſſively ſubmit, but not Actively,
or Negatively obey him, but muſt preach as
long as we are able, and do our duty, till by
priſon, or death he ſtop us in the exerciſe.</p>

there is to be adjoyned a Miniſterial
Inveſtiture, or Delivery of the Benefit

               <p>THis is the proper work of the Miniſters

to Deliver up the Counter-covenant on
his part, in his Name, and to eſpouſe them to
Chriſt, and to Accept them in his Name,

principal parts of the Nature and uſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
which all have not fully Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
of. The Papiſts tell us of ſeven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
Baptiſm, Confirmation, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
Orders, the Euchariſt, Matrimony,
and Extream Unction. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſticks not to

not in Scripture, but of meer Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtik
uſe, and being a word that will ſtretch,
I diſtinguiſh between three ſorts of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
1. For any Divine Inſtitution which
notably ſignifieth Spiritual Grace: And ſo
(though I think Extream Unction none, as
being now no duty, yet) I doubt not but
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:120705:60"/>
there's more then ſeaven. 2. For any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<hi>Inveſtiture</hi> of a perſon by Miniſterial
Delivery, in a ſtate of Church-priviledges,
or ſome ſpecial Goſpel-mercy. And ſo I
grant that there are five Sacraments: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
Confirmation, Abſolution, the Lords
Supper, and Odination. As a man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth
Poſſeſſion of a houſe, doth deliver
the Key to him that enters; and as we are
Inveſted in the Poſſeſſion of land, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of a twig and turfe; and as Miniſters
were wont to be inveſted, or have Induction
into the Churches by giving them the Books,
and the Bell-ropes; and as women were wont
to be married with a ring, and as a Prince
doth Knight a man by a ſword; ſo Chriſt by
his Miniſters doth firſt by Baptiſm Inveſt us in
our Church-ſtate, and Infant-priviledges:
and by Confirmation, confirm us in our
Church-ſtate, and <hi>Inveſt</hi> us with a Right to
the Priviledges of the Adult: and by Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
reinveſt us in the Priviledges that we had
forfeited: and by the Lords Supper Deliver
to us Chriſt and his Benefits, for our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
nouriſhment, and growth in Grace:
and by Ordination he Inveſteth the pardon
ordained with Miniſterial Power. 3. But
taking the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> in that ſtricteſt
ſence, as our Divines define a Sacrament,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:120705:61"/>
as it is an outward ſigne of Chriſts Inſtitution,
for the obſignation of the full Covenant of
Grace, betwixt him and the Covenanter,
and a delivery, Repreſentation, and Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture
of the Grace, or Benefits of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
thus we have only two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper.
But truly I would not quarrel with them for
the meer name, as to the five which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

of Profeſſours, into the Right of the

<hi>1.</hi> Of the unbaptized, who are now firſt

the Propoſition, I think
it may ſuffice, 1. That
Impoſition of hands was
uſed in Scripture times,
and ſo uſed, as may invite
us to imitation, but not
deter us from it at all.
2. And that it hath been
ſince of ordinary uſe in
the Univerſal Church, in
this very caſe, ſo that no
other Original of it can be
found, but Apoſtolical;
yea we have exceeding
probable evidence, that
the uſe of it was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,
from the daies
of the Apoſtles, down to
the Reformation. 3. Nor
is it laid aſide in many of
the Reformed Churches.
So that you will find that
as it's eaſie to prove <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:120705:64"/>
ſo it's more likely to
be a Divine Inſtitution,
Neceſſary <hi>Neceſſitate prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti,</hi>
then to be <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall purpoſely ſay the leſs of it, becauſe
Mr <hi>Hanmer</hi> hath ſaid ſo much already as to
the Judgment of the Ancients; and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
is to pretermit that part (or ſay leſs to
it) which he hath performed. But that it is
Lawfull and fit, if not of ſome Neceſſity,
I ſhall prove by the forementioned Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Impoſition of hands, is allowed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to be uſed Generally by Spiritual Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
to ſignifie their Will and Deſire, that
the Bleſſing may fall on the Inferiour, or the
Gift, or Power be conferred on him, for which
they have a call to mediate:</hi> So that it is not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:120705:65"/>
confined to any particular Bleſſing, Power,
or Ordinance. And therefore if there had
been no example of the uſe of it, in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
caſe (of Confirmation, or Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
yet hence it is proved to be <hi>Lawfull</hi>
and <hi>Meet,</hi> becauſe it hath this General uſe and
allowance. The <hi>Lifting up of Hands</hi> in Prayer
was uſed to ſignifie <hi>from whom and whence</hi>
they did expect the bleſſing; even from <hi>our
Father which is in Heaven:</hi> And the <hi>Laying
of Hands on</hi> the Head of the perſon, in or after
Prayer, was uſed as an <hi>Applicatory</hi> ſigne,
to ſignifie the <hi>Terminus ad quem</hi> of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
deſired, or the Perſon, on whom they
would have it beſtowed. And as you will
not caſt away the uſe of <hi>Lifting up of Hands,</hi>
though it be for ſuch mercies, as you read no
Scripture inſtance, that <hi>Hands</hi> were <hi>lift up</hi>
for; becauſe the <hi>General warrant</hi> is ſufficient;
ſo you have as little reaſon, to ſcruple or caſt
away the <hi>Laying on of Hands,</hi> though in ſuch
caſes as you read not that the ſign was uſed
for in Scripture; becauſe the <hi>unlimited Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
uſe,</hi> is ſufficient warrant, in ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
caſes. God ſhewed that the very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſigne of <hi>Lifting up of the hands,</hi> was
not to be deſpiſed, when <hi>Ameleck</hi> had the
better when <hi>Moſes</hi> hands fell down, though
but through weakneſs, ſo that <hi>Aaron</hi> and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:120705:65"/>
                  <hi>Hur</hi> were fain to underſet them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.
And I think we have no reaſon to contemn
the <hi>Laying on of hands,</hi> which in Grounds
and Nature is ſo neer kin to the other. And
as ſpreading forth the hands, doth not ceaſe
to be good and meet, for all that God hath
ſaid he will <hi>not heare them</hi> that ſpread forth
hands that are full of blood, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 15. So the
<hi>Laying on of hands</hi> doth not ceaſe to be good
and meet, though in ſome caſes the Bleſſing
do not follow it. Still we muſt every where
<hi>Lift up holy hands</hi> in Prayer, without wrath
and doubting, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. Though the ſigne
be not of abſolute Neceſſity in every Prayer,
yet it is very meet, and too much neglected
among us. And ſo I may ſay of the other.
When <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed in the Temple he <hi>ſpread
forth his hands towards Heaven,</hi> 1 King 8.
22. And ſo he ſuppoſed all would do, that
lookt to be heard by the God of Heaven,
when <hi>verſ.</hi> 38. he prayeth for the people
thus: <hi>What Prayer and Supplication ſoever be
made by any man, or by all thy People Iſrael,
which ſhall know every man the plague of his
own heart</hi> (that was their Prayer-Book) <hi>and
ſpread forth his hands towards this houſe, then
heare thou in Heaven thy dwelling place, and
forgive, and doe,</hi> &amp;c. ſee <hi>verſ. 54. 2 Chron.</hi>
6. 12, 13. We muſt <hi>lift up our Hearts with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:120705:66"/>
our Hands to God in the Heavens,</hi> Lam. 3.
41. We muſt <hi>prepare our hearts, and ſtretch
out our hands towards him,</hi> Job 11. 13.
Praying <hi>to a ſtrange God,</hi> is ſignified by
<hi>ſtretching out the hand to him,</hi> Pſal. 44. 20.
Even in <hi>Praiſes</hi> the people were to <hi>Lift up
their hands towards Heaven,</hi> Neh. 8. 6. Yea
and in <hi>Bleſſing, Lifting up the Hands was</hi>
uſed to ſignifie <hi>whence</hi> the Bleſſing came,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 50. Now <hi>this</hi> being ſo commonly
applied, the <hi>other</hi> that is ſo neer a kin to it,
may without ſcruple be uſed in any caſe that
that falls under the foredeſcribed General
caſe. Indeed <hi>every man</hi> muſt <hi>lift up hands,</hi>
becauſe every man muſt pray, (and it is an
engagment, that thoſe hands that are lifted
up to God, be not uſed in wicked works:)
but <hi>Laying on of hands</hi> is ordinarily the Act
of a Superiour, to the Ends aboveſaid.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 48. 14, 15. <hi>Laid his
hands on the ſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es of Joſeph</hi> in bleſſing them.
<hi>Moſes laid his hands on Joſhua,</hi> when he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
him his ſucceſſour, <hi>Num.</hi> 27. 18, 23.
&amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 9. Yea even in the execution
of evil they laid on hands, as an Applicatory
ſigne, as in Sacrificeing; as if they ſhould ſay,
<hi>Not on me, but on this ſubſtitute let the Evil
of puniſhment be.</hi> See <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 21, 22.
<hi>Exod. 29. 10, 15. Lev.</hi> 4. 15. &amp; 8. 14, 22.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:120705:66"/>
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. 12. Yea in putting a Blaſphemer
and Curſer to death, they firſt laid their
hands on his head, as an <hi>Applicatory</hi> ſigne,
in whom the fault was, and to whom the
puniſhment did belong, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 14. In the
Ordination, or Conſecration of the <hi>Levites,</hi>
the people were to lay their hands on them,
<hi>Numb</hi> 8. 10. Not to give them Authority,
but to Conſecrate and give them up to God.
By Laying on of the hands, as an <hi>Applicatory</hi>
ſigne, did Chriſt and his Diſciples heale diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
<hi>&amp;c. Mark</hi> 5. 23. Where note, that
the Ruler of the Synagogue <hi>Jairus,</hi> took this
as an ordinary ſigne of conferring bleſſings
from a Superiour, and therefore he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it with the bleſſing deſired, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 5.
&amp; 8. 23, 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 13. &amp; 4. 40. So
you may ſee alſo the Apoſtles did; yea, and
other believers, as the promiſe runs, <hi>Mark</hi>
16. 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 8. Alſo by laying on of
hands, as an <hi>Applicatory</hi> ſigne, they inveſted
the ſeaven Deacons in their Office, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.
6. And the Prophets, and Teachers in the
Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſeparated <hi>Barnabas</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> to the work that God appointed them,
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2, 3. By Faſting, and Prayer, and
Impoſition of hands. And <hi>Timothy</hi> received
his Miniſterial Gift, by the <hi>Laying on of
Pauls hands, and the hands of the Presbitery,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:120705:67"/>
1 Tim. 4. 14. and 2 Tim. 1 6. If this laſt
Text be underſtood of the Miniſterial Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Gift, which I rather think is
meant of the Apoſtolical <hi>Impoſition of hands,</hi>
after Baptiſm, for giving of the Holy Ghoſt.
So that this ſigne was uſed upon ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and is not at all forbidden in this, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
nor indirectly, and therefore it is
undoubtedly lawful: ſeing that without doubt
the leſs is bleſſed of the greater, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 7.
and the Duty and Power of the Paſtour to
<hi>Bleſs</hi> the perſon in this caſe is unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and this <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> is an allowed
ſigne in <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> as <hi>Lifting up the hands</hi> is,
in <hi>Praying;</hi> here is Scripture enough to
prove it Lawful, and very meet.</p>

whether the Scripture lay not
ſome kind of obligation on us,
to uſe this Ceremony, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.
To which end let
theſe ſeveral things be well conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We find in Scripture a Bleſſing of
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urch-members, with Laying on of hands.
2. We find in Scripture, that the Holy Ghoſt
is in a special manner promiſed to Believers,
over and above that meaſure of the Spirit,
which cauſed them to believe. 3. We find
that Prayer with Laying on of hands, was the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:120705:67"/>
outward means to be uſed by Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
for the procuring of this bleſſing. 4. We
find that this was a fixed Ordinance to the
Church, and not a temporary thing.</hi> Lay all
this together, and you will ſee as much as my
Propoſition doth affirm. Let's try the
proof of it.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Though the proof of the firſt be not
Neceſſary to the main point, yet it ſomewhat
ſtrengtheneth the cauſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 16.
Chriſt took the Children up in his armes, put
his hands upon them, and bleſſed them ſo,
<hi>Math.</hi> 19. 15. This is not I confeſs a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
upon perſonal Profeſſion, which I
am now pleading for: But this is a Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by laying on of hands: And the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of it were ſuch Children as were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
at leaſt of the Jewiſh Church, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Circumcized.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But to come neerer the matter; let us
enquire what this Gift of the Holy Ghoſt
was, that is promiſed to Believers. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the <hi>Pelagians</hi> ſay, the Scripture aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
us that Faith and Repentance which go
before Baptiſm in the Adult, are the gifts of
the Holy Ghoſt: and yet for all that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt is to be given afterward. And
though very often this after<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gift is manifeſted
by Tongues, and Propheſie, and Miracles,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:120705:68"/>
yet that is not all that's meant in the promiſe
of the Holy Ghoſt. Gad hath not tyed Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by that promiſe to any one ſort of thoſe
extraordinary Gifts, no nor conſtantly to
give any of them: But he hath promiſed in
General to give Believers the Spirit: and
therefore there is ſome other ſtanding gift,
for which the Spirit is promiſed to all ſuch.
And indeed the Spirit promiſed is <hi>One, though</hi>
the gifts are many; and the many ſorts of
gifts make not many Spirits. If any man
therefore ſhall ask, whether by the Promiſed
Spirit be meant Sanctification, or Miracles,
or Propheſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I Anſwer with <hi>Paul, There
are diverſities of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit,
as there are differences of adminiſtrations, but
the ſame Lord, and diverſities of operations,
but the ſame God,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 4, 5, 6. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no wiſer a queſtion to ask, whether by
<hi>the Spirit</hi> be meant <hi>this gift,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi>
when it is only <hi>the Spirit in General</hi> that is

by the ſame Spirit, to another Faith by the

if any man can prove that this promiſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:120705:68"/>
of the Spirit to the faithfull, is meant only
of the extraordinary gift of Miracles, then
he would weaken the Argument that I am
about. But I prove that contrary, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 12, 13. It is the gift of the Spirit, by
which we are <hi>One body,</hi> which is called
<hi>Chriſts, by which we are all baptized into this
one body;</hi> and ſuch members as have a lively
fellow-feeling of each others ſtate, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26.
27. Yea ſuch as giveth to the Elect, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
durable grace of Charity, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31.
and Chap. 13.</p>
               <p>Gal. 4. 6. <hi>And becauſe ye are Sonnes, God
hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Sonne into your
hearts, crying Abba, Father.</hi> Note here,
that it is not only the gift of Miracles, but the
Spirit of Adoption that is here mentioned;
and that it's given to Believers, becauſe they
are Sonnes. And all the firſt part of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
to <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. doth ſhew, that it is the Spirit of
Adoption, Supplication, and that by which
we mortifie the fleſh, that is given to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p>2 Cor. 1. 21, 22 <hi>Now he which ſtabliſheth
us with you in Chriſt, and hath anointed us,
is God who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the
earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi> It is not
the common gifts of the Spirit only that are
here ſpoken of, nor is it the firſt gift of Faith,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:120705:69"/>
but it is <hi>Confirmation,</hi> or inward eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Chriſt, and that Spirit, which is the
<hi>Fathers Seal</hi> upon us, and <hi>the earneſt of the
Inheritance.</hi> I believe not that it is outward
Anointing, or ſealing with the ſigne of the
Croſs, that is here mentioned, as many
Papiſts dreame; but inward unction, ſeal,
earneſt, and confirmation by the Spirit, are
here expreſt. So 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 5. Zach.</hi> 12. 10.
It is the <hi>Spirit of Grace and Supplication</hi> that
is promiſed to the Church. And ſee the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
in Chriſt our head, on whom after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<hi>the Spirit deſcended,</hi> and to whom it is
<hi>promiſed,</hi> Matth. 12 18.</p>
               <p>Epheſ. 1. 13, 14. <hi>In whom alſo after yee
believed, yee were ſealed with the Holy Spirit
of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
Here it's evident that it's ſuch a gift
of the Spirit, which is an <hi>Earneſt</hi> of
Heaven that is given to men, after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p>Joh. <hi>7. 39. For the Holy Ghoſt was not yet
given them becauſe that Jeſus was not yet Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſied.</hi>Yet the Apoſtles had <hi>Saving Faith</hi>then. And that it is not meant only of the
Apoſtles extraordinary gifts of Miracles, the
foregoeing words ſhew: <hi>He that believeth
on me, out of his belly ſhall flow living waeters:
but this he ſpake of the Spirit, which they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:120705:69"/>
that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all this it is evident, that there was an
Eminent gift of the Holy Ghoſt promiſed to
them that had already the grace of <hi>Faith, and
Repentance, and Love to Chriſt,</hi> wrought
in them by the Holy Ghoſt; and that though
this Eminent Gift, did very much conſiſt in
gifts of Languages, Propheſie, and mighty
works for the Confirmation of Chriſts Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which was then to be planted in the
world: yet was it not only in thoſe gifts;
but as ſome had only thoſe common (though
extraordinary) gifts, for the good of the
Church; ſo ſome had an Eminent addition of
Special Gifts, to ſeal them up to the day of
Redemption, and be the earneſt of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
to the ſaving of the Soul. If you
ask, <hi>Wherein theſe ſpecial Eminent Gifts of
the Holy Ghoſt do conſiſt,</hi> I Anſwer: 1. In a
clearer knowledg of Chriſt,<note place="margin">☜</note> and the r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of the Goſpel; not an uneffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
but a powerful, affecting, practical
Knowledge. 2. In a fuller meaſure of Love,
agreeable to this Knowledg. 3. In Joy and
Peace, and ſweet Conſolation. 4. In eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment,
and corroboration, and firmer
reſolution for Chriſt, and everlaſting Life.</p>
               <p>For the underſtanding of which we muſt
know, that as the Doctrine is the Means of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:120705:70"/>
conveying the Spirit, ſo the Spirit given is
anſwerable to the Doctrine, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
that men are under. It's a very great
queſtion whether <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency had the
Spirit or not? But as the Adminiſtration ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the meer Light, and Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is eminently in Scripture attributed to
the Father, ſo <hi>Adam</hi> certainly may be well
ſaid to have had the Spirit of the Father, to
enable him with gifts that were anſwerable
to the Law that he was under, and the ſtate
that he was in: But we cannot fitly ſay that
he had that which the Scripture calleth the
Spirit of the Sonne, as not being under the
Adminiſtration of the Sonne. But after the
Promiſe till the coming of Chriſt, as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
was mixt of Law and Promiſe,
Nature and Grace, as the dawning of the
day before Sunne riſing doth partake of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and of Light, ſo the Spirit that was then
given, was anſwerable to the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Doctrine. And therefore as there
was ſomewhat of the Goſpel in thoſe times,
though yet God hath not thought it meet to
call it (at leaſt uſually) by that name, but
rather by the name of <hi>the Promiſes,</hi> and
<hi>Prophecies of Chriſt;</hi> ſo there was ſomewhat
of the Spirit of Chriſt, though it be not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſo called, but when it appeared in ſome
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:120705:70"/>
eminent Servants of Chriſt, as the Prophets
were, in whom the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to
have been, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. Now as it was
part of that work aſcribed to the Father, to
<hi>ſend and give the Sonne,</hi> and to <hi>Give men
to the Sonne;</hi> ſo commonly thoſe <hi>Gifts</hi> are
aſcrbed to <hi>Him</hi> which are cotained in theſe
expreſſions, and are the accompliſhment of
this work; And that not only in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
but in the New: and therefore it
is called the <hi>Giving and the Drawing of the
Father,</hi> by which we are brought to <hi>Believe
in the Sonne;</hi> though yet the Grace of Faith
is a ſpecial Saving Grace, and not common
to the wicked, as the Papiſts dreame, becauſe
they find an uneffectual Aſſent to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p>But now, as Chriſt at his coming doth
bring to the world a clearer Light, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Revelation of Himſelf, and the myſteries
of Redemption, and <hi>bring Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
to Light in the Goſpel;</hi> and as the riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sunne, diſpelleth the remnants of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
darkneſs, and his Doctrine is fully called
<hi>The Goſpel, the Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo
anſwerably he doth by, and with this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
give out ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit,
to the Church; as is Eminently called <hi>the
Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Which carryeth us
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:120705:71"/>
higher then the firſt Grace of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
to thoſe fuller degrees which were
not ordinary, no not to the Godly in the
time of the Law. And as this Spirit of
Chriſt did extrinſecally ſhine in the Glory of
tongues and wonderous works, while thoſe
were neceſſary to the Church, and Chriſts
ſervice; ſo both then, and ever after it doth
work (but in various degrees) for the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
of believers, and conforming their
hearts and lives to Chriſt; in his humiliation,
patience, ſelf-denial, meekneſs, contempt
of the world, obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till at laſt we
be conformed to him in his Glory.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I have cleared the ſecond point,<hi>(that there is an Eminent Gift of the Holy
Ghoſt to be expected after our firſt Believing,
even ſuch as ceaſed not with Miracles:</hi> I
now come to the third point, which is, <hi>That
Miniſterial Prayer with Laying on of hands,
was the Scripture-way for the giving of this
Eminent gift of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the underſtanding of this, obſerve
theſe things: 1. How Sacraments, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting
ſignes, conferre Grace. 2. How
the Spirit is given in Baptiſme 3. How far
God hath, as it were, tyed himſelf to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
for conferring Grace. 4. What
proof the Scripture yields us of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:120705:71"/>
5. What aptitude there is in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
Confirmation, for the attainment of
theſe ends.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We find in Scripture, that Sacraments
are not appointed (nor to be uſed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the intent of the inſtituter) for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
of that Grace which men have not in
any degree already: but they are, 1. Partly
a <hi>Solemn Inveſtiture</hi> in that which before we
had a <hi>Fundamental Right</hi> to: as the Liſting
of a Souldiour, or the ſolemnization of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
after a firm contract; the Crowning
of a King; the delivering poſſeſſion by a
Key, a twig, or turf; the Knighting a man
by a ſword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is as to Relative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
and Right to Phycal benefits. 2. And
withal they are by actual excitation of Grace,
to Increaſe the Inherent Grace received, and
ſo to give us more. All this is evident in
Baptiſm it ſelf, where we are to receive both
Remiſſion of ſinnes, with right to Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
Life, and alſo an increaſe of Grace in
the Adult: And yet no man at age, is to
come to Baptiſm (to require it) that is not
a Penitent Believer already, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that hath not the beginning of ſpecial Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Grace, and ſomewhat of Chriſt, and
the Holy Ghoſt; and title to forgiveneſs,
and Everlaſting Life. For he is under the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:120705:72"/>
promiſe that <hi>Whoeſoever believeth, ſhall not
periſh, but have Everlaſting Life:</hi> and a
Papiſt will grant, that the <hi>Votum Baptiſmi</hi>
may ſerve to his Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vation, if he die without
it. And the caſe of Infants is the ſame, as
to theſe Mercies which are Neceſſary to their
ſtate of life. Their Parents muſt be Believers,
before they Dedicate them to God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the Child hath the Covenant right
before it is ſealed. And it is ridiculous in the
Papiſts to damn all Infants, for want of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and not the Aged; and to make the
<hi>Votum</hi> to ſerve for the Parent, and yet not
for his Child, when yet the Parents Faith
muſt ſerve to prove his Title to Baptiſm it
ſelf. But to leave theſe Corrupters, and
Innovatours; we ſee now what is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by Confirmation: Not that men that
have no ſignes of Corroborating Grace,
ſhould come thither firſt to receive it; but
that ſuch as appear <hi>Initially Reſolved, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
and Corroborated,</hi> may be (though
not by a full and proper Sacrament, yet) <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterially;</hi>
1. <hi>Inveſted</hi> into the ſtate of the
Confirmed, and their Priviledges, which is
a higher form in the Schoole of Chriſt. 2. And
may receive yet further Confirmation, and
Corroboration by Gods Approbation, and
Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:120705:72"/>
2. <hi>But hath not Baptiſm done all this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
ſeeing we are Baptized into the Name
of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> This is our ſecond Point
to be reſolved. I Anſwer, It is a great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
to think that Adult Perſons that have
nothing of the Holy Ghoſt, may demand
Baptiſm, and that Baptiſm doth not give the
Holy Ghoſt: But yet it's one thing to give
the Holy Ghoſt in <hi>Relation, and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Right,</hi> and another thing to give the
Graces of the Spirit; and it's one thing to
ſeale and increaſe the Initial, Special Grace
of the Spirit, and another thing to Inveſt in
a ſtabliſhing degree: And ſo it is evident that
Baptiſm, as ſuch is appointed but for the
two firſt: That is, 1. As we muſt have ſome
Faith and Repentance, before a perſon at age
may come to Baptiſm, and ſo muſt have
Fundamental Right by promiſe, to Chriſt,
and pardon, and life, ſo this is <hi>ſealed</hi> in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and we are <hi>ſolemnly Inveſted</hi> in it, and
our Grace excited for increaſe: But it is not
requiſite that a man have a further degree of
Grace before he come. 2. In Baptiſm, it
is our very Relation to God, as our Father
and God, to Chriſt as our Saviour, and to
the Holy Ghoſt as our Sanctifier, that is
ſealed to us, and we are Inveſted with:
which is the Foundation of all that afterward
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:120705:73"/>
from the Spirit is given us. As in Marriage,
the perſons in Relation, are given to each
other for Marriage ends; So in Baptiſm,
God the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt,
one God in three perſons, are ſolemnly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to us in Relation to themſelves, for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
Baptiſmal Ends. But as after Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
the man takes home his wife, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth
her a poſſeſſion of his houſe firſt,
and after admits her to bed and board, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Covenant, ſo Chriſt doth after
Baptiſm, take home the Chriſtian into his
Church, and admit him to the ſeveral Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of it, in the ſeaſon, and manner as he
ſeeth meet. So that as all the good that we
do after Baptiſm, is but the fulfilling of our
Baptiſmal Covenant, and yet we did not the
good when we Covenanted to do it: So all
the after-Mercies, that God giveth us by
promiſe (at leaſt) on his part, are but the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling,
or fruits of his Baptiſmal Covenant;
and that he did not give them in our Baptiſm.
So that Confirmation is no full, and proper
Goſpel Sacrament as Baptiſm is, but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſubſequent Inveſtiture, in ſome of
the fruits of Baptiſm it ſelf, in the ſeaſon of
them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>But have we any certainty, that this
Ordinance ſhall prove effectually confirming to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:120705:73"/>
us? If not it will be but an idle, empty Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi>
This is our third Queſtion: To which
I Anſwer: 1. Ordinances are Duties, which
we muſt uſe, and in which we muſt wait on
God for his bleſſing, if we will have it: and
therefore in the way of Duty, we muſt be
found. 2. What if you have not a certainty
that your Prayer ſhall be granted, will you
not therefore pray? Or if you are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that a Sermon ſhall profit you, will you
not hear it? Or that Reading ſhall profit
you, will you not read? Or that the Lords
Supper ſhall increaſe your Grace; will you
not uſe it? 3. But I may ſay more: If you
come prepared, you may be ſure of a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in ſome degree: As it is not every one
that Prayeth, and heareth, and Receiveth
the Lords Supper, that ſhall certainly have
the bleſſing, but the prepared Soul that is
the ſubject of the promiſe, which is annexed
to that Ordinance; ſo it is not every one, that
is externally Confirmed by Prayer, and
Impoſition of Lands, that ſhall be ſure of
the Bleſſing, but the Soul that is prepared,
as aforedeſcribed. 4. But yet the ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Bleſſing, God hath kept in his own
hand, and not affixed them by promiſe to
any perſon, in any Ordinance: He may bleſs
the Word, Prayer, the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:120705:74"/>
to one true Chriſtian more then to another,
and yet perform his promiſe to them all:
and ſo he may this outward Confirmation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>But what proofe is there in Scripture of
ſuch an Ordinance, or Practice?</hi> That's
our fourth Queſtion: To which I Anſwer,
1. For the main Point in queſtion, it's alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
proved, beyond all Controverſie, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Neceſſity of a Perſonal Profeſſion, and
Covenant, before men be admitted to the
Church-priviledges of the Adult, and that
it belongeth to the Office of Chriſt's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to judge of, and approve this Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is none of this that we have
now to prove, but only the <hi>Manner of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſon</hi>
hereupon, whether it be to be done <hi>by
Prayer with Benediction, and Impoſition of
hands:</hi> And it is not the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of this;
for that's proved before: but <hi>whether this
Manner and Solemnity be a thing which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
we ſhould obſerve?</hi> And that it is ſo,
this ſeems to me to prove, 1. As beyond
Controverſie it belongeth to Spiritual Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
even the Miniſters of Chriſt, to
<hi>Pray</hi> for the people, and <hi>Bleſs</hi> them, ſo
this muſt be in a ſpecial manner exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
great and ſpecial Occaſion: But the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of the Adult upon their perſonal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting
and Profeſſion, is a great and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:120705:74"/>
ſpecial Occaſion: This is as good an Argument
as we have for ſtated Family-prayer, that
I remember; and it's cleerly good for both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhould but trouble you to prove the
General Part of the Major, that it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Paſtours to Pray for, and Bleſs the
people Miniſterially. 2. And the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this ſeaſon is proved thus; 1. <hi>All
things are Sanctified by the Word and Prayer:</hi>
Therefore this. 2. If the great and ſpecial
works, and changes of our lives, be not
thus to be Sanctified, much leſs the ſmaller;
and ſo the whole Command would be void.
We agree, that at Marriage, at our Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the Miniſterial Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there
muſt be Miniſterial Prayer, and Benediction,
uſually to Sanctifie it to the faithful: But
here there is as great, if not greater reaſon
for it, the change and
bleſſing being in ſome ſort
greater<note n="*" place="margin">As ſome doubt whether Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or building up be the greater work (and give it to the later, that they may conclude the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as this is plain for
Miniſterial Prayer and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction,
ſo it ſeems
that the Weight and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the work, doth

of Impoſition of hands,
ſeeing God hath not tyed

it to any one or two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
caſes, but made it
a ſigne of General uſe, in

               <p n="2">2. But we have yet a more clear proof
from Scripture example, <hi>Acts 8. 15, 16,
17. Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were ſent to <hi>Samaria,</hi>when they heard that they believed, and<hi>when they were come down, they Prayed for
them, that they might receive the Holy Ghoſt;
for as yet he was fallen on none of them: only
they were Baptized in the Name of the Lord

and they received the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So<hi>

Acts 19. 5, 6. When they herad this, they
were Baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus:

the Holy Ghoſt came on them, and they ſpake

               <p>And this was the gift that <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
would have bought with money. And it
ſeemeth to me moſt probable, that this was
the gift that <hi>Timothy</hi> received by Laying on
of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands (which being for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. He was to
ſtirre up, and exerciſe in his Miniſtry)
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. And that the <hi>Laying on of the
hands of the Presbytery,</hi> 1. Tim. 4. 14. was
at another time. That the Holy Ghoſt was
then given by Prayer, with Impoſition of
hands, is thus evident.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But the laſt Point remaineth, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this were not Temporary and now ceaſed:</hi>
(whether I ſhall take in the fifth particular,
before named, about the Aptitude of the
means now.) And 1. When I have proved
it once <hi>Appointed,</hi> it lyeth on the contrary
minded, to prove it changed, or ceaſed:
That's the task of them that affirm it ceaſed,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:120705:76"/>
If I ſhew them an obligation once laid, they
muſt prove it taken off. Their only Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, that the perſons and occaſion were
only extraordinary, and are ceaſed, and
therefore ſo is the ſigne or means. To which
I Anſwer, 1. By denying the Antecedent;
both as to perſons and occaſion: They were
not <hi>Only extraordinary.</hi> 2. By the denying
the Conſequence, as it is inferred from the
perſons: For extraordinary perſons were
our patterns for ordinary, durable works.</p>
               <p>But I prove the Negative: 1. The Uſe and
Ends of the Ancient Impoſition of hands do
ſtill continue: Therefore we are to judge
that the ſigne and means is not to ceaſe. For
the proofe of the Antecedent, remember that
I have before proved, that it was not only
(though very eminently) the gift of Tongues
and Miracles, that was then meant by <hi>the
Holy Ghoſt</hi> that was given, but alſo <hi>Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating</hi>
Grace. And the neceſſity and
actual collation, and uſe of this doth ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is ſtill a diſcernable Aptitude in
the means to theſe neceſſary Ends. The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
believer may yet want <hi>the Joy of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>boldneſs of Acceſs to God,</hi> and
<hi>the ſhedding abroad of fuller Love in the heart,</hi>
Rom. 5. 5, And that <hi>Conſolation</hi> which is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:120705:76"/>
much of the work of the <hi>promiſed Spirit,</hi>
which therefore is called <hi>the Comforter;</hi> and
that <hi>Corroboration,</hi> and <hi>Stability</hi> which he
needeth. Now to have a Meſſenger of Chriſt
that hath received <hi>a binding and looſing power,</hi>
in the Name of Chriſt to <hi>Encourage</hi> us in our
Profeſſion, and to put up <hi>Solemn Prayers</hi>
for us, and as it were take us by the hand,
and place us in the higher form (at leaſt, to
place us at our firſt perſonal Profeſſion,
among Adult believers) and make particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
application of the Promiſe to us, and
Bleſs us in the Name of Chriſt, by virtue of
their Miniſterial Office; this muſt needs tend
much to confirm, and comfort, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the weak. Though ſtill further Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
Confirmation by Praying, and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
will be neceſſary to the end, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.
22. &amp; 15. 31, 32.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture ſignifieth to us, that
<hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> was of ſtanding uſe in the
Church, and therefore not to ceaſe with
Miracles. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. We find it named
among the parts of the Foundation, <hi>Laying
on of hands.</hi> Now all the doubt is, <hi>what
Impoſiton of hands</hi> is there mentioned. 1. For
them that think the Apoſtle meaneth Jewiſh
Impoſition, when he mentioneth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Foundation Points, I think their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:120705:77"/>
ſaveth me the labour of Confuting it.
2. Either then it is Impoſition of hands, in
caſe of <hi>Ordination,</hi> or in caſe of <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or in caſe of <hi>Abſolution,</hi> or for <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Miraculous</hi> cures. The laſt alone it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, becauſe we find it among <hi>Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Points,</hi> and find it a continued thing; and
becauſe there is no evidence, to lead us to
ſuch a reſtrained expoſition. And if it be in
the caſe of <hi>Abſolution,</hi> or <hi>Ordination,</hi> that
Impoſition is to continue, it will by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
be proved, that it no more ceaſeth <hi>here</hi>
then <hi>there.</hi> And uſually they that queſtion
the uſe of it in one caſe, queſtion it in the
reſt. 3. For my part, I think that it is no
one of theſe caſes alone, that the Scripture
here ſpeaketh of, but of the Power and uſe
of it in General, for the Miniſters of Chriſt
to be his Inſtruments, in conferring Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Gifts, and Power, by impoſition of
hands. We muſt not limit, and reſtrain the
ſence of Scripture, without Evident cauſe.
It is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>You are long
agoe taught the Neceſſity of Repenting, and
forſaking the works of Death, and of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the true God, and of being Dedicated,
and Engaged to Father, Sonne, and Holy
Ghoſt in the Baptiſmal Covenant, in which you
your ſelves have been conſecrated unto God, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:120705:77"/>
received the remiſſion of ſinne; and you have
ſeen the Power that is given to the Miniſters of
Chriſt, that by their Prayers, and Impoſition of
hands, Miracles have been wrought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
their Doctrine, and Grace is given to
confirm the Soul, and Abſolution and Peace
is given to the Penitent, and Miniſteriall
Power delivered to others,</hi> &amp;c. But however
you underſtand this <hi>Impoſition of hands,</hi>
without apparent violence, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
either Impoſition in the caſe that we are
ſpeaking of, or that which will warrant it,
and ſtands on the ſame ground, to be here
meant.</p>
               <p>So <hi>1 Tim. 5. 22. Lay hands ſuddenly on
no man, neither be partaker of other mens
ſinnes.</hi> Some think that here is meant <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of hands in Ordination,</hi> and ſome that
it's meant <hi>only of Confirmation,</hi> and ſome of<hi>Abſolution;</hi> but however, it will help us in
the following Argument.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Scripture fully proveth that <hi>Laying on
of hands,</hi> is a thing to be <hi>continued</hi> to <hi>other
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes,</hi> where the reaſon of continuance is
the ſame: Therefore we are not to judge it
ceaſed as to this uſe. This Text laſt named,
ſhews that it is a <hi>ſtanding, or continued thing;</hi>
and if for <hi>Abſolution,</hi> then for <hi>Confirmation;</hi>
and if for <hi>Ordination,</hi> then <hi>for both the other.</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:120705:78"/>
So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. ſheweth, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
did lay hands on <hi>Timothy</hi> in Ordination:
And if it ceaſe not to this, it ceaſeth not to
other continuing uſes.</p>
               <p>This much from Scripture, for Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of hands, is more then Nothing, though
it may not be ſo full as you expected: But on
the contrary, Nothing is brought to prove it
unlawfull, that's worth the mentioning.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing that I have to do, is to argue
from the Practice of the Church, as the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of theſe texts of Scripture. If the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church of Chriſt have uſed Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Prayer, and Laying on of hands, as a
Practice received from the Apoſtles, and no
other beginning of it can be found; then have
we no reaſon to think the Ceremony to be cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
or to interpret the forementioned Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
contrary to this Practice of the Univerſal
Church: But the Antecedent is true, as I now
come briefly to prove, ſuppoſing what
Mr <hi>Hanmer</hi> hath ſaid. It is commonly known,
that the Ancienteſt Canons of the Church do
ſpeak of this as the unqueſtioned Practice and
duty of the Church: So that to recite Canons
were loſs of time in ſo known a caſe. And if any
ſay that Anointing and Croſſing were Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
I Anſwer, 1. That <hi>they were as ancient
in the Popiſh uſe, as the Matter of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:120705:78"/>
or as neceſſary ſignes,</hi> is not true, nor
proved, but diſproved by our Writers,
againſt the Popiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
frequently.<note place="margin">

Nor can it be proved that
they were as Ancient as
Indifferent things. 3. We
prove the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

1. That we do not
find that God any where
Inſtituted this ſigne, as a
matter of Neceſſity, ſtill
without interruption, to
be uſed; but only that by
holy men it was applyed
as a convenient ſigne, or
geſture to the works, in
which they uſed it. Even
as Lifting up of hands in
Prayer was ordinarily
uſed as a fit geſture, not
wilfully to be neglected
without cauſe, and yet
not of flat neceſſity; or
as kneeling in Prayer, is
ordinarily meet, but not
alway neceſſary. We find
no more Scripture for the
one then for the other:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:120705:80"/>
Which indeed ſheweth on
one ſide, how cauſeleſs it
is to queſtion the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs</hi>
of it, any more
then of Liſting up the
the hands, or Kneeling;
and yet how little reaſon
there is on the other ſide,
to make it a matter of
flat neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As we find that
Kneeling in Prayer, and
Lifting up the hands were oft omitted, ſo we
find that ſometime the Holy Ghoſt is given
before Baptiſm, or Impoſition of hands,
<hi>Acts</hi> 10. And we find not that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
uſed it to all (though I confeſs the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
arguing is infirm, yet it ſeems not
probable, that this was alwaies done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is ſomewhat ſuſpicious to find in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin
Martyr</hi>'s deſcription, of the Chriſtian
Churches Practices, no mention of this, nor
any Sacrament, but Baptiſm, and the Lords
Supper, nor any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
And <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and ſome other are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God maketh no Ceremonies under the
Goſpel ſo neceſſary, (except the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments)
not layeth ſo great a ſtreſs on
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:120705:80"/>
them as under the Law: And therefore we are
not to interpret the Goſpel as laying mens Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
or the Peace of the Church on any Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonies;
unleſs we find it clearly expreſſed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For all that I have ſaid from Scripture for
Impoſition of hands in Confirmation, though
the lawfulneſs of it is proved paſt doubt, yet
the proofe of the duty of uſing it, is lyable to
ſo many Objections, as that I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the Goſpel tenderneſs &amp; the ſenſe of
our mutual infirmities, and our care of tender
Conſciences and of the Churches Peace, ſhould
reſtrain all the Sons of Piety and Peace, from
making it a matter of flat Neceſſity, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them that ſcruple it, to ſubmit to it.</p>
               <p>And now having ſaid thus much of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of hands, and Confirmation, as
grounded on the Apoſtles example; I muſt
againe and againe remember you, that this
is in a manner but <hi>ex aebundanti,</hi> and that
the cauſe that I am pleading, doth not at all
need it; but that I did before moſt clearly
manifeſt the Truth of my poſition upon
other grounds, upon which I ſhall proceed:
and having ſhewed the Neceſſity of Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
judging of mens Profeſſion, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Covenanting of the Adult, and the
Lawfullneſs of impoſing hands therein, I go
on as to the manner.</p>

Acts 8. whom <hi>Philip</hi> Baptized in their

<hi>Acts</hi> 16. Baptzed in the night at home. The

reaſon and caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a man may by Confirmation be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the Number of Adult Chriſtians,

into a particular Church, then his
Profeſſion and Admiſſion need not (in that
caſe) to be before the Congregation: But
the Antecedent is true: as I prove thus.
A man may by Adult Baptiſm, be admitted
firſt into the Univerſal Church only: (As
was the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> the <hi>Jaylour, Lydia, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius

               <p>The Conſequence of the Major is plain.

Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The whole Society among whom ſuch
a perſon is entered, do owe him much duty
and brotherly aſſiſtance: They muſt Love
him with a ſpecial Love: They muſt live,
though not in a Levelling, yet in a Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Community with him, not ſhutting up
the bowels of Compaſſion from him, when
they ſee him in want, but relieving him, as
if they ſufferd with him: They are not only
to Love him, and Relieve him as a man; but
as one of Chriſt's little ones, or friends; yea
as his brethren, yea as loving and relieving
Chriſt in them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 35. to the end.
They muſt receive and relieve a Diſciple in the
name of a Diſciple. Beſides this, they muſt
have Church-Union and Communion with
him, as one Body; and muſt pray for him,
and rejoice with him in Gods Praiſes, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:120705:85"/>
the Lords Supper, and watch over him,
and admoniſh and reprove him in ſinne, for
his recovery; and avoid him if he walk diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly,
and be impenitent in ſcandalous
ſinne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now 1. No man can perform all this duty,
to a man that he knoweth not to be thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to him: If he know not that he owes
him this duty, any more then to any one
elſe in the world, how ſhall he pay it him?
To ſay that we are bound to take all men, that
converſe with us, to be ſuch; is to ſay,
that Chriſtians muſt renounce their witts,
and turn the Church into Bedlam.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as this proves, that the Church-members
muſt be made known to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo it proves that they muſt have a
Judgment of Diſcretion in receiving them:
(though the Paſtours have the Judgment of
Governing Direction.) For 1. God hath
not left the Paſtours at liberty, to take in
whom they Pleaſe; but hath deſcribed what
Profeſſion they ſhall accept, or what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
they ſhall admit, and whom they ſhall
reject. If therefore the Paſtours go againſt
the Word of God, then this following is the
peoples duty: 1. If they know not the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
or the caſe be doubtfull, they are to
reſt in Obedience to their Paſtours, (for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:120705:85"/>
that's undoubtedly their duty) the work
being the Paſtours and not theirs. 2. But if
the caſe be plainly contrary to the Scripture,
(as if he would admit an Impenitent Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,
Fornicatour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) they muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
his ſinne, that it lie not upon them, and
refuſe private familiarity with that perſon;
but not withdraw from publick Ordinances,
becauſe of his preſence. For when they have
done their duty, and rid themſelves of the
guilt by a diſſent, the perſon is to them as
Morrally abſent, though Locally and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically
preſent; and the Ordinance is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
to them by his Corporal preſence; but
the guilt will lie on the Rulers of the Church:
otherwiſe, all Churches ſhould be broken in
pieces, if the people muſt ſeperate, when
every one that they are confident is unworthy
is Introduced: and the Governed will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Governours. 3. But if it be not
a few that the Paſtours thus introduce againſt
the certain Word of God; but ſo many and
ſuch as will corrupt the ſubſtance of the
Church,<note place="margin">☞</note> and make it an uncapable
matter for the form, and ſo to become
another thing, and deſtroy the very
Ends of Church-aſſociation, ſo that it is no
longer a Communion of Saints; then the
people fearing God, are bound to ſtop this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:120705:86"/>
before it have quite corrupted the Church, by
admoniſhing the Paſtours, and adviſing
with neighbour Churches to admoniſh them;
and if that prevail not, by rejecting them:
and if they cannot do ſo, by reaſon of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
Vote of uncapable perſons, they ought
to withdraw themſelves, and worſhip God
in ſuch a Church as is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
capable of the Name
and Ends:<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And indeed it would
be very hard meaſure, if
at the corrupt adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a carnal, or carleſs, or erroneous
Paſtour, all the Church muſt be under an
Obligation to give their eſtates by way of
relief to every one, that he will put the name
of a Chriſtian and Church member upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily:
Then may he force them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:120705:86"/>
all the beggars and rogues about them,
though they were Infidels and impious men.
I ſpeak not of the common relief of the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
for that I know they owe to an Infidel:
but of the ſpecial Community, which Charity
muſt make among the Diſciples of Chriſt.
It's againſt all Reaſon, that an erring or
careleſs Paſtour, ſhall thus Command all the
Peoples eſtates, by introducing ſuch without
their conſent, whom they are bound thus to
maintaine.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yea indeed, the Spirit of God, is in the
Saints, a Spirit of diſcerning; ſo that it is not
Poſſible that all the Church ſhould in their
Affections obey ſuch a corrupt Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
by Loving all the notorious, ungodly
men, as Saints, with the ſpecial Love of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
whom he will careleſly, or errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
put in the place of Saints. I cannot
poſſibly Love that man as a Saint, or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Chriſt, that I am certain is his enemy,
and none ſuch.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, that though the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be not Church-governours by a Vote
(that's a great errour) yet they have a
Judgment of Diſcerning, according to which,
they muſt obey, or reject their Paſtours ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations.
And he that denyeth this,
and would have them yield an Abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:120705:87"/>
without trying, chooſing and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
would not only make the Paſtours to
be of a Papal ſtreine, but would give them a
Jeſuitical Obedience, above what the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Papiſts give the Pope. And therefore
ſeeing that <hi>ad finem</hi> there is a Neceſſity that
the People conſent, (or elſe they cannot
Obey, nor hold communion with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
therefore there is alſo the ſame Neceſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>ad finem</hi> that they have ſatisfaction offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them, and have either the cogniſance of
the Profeſſion, and admiſſion of the perſon,
or that they be ſatisfied in the fidelity of their
Paſtours in Adminiſtration, and that he ſeek
their conſent; or (which is beſt) that ſome
choſen perſons do Repreſent them, and be
preſent at ſuch Profeſſions with the Paſtours;
and the Paſtours, and their own Delegates
together, do acquaint the Congregation of
all that are Admitted, and of their Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
Prfeſſion, that they may hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them. This I ſpeak of thoſe
(which are very many) that are fit for
Church-communion, and yet through baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs,
or want of utterance, are unable
to make a Publike Profeſſion before all (The
choiſeſt Chriſtians that I have known, have

Univerſal Church: notwithſtanding their
unjuſt refuſall. 2. He hath power to Admit
him into that particular Church, againſt their
unjuſt diſſent, as he is the Ruler of the
Church, and the Adminiſtratour of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
3. He hath Authority to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:120705:88"/>
and command them from Chriſt, to
hold communion with the perſon, and do
their duty to him: which if they do not
they commit a double ſinne: one of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
and uncharitableneſs, in a cauſleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
of a member of Chriſt; and another
of diſobedience, againſt the fifth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.
4. But yet the Paſtours cannot
force the people to obey their advice, and
command, nor effectually procure it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps.
5. And therefore their forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Power is not alwaies to be exerciſed.
For it is in vaine to uſe a means, that will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hinder the End then attain to it; and ſo
is at that time, no means. Sometimes the
Paſtour may ſee juſt cauſe to exerciſe all this
Power, and execute his part of Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the perſon, in adminiſtring the
Ordinances to him, and leave the people an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to God, for refuſing their part:
But this is not an uſual caſe: Uſually, if he
ſee the People reſolve againſt Communion,
with that perſon (how fit ſoever,) he is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to cleare himſelf by diſallowing them
in their ſinne, and reproving them for it,
and leaving the blame on them; and then in
Prudence to forbear the Intruding of the
perſon; becauſe no duty is at all times a duty
to be performed; and eſpecially when the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:120705:88"/>
hurt that will follow upon it, in the diviſions
of the Church, is like to be far greater then
the good, if it be done. 6. But if the
Church ſhould be ſo corrupted, as that the
Major Vote doth ſet againſt Faith and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
as ſuch, and ſo will not admit a ſound
member to be added to them, the Paſtour
with the Minor part, may after due Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
and Patience, as juſtly reject the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and obſtinate, as if they were but one man,
and not a Major part.</p>
               <p>What is ſaid of this caſe of Admiſſion,
holds alſo of Rejection by Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of other Antecedent acts of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, If Excommunication muſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
be done in publique, before the whole

muſt uſually be done in publique (the

It's hard if a Natural body may not lawfully

2. And to acquaint you who it is
among us, that are, or are not to be called
to Confirmation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not the degree of clearneſs and
openneſs in our Profeſſion, or in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
Approbation or Admiſſion, that is
Eſſential to a Church-member. An obſcure
Profeſſion may be truly a Profeſſion. Some
obſcure Profeſſion, hath been ordinarily
made by our people in this Land heretofore,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:120705:91"/>
by their ordinary hearing the Word, and
ſtanding up at the Recital of the Creed; and
joyning with the Church in Prayer and
Praiſe, and confeſſing the Scriptures to be
the Word of God, and acknowledging the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry:
And a further Profeſſion they made,
by actual receiving the Lords Supper, which
is a ſilent Profeſſion of their Faith in Chriſt.
And though they were not ſolemnly Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and Confirmed, (except that one of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
had a Cerimonious Confirmation from
the Biſhop in their Childhood) yet were
they Actually admitted to daily Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Church, and the ſpecial part
of Communion in the Lords Supper. And
though this Profeſſion and admiſſion was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably
defective, (of which more anon)
yet it is ſuch as may prove our ordinary Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
to have been true Churches.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">☞</note> And I do not think it fit, that
any that have been already admitted to
Church-communion in the Lords Supper,
ſhould be now called out to Confirmation,
by Impoſition of hands; though where there
is juſt cauſe to queſtion their Knowledg,
Faith, or lives, they may by the Poſtour
be called to give an account of them; and put
upon a clearer Profeſſion then they have yet
made: But ſure when they have been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:120705:91"/>
to the Lords Supper, by any regular
Miniſtry and Church, they are to be taken
for Adult-members, till they are juſtly caſt
out, or do caſt out themſelves. For the
more Perfect doth include the leſs Perfect in
it: If a man be ordained a Presbyter, that
was never ordained Deacon, he is not to be
called back againe and made a Deacon. If
you make a man free of your Trade, before
he was ever bound prentice; you cannot call
him back againe, and bind him prentice after
this. If the Univerſity give a man the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Doctor of Divinity, or Maſter of
Arts, that never took Degree of Batchelour
of Divinity, or of Arts, they cannot after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
call him back to take his Batchelours
Degree. If you have irregularly admitted
the untryed, unapproved, unconfirmed to
the Lord Supper, you have <hi>Eminenter,</hi>
though not <hi>Formaliter</hi> Confirmed and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
him though irregularly. Of this

Cure.</head>
               <p>LEt us here take a view of the caſe of our
Nation, and Congregations, and then
conſider of the effects and conſequents.</p>
               <p>All the people of our Pariſhes, (except
<hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>) do bring their Children to be
Baptized; which if it were faithfully done,
were a happy means of an early engagement
unto Chriſt, and a happy enterance upon
further mercy.) Multitudes of thoſe know
not what Baptiſm is, nor to what uſe and
end it is appointed, nor what benefit their
Children may receive by it: (I ſpeak upon
too ſure and large experience) nor do they
know what Chriſtianity is, nor who Jeſus
Chriſt is, nor what it is, that they are to do
in Baptiſm: But there they make a promiſe
cuſtomarily, as they are bid, in words not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:120705:92"/>
underſtood, that they will acquaint their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at age with the Covenant there made
(which they never underſtood themſelves)
and that they will educate them in Godlineſs,
when they hate Godlineſs at the heart. And
when they come home, they performe their
promiſe accordingly: They teach them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, and
the life to come, but they give them up to the
fleſh and the world, which there in words
they did renounce; and they teach them by
their daily examples to curſe, and ſwear, and
raile, and to be proud and covetuous, and
voluptuous, ſerving their bellies in ſtead of
God; and hateful reproaching a godly life,
inſtead of teaching it their Children. Theſe
Children are cuſtomarily brought to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
where they heare the plaineſt
teaching, without underſtanding, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
it, and grow hardened under daily
reproofs and exhortations; living as
their Parents taught them, ſome in groſs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and worldlyneſs, without any ſignes
of Godlyneſs, further then to come to
Church; ſome in Drunkenneſs, ſome in
Whoredom, abundance in a malignant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of a holy life, making them that uſe it
the common ſcorne, and taking them for the
hatefulleſt perſons in the Pariſh, or Country
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:120705:93"/>
where they live: For cuſtome ſake, and to
quiet their Conſcience in their ſinne, they
will come to the Lords Table, if they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the Paſtour, and may have it in
their mode and way: And if a Miniſter ſhall
deſire them to come to him firſt, that he may
underſtand their knowledg and Profeſſion,
they ſcorn it; and ask him by what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he would examine them, and what proof
he hath that men muſt be examined, before
they be admitted to the Lords Supper? And
ſome ſelf-conceited, half-witted Writers
have taught them this leſſon, and made Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
tryal and Approbation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>odious to
them. But becauſe they were once Baptized,
and have ſince come to hear and joyne with
us in the Aſſembly, therefore they think
that they have right to all Ordinances, and
are true Chriſtians and Adult members of the
Church; and alſo exempt from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Paſtours, that require them to
ſubmit to the means of their own good. In
the Biſhops daies, ſome few of them were
Confirmed: (in the Country where I lived,
about one of ten or twenty) and what that
was, and how it was done I can tell you, but
what I once made tryall of. When I was a
Schoole-boy, about 15 years of age, the
Biſhop coming into the Country, many
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:120705:93"/>
went in to him to be Confirmed: we that
were boies, runne out to ſee the Biſhop
among the reſt, not knowing any thing of
the meaning of the buſineſs: when we came
thither, we met about thirty or fourty in all,
of our own ſtature and temper, that had
come for to be Biſhopt, as then it was called:
The Biſhop examined us not at all in one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Faith; but in a Church-yard, in
haſt, we were ſet in a rank, and he paſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily
over us, laying his hands on our head,
and ſaying a few words, which neither I nor
any that I ſpoke with, underſtood; ſo haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were they uttered, and a very ſhort pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
recited, and there was an end. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they
we were Chriſtians or Infidels, or knew
ſo much as that there was a God, the Biſhop
little knew, nor enquired. And yet he was
one of the beſt Biſhops eſteemed in <hi>England.</hi>
And though the Canons require, that the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
or Miniſter ſend a Certificate that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
have learnt the Catechiſm; yet there
was no ſuch thing done, but we runne of our
own accord to ſee the Biſhop only; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the reſt of the County, had not this
much: This was the old careleſs practice of
this Excellent Duty of Confirmation. Some
few (perhaps halfe a Pariſh in the beſt places)
will ſend their children to Church, to be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:120705:94"/>
catechized yet; but even thoſe few that learn
the words for the moſt part underſtand not
what they ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are as ignorant of the
matters, as if they never learnt the words.
This is the common way, by which our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
come to be Churches, and our people
to be Chriſtians; ſuppoſing ſome to be mixt
among them, that are more Faithfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to God in Baptiſm, and better educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in the feare of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now let us ſee what are the real, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
undenyable fruits of this defective ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
courſe. Becauſe men build upon this <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
falſhood,</hi> that infant Baptiſm upon
the Parents Profeſſion, doth give them
right to the Church-ſtate and Priviledges of
the Adult, without any perſonal Profeſſion
and Covenanting with God, when they come
to the uſe of reaſon, which the Church muſt
have cogniſance of; and ſo they that entred
ſomewhat more Regularly into an Infant
Church ſtate, do become Adult-members
ſecretly, unobſervedly, and no body well
knows how: Hereupon it followeth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our Churches are lamentably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and diſeaſed, (though they are true
Churches, and have Life in them) while
they are made ſo like the unbelieving and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
world; and the Garden of Chriſt is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:120705:94"/>
made too like the common wilderneſs For
Heathens, and Impious perſons, and all
ſorts of the unclean (almoſt) are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of them, where Pariſhes, or Pariſh-meetings
are made convertible with Churches.
I would make the caſe neither worſe nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then it is. Till within theſe few years, I
knew but very imperfectly how it is, and I
thought the caſe had been better with ſome,
and worſe with others then I have found it
upon tryall. And had I not ſet upon the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Perſonal inſtruction, I ſhould never
have known the ſtate of the people: But now
we have dealt with them almoſt all in private
perſonally, I ſhall truly tell you the ſtate of
this Pariſh, by which you may conjecture at
the reſt of the Nation. I know not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
in <hi>England</hi> that hath in it Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
ſo many that fear God: and yet
our whole Pariſh conſiſteth of all theſe ſorts
following. 1. Among eight hundred Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
there are about five hundred perſons,
ſuch as the vulgar call preciſe, that are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be ſerious Profeſſours of Religion, (or
perhaps ſomewhat more) Theſe live in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and ſeem to me to ſeek firſt the Kingdom
of God and his Righteouſneſs; and are of as
peaceable, harmleſs, humble Spirits, and
as unanimous without inclination to Sects, or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:120705:95"/>
Oſtentation of their parts, as any people I
know. 2. Beſides theſe there are ſome of
competent Knowledg and exterior perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
and lives ſo blameleſs, that we can
gather from them no certain Proofe, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Preſumption that they are ungodly, or
that their Profeſſion is not ſincere. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of theſe joyning with the reſt, as make
about ſix hundred, do own their Church-memberſhip,
and conſent to live under ſo
much of Church-Order and Government, as
unqueſtionably belongeth to Presbyters to
exerciſe, and to be my Paſtoral charge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides theſe, there are ſome that are
tractable and of willing minds, that by their
expreſſions ſeem to be ignorant of the very
Eſſentials of Chriſtanity; which yet I find to
have obſcure conceptions of the truth, when
I have condeſcendingly better ſearcht them,
and helped them by my enquiries. Theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

we receive.<note n="*" place="margin">Of this fourth ſort I hope are many that truly fear God, that ſome on one pretence, and ſome on an other, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ioyn with us in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: but yet heare, and live in love and peace with us. And ſome do joyn with us (on the grounds as godly ſtrangers may be admitted) ſomtime in the Lords Supper; that yet expreſly own not a memberſhip in the particular Church.</note> 4. Some
there are that are of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
underſtandings,
and of lives ſo blameleſs,
that we durſt not reject
them; but they hold off
themſelves, becauſe they
are taught to queſtion, if
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:120705:95"/>
not to diſown our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations;
for all that,
we give liberty to all that
in tollerable things do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.
5. Some there are,
that are ſecret Heathens,
believing with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
that the world was from
Eternity; making a ſcorn
of Chriſt, and <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and Heaven, and Hell, and
Scripture, and Miniſters, and all Religion;
thinking that there is no Devill, no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the Soul, or Everlaſting Life:
But this they reveale only in ſecret, to thoſe
that they find capable, by viciouſneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetledneſs,
or any malignity, or diſcontent
againſt the Godly, or the Orders of the
Church: And yet for the hiding of their
minds, they will hear and urge us to baptize
their children, and openly make the moſt
Orthodox Confeſſions, and ſecretly deride
it when they have done, as I can prove. And
this is the only differing party among us, in
Judgment and deſigne,
that is in danger of leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

riſing up in tumults againſt the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:120705:96"/>
that endeavour to puniſh a drunkard, or
Sabboth breaker, and reſcuing them, and
ſeeking the ruine of the Officers. 7. Some
there are that are of more tractable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but really know not what a Chriſtian
is: that heare us from day to day, yea and
ſome few of them learn the words of the
Catechiſm, and yet know not almoſt any
more, then the veryeſt Heathen in <hi>America.</hi>
They all confeſs, that we muſt mend our lives,
and ſerve God: but they know not that God
is Eternal, or that Chriſt is God, or that he
is man, but ſay, he is a Spirit; ſome ſay
neither God nor man; ſome ſay God and not
man; ſome ſay man and not God: abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
ſay, He was man on earth, but now
He is not: Abundance know not what He
came to do in the world: nor that there is
any ſatifaction made for ſinne, but what we
muſt make our ſelves; and they tell me,
they truſt to nothing for Pardon and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but Gods Mercy, and their good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him (which is only ſaying every night
and morning in bed, or as they undreſs them,
the Lords Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Creed for a Prayer,
and comming to Church.) They ſay openly,
they do not know of any ſurety that we have,
or any that hath borne the puniſhment of
our ſinne, or ſuffered for us: And when I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:120705:97"/>
repeat the Hiſtory of the Incarnation, life,
death, and reſurrection of Chriſt to them,
they ſtand wondering, and ſay, they never
heard it before: what the Holy Ghoſt is,
they know not: nor what Sanctification,
Faith, or Juſtification is: nor what Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is; nor the Lords Supper; nor to
what uſe, but in general, <hi>for our Salvation.</hi>
What a Church is, they know not; nor
what is the Office of Paſtour or People,
ſave only to preach and hear, and give and
receive the Sacraments. If I ask them what
Chriſtianity is, the beſt anſwer is, that it is
a ſerving God as well as we can, or as God
will give us leave. So that there is ſcarce
an Article of the Creed, or very few that
they tolerably underſtand. Nay one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
foureſcore yeares of age (now dead)
thought Chriſt was the Sunne, that ſhineth
in the Firmament; and the Holy Ghoſt was
the Moone. 8. Many there be, that joyne
this Heatheniſh ignorance, and wicked obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
together; hating to be inſtructed;
ſcorning to come neer me, to be taught, and
to be told of their ſinne, when they come.
They will raile at us bitterly behind our
backs, if we will not let them have their own
will and way about the Sacraments, and
all Church-affaires: but they will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:120705:97"/>
to that Teaching, that ſhould bring them
to know what Chriſt or Chriſtianity is.
9. Some there be that are of tollerable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
and no Drunkards, nor Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers
that the world knoweth of, but of
more plauſible lives, and have ſome formes
of Prayer in their families: but yet live in
idle or tipling company, or ſpend their lives
in vanity, and hate more a diligent ſerving
of God, and heavenly life, then the open
Drunkars do: Theſe make it their work to
poſſeſs people with a hatred of ſtrict Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours,
and of our Churches and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to that end get all the books that
are written for admitting all to the Lords
Table, that they can light
of;<note place="margin">I have but very few of theſe; but I know neighbour Pariſhes that have too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to the grief of their godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> and contrary to the

make them Engines to
harden others in their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
and hatred of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
The like uſe

Another
ſort there are, that are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:120705:98"/>
deeply poſſeſt with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that God having
determined before we are
borne, whether we ſhall
be ſaved or not, it is in
vaine to ſtrive; for if we
be predeſtinated, we ſhall
be ſaved what ever we do;
and if we be not, we ſhall
not, what ever we do; and
that we can do nothing
of our ſelves, nor have
a good thought, but by
the Grace of God, and if God will give it
us, we ſhall have it; and the Devil cannot
prevaile againſt him; but if he will not give
it us, it's in vaine to ſeek it; for it is not in
him that willeth, nor in him that runneth,
but in God that ſheweth Mercy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they give up themſelves to ſecurity and
ungodlineſs, becauſe they cannot do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of themſelves. And thus by miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
ſome Texts of Scripture, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſome Truths of God, they are hardened
in ungodlineſs, thinking that all is long of
God: and they will not ſo much as promiſe
Reformation, nor promiſe to uſe the means,
becauſe they ſay, they cannot tell whether
God will put it into their hearts: and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:120705:98"/>
it is all as he will. 11. Beſides theſe, there
is one or two honeſt, ignorant Profeſſours,
that are turned <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and joyne with
the Church of them in
the next Pariſh.<note place="margin">12. Our Papiſts are but few; but if the reſt of them be ſuch as ours, their Church hath ſmall reaſon to boaſt of its Holineſs.</note> 12. And

ſtate of our Pariſhes may

               <p>And now if all theſe are fit to go for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
then muſt we make a new kind of
Chriſtianity; and a new Goſpel, and a new
Chriſt. And if all theſe are fit to be Church-members,
then we muſt make a new kind of
Churches?</p>
               <p>And why then may not thoſe be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Church-members, that never heard of
the Name of Chriſt, as well as many of theſe?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:120705:99"/>
2. By this untried Entrance of all ſorts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Churches, we bring a diſhonour on
the very Chriſtian Name, and ſo on the
Lord Jeſus himſelf, and on his Goſpel and
holy waies. Chriſtianity is not a matter of
meer Opinion: Chriſt came not into the
world only to perſwade men to have high
thoughts of him, but to ſave his people from
their ſinnes, and to deſtroy the works of the
Devil. And when the Church of Chriſt
ſhall be turned into a den of thieves, or a
ſty of ſwine, what a great diſhonour is it to
the Lord? As if we would perſwade the
world, that his ſervants are no holier then
others, and differ but in an Opinion from
the world. Chriſt needeth not Diſciples, and
therefore will not take in all that refuſe to
come upon his terms; but hath fixed his
terms, and will have only thoſe that will
yield to them. Though I abhorre the rigor
of the contrary extreame, that would make
the Church narrower then it is, and pinne it
up in ſo ſmall a number, as would tempt men
to doubt of Chriſtianity it ſelf; and teacheth
men to exclude their bretheren, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are themſelves uncharitable Judges,
when they are not able to diſprove their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
yet muſt I alſo deteſt this horrible
diſhonouring of the Lord, as if his Body
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:120705:99"/>
were no better than the army of the Devil.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And by this means the Heathens, Jews,
Mahometans and all Infidels are exceedingly
hindred from believing in Chriſt; when they
can ſay as the Turks, when men queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their fidelity; <hi>what? doſt thou think I am
a Chriſtian?</hi> He that knows any thing of
Religious affaires, knoweth that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the firſt thing that draweth men to any
party, is the liking of the <hi>Perſons</hi> and their
<hi>Practices;</hi> from whence they grow to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
with inclination into their doctrines.
The Ancient Chriſtians that lived before the
daies of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> did bring Chriſtianity
into reputation by their <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and God
was then more eminently ſeen among them.
But when the countenance of the Emperour,
and worldly advantages had drawn in all men
to the Church, and the Biſhops did ſet the
door too wide open, Chriſtianity lookt like
another thing, and that inundation of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
overſpread the Church, which <hi>Salvian</hi>
and ſo many more complaine of. Our like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
way to win the Jews, and all Infidels to
the Church, is by ſhewing them the true
Nature of Chriſtianity in the Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hereby alſo we confound the ancient
Order of <hi>Catechumens,</hi> or <hi>Expectants</hi> with
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:120705:100"/>
the true members of the Church, and lay
the Church and the porch, yea and the
Church-yard, if not the commons, all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
By which alſo our Preaching and
Adminiſtrations are confounded: ſo that
whereas the Ancient Churches had their
Common Sermons (and ſome Prayers)
which were fitted to the unconverted or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants;
and had alſo both Doctrine, Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Praiſes, and other worſhip, proper to
the Church (eſpecially on the Lords Daies)
we muſt now ſpeak to all, and joyn with all;
and the Church, and the Enemies of the
Church muſt ſing the ſame Praiſes, as if they
were one body. And God is not the God of
confuſion but of order in the Churches. He
that put two ſorts of Preaching and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
into the Apoſtles Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi>
28. 19, 20. One for making Diſciples and
another for the edifying and guidance of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
did never intend, that theſe ſhould
be confounded.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And then by this means, the Souls of
millions of poore people are deprived of the
great benefits of the Ordinances and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations
ſuitable to their ſtate. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
Word goeth before the feeding,
ſtrengthning Word, even before the milk
for babes. The laying of the foundation
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:120705:100"/>
muſt go before our building thereon. Every
one will thrive beſt in his Own Element and
place. A fiſh will not proſper on dry land,
nor a man under water. The womb is the
only place for the Embrio and unborn child,
though not for thoſe that have ſeen the Sun.
If you will break the ſhell before the Chicken
be hatcht, that you may haſten its produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or honour it with a premature aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
with the reſt that ſee the Sunne, your
fooliſh charity will be the death of it. And
ſo deale abundance of miſtaken Zealots with
the Souls of men; who cry out againſt the
wiſeſt and moſt conſcionable Miniſters, as if
they were unchriſtning the People, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
the world, becauſe they would feed
them with food convenient for them, and
will not be ſuch haſty midwives, as to caſt
the mother into her throws, if not rip her
up, that ſhee may have the child at her
breaſts, which ſhould yet be many daies or
moneths in the womb. Moreover they thus
cauſe our people, to loſe all that benefit of
preparations, and ſolemn Engagement to
Chriſt: of which more anon among the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By this means alſo the Souls of our
poor people are deluded, and they are made
believe that they are Chriſtians when they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:120705:101"/>
are not, and in a ſtate of Salvation, when
it's no ſuch thing.<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

be admitted to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
(or viſible ſocieties
of Chriſtians) till there be
juſt preſumption that he is
of the Heavenly Jeruſalem that is above:—And admitting to, and excluding from the
Church is, or ought to be a juſt and Lawfull
preſumption, of admitting to, or excluding
from Heaven: It is morally and legally the
ſame act that entitleth to Heaven, and to the
Church, that maketh an heir of life Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
and a Chriſtian:</hi>—And if ſo, then
what greater miſchief can we do the Soul of
an ungodly man, then ſo to delude him, by
our admitting him into the Church, and
make him believe he is in a ſtate of Salvation,
when it's no ſuch thing? Falſe faith, and falſe
hopes, are the things that fill Hell, and are the
common undoing of the world: And all that
ever we can do, is too little to cure it. When I
bend all my ſtudies and labours, but to make
a wicked man know that he is wicked, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
procure it. I can make him believe that
he is a ſinner, but not that he is an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
ungodly ſinner, and in a ſtate of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:120705:101"/>
Condemnation. O the power of blinding
ſelf-love! that will not ſuffer them to ſee
themſelves miſerable, when they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſinfull, and all becauſe they would not
have it ſo; when yet it's moſt viſible to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And ſhall we all joyne to ſtrengthen
this potent Enemy? and lay this ſhare, and
thruſt men headlong into Hell, that are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
down-hill ſo faſt already: and all under
pretence of Charity and Compaſſion?</p>
               <p n="7">7. We ſhall put them by this means into a
way, not only of loſing the fruit of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
but of miſapplying all to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
of their deceit: When we preach
Peace to the true believer, the wicked will
miſapply it, and ſay, it belongs to them:
When we ſpeak againſt the unbelievers and
ungodly, they'l think that this is not their
part, but bleſs themſelves becauſe they are
Chriſtians. In our praiſes they are tempted
with the Phariſee to thank God, and perhaps
for mercies which they never had, as Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
Adoption, Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The Sacraments by miſapplication will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
them in Preſumption. And thus as they
enter by deceit, among Adult-believers, ſo
will they turn all the Ordinances of God,
and the Priviledges of the Church to feed that
deceit, more effectuall then among the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:120705:102"/>
it would have been.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But the greateſt miſchief that troubleth
me to think of, is this; that by this haſtening
and admitting all the unprepared into the
Number of Adult-Chriſtians, and members
of the Church; we do either put a neceſſity
upon our ſelves to throw away Church-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline,
or elſe to be moſt probably the
damnation of our peoples Souls, and make
them deſperate, and almoſt paſt all hope,
or remedy. I muſt confeſs, that what I am
ſaying now, I was not ſenſible of, till lately
that experience made me ſenſible: While I
medled not with Publike reproofs or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
I diſputed of theſe things, without
that experience, which I now find is one of
the greateſt helps to reſolve ſuch doubts;
which makes me bold to tell the Church,
that the Practice of ſo much Diſcipline as we
are agreed in, is a likelyer way, to bring us
all to agreement in the reſt, then all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputings
will do without it: And that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
hereafter, to take that man for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent
Judge, and unmeet Diſputer about
Church-diſcipline, that never exerciſed it,
or lived where it was exerciſed: And I ſhall
hereafter ſuſpect their judgments, and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as loath to follow ſuch, as to follow a
ſwimmer, that never was before in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:120705:102"/>
or a Pilote that was never before at ſea;
or a Souldiour that never ſaw warres before,
but have only learned their skill by the Book.
Our caſe ſtands thus: If we take all our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
according to the old Church-conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be particular Churches, and all
the Pariſhiones to be members, then either
we muſt exerciſe the Diſcipline which Chriſt
hath commanded, or not. If not, then we
diſobey our Lord and Maſter, and own ſuch
a Church, as is utterly uncapable of Church-ends,
and conſequently of the eſſence, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it is a Relative being. For it's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that it is not for any unuſual accident,
that we cannot exerciſe this Diſcipline, but
from the very Church conſtitution, or inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of the matter. And then 1. We ſhall
be Traitours to Chriſt, under the name of
Paſtours, if we will wilfully caſt out his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial,
Kingly Government. 2. We ſhall
betray the Church to licentiouſneſs. And
3. We ſhall ſet up a new Church-way, which
is contrary, to that which hath been practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in all ages, from the Apoſtles daies, till
Impiety had overſpread the Chriſtian world.
He that dare take on him to be an Overſeer
and Ruler of the Church, and not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
and rule it, and dare <hi>ſettle</hi> on ſuch a
Church-ſtate, as is uncapable of Diſcipline,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:120705:103"/>
is ſo perfidious to Chriſt, and ventureth
ſo boldly, to make the Church another
thing, that I am reſolved not to be his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower.</p>
               <p>But if we ſhall exerciſe the Diſcipline of
Chriſt upon all in our ordinary Pariſhes,
what work ſhall we make? I will tell you
what work, from ſo much experience, as
that no reaſonings can any more perſwade
me to believe the contrary, then that worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
is not bitter, or ſnow not cold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhall have ſuch a multitude to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
or reject that it will make the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
grow almoſt contemptible by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs.
2. We ſhall ſo extreamly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the ſpirits of the people, that we ſhall
go in continual danger of our lives: Among
ſo many that are publikly reproved, and caſt
out, it's two to one, but ſome deſperate
villains will be ſtudying revenge. But all
this is nothing: but that
which ſticks upon my
heart is this:<note place="margin">This is no diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: for we find it hath great effect on ſuch as are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it.</note> 3. We ſhall
be the cruelleſt enemies to
the Souls of our poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the world: and put
them the very next ſtep
to Hell. For as ſoon as ever we have reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them, and caſt them under publique
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:120705:103"/>
ſhame, they hate us to the heart, and either
will never heare us more, or heare us with
ſo much harted and malice, or bitterneſs of
ſpirit, that they are never like to profit by
us. If you ſay that doubtleſs Diſcipline will
have better fruits, if it be an Ordinance of
God: I Anſwer 1. It's no time now in the
end of the world, to queſtion whether that
be an Ordinance of God, which Scripture
ſpeaks for ſo fully, and ſo plainly; and
which the Catholike Church hath ſo long
practiſed, and that with ſuch ſeverity as it
hath done. 2. I know the Diſcipline is of
excellent uſe, and is likely to have excellent
effects: But upon whom? Upon ſuch as
are fit to come under Diſcipline, and with
ſuch I have ſeen the uſefulneſs of it: but with
the reſt it makes them next to mad. They
that before would patiently hear me, in the
plaineſt, ſharpeſt Sermons that I could
preach, and would quietly bear any private
admonition, when once they are publikly
admoniſhed and caſt out, are filled with the
gall of malice and indignation, and never
more likely to profit by a Sermon. Nay they
ſet themſelves with malice, to reproach and
oppoſe, and ſtir up others; and fall in to
any party, that will receive them that are
enemies to the Miniſtry: ſo that I looke upon
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:120705:104"/>
ſome of them, when once they are caſt out,
almoſt as if they were already in Hell: For
they are deſperately hardened againſt any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means of their recovery. 3. Yea I am
perſwaded, that if we exerciſe Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
according to the Scripture Rule, upon
all in the Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> it would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
a rebellion; and the rage of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would make them ready, to take any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to riſe up againſt the Soveraigne
Power, that doth maintaine and protect us;
and if we were not protected, we ſhould
ſoone have enough of it.</p>

exerciſed but with one half, or the ſixth part
of the ſeverity of the Ancient Canons of the
Church, and you ſhall certainly ſee the effects
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:120705:104"/>
that I tell you of. Do you think to uſe it
but with few, when Impenitent, ſcandalous
ſinners are ſo many? But perhaps you
think to uſe it only <hi>in terrorem</hi> or now and
then one, and let others alone that are in
the ſame caſe. But 1. That's the ſame diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to God, as to uſe it upon none at
all. He that hath commanded us to <hi>reject a

by ſome ſome but by all. God 2. condemneth
partiality. 3. Your Partiality will preſently

               <p>I anſwer, You ſpeak this becauſe you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
tried, and know not the world. I muſt
preſume to tell you (though to tell you the
reaſons be unmeet) that there's but few men
in <hi>England</hi> muſt expect more advantages for
Intereſt in their people, then I have in mine:
and yet all's nothing, when I come to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Diſcipline, and croſs their ſelfiſh, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
inclinations. Thoſe that will tell me,
they are beholden to me for their lives, yet
will not heare me when I perſwade them to
any humbling confeſſion. Thoſe that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hide their ſinne, will confeſs it, and
commit it over and over: will you accept of
their private Confeſſion for Satisfaction,
that will publickly ſlander
their Neighbours,<note place="margin">I deſire thoſe that are overridgid and uncharitable in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring others, not to extend theſe complaints to more then I extend them: nor to take it as an occaſion for the unchurching of whole Pariſhes, or any one particular perſon, without ſufficient evidence. For I muſt profeſs that I meet with hundreds in my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, that I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, that ſome men of ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter principles, or more cenſorious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſitions would reject: Yea, and I take abundance for truly goldy men, that are not noted for any eminency of Religion, perhaps their parties, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, being ſuch as keep them much from the Knowledg of others.</note> or be
drunk openly every week
or month, or ſwear eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day. But many of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:120705:105"/>
them will not ſo much as
confeſs before a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
or Officers of the
Church, that they have
ſinned, but will ſtand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently
in it to the laſt.
Let me intreat them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
the ſubmiſſiveneſs and
earneſtneſs that I can,
when one hath beat or
ſlandred another, or in
the like caſes, if I would
kneel to them, I cannot
get many of them once
(Hypocritically) to ſay,
I am ſorry, or I did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs:
And thoſe that do
ſay ſo, in a cold, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical,
heartleſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
will joyne with it
ſuch bitter words, againſt
the accuſer or reprover,
and ſhew ſuch hatred to
thoſe that admoniſh
them, that declareth their
impenitency. If you have
ſuch extraordinary abilities, to melt and
mollifie hardened ſinners, more then we
have, you are the more unexcuſably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:120705:106"/>
to God and man, that will not uſe
them. And all are not ſo haypy as to have
your conquering parts. For my part I can
ſay in uprightneſs of heart, that I do what
I can do, (abating thoſe neglects which are
the conſequents of any frailty) and if I knew
how to do more, I would, with ſtudy, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
conference, labour or eſtate; and yet
with abundance I am not able to prevaile,
ſo much as to make them capable of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
So that I ſee plainly by unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
experience, that either we muſt have
Churches without the Diſcipline of Chriſt,
and be Rulers without Ruling it; or elſe we
muſt utterly undo our people, body and
Soul for ever, and plunge them into a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſtate, and make all our following la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous
in vaine to multitudes of them: Or
elſe we muſt take another courſe, then to
admit all our Pariſhes to Adult Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip,
as was formerly done, without
preparation, and fitneſs for ſuch a ſtate.</p>
               <p>And yet in their blindneſs, Gentlemen,
Miniſters, and all that plead for common
Church-memberſhip, pretend to be chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Peoples Souls, when they are
exerciſing this grievous cruelty. It is juſt as
if in Mercy to the ſchoole-boyes, you ſhould
ſet them, that cannot read <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:120705:106"/>
higheſt form, where they muſt make Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> or elſe be whipt:
would they thank you for ſuch advancement.
It is as if you ſhould put an ignorant unexer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
cowardly Soldier, or one that is
but learning to uſe his armes, into the front
of the Battaile, for his honour: or as if you
ſhould prefer a Pupill to be a Tutour, or put
a freſhman in the Doctors chaire, or admit
a new baptized Novice to be a Paſtour of the
Church, where the blood of the people ſhall
be required at his hands; or as if to honour
him, you ſhould admit any common Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to the Pilots place, or any Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to play the Phyſician to other mens ruine,
and his owne ſhame. If you ſet ſuch Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
on horsback, while you pretend their
good, you will break their necks. No man
is ſafe out of his own ranck and place: If the
Husbandman know that every ſort of plants
and graine, muſt have their proper ſoile
and ſeaſon, and the Gardner knoweth that
ſeveral herbs and flowers, muſt be variouſly
manured, or elſe they will not proſper;
why ſhould we be leſs wiſe in the Work of
God? As Countrey Schooles are Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to the Academies, ſo the ſtate of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens
or Expectants is the Seminary to
the Church, and the ſtate of Infant Church-memberſhip,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:120705:107"/>
the Seminary to the ſtate of
the Adult, into which they muſt be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
and ſolemnly tranſplanted, when they
are ripe and ready, and not before. Truly
our mercifull haſtlings do but yoake untamed
bullocks, that are fitter to ſtrive and tyre
themſelves then to plow; and do but ſaddle
ſuch wild, unbroken colts, as are liker to
break their own and their riders necks, then
to go the journy which they are deſigned
for. In the ſtate of Expectants, theſe men
may profit by Preparing Ordinances, and
the ſeaſon may come, when they may fitly
be tranſplanted: But if we put them <hi>inter fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles</hi>
that are <hi>infideles,</hi> among Actual Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and Adult Church-members that are
not ſuch, nor prepared for the ſtation, we
bring them under a Diſcipline which will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate
them, and turn them to be malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
enemies, and undoe them for ever.
The Diſpoſition of the matter, muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Reception of the forme: For undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
matter will not receive it. As the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
followeth the Being, and the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
ſo we muſt employ every perſon and
thing, in ſuch operations only, as their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Qualification is capable of, and
ſuited to. A due placing of all according to
their Qualifications, is the chiefeſt part of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:120705:107"/>
our Government. Miſplace but one wheel
in your watch, and try how it will go. If
any perſon or thing be not good in his <hi>Own
place,</hi> he will be much worſe out of in,
it the place of his Superiour. Fire is better
in the chimny then in your bed, or upon
your Table: A good Cleark may make but
a ſorry Counſeller; and a good Subject may
make but an ill Magiſtrate: And many a man
becomes the ſeat of a Juſtice, that would not
become the Princes Throne. If you would
not undoe mens Souls by a Diſcipline, which
they cannot bear; let them ſtay in the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
of Expectants, till they are ripe for it.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But how do the Churches of France,
Holland, Geneva and Scotland, that have
exerciſed Diſcipline upon all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Muſt I be ſent to another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to know that which I have made tryall
of, and attained the certain knowledg of, at
home? I was never in <hi>France,</hi> nor at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
and therefore I know not what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of obſtinate, impenitent, ſcandalous
perſons are there, nor how many that know
who Jeſus Chriſt is, nor what a Chriſtian, or
a Church is: but I have been in <hi>England,</hi> and
I partly know what ſtore of theſe are there,
and what uſage they will bear, and what
not. 2. Either other Churches have ſuch
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:120705:108"/>
materials as our Pariſhes, or not. If not,
their cauſe is none of ours: If they have,
then either they exerciſe Chriſts Diſcipline on
them faithfully, and impartially or not: If not,
then they are not to be imitated by us in their
negligence, unfaithfullneſs, or partiality. If
they do, and yet do not undo the people,
they have not ſuch a people as ours, or elſe
they have other means to further their ends.

what ſhould I think of
Scripture, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the univerſal Church. 2. By this
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:120705:108"/>
neglect it is, that Reformed Churches have
contracted the greateſt diſhonour that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, while they are ſound in Doctrine,
and have Learned Paſtours, able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the Romiſh adverſaries; but alas, too
many unmeet Church-members. 3. They
have (and <hi>Scotland</hi> had till lately) the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates

them to ſubmit to Diſcipline, which is not

               <p>Object. <hi>But fiat Juſtitia &amp; ruat coelum:

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This doth but beg the Queſtion:
Gods Ordinances are not for deſtruction,
but edification; at leaſt as to the multitude
of the ungodly, they tend to their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:120705:109"/>
and not to their perdition. Is that
likely to be Gods Ordinance, which certain

work to advance them to the Pinacle of the
Temple, that he may caſt them down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.
And I yet never knew the man, nor

pleads for; and exerciſed Diſcipline,
faithfully on a whole Pariſh. Nor do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that any man can do it that would; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Magiſtrate do it for him. For he
cannot do it without the peoples conſent:
and if he ſentence ſuch to be avoided by the
people, they will deſpiſe his ſentence, and
hold communion with them the more, and
do as our Drunkards do, when one of their
Companions is put in the ſtocks, bring him
Ale and good cheare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eat, and drink,
and make merry with him, if the Magiſtrate

               <p>Object. <hi>But Excommunication muſt not be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:120705:109"/>
uſed, till all other remedies will do no good: and
when all will do no good, what good will it do
ſuch to be kept under other means?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To do good, for the bringing a
man out of that ſinne, for which he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed,
is one thing, and to do good,
for his Information and Converſion in the
maine, is another thing; It is the uſe of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
to cure men of the particular ſinnes
that they are reproved for, rather then to
convert them from a ſtate of wickedneſs in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
2. Nor is Excommunication to be
deferred, as long as there is any Hope by
other meanes; but only till we have uſed
other means in vaine, for ſuch a ſeaſon as is
meet; that the ends of Diſcipline be not fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.
For elſe there ſhould never man be
Excommunicated: For there is ſome Hope
that preaching againſt his ſinne may do him
good at laſt; though he come drunk to the
Lords Table twenty years together, you
cannot ſay that his Converſion is Impoſſible:
And yet we muſt not hereupon deferre the
caſting out of ſuch a member. But in his
<hi>Expectant</hi> ſtate, or among the <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi>
we may beare with him lawfully in his
wickedneſs, without excluding him from
among our hearers, and if he heare us ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years and ſeaven in vaine, there is yet
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:120705:110"/>
ſome Hope of his Converſion, while he
waiteth in his own place and way.</p>
               <p>And yet I yield this much to the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
freely, that when fit perſons are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into the Church, (yea or unfit, by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence)
we muſt wait with all patience that
is conſiſtent with the ends of Government,
and cutting off muſt be the laſt remedie: and
that when it is neceſſary, it muſt be uſed,
though we ſee that it's ten to one, it will
plunge the perſon (occaſionally) into a
worſe condition. For the Publike Ends of
Diſcipline, (the credit of Chriſtianity, the
preſervation of the Church, and abundance
more) are to be preferred before the good
of that mans Soul: and as <hi>paena debetur Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae,</hi>
and we cut not off malefactours for
their own good, ſo much as the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
which by their hurt muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted,
ſo is it as to the Church. But this
muſt be done but upon a few, for example:
and therefore but few that will need this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
are ſuppoſed to be in our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
And I cannot believe that way to be
of God, that would bring ſuch multitudes
into this miſerable ſtate.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Your very keeping them from
the Communion of the Church, and not
Approving or Confirming them, would
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:120705:110"/>
as much exasperate them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's no ſuch matter. Much it may,
but not neare ſo much, as I certainly know
by experience: Thoſe not Admitted heare
with Hope; but to the rejected I ſpeak as
almoſt hopeleſs, except ſuch as were fit to
live under Diſcipline, on whom it may have
its due effect.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And by this admitting all men without
tryal and Confirmation, to come unobſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
into the ſtate of Adult-Chriſtians, we
breed and feed continual heart burnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Miniſters of Chriſt; while we are
neceſſitated to do our work upon ſuch unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Souls. And how much the hatred and
contempt of Miniſters doth conduce to the
deſtruction of the people, Satan is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that is the diligent promoter of it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. By this means alſo we fruſtrate our
own ſtudies, and Miniſterial Labours, to
abundance of our people. Partly by delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them actually, in the Reception of them
among Chriſtians, that really are no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and partly by this provocation of
their hatred.</p>
               <p n="11">11. By this means alſo we breed and feed
abundance of Controverſies in the Church:
For when once we diſplace any parts of the
frame, we ſhall find almoſt all in pieces, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:120705:111"/>
one errour draweth on ſo many, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
grow numerous, and will never
be reconciled by meere words and writings,
till we actually ſet the Church in joynt
againe.</p>
               <p n="12">12. By this courſe alſo we lay open the
Ordinances of God, to a continual propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
while abundance that know not who
Chriſt is, nor what Chriſtianity is, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
as Chriſtians, to our Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
and ſo themſelves are involved in
more ſinne, and Gods own Worſhip tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into Provocation; ſo that we may feare
leſt God ſhould frown upon our Aſſemblies,
and withdraw the tokens of his Preſence, and
deny his bleſſing to thoſe prophaned Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
Though the innocent may ſtill have
their ſhare in the bleſſing, yet may the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
and the guilty majority, deeply ſuffer
by this great abuſe of holy things.</p>
               <p n="13">13. By this means alſo it is that ſo many
Scruples are caſt in our way, about Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations,
and reception of Ordinances;
and the comfort of Miniſters and people in
them, is much abated.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And I doubt it is a hinderance to the
Converſion of many ſects about us, and
of many ungodly ones among us, who
if they ſaw the primitive holineſs of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:120705:111"/>
Churches might be drawn in.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And it much corrupteth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, and turneth it to another
thing; when this Holy Communion is ſo
much of our duty and our comfort, and ſuch
a Repreſentation of Heaven it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And if it be not a practical denial of
ſome of the Articles of our Faith, it's well.
We ſay there, that we Believe the Catholike
Church to be Holy, and that it is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, that is by the parts of it,
to be exerciſed. And ſhall we deny this in
our works, which in words we profeſs.</p>
               <p n="17">17. By this means alſo we diſhonour the
work of Reformation, when we hinder the
fruits of it, that ſhould be viſible to the
world; and make men believe that it lieth
but in a change of bare opinions. They that
ſee no great difference between the Reformed
and the Romaniſts in their lives, will think
it is no great matter, which ſide they are
joyned to. It's noted by ſome Proteſtant
Writers, that when <hi>Luther</hi> oppoſed Popery
in <hi>Germany,</hi> abundance of the common li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
people, that were weary of Popiſh
Confeſſions, and Penances, did joyne with
thoſe that were truly conſcientious, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured
the Reformation by their lives,
though they increaſed the number, and did
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:120705:112"/>
the ſervice as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his Goſpeller, that
uſed to carry a bottle of wine, and <hi>Eraſmus</hi>
New Teſtament, with great braſs boſſes,
and when he diſputed with a Papiſt, knockt
him about the pate with the Bible, and ſo
confuted him.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And by this means we give the Papiſts
more roome then they ſhould have, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
our Churches, and glory compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
of the Holineſs of theirs. Though I
know that their glory is exceeding unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that our Impurities are no more to
theirs, then a few boiles to a Leproſie;
yet we do ill to give them ſo much occaſion,
as we do, who are ready to make the worſt
of all.</p>
               <p n="19">19. By this means alſo we leave all Sects,
to quarrel with us, and diſpute againſt us,
even whether we be true Churches of Chriſt
or not, becauſe our Adult-profeſſion and
Covenant is no more expreſs, and diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then it is. And though we have enough
to prove our ſelves a Church, yet do we
leave them under their temptations, and our
ſelves under the obloquy. And indeed we
perverſly maintain our own diſhonour, while
we think it a condition to be reſted in, if we
can but prove our ſelves true Churches;
when our Learned Divines do give as much to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:120705:112"/>
the Romaniſts themſelves, though not as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
yet as Chriſtian. A Leper is a true
man, and yet his cure is a thing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Laſtly, By this means alſo we tempt
many well meaning people among us, to a
dangerour ſeparation from us, and to fly
from our Churches, as if they would fall on
their heads; and we too much harden thoſe
that are already ſeparated: and all becauſe
we will not yield to the healing of our own
diſeaſes, or will do little or nothing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it. I know theſe men have no juſt
ground for their hard concluſions, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of us; but we have little reaſon to give

in the way of ſo many precious Souls.</p>
               <p>To what is here briefly thruſt together, if
the Reader will adde the twelve Reaſons, in
my Chriſtian Concord, <hi>pag.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14.
and what's ſaid in my book of Right to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
where theſe matters, or thoſe
that ſuſtaine them, are handled more at
large, I ſuppoſe he may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that the former Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
in <hi>England,</hi> have been lamentably neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
and our Churches by their means are
much diſordered, and that the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ſhould be more forward, and diligent,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:120705:113"/>
and unanimous for the cure, and that the
Magiſtrate, if he love the Church of
Chriſt, and the Souls of men, ſhould ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
afford his help, and all too little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
theſe great and many evils, which we
have let in, by ſuffering ſuch a looſe, unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
tranſition from the ſtate of Infant
Church members, or from Apoſtacy, into
the number of Adult-members, without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Profeſſion and Confirmation.</p>

that would follow the general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of this duty, of Trying, Approving,
and Confirming (or Abſolving) all thoſe
that enter into the number of Adult Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
that it ſhould mightily provoke all
Chriſtian Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and
People, to joyne in a ſpeedy and vigorous
execution of it.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ONe excellent fruit of this Practice,
will be the great increaſe of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and godlineſs, and the deſtruction
of ignorance, and notorious impiety. This
is an effect, moſt apparent in the Cauſes.
When men are made to underſtand, that by
the Law of God, ſeconded by the common
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:120705:113"/>
conſent of the Church, and the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Godly Paſtours, and (if it may be)
by the Law of the Land; no man is to be
accounted, or numbered with Adult-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
but thoſe that make a ſober, ſerious;
underſtanding Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the fleſh, the world, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and not contradicting, and nullifying
this Profeſſion, by a wicked life; this will
engage Parents, to teach their Children, and
Children themſelves to learn what Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is, when they cannot have the Name,
or the honour, and the Priviledges of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
without ſome Credible Appearance
of the thing. For doubtles while Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is in credit, the ſame motives that now
prevaile with the multitude to ſeeme Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and to deſire the Baptiſm of their
Children, will continue then, to make them
deſire to be numbred with Chriſtians, when
they are at age: and ſo will provoke them
to do that, without which they know they
connot be eſteemed Chriſtians. And as it's
now a common thing to be baptized in Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
ſo will it be then a common thing, for
our young people to learn the Principles of
Chriſtianity, yea and to reform their lives,
(I hope with the moſt) when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that elſe they muſt be taken to be no
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:120705:114"/>
Chriſtians. And if it were but the making of
the underſtanding Profeſſion, and outſide
of Chriſtianity, to be commoner among us,
it would be a moſt precious fruit of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
But much more, when true
Chriſtianity it ſelfe, in the life and power of
it, would alſo be more common. As no
doubt but it would: For the Knowledg of
the Letter, is the way to the receiving of the
Spirit: &amp; among multitudes that have the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of true Religion, there will be far more,
that have the life and ſoule of it, then among
thoſe that have not ſo much as the outſide.
Any man in reaſon may foreſee, that if we
be openly agreed, and it be publikely enacted,
or declared, that none be taken into the
number of Adult Chriſtians, nor admitted
to their Priviledges, till they have made an
Approved Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and
ſo be received by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, acting
by his Miniſters, it will ſet all that care for
the Name, or hopes or Privilidges of
Chriſtians, to learn, and be, and do, that
which they know will be ſo required of them.
Whereas, as things go now in moſt places,
they may bring their Children to Baptiſm,
without underſtanding what Baptiſm is; and
thoſe Children may ſlide into the ſtate of the
Adult-Chriſtians, and poſſeſs the Name, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:120705:114"/>
place, and outward Communion, and other
honours and Priviledges of ſuch, without
knowing whether Chriſt were a man or a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or who he is, or what buſineſs he came
about into the world: And when no outward
Neceſſity is laid upon them by the Church,
to know more, or to ſeem better, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if ſo many Heathens do ſit among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and if the multitude looke not much
after knowledg or Godlineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And moreover it will be a very great
helpe to their Conſciences, in order to the
convincing them of their ſinne and miſery,
and of the inſufficiency of that Condition
which multitudes do now reſt in; and ſo to
waken them to look after a ſafer ſtate, and
to be what they muſt <hi>ſeem to be,</hi> if they will
be taken to be Chriſtians. It is a great help
to the deceiving of the multitude of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
to be currantly eſteemed Chriſtians,
when they are not: And ſelf-love is ſuch a
blinding thing, that a little help will go farre
with it, in the promoting of ſuch deceits.
Naturally men are very eaſily brought to
think well of them ſelves, and hardly brought
to confeſs their miſery. Every man almoſt
will eaſily confeſs himſelf a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and a <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great ſinner,</hi> ſo you will but allow him to
be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and a <hi>pardoned ſinner.</hi> For
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:120705:115"/>
this is a common confeſſion, and brings no
very terrible Concluſion, and meſſage to the
Soul. But when a man muſt confeſs himſelf,
<hi>no true Chriſtian,</hi> but <hi>unſanctified, unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,</hi>
and a ſlave of Satan, this is as much
as to confeſs himſelf in a ſtate of damnation,
in which if he die he is loſt for ever,
and men are hardly drawn to believe ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Concluſion: when yet it is ſo neceſſary
where it is true, that we can ſcarce imagine
how a man can be ſaved without it. He that
knoweth not himſelfe to be out of his way,
will hardly be perſwaded to turne back: And
he that knows not himſelf to be unpardoned,
will hardly value or ſeek a pardon: And he
that thinks he is ſanctified, and a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
already, will ſeek to be made what he
takes himſelf already to be. And how much
Reputation doth, to help or hinder men,
even in ſelf-judging, is eaſily perceived.
Now here is a <hi>threefold Reputation,</hi> of very
great moment, to concurre, either for mens
Deception, or Converſion. 1. The Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Prince and Parliament, and ſo of
Law-givers and Rulers of the Nation, who
by their Laws do manifeſt, whom they
eſteem good Chriſtians, and this the people
very much look at. 2. The Reputation of
all the Paſtours of the Church, which is to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:120705:115"/>
be manifeſted in their Agreements, Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
or Declarations and Practices. 3. The
common conſent of Chriſtian people, which
is to be manifeſted by their actions, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws of Chriſt, and the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Guides. If Magiſtrates, Miniſters
and people do concurre, to repute all the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
and utterly Ignorant, wicked men
among us to be Chriſtians, how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Souls may this deceive, and undo for
ever? Whereas, If Magiſtrates, Miniſters,
and People that feare God, would all agree
accordng to the Laws of Chriſt, to eſteem
none Adult-Chriſtians, but thoſe that by a
<hi>Credible Profeſſion of Chriſtianity,</hi> do ſeem
to be ſuch, it would abundantly help to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them of their miſery, and the need of
Chriſt and Grace, and the abſolute neceſſity
of a change. We ſee even among good men,
in the caſe of a particular ſinne, how much
<hi>common Reputation,</hi> doth help to hinder the
work upon their Conſciences: Among the
Reformed Churches beyond the Sea, what
Conſcience is troubled for theſe actions, or
omiſſions on the Lords Day, which in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
would much trouble men of the ſame
temper in other things. Among ſeveral
Sects it troubleth them not, freely to revile
the Servants of Chriſt that are againſt them,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:120705:116"/>
becauſe they finde it rather go for commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then much condemnable, by thoſe whom
they moſt eſteem. Among the Papiſts, the
believing in a Vice-Chriſt, and the worſhiping
of his Image and Croſs, with Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and alſo the conſecrated Hoſt, and
the condemning all the Churches of Chriſt
that do it not, do goe for Virtues, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Practices, though they are moſt hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
odious ſinnes; and what is it but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reputation of Prince and Prieſts, and
multitudes of people, that could make ſo
many, yea and ſuch perſons as ſome of them
are, to continue in ſuch ſinnes, as if they
were a part, yea an eſſential part of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and one generation to ſucceed another
in them. Were theſe ſinnes but commonly
<hi>reputed</hi> to be as odious as indeed they are,
what a change would it make on millions of
Souls? So that it's ſtrange to ſee the power
of Reputation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover, this courſe would be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
help to the Labours of the Miniſters of
Chriſt, for mens Salvation. They would
better underſtand and apply our Sermons:
whereas now, they loſe the benefit by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying
them. Now we muſt labour all
our lives, (and with moſt, in vaine) to
make unbelievers, and ungodly perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:120705:116"/>
what they are, and no means will
ſerve to convince many people, that they
are not truly Chriſtians, that know not what
it is to be a Chriſtian, or that hate it and
fight againſt it. When they all go together
under the name of Chriſtians, what ever
comforts they hear offered to Believers, they
take them to themſelves, or miſtake them
as offered to them; and all the threatnings
that are uttered againſt unbelievers, they put
by and think it is not they that they are ſpoken
againſt. But if once we could but get men
to ſtand in their own places, and to know
themſelves; how eaſily then would our meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
work? Me thinks the Devil ſhould not
be able, to keep one man of an hundred in
his power, if they knew themſelves to
be in his power: nor one of an hundred, in a
ſtate of ungodlineſs and condemnation if they
knew that they are in ſuch a ſtate. At leaſt,
I am ſure men will not ſo numerouſly, nor
eaſily runne into Hell, when they know they
are going into it, as when they are confident
that they are good Chriſtians, and in the
way to Heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If this foredeſcribed Confirmation be
practiſed, it will more powerfully oblige
our people to Chriſt, then a ſecret ſliding
into the number of Adult-Chriſtians will do.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:120705:117"/>
And doubtleſs ſolemn engagements and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
have ſome force upon Conſcience,
to hold men to Chriſt, and reſtraine them
from ſinne: or elſe Baptiſm it ſelf would be
much fruſtrate; and the Jews ſhould not
have been ſo often called by <hi>Moſes, Joſhua,
Aſa,</hi> and other Princes, to renew their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God. But with us, men feel no
ſuch bonds upon them. And many queſtion
whether they are bound at all, by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
promiſes for them in Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The profiting of our people will be
much greater in their own place: when thoſe
that are not yet fit for Adult-memberſhip,
and Priviledges, are kept in the place of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens
or Expectants. Every thing doth
thrive and proſper beſt in its own place: If
you teare them not out of the Churches
wombe, till they are ready for the birth,
they will proſper there, that elſe may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.
Your Corne will beſt proſper in the
cold earth, where it ſeems to be dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
till the Springing time ſhall come.
And you ſhould not violently unhoſe the
eares, till Nature put them forth. The firſt
digeſtion muſt be wrought, before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and Nature muſt have time allowed it,
and the ſtomack muſt not too haſtily let go
the food, if you would have good ſanguifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:120705:117"/>
and nutrition follow. Men think they
do a great kindneſs to groſly ignorant, or
impious men, to take them into the Church
before they are capable of ſuch a ſtation, and
the work, or Priviledges thereto belonging:
but alas, they do but hurry them to perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by thruſting them out of the ſtate, where
they might have thriven in preparation to a
Church-ſtate, into a ſtate which will ſet them
abundance of work, which they are utterly
unfit for, and under the pretence of benefits
and Priviledges, will occaſion abundance of
aggravations of their ſinnes. A boy in his
A, B, C. will learne better in his own place,
among his fellows, then in a higher form,
where he hath work ſet him, which he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of doing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By this means alſo Church-Diſcipline
will attain its Ends; It will awe and preſerve
the Church, and terrifie, and reduce offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
and help them to Repentance, and
preſerve the order of the Church and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
when it is exerciſed upon ſuch as are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of it; that know the nature of it, and
either are habitually dipoſed to profit by it,
or at leaſt underſtand, what it was that they
were engaged to, and underſtandingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to live under ſuch a Diſcipline: and
when it is exerciſed upon few, and we have
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:120705:118"/>
not ſuch multitudes to ſweep out of the
Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. By this means, both Church-aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Ordinances may attaine their Ends;
and people will be capable of doing the duty
of Chriſtians to one another, when others
are capable of receiving it. Church members
are bound to <hi>exhort one another daily, while
it is called to day, leſt any be hardened by the
deceitfullneſs of ſinne,</hi> Heb. 3. 13. and to
<hi>teach and admoniſh one another,</hi> Col. 3. 16.
But before <hi>ſwine, we muſt not caſt ſuch pearls,
nor give that which is holy to dogs,</hi> Matth. 7.
6. Therefore it neceſſarily followeth, that
dogs and ſwine ſhould be <hi>kept out</hi> of the
Church, and <hi>caſt out</hi> if they be crept in.
Nothing hath more deſtroyed that <hi>Charitable
Community,</hi> which ſhould be among the
members of the Church, and that loving and
relieving Chriſt in Church-members, then
the crowding of ſuch into the place, as indeed
are Satans members, and appeare not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of that ſpecial Love, nor are capable of
returning it to others.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This will make eaſy the Miniſters work,
and free him from abundance of hatred,
trouble, and diſadvantage, when like a
workmans tooles in his ſhop, that all are in
their place, and ſo at hand when he ſhould
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:120705:118"/>
uſe them, ſo his Hearers are in order, and
each one lookes but for his portion, and
none are ſnatching at our fingers, for the
Childrens bread, that belongs not to them,
and men be not drawn to hate and raile at
Miniſters, for not fullfiling their deſires.</p>
               <p n="9">9. By this means alſo, the Ordinances will
be more purely adminiſtred, agreeably to
their Nature, and the Inſtitution: And ſo
God will bleſs them more to his Church, and
own his people, with the fuller diſcoveries
of his preſence, and take pleaſure in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
and ſervices of his Saints.</p>
               <p n="10">10. By this means alſo, the <hi>Communion
of the Saints,</hi> (and the holy Ordinances of
God) will be abundantly more <hi>ſweet</hi> to his
Servants, when we have it in the appointed
way, and it is not imbittered to us, by the
pollutions of Infidels, and notorious ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men. Though yet I know, that in a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
polluted Church, Gods Servants may
have their ſhare of comfort, in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
when they have done their own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for Reformation, without ſucceſs.</p>
               <p n="11">11. By this means the Church, and the
Chriſtian Religion will be more honorable in
the eyes of the world, who judge by the
members and profeſſours lives, before they
can judge of the thing as in it ſelf: And as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:120705:119"/>
Chriſt will be thus honoured, and the mouths
of adverſaries of all ſorts ſtopped, ſo it will
do much to further their Converſion, when
they have ſuch a help to ſee the beauty of the
Church and Chriſtian Faith. Many more
ſuch benefits I would name, but that you
may gather ſome of them, from what was
ſaid of the contrary incommodities: Only I
adde</p>
               <p n="13">13. Laſtly, it is a way that is admirably
ſuited both to Reformation, and Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation;
to Unity, as well as Purity: which
removeth many of the Impediments, that
elſe would trouble us in the way. For as all
wicked men will agree againſt it, as they will
againſt any holy practice, ſo all parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
among us, do in their doctrine and
profeſſions owne it; and it will ſuit the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
or the Ends of all that fear God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly of very farre. I ſhall here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
ſhew you, 1. That the Epiſcopal:
2. Presbyterians: 3. Independants: 4. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abaptiſts:
5. Yea and I may put in, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts

               <p n="1">1. That it is ſo far agreeable with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

pag. 289, 290, 291.</hi> Where he reciteth the
words of our Canon, that <hi>ſeing it was a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn,
ancient, laudable cuſtom in the Church
of God, obſerved even from the daies of the
Apoſtles, that all Biſhops laying hands on
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:120705:121"/>
thoſe that were Baptized in Infancy, and are
inſtructed in the Catechiſm of the Chriſtian
Religion, ſhould Pray over them, and bleſs

very Catholike, if uttered in good ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—</hi>And
citing the <hi>Rubricke</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
he mentioneth the Conference at<hi>Hampton Court, pag. 10, 11, 32, 33. That
the Doctrine of Confirmation was part of the

Churches, but in Calvins Judgment to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

this the Formaliſtes (</hi>as he conſtantly calls

the Catholikes themſelves, as to the ſound of

any thing more honourable of Confirmation.</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:120705:122"/>
And that you may ſee how farre he accepts
alſo of <hi>Calvins</hi> conceſſion, he doth with
oſtentation cite the words of <hi>Calvin, in Act.
2. and Inſtit.</hi> lib. 4. cap. <hi>19. §. 28.</hi> that <hi>It's
incredible that the Apoſtles ſhould uſe Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of hands, but by Chrſts Command: and
that it was not an empty ſigne, and that it is
to be accounted for a Sacrament.</hi> So that
theſe two parties cannot be againſt us, in the
matter of Confirmation, though I know
that the Papiſts are againſt us, for laying by
their ceremonies and abuſe of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as for the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be againſt it: For 1. The moſt eminent
Divines of that Judgment, have written for
it, of whom I could cite abundance: But
<hi>Calvin, Hyperius,</hi> and others, cited by
Mr. <hi>Hanmer</hi> already, ſufficiently declare their
deſires, after the reſtoring of Confirmation:
And <hi>Chemnitius</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> is large for it,
and others of that way. 2. And it is ſo
clearly uſefull and neceſſary to the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of diſtempers in the Church, and the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
of the Miniſtry, and the ſafe and ſuccesfull
exerciſe of Diſcipline, that I know they will
heartily conſent to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And for the Congregational party,
1. Some of them have declared their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for it, in the approving or promoting
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:120705:122"/>
Mr <hi>Hanmer</hi>'s Book. 2. And I have ſpoke
with ſome of the moſt eminent of that mind,
that are for it. 3. And the ſolemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
or Profeſſion, which they require of
all that enter among them, as Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
doth ſhew that they are for it in the
ſubſtance, though how far they like, or
diſlike the ſigne of Impoſition of hands I
know not. It is the want of this, that they
are ſo much offended with in our Pariſh-Church,
and therefore doubtleſs they will
conſent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And For <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect their full conſent, becauſe they
admit not Infants into the Viſible Church,
and therefore Baptiſe thoſe whom we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
or Reſtore, yet doubtleſs they will
like this as <hi>next</hi> to that which they ſuppoſe to
be the right: and becauſe we come as neare
to them as is fit and lawfull for us to do, it is
the likelieſt way to abate their cenſures, and
procure with them ſo
much Peace,<note place="margin">Some few alſo there are, that are <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paedobaptiſts</hi> (againſt baptizing Infants) and yet not <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> (as not judging it a Nullity, nor to be iterated) And theſe, one would think we might live at Peace with.</note> as in reaſon
may be expected, with
men that differ from us in
the point of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
Three ſorts of them,
I ſuppoſe we may meet
with: 1. Some that grant
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:120705:123"/>
that Infants are Chriſts
Diſciples, Chriſtian, and
Viſſible Church-members,
but yet think that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is not for their admiſſion, but only for
the Adult. I confeſs I know of none ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
nor am I ſure there are any ſuch, but
by hearſay, or conjecture: But if there be,
our differences with theſe men would be moſt
in the External ſigne. If they do but as
much by Infants, as the expreſs words of the
Goſpel do commend, and Chriſt chid his
Diſciples for oppoſing, that is, if they
yield that they ſhall be offered unto Chriſt,
and that the Miniſter of Chriſt do in his
Name, <hi>Receive them, lay his hands on them,
and bleſs them, becauſe of ſuch is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God;</hi> and then baptize them, when at
age they make a perſonal Profeſſion; and if
we on the other ſide offer them to Chriſt, and
the Miniſter in his Name accept them by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and at age confirm them, upon their
perſonal Covenanting or Profeſſion, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
here would be moſt, that they change
the outward ſigne, and <hi>they</hi> uſe <hi>Impoſition of
hands</hi> when <hi>we</hi> uſe <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> uſe <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>
when <hi>they</hi> uſe <hi>Impſition.</hi> And with ſuch
it were eaſy for moderate men to hold bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Love and Peace. 2. Some we ſhall
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:120705:123"/>
meet with, that deny Infants to be Viſible
Church-members, and yet think the Infants
of Believers, to have ſome promiſes more
then the reſt of the world, or at leaſt that
they are <hi>Candidati Chriſtianiſmi, Expectants
of a Church-ſtate,</hi> and are as ſoone as they
underſtand any thing, to be bred up as <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens</hi>
in the Church ſeminaries, and to
be Baptizd, as ſoone as they are actual Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
And as far as I underſtand them, ſome
of them will conſent that they be offered and
dedicated to God in Infancy, and ſolemnly
received, by Miniſterial Impoſition of hands,
into the ſtate of Expectants. If theſe men be
of peaceable, moderate Spirits, and agree with
us in other matters of Religion (in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
at leaſt) they muſt needs acknowledg,
that in the foredeſcribed practice of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
we come ſo neere them, that they
cannot deny us brotherly Love and Peace.
For I hope they will not think, that they
may lawfully deny theſe (yea or their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion)
to all that be not punctually of
their opinion, againſt the Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Baptiſm of Infants. 3 And as for
all the reſt of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that hold alſo
the doctrine of Pelagianiſm, or Socinianiſm,
or Libertiniſm, or Familiſm, or Quakers,
or Heatheniſm, they are not in a capacity
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:120705:124"/>
for us, to treat with about Accomodation,
or Chriſtian Peace.</p>
               <p>But yet, as to all the intemperate, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
unpeaceable <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that will
but reproach us for our drawing ſo neer
them, at leaſt we ſhall have this advantage
againſt their reaſonings, that we ſhall be
far better able to manifeſt the variety of
them, then otherwiſe we could do. For
whereas their common Argument againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
Baptiſm is, that it defileth the Church,
by letting in all the Children in the Nation,
which muſt be caſt out againe, or the moſt
will be openly vile; and that it defraudeth
the Adult of the benefits of ſolemn Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Chriſt; all this will be taken off by
Confirmation, and will lie no more on us,
then on themſelves, ſeeing by this means,
we can as faithfully hold the Church door
againſt the Adult, that are unfit to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the number, as they can.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall intreat the moderate, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſons among us, that are of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
Presbyterian, Congregational, or Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Judgment, yea and the firſt and ſecond
ſort of Anabaptiſts, to conſider how neerly
we are all Agreed, or how neer to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
when we are not aware of it, or
live at ſuch a diſtance, as if we were not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:120705:124"/>
aware of it: And whether it be not our duty
to cloſe upon this Practice, at leaſt much
nearer then we are? It is a ſad and fearfull
caſe, when men Profeſſing Godlineſs, and
all pretending to a Love of Unity, Peace and
Holineſs, ſhall hate or oppoſe each other,
and ſeparate from each other, upon a pretence
that we differ in things that we are agreed in;
and when ſuch ſhall perſwade the common
Enemies, and the ignorant people, that we
differ where we do not: as if the Enemy had
not already matter enough of reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, nor the ignorant matter enough
of temptation and offence, but we muſt falſly
give them more, by ſeeming to differ when
there is no ſuch thing. And if this becauſed,
by any mens hating their own Principles,
when they ſee them in anothers hand, or yet
by hating the <hi>Practice</hi> of their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
I leave it to the conſideration of ſober
men, whether ſuch are liker to the Miniſters
of Chriſt, or Satan.</p>
               <p>Give me leave here a little, by way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
to review what I ſaid concerning
our Accord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How much many Brethren of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Judgment, do cenſure other mens at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
for Reforming their Congregations,
is too open to be hid. But how little cauſe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:120705:125"/>
they have to be offended with any <hi>Moderate</hi>
attempts, let their own forecited Principles
be judge. I know that it is the <hi>Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>Government</hi> of the Churches, that
ſeems by the noiſe of Oppoſition among
us, to be the greateſt point of differences:
But as far as I can deſcern, it is not ſo. The
<hi>Conſtitution</hi> of our Curches is the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
It's a ſhame to ſpeake it: we differ
moſt where we are Agreed. I have ſo much
experience of the minds of Godly Miniſters,
and private men in <hi>England,</hi> that I dare
boldly ſay, would we but all Agree in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
in the <hi>conſtituting</hi> our Churches of due
<hi>Materials,</hi> where for ought I know, we
are almoſt all Agreed in Principles, there
were no Probability, that all the reſt of our
diſagreements, would keep us at a quarter
of the diſtance as we are. Truly the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
honeſt, godly people, ſtick not much
on the difference in formalities, and extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
modes of Government: If they heare a
Miniſter pray heartily, preach ſoundly, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly
and powerfully, live holily and
righteouſly, and charitably, and beate
down ſinne, and ſet himſelf to promote true
Piety, they are (commonly where I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted)
if not indifferent what form of
Government he is for, yet at leaſt, can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:120705:125"/>
beare with him, though he differ from
them. Let us have the Work of God well
done, and we ſhall care the leſs who it is that
doth it. The greateſt offence, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
is taken againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> is, 1. The
former viciouſneſs, negligence and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that men of that way were guilty of;
and 2. Becauſe men know that a <hi>Dioceſan
Biſhop</hi> hath ſo much work upon his hands,
that he will certainly leave the far greateſt
part undone. So that the Queſtion is not ſo
much <hi>who ſhall do the work,</hi> as <hi>whether it ſhall
be done or not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now if <hi>this Principle</hi> were Practiſed, in
which we are Agreed, about <hi>Confirmation,</hi>
or at leaſt, <hi>a Publicke Profeſſion,</hi> that ſo
our Churches might be conſtituted of fit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
and not be peſtered with ſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
or perſons ſo Ignorant as that they
know not Chriſt; or perſons ſo notoriouſly
vicious, as that they are openly bruitiſh and
prophane, and make a very ſcorne of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
and Godlineſs, this would do much to
heale all the reſt of our Diviſions. The
Country knows, that the reaſon why the
multitude of Ignorant, ungodly people are
for Epiſcopacy, is principally becauſe they
think that Government will do as it did, and
rather curbe the Preciſians (as they call
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:120705:126"/>
them) then them, and will not trouble them
with a <hi>Differencing</hi> diſcipline or adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nor urge them ſo hard to labour for
Knowledg, and live a Godly life. Take
away this conceit from them, by the faithfull
practice of your own Principles, and they
will hate you as much as others. What
great ſatisfaction would you give to all that
fear God among us, if you would Practiſe
but that which the Rubricke of the Common-Prayer
Book requireth of you, in this one
point? For it requireth not only a <hi>Learning
of the Catechiſm</hi> but alſo <hi>a publike owning
of their Baptiſmal Covenant in the face of the
Congregation, and a ſolemn Promiſe to live
a holy, obedient life: and this at full age;</hi> and
after this they muſt be <hi>Confirmed, before they
be admitted to the Sacrament of the Euchariſt.</hi>
That it may appeare how fully we are Agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this point, I ſhall tranſcribe ſome more
of the <hi>Rubricke of Confirmation,</hi> which is as
followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Reaſons</hi> given, why none ſhall be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
till they can anſwer ſuch queſtions
of the Catechiſm, as they ſhall be appoſed
in, are theſe, <hi>1. Becauſe that when Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
come to the years of diſcretion, and have
learned what their Godfathers and Godmothers
promiſed for them in Baptiſm, they may then
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:120705:126"/>
themſelves with their own mouth, and with
their own conſent, openly before the Curch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
and confirme the ſame; and alſo promiſe,
that by the Grace of God they will evermore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
themſelves, faithfully to obſerve and
keep ſuch things as they by their own mouth and
confeſſion have aſſented unto. 2. Foraſmuch
as Confirmation is miniſtred to them that be
baptiſed, that by impoſition of hands and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
they may receive ſtrength and defence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all temptations to ſinne, and the aſſaults
of the world and the Devil, it is moſt meet to
be admitted, when Children come to that age,
that partly by the frailty of their own fleſh,
partly by the aſſaults of the world and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
they begin to be in danger, to fall into
ſundry kinds of ſinne. 3. For that it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with the uſage of the Church in times paſt:
whereby it was ordained, that Confirmation
ſhould be miniſtred to them that were of perfect
age, that they being inſtructed in Chriſts Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
ſhould openly Profeſs their own Faith,
and promiſe to be obedient to the Will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, with what was before cited ſhews,
that in this main Point we are agreed with the
Brethren of the Epiſcopal Judgment, and
therefore may expect their concurrence: and
to that end, we deſire them to promote the
Practice of their own Principles: and let us
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:120705:127"/>
not leave the Work of God undone, while
we ſtrive who ſhall do it or rather who ſhall
not do it. If the <hi>Canons</hi> allow the <hi>Biſhops
ſuffragane</hi> to do it, you may beare with
others of the ſame order to do it, rather then
leave it undone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> I intreat
them to Conſider, 1. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w much the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
practiſe of this duty, will put by all the
offence and miſtaking-reaſons of the Eraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who ask them ſo earneſtly, <hi>how they
can prove that people muſt be examined by the
Miniſter, in order to the Lords Supper, any
more then in order to a day of thanksgiving?</hi>
I know it is an eaſy matter, to prove that a
Paſtour may call his People to private, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Inſtruction, at any fit ſeaſon; and
therefore before a Sacrament when he ſees
juſt cauſe: and they are bound to obey him,
ordinarily, by virtue of the general precept,
<hi>Heb. 13. 17. Obey them that Rule over
you,</hi> &amp;c. But if you make this the ſeaſon
and uſe of your Examination, to admit men
out of a ſtate either of Catechumens, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-members,
into the number of Adult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members,
and never trouble them afterward
with Examinations, unleſs upon ſome ſpecial
occaſion, or in your ordinary courſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Inſtruction, this would put by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:120705:127"/>
of gainlayers; and I think, ſatisfie
all of them that have any ſober conſiderations
and love to the proſperity of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And conſider alſo how much this way
would facilitate your courſe of Diſcipline:
you would be much more clearly ſatisfied,
who are your Church-members, and of your
ſpecial charge, and on whom you are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
bound to exerciſe Diſcipline, and to
whom you owe your ſpecial care and labour:
and your people will be better ſatisfied then
now they are, both of the quality, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
reception of members, and who they
be, to whom they owe the ſpecial Duty of
members, and whom they are more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
bound to communicate their worldly
goods in their neceſſity. How much uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
confuſion, diſſatisfiedneſs and
neglect of duty, remaineth in thoſe
Congregations, where this work is quite
ommitted, is obvious to common obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And if any ſhould have a jealouſie of
this deſigne, as ſeeming to ſet up the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
way of Covenanting, I intreat
ſuch to remember; 1. What an enemy to the
Unity of the Church, and how unbeſeeming
a charitable Chriſtian, a ſpirit of cauſeleſs
jealouſie is. 2. That it ſhould be the more
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:120705:128"/>
gratefull to you, becauſe it is acceptable to
your Brethren: If you are Lovers of Unity
and Peace, you will be far from avoiding a
Practice, becauſe thoſe hold it with whom
you would be united, that is, becauſe it
tends to Unity; but rather you will be glad
of ſuch a healing means. 3. Conſider that
it is no more the Congregational mens Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
then the Epiſcopal, Presbyterians and
the Eraſtians. It is our common Principle,
let us therefore make it our common Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
an eaſy, a reaſonable way of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The not Practiſing of this hath caſt
us into confuſions; and the Practiſe of it
muſt be it, that muſt reſtore our Church
Order, and heale moſt of our Diviſions. I
know it is agreeable to your Judgments. I
move you not to forſake your Principles,
but to Practice them. Do but enrol thoſe
only for your Adult Church-members, that
are Confirmed, or Approve, upon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
credible Profeſſion, of true Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and conſent to live under your Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Diſcipline; and it will do more, then
you can eaſily now apprehend, for an Union
with your Brethren, and for the cloſing of
the ſad, and long-continued diviſions of the
Churches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And to the Congregational Brethren, I
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:120705:128"/>
may boldly ſay, it is a Practice ſo ſuitable
to your own Practice already, (though I
think it is a more Regular performance of it
that I propound, then moſt have uſed) that
in reaſon we may expect your approbation
and concurrence. Perhaps you'l feare that
ſome of your Brethren may ſlubber over the
work, and make but a Ceremony of it: But
ſo may ſome of your Own mind, if they be
perſonally remiſs and negligent, as well as
others. And perhaps others will feare leſt
<hi>you</hi> ſhonld uſe it <hi>over rigorouſly,</hi> and make it
a pretence for excluding many that are not to
be excluded. But this will be according to
the Prudence, and Charity of particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours;
and is nothing to thoſe Principles, in
which we are all agreed. Only I beſeech you
in the feare of God, take heed of giving juſt
occaſion of this offence. Be not Righteous
overmuch: Remember how tender Chriſt is
of his litle ones: and how he is diſpleaſed
with thoſe that keep them from him: and
will not break the bruiſed Reed: If he carry
the Lambs in his armes, and gently drive
thoſe that are with-young, it beſeemes not <hi>us</hi>
to turn them out of the fold, or to diſowne
them. We are commanded to <hi>Receive him
that is weak in the Faith, though not to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
disputations,</hi> Rom. 15. 1. It's a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:120705:129"/>
of impiety, injuſtice and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs,
to thruſt back thoſe that Chriſt
would have admitted. It's <hi>Impiety,</hi> to rob
Chriſt of his Church-members, and diminiſh
his Viſible Flock, and wrong thoſe whom
he values as his Jewels, and is tender of, as
the apple of his eye. It is great <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> to
defraud men of their <hi>Due,</hi> in ſo great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as his Church-priviledges and helps to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
It's greater Injuſtice, then to turn
them out of their houſes and lands; for the
Benefits are greater. It's <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs,</hi>
to deale ſo cruelly with us, in matters of ſuch
Conſequence. And it's the greater, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is none of our own, but our Maſters
treaſure which we deny them. 2. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are Conſcious, if we are Chriſtians
indeed, of ſo much ſinne and unworthyneſs
our ſelves, as ſhould provoke us to deale the
more tenderly and compaſſionately with
others. I would not have you blind under
pretence of Charity, nor to let in known
ſwine, for feare of keeping out the ſheep.
But remember that when the caſe is but ſo
doubtfull and difficult, that you cannot know
certainly the tares from the wheat, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make a ſeparation without a danger of
pulling up the wheate with the tares, it's
better let both alone till harveſt. We will
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:120705:129"/>
not be wilfully guilty of mens Lying, or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical
Profeſſions: but if they be guilty
of them, we may yet believe, that God
hath much ſervice for Hypocrites in his
Church. And the number ſhall be ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to him; and ſome encouragement to
ſome that are yet without, to draw neerer us.
Though it be the Intention of Chriſt in Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
his Ordinances, and the Intention of
the Church, that men be truly Penitent
believers before they are Baptized (at age)
or admitted into the number of Adult
Church-members, and to the Lords Table;
and ſo never made the Euchariſt an Ordinance
which is Primarily and Directly intended for
Converſion of the unregenerate, and which
known ungodly men may ſeeke, and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to, in order to their Converſion:
(<hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf confeſſing that ſuch come
into the Church <hi>praeter intentionem Eccleſiae</hi>)
Yet Chriſt that knew abundance of unſound
Profeſſours would thruſt themſelves into the
Church, hath provided thoſe Ordinances
there, which conduce much to their regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
And even the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> though
inſtituted <hi>primarily</hi> for another uſe, may
be a means of this, to thoſe that yet unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
drew neer it. However, if we be
commanded to invite, yea and compel men
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:120705:130"/>
to come in to the Church, that the houſe of
Chriſt may be filled, we muſt not be too
ſcrupulous in admitting them, nor to buſy
in keeping them back. If any where, it's
here that Chriſt is like to ſay, <hi>Odi ſervum ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
diligentem.</hi> If men make a <hi>Credible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
I dare not refuſe them: Nor dare I
by my uncharitable Incredulity, take that
for Incredible, which I cannot Prove to be
ſo. His <hi>Profeſſion</hi> is the Evidence of his Title
with the Church. If I will deny him when
he ſeeks admittance, I muſt diſprove that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and ſhew it to be invalid. Truly
much experience hath taught me, that many
that were never commonly noted for
Godlineſs, and that through baſhfulneſs, or
want of expreſſions, or the hinderance of
carnal friends, and worldly affaires, have
lived as ſtrangers to thoſe that are eminent for
the feare of Cod, have yet at laſt, diſcloſed
themſelves to me, to have been humble, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Chriſtians many years, as far as I was
able to judge. Eſpecially take heed how you
ſlight or reject people for want of parts, or
gifts, or utterance. I have known excellent
Chriſtians, that through baſhfulneſs are not
able to give an account of their knowledg of
the very fundamentals of Religion, to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
whom they much Reverence, and are in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:120705:130"/>
awe of. And I meet with many ignorant
people, that in anſwer to many of my Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
do ſeem to be ignorant of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who yet ſhew the contrary, when by
other words, I have cauſed them better to
underſtand me. If people be but deſirous,
and willing and diligent, it muſt be very
groſs Ignorance indeed, that muſt warrant
us to refuſe them. Many thouſands are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of wrong intruding into the Church, when
the Miniſters and Church were not guilty of
wrong admitting them, but had been cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
if they had refuſed them.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak all this to the Congregational Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
rather then the reſt, becauſe they are
moſt ſuſpected to be overſtrict in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions;
and becauſe I would intreate them,
to avoid all juſt occaſions of offence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
in their Practiſe, when we are all ſo
happily agreed in our Principles, in this great
point, of the Neceſſity of an Approved Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And for the <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> as in the point
of Diſcipline, they commonly contend with
us upon a meer miſtake, thinking we claime
a proper <hi>Imperium,</hi> or <hi>Magiſterial Power,</hi>
when as we claime but the <hi>Power of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,</hi>
with ſuch a kind of Power, as a
<hi>Phyſician</hi> hath over his <hi>Patients,</hi> or as <hi>Plato</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:120705:131"/>
or <hi>Zeno</hi> had in their Schooles, (beſides the
Miniſterial Power in Worſhiping) ſo their
Principal quarrel with us, will be removed
by the Practice of Confirmation. You talk
much of the Sacraments being converting
Ordinances, and againſt examining men in
order to the Lords Supper, and keeping men
away. But are you not Agreed with us, that
<hi>a perſonal underſtanding, ſerious Profeſſion of
Chriſtianity,</hi> even of Faith, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
(which conteineth a Renouncing the
fleſh, the world, and the Devil) is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to thoſe that will (either by Baptiſm or
Confirmation) be admitted into the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Adult-members of the Church? And
do you not grant that the Adult, whether
before Baptiſm or Confirmation, are to be
tried and approved by the Paſtours, before
they Baptize them, or Confirm them?
Grant us but this (and that the ancient Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
ſhould be exerciſed in the Church,
which the Scriptures and all the Church
Canons do record) and wee ſhall be
agreed with you in a moment. For Baptiſm
we are no ſtricter then the Common-Prayer
Book, that required that the party (by him
ſelf or others) did <hi>Promiſe and vow 1. To
forſake the Devil and all his works, the Pomps
and vanities of the wicked world, and all the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:120705:131"/>
ſinfull luſts of the fleſh. 2. To believe all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Chriſtian Faith. 3. To keep Gods
holy will and Commandements, and walk in
the ſame all the daies of his life.</hi> That ſo, it
may be truly ſaid of the Baptized, that <hi>he is
made a member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and
an inheritour, (or heir) of the Kingdom of
Heaven:</hi> and of the <hi>Confirmed,</hi> we expect
but that which is here ſaid to be given and
aſſured in Baptiſm, <hi>viz. A Death unto ſinne,
and a New birth unto Righteouſneſs; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Nature born in ſinne, and the children
of wrath, we are hereby made the Children of
Grace:</hi> yea we expect but <hi>what is required of
perſons to be baptized;</hi> viz. <hi>Repentance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they forſake ſinne; and Faith, whereby they
ſtedfaſtly believe the Promiſes of God made to
them in that Sacrament.</hi> All theſe are the
words of the Catechiſm in the Common-Prayer
Book. Yea we expect but that open
Profeſſion before the Congregation, which
the forecited <hi>Rubricke</hi> of Confirmation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth:
no nor alway ſo much as that. So
that I may well ſuppoſe, that no Godly,
moderate man of the <hi>Eraſtian</hi> way, can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from us in this point of <hi>Confirmation:</hi>
And a Conſent in this, will be next to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in all, between us and them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And for the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> themſelves,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:120705:132"/>
though we evpect not their <hi>Conſent,</hi> yet we
may well expect their <hi>Moderation,</hi> and <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppoſition,</hi>
and that as we thus draw as neer
them, as poſſibly (in our preſent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
we can, ſo they would lay by all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
and reproach, and diviſive carriage,
and come as neer us as they can. And as now
with the more moderate of them, our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
appeareth leſs then many of them ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
ſo it may appear, that the diſtance
in affection and Communion ſhall be no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then there is cauſe. The <hi>odium</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,
and unpeaceableneſs, hath ſo long
laine upon their party, that methinks they
ſhould be willing to have it taken off. And
there is no way to take it off, but their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
amendment: by becoming Lovers and
Promoters of Union, Communion, and
Peace among the Churches of Chriſt. Men
will never take your opinion to be of God,
while general experience ſhall ſhew them,
that it will not ſtand with that Love, Union,
and Communion of the Saints, but engageth
almoſt all that receive it, in Diviſions, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and Reproach, of the Servants of
Chriſt and his Churches. Though you think
your own Opinion right, let it not ſo farre
diſpoſſeſs you of Charity, and Reaſon, as to
unchurch all the Churches of Chriſt, that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:120705:132"/>
thinke otherwiſe, or to caſt off Communion
with the Godly, that are not of your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
as long as we come ſo near you, as to
take none into the Number of Adult Church-members,
but thoſe that are Confirmed, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by Chriſts Miniſters, upon their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
credible Profeſſion of Faith and Holineſs.</p>
               <p>Lay all this together, and we may well
conclude, that this Practice of Miniſterial
Approbation, and Confirmation, (or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration)
of all that are admitted into the
Number of Adult-Chriſtians, or viſible
Church-members, and to their Priviledges,
is ſo neceſſary, and ſo admirably fitted, both
for Reformation, and Reconciliation, of the
Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, Independants, Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
and moderate Anabaptiſts, and to ſtop
the mouths of the Intemperate, and of the
Papiſts, that all Magiſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, Miniſters and
People, that love the Churches Purity and
Peace, and long to ſee it clenſed and healed,
ſhould gladly embrace it, and vigorouſly
promote it it.</p>
               <p>I Have two things yet more to do upon this
Subject. 1. To anſwer ſome Objections,
and 2 To give ſome Directions to all ſorts,
for the effectual putting it in execution. The
Objections are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:120705:133"/>
Object. 1.  <hi>You will tempt the Anabaptiſts
to ſay, that this is but a ſhift of our own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
inſtead of Baptiſm, leſt we ſhould yield
to them, when we are convinced of the Nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of a perſonal Covenanting by the Adult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no Ordinance or Truth of
God, that will not be ſpoken againſt by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking
men: and yet we muſt not therefore
caſt them away. Nor is it the way to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
a Truth or Ordinance from reproach,
to diſclame it, and ſo to reproach it actually
our ſelves. Nor is it the way to get advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of an adverſary, to fly fom him too far
into the contrary extreame, but rather to
come as neare him as the truth will give us
leave. And to the Anabaptiſts Objection,
we ſhall give them our reaſons againſt their
way, in a fitter place, and have already
done it. We are moſt certain that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God of old (both with Circumſion
and without it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.) did enter their
children into Covenant with God, as well
as themſelves. And if it be the expreſs Word
of God, that both Infants and Aged ſhould
be entered and engaged to him in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
we will obey his Word, and do both,
though the Anabaptiſts will do but the one.
He muſt have a hard face, that will deny that
it was once the duty of Parents, to offer their
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:120705:133"/>
children to God, and enter them into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with him: and when they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that this Duty or Power is recalled,
(which I never yet ſaw done, no not in
Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his laſt Voluminous Review) then
we will forbeare it; but till then it is not mens
talk and confident words, that muſt make a
tender Conſcience yield, to omit ſo great
and plain a duty, or give up ſo great a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
as this is. I am ſure that Infants were then
no more able to believe themſelves, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelves in Covenant with God then
now: and I am ſure the Parents by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
did it for them, offering and
engageing them to God, and that God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
is called their God, and they his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
and that uſually the ſigne of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was annexed. And I am ſure that Parents
have as much Natural Intereſt in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
now as then: And I never yet ſaw where
God had acquit us of this duty, or withdrawn
this Mercy from us, and our ſeed.</p>
               <p>Object. 2.  <hi>The proof which you bring for this
Confirmation is ſo obſcure, that it is not like
to be generally received.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was generally received in almoſt
all the Churches on earth, till lately: And
as far as I plead for it, it is yet Doctrinally
at leaſt owned and maintained, even by thoſe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:120705:134"/>
Churches that practically have diſuſed it Of
all the Chriſtians on Earth, I ſuppoſe there
is a thouſand if not ten thouſand for it, (do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally
or dogmatically) for one that is
againſt it, if we judge by the Laws, Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and writings of their guides. Though
the <hi>Greeks</hi> I know do not own the Popiſh
Confirmation, nor have it not ſo formally
as they ſhould, and the Papiſts have corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it by their abuſe; yet the thing in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is owned dogmatically by almoſt all
the Chriſtian world: And they muſt be very
ſingular perſons that diſowne it. 2. And
I think the proofe that hath been given you is
clearer, then you have for the Morality of
the Lords day, for conſtant family Prayer,
for Infant Baptiſm, and many a holy Duty,
which yet we have ſufficient proof for. What
would you have plainer? Is there the leaſt
doubt of it, whether a Preſonal Profeſſion and
Covenanting with God, be neceſſary to him
that will be taken into the Number of Adult
Chriſtians, and poſſeſs their Priviledges and
Communion? Or whether this Profeſſion
muſt be approved by the Paſtour, of the
Church, and known to them that muſt hold
Communion with him? Prove if you can, that
ever one man was admitted among Adult-Chriſtians,
to enjoy Communion with them,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:120705:134"/>
without ſuch a perſonal Profeſſion. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prove it. If Infant-Covenanting were
enough for the Adult, then Infidels are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>But this will make Miniſters
to be Lords of the Church: when no man can be
taken into the Church, or poſſeſs the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of a Chriſtian, till he be Approved by
them This will put a Tyrannical Power into
their hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Such a Tyranical Power as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Phyſician hath, who may chooſe or refuſe
his patients; or every School-maſter hath
that may chooſe or refuſe his Schollars, if
he engage not himſelf to the contrary, as
<hi>Plato, Zeno,</hi> and every Philoſopher did in
his Schoole.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſuch a Tyranny as Chriſt hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
ſet up; and to accuſe him of
ſetting up Tyranny, is an unkind part of
them that look to be ſaved by him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a Power that hath Conſtantly been
exerciſed by the Officers of Chriſt, and did
not men ſmel out the Tyranny of it till now?
What Prince did govern the Church doores,
and judge who ſhould be admitted, from the
daies of Chriſt, till <hi>Conſtantines</hi> daies, when
the Church was at the pureſt; yea or ever
after for many a hundred yeares? Did not
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:120705:135"/>
all the Apoſtles, and every Preacher of the
Goſpel Baptize thoſe that they convetred,
and judge of them whether they were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizable?
And did not the Biſhops Confirm
the Baptized, without conſulting another
Power? Half that were admitted into the
Church by Baptiſm, (and more) for ſome
hundred yeares after Chriſt, were the Adult:
and of theſe, the Paſtour required a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Covenant and Profeſſion. The other
half were their Infants: and for them they
required the Parents Profeſſion, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them into Covenant: But ſtill the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
were the Judges, who were the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you think it too much <hi>Power</hi> for us,
I beſeech you think it too much <hi>work</hi> for us:
and dreame not that we have a <hi>work,</hi> and not
<hi>Power</hi> to do it, or diſcern what we do. Set
others to do it, that you can better truſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Who would you have truſted with this
Power? Some body muſt have it. I have
proved to you fully, that every man muſt
not be the ſole Judge of his own fitneſs for
Baptiſm or Church Priviledges: and that the
people or Magiſtrates are not the ſole or chief
Judges: and who ſhould it be but they, to
whom it is committed by Chriſt in their call
to the office of the Miniſtry?</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:120705:135"/>
6. Miniſters (as I before ſhewed) have
no Tyrannical or Arbitrary Power. For
Chriſt hath tied them by a Law, who to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and whom to reject. And if they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
this Law, the Magiſtrate may correct
them: So that in the exerciſe of this Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Power, every Miniſter is under the laſh
of the Magiſtrates violence, (if he groſly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend)
whereas none of the people are under
any violence, or force from us to obey us;
but if all of them diſobey us and rebel, it is
their own loſs, and we have no remedy.
This is the Tyranny.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, If you think it (as it is) ſo
great a Power, for us to judge of mens Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and fitneſs for Church Priviledges, let
it awaken you the more, to get the wiſeſt,
ableſt men you can for the Miniſtry, that are
fit for ſo a great truſt. If the beſt that are to be
got, are not in the Office, beſhrew our
Governours, and the chooſers. And if you
do not caſt us all out, if you can put fitter men
into the place, that are meeter for the truſt,
beſhrew you for your negligence: we
give you no thanks for it. But if you have
<hi>no fitter</hi> for this work and truſt, will you caſt
it upon <hi>unfitter</hi> or on none? It is a great
truſt for a Phyſician to be truſted with your
lives, and a School-maſter and Tutour with
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:120705:136"/>
your Children? But what of that? Will you
therefore truſt the good women, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
neighbours about you with them; yea
or the Magiſtrate himſelf. Or will you have
no Tutours or Phyſicians? Or rather will
you not be the more careful to keep our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks
and unworthy perſons, and get the
ableſt and faithfuleſt that you can. O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
men, that grudge us the Power of
labouring and ſpending our ſelves for their
Salvation, and judging, where we muſt act!</p>
               <p n="4">4. Object. <hi>Is it not the uſe of the Lords
Supper to Confirm us; and do not men there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
their Covenant and Profeſſion? What need
is there then of any more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You would think much, if at
the Lords Supper we ſhould openly call each
man to a perſonal, explicite Profeſſion of
his Faith, and Covenanting with God: And
indeed it would be a tedious, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
work. It is but a general or joynt
Profeſſion of all together, that is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed:
and notwithſtanding that, there
may for ought we know, be many a one there
that is an Infidel, and knoweth not what
Chriſtianity is. 2. The Lords Supper is the
food of the Soul, confirming by way of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
and augmentation; and therefore you
muſt ſhew that you are alive, before you
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:120705:136"/>
may partake of it. It is a feaſting upon Chriſt,
and with him in his family, and at his Table:
It is a work of Communion with Chriſt and
with his Saints: It is one of the higheſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the Church: And therefore you
muſt produce your little, before you can lay
claim to it. If a man muſt be admitted to the
Lords Supper, without any precedent, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Profeſſion or Covenanting with God,
upon ſuppoſition, that by the act of Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
he doth all this; then men that know
not whether there be a Chriſt, or what he is,
may be admitted: For multitudes of ſuch
there are, that in Infancy were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized:
And I know not by ſeeing him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
whether he know or believe any
thing of Chriſtianity. If a man converted
at Age from Heatheniſm, may not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Lords Table without a perſonal
profeſſion in Baptiſm, then neither may
ſuch as are baptized in Infancy, be admitted
without a perſonal Profeſſion, in Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or ſuch as is without any other Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
Our Parents Profeſſion will not ſerve
our turn, in ſtead of our own when we come
to age. And therefore this Objection is
vaine, unleſs Infidels may be admitted to
Communion, and all be common. But I
need not ſpeak much of this, becauſe I ſhall
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:120705:137"/>
have few ſuch Objectours to deale with:
Even the Papiſts themſelves are many of
them againſt promiſcuous communion,
though the Jeſuites of late, have fitted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all their work, to their man pleaſing
deſigne: See <hi>Joh. Thauleri flores.</hi> cap. 23, &amp;
24 pag. 257, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (An old Puritane, among
the Papiſts) And they make confeſſion alſo
prerequiſite.</p>
               <p>Object. 5. <hi>According to our arguing,
Confirmation is not neceſſary to thoſe that were
Baptized at full Age; and therefore it is not
neceſſary to any, if not to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have given ſome Reaſons why it
ſhould be uſed, with all that have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
after Baptiſm; but I have proved it
more Neceſſary to thoſe that were baptized
in Infancy. And if it were Neceſſary to no
other, it would not follow, that it is not
Neceſſary at all, becauſe not to all.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Object. <hi>Is it not better take up with an
Implicit Profeſſion and Covenanting, then
make ſo great a trouble to our ſelves, and
diſturbance among the people, as this will
make?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Me thinks, not only the face
of the Roman Church, but of our own,
might by this time have afforded us ſatisfying
experience, what Implicit Faith, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:120705:137"/>
Profeſſions are, and to what they tend.
Peruſe the forementioned Evils of this courſe,
and look upon the ſtate of our people, where
you may ſee them in exiſtence, and then
judge whether this Objection be anſwered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Implicit Profeſſion, is the loweſt
and leaſt, that in any caſe of extremity or
neceſſity can be thought tolerable, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by God, and conſiſtent with the life
and being of a Church. And ſhall we <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately</hi>
chooſe to offer God the <hi>worſt,</hi> the
<hi>leaſt,</hi> the <hi>loweſt</hi> that's poſſible to find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
Nay he will have the <hi>beſt,</hi> as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the <hi>beſt,</hi> or he will not accept it, when
we have it to give: Shall we think that in a
caſe of freedom, the ſame will be accepted,
which Neceſſity only can excuſe? Or ſhall
we be content that our Churches have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diſeaſes as will conſiſt with life and being?</p>
               <p n="3">3. An <hi>Implicit Profeſſion</hi> makes or proves
men but <hi>Implicit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly Chriſtians.</hi> Such dumbe
uncertaine ſignes, do leave us in So great
uncertainty of the thing ſignified, that it
ſeems but a very mocking of God (that will
not be mocked) when we have opportunity
for an open Intelligible Profeſſion, and will
not uſe it, or require it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is <hi>againſt Nature</hi> for a man that hath
a Tongue in his head, to refuſe to utter his
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:120705:138"/>
mind any other wiſe then by dumb ſhews,
and yet expect to be underſtood and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
What is the Tongue made for but to
expreſs the mind? Indeed if a man be dumb,
and can neither ſpeak not write, it is more
tollerable to take an uncertaine ſigne from
ſuch a man; then from another that hath the
uſe of Tongue or pen.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a very <hi>Implicite denying</hi> of Chriſt,
which many call an <hi>Implicite Profeſſion.</hi> If a
man that hath a Tongue in his mouth, ſhall
refuſe to Profeſs the Chriſtian Faith and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with the Miniſter that calls him to it,
and ſay, we ſhall have no other Profeſſion
from him then to come to Church, and put
the bread and wine into his mouth, and not
to deny Chriſt expreſly, I leave it to any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
man, whether there be not ſo much of
an Implicite <hi>denying</hi> Chriſt in this <hi>refuſing to
confeſs</hi> him, when they are called to it by
their Paſtours, whom God hath commanded
them to obey, and that in a caſe and ſeaſon,
when all the Church hath required it, or
taught it to be due.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is contrary to the honour of Chriſt,
and the very Nature of Chriſtianity, for
men to take up with Implicite, uncertaine
Profeſſions, when we have opportunity of
more open free Profeſſions. He is not a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:120705:138"/>
to be aſhamed of. And he will have no
ſervants that will not confeſs him before
men, even in the hazzard of life; much more
in daies of the freedom of the Goſpel: As
<hi>with the heart men muſt believe to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo with the mouth Confeſſion is made unto
Salvation,</hi> Rom. 10. 10. What reaſon have
we to whiſper or draw back, in a cauſe of
ſuch a nature and weight as this.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Shall we thus teach our people to
eſteem Chriſtianity, as an unobſervable
thing, by no more obſerving it? The <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity</hi>
of mens <hi>Tranſition</hi> into the Adult-ſtate
of actual Believers, doth make it more
<hi>Obſervable</hi> in the eyes of men; and they will
ſee that there is more in it, then commonly
is now eſteemed. I find by experience that
our people hate no preaching more, then
<hi>Differencing</hi> Preaching, which leaves or
ſhuts them out from the number of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
and ſets them as one the left-hand,
in the face of the Congregation, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them before the time: but faine they
would have Miniſtry confound and jumble
all together: And then you may make them
as great ſinners as you will, ſo you will
make them no worſe then the Juſtified, that
are forgiven, and ſhall be ſaved. And ſo
in <hi>Practice,</hi> they love no differencing waies:
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:120705:139"/>
But ſhall we ſo far gratifie the Devil and the
fleſh? No: we muſt labour to make the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between Chriſts Servants and the
world, as conſpicuous as we can! that the
Conſciences of poor ſinners, may rather be
wakened, then cheated by us: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhould chooſe the moſt ſolemn
Tranſition, and Record the names of the
Confirmed, and let the people be brought to
a publike Obſervation, of the Neceſſity of
Faith and Holineſs, while the Covenant and
Profeſſion of it is made ſo Neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That is the beſt means, that is fitteſt to
attain the End; The End of a Covenant is to
<hi>Oblige,</hi> and the End of a Profeſſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the mind: And I pray you which is fitteſt
for theſe Ends: An <hi>Expreſs Profeſſion and
Covenant,</hi> or a dumbe uncertain ſigne, by
coming to Church; paying Tithes? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Such dumb Profeſſions are leſs tolerable
now, becauſe we have many in our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
that we <hi>know</hi> to be no Chriſtians. I
know of many that will heare, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no life to come, and ſecretly make a
ſcorne of Chriſt and Scripture, and many
more that know not what Chriſtianity is, as
is aforeſaid. Now ſhall we take up with
ſuch ſignes of Chriſtianity, as we ſee and
know are commonly uſed by Infidels,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:120705:139"/>
when we may have better?</p>
               <p n="10">10. It is <hi>eſſential</hi> to a Profeſſion to be in
ſome meaſure <hi>explicit:</hi> for <hi>Profiteri</hi> is but
<hi>palàm vel publicè fateri;</hi> It is no Profeſſion
if it be not, or pretend not to be, an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi>
of the mind: And therefore to be <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite</hi>
and not <hi>Expreſs,</hi> is ſo far to be againſt
the very Nature of the Profeſſion; in that
meaſure as your <hi>Profeſſion</hi> is <hi>Implicite</hi> (as it's
called) and not <hi>Expreſs,</hi> in that meaſure it
is no <hi>Profeſſion</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>Object. 7. <hi>But when you have the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Covenant or Profeſſion, you are not ſure
that it is true, and that the man is a believer
at the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I am ſure that it's <hi>Truly a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
that is, a <hi>Pretended ſigne of the mind,</hi>
tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gh I am not ſure that it's <hi>True Profeſſion,</hi>
that is, a <hi>True infallible ſigne of the mind:</hi>
I can know the metaphyſical, though not
the Morall Truth of it. And then I can be
ſure that I do my duty, and take up accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Directions of Chriſt. It is his
work to judge the heart immediatly, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his prerogative to know it: but it's my
work to judge of the Credibility of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
2. And what if I have no <hi>infallible</hi>
Certainty? Muſt I therefore throw up all,
and make the Paſtoral Church-government
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:120705:140"/>
to be void, and caſt open the Vineyard of
Chriſt to the wilderneſs, and not ſo much as
require a <hi>Credibility,</hi> becauſe we cannot have
an Infallibility? This may not be.</p>
               <p>Object. 8. <hi>But this will encourage tbe Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
and Congregational, in their Expreſs
Covenantings, by our coming ſo neer them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I may better ſay, you will make
men Anabaptiſts, and drive them too far,
by your looſneſs, and willfully ſhunning
plaine duty. How can weake profeſſours be
drawn to think well of that party, which
they ſee do ſhun ſo needfull a Work of God?
2. Love and Peace will teach all Chriſtians
to ſay, that it's the beſt for Unity and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our breaches, to come as neare diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Brethren as we may, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to fly
the further from them. At leaſt we may not run
from truth and duty, that we may be unlike
our diſſenting Brethren. 3. And I take it to
be my duty to tell this alowd to the Chriſtian
world, that after long conteſt with the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
and oppoſition of their waies, I am
grown (as I confidently think) to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the mind of God in ſuffering them
among us; that he had this great truth and
duty, to which he ſaw it neceſſary to awake
us; the Church having been ſo lamentably
defiled, Diſcipline made an impoſſible thing,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:120705:140"/>
and mens Salvation grievouſly hindred, by
the common <hi>ſecret, unobſerved tranſition</hi> of
all people into the name, and number, and
Priviledges of Adult-Chriſtians; therefore
did God permit theſe men, to ſtep too far
on the other ſide, that the noiſe might be the
greater, and his call the more obſervable;
ſo that they are his meſſengers, calling aloud
to <hi>England,</hi> and all other Chriſtian
Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> to keep the doore, and
repaire the hedge, and no more to take an
Infant-baptiſm, and Profeſſion of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
as a ſufficient Evidence of the Title of
the Adult, to the Name, or Place, or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veledges
of Chriſtians; but to give them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
Priviledges upon the Parents Profeſſion;
but to require of them a ſober, ſerious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and Covenanting by themſelves, in
owning their Baptiſmal Covenant, before
we number them with Adult-Chriſtians: And
that God hath ſuffered the Anabaptiſts to
make ſuch a ſtirre among us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will prove a
mercy to us in the End, if we have the wit
and grace to learn this, upon this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
occaſion; and then the Reformation
will do us more good, then ever the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
did us harm. But if we will not
learne, nor obey Gods call, we muſt yet
looke to be moleſted by them more, or
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:120705:141"/>
elſe to do and ſuffer worſe.</p>
               <p>Object. 9. <hi>But if you will not take a non-renouncing
of Chriſt, and Infant Baptiſm as
ſufficient, without a Perſonal Covenant and
Profeſſion, you may on the ſame grounds call
men every week to ſuch a Profeſſion, becauſe
that the former Profeſsion ſhews not what they
afterwards are, but what then they are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The caſe is quite another:
In your inſtance, it is but the <hi>continuance of
the ſame Profeſſion and Condition</hi> that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite:
And I am bound to take it as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
while I have no Evidence to queſtion
it, and ſee the performance of it, as far as
belongeth to my cogniſance. But in my
caſe the <hi>Conditions</hi> and the <hi>Profeſsions</hi> are not
the ſame: <hi>A new Condition</hi> of <hi>Right;</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the <hi>Adult,</hi> which they had not at
all in their Infant Baptiſm. <hi>Then</hi> they ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon their <hi>Parents</hi> Faith or Profeſſion;
but at age they muſt neceſſarily have a Faith,
or Profeſſion of their <hi>own,</hi> or elſe they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ceaſe to be Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And yet let me adde, that frequent
Profeſſions of Faith, and renewing Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, have ever been uſed in the
Church; both before Chriſts Incarnation
and ſince, and indeed, the Lords Supper
doth import it: And for my part, I thinke
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:120705:141"/>
it a very convenient, edifying courſe, to
have the <hi>Articles of our Faith every day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
as the Belief of that Church, and the
people to ſtand up at it, to ſignifie their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;</hi>
ſo be it, you will not take up with this
ſilent Profeſſion alone, and exclude a more
explicite one, when it is requiſite. But this
fitly ſignifieth our ſtanding to the firſt.</p>
               <p>Object. 10. <hi>But this will caſt you upon the
ſame difficulties which you Object to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts;
you will not know at what Age to take
men for Adult-Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We ſhall not accept them for
their Age, but for their <hi>Profeſsion:</hi> And
we can eaſily tell when they offer themſelves
to tryal and Profeſſion, and deſire the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church: As the Ancient
Churches could tell when their Catechumens
were to be baptized.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for the time when we muſt judge
their Infant Church-ſtate to ceaſe, if they own
not the Covenant perſonally, we cannot
ſet a certaine yeare, nor is it neceſſary: but
when their Infancy ceaſeth, then their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſtate
ceaſeth: That is, when they come
to the full or competent uſe of Reaſon: But
then obſerve, 1. That if they be called at
ſuch a time to profeſs their Faith, and own
their Covenant, and refuſe it, then we muſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:120705:142"/>
judge them refuſers of Chriſtianity unleſs
the Reaſons of the Refuſal allows another
judgment. 2. Or if they will fully neglect
for a conſiderable ſpace, to own their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal
Covenant, and to ſeeke a ſtanding
among the Adult-Chriſtians, it's a ſtrong
preſumption that they are Backſliders. 3. If
they only <hi>ſuſpend</hi> their perſonal Profeſſion at
age, we muſt only <hi>ſuſpend</hi> our Judgment,
till we have ſome light to diſcern the cauſe:
and cannot be ſure that there are Deſerters or
Apoſtates. 4. But we are ſure that they are
nor to be numbred by the Church among
Adult Chriſtians, till they have produced
the Evidence of their Title, which is no other
then <hi>A Credible, Perſonal Profeſsion.</hi> So
that it's eaſy to know when any ſuch perſon
is to be admitted, and publikely owned as an
Actual Believer, though it be not ſo eaſy to
diſcern of all, before that time, whether
they are to be reckoned as <hi>Deſertours</hi> or not.
He that wilfully neglecteth to come among
the Adult Chriſtians, long after he hath the
full uſe of Reaſon (which is not with all at
the ſame age) is to be much ſuſpected, at
leaſt: And commonly about 16, or 17, or 18,
years of age, is the time when we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to expect that they ſhould ſeek the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
and Privilidges of the Adult: For
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:120705:142"/>
about that age, they have a competent uſe
of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Object. 11.  <hi>But if you admit them into
the Church in Infancy, ſay the Anabaptiſts, you
will be obliged to excommunicate them all, that
prove ungodly when they come to age, and not
to let them ſilently paſs out of the Church again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Excommunication is either an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
them from all Relation of members
to the Catholike Church, or from the actual
Communion of the Church, or from both.
The former we can do but Declaratively. In
the latter we alſo adjoyne the charge of God,
for the execution of the ſentence. But thoſe
that were never perſonal Profeſſours of
Faith, nor admitted into the Communion of
Adult-Chriſtians, are not fit to be caſt out
of it: And this is the common uſe of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
to remove thoſe, as unfit, from
the Communion of the Adult, that once
were in it, and forfeit that Communion:
which cannot belong to them that never were
in it. And for our <hi>Declaring</hi> them <hi>Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi>
or <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> we may do it upon juſt
occaſion, but we are not bound to do it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
by all that are guilty; this being not
<hi>the Excommunication,</hi> that is ſo enjoyned in
the Scriptures. Where do you find that the
Church in Scripture-times or after, was wont
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:120705:143"/>
to <hi>Excommunicate Apoſtates?</hi> And yet Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
were formerly of the Church. It is
thoſe that hang on, and pretend ſtill to be
of the Church, and intrude into the Actual
Communion of it, that we muſt caſt out,
when they deſerve it.</p>
               <p>Object. 12. <hi>But if they ceaſe to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
you muſt Baptize them againe, if you
will receive them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No ſuch matter: The Anabaptiſts
themſelves will not Rebaptize an Apoſtate,
when he returneth to the Church. He is to
be received by Confeſſion and Abſolution,
and not by Baptiſm. If a Chriſtian turn Turk,
and afterward Return, he is not to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized.</p>
               <p>Object. 13. <hi>But by this means you will
unchriſten the people, and then they will be
exaſperated, and turn Heathens, or hearken
to any ſeducers that will miſlead them</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. No: we will unchriſten no
man: but do that honour to Chriſtianity,
and that right to the Church and the Soules
of men, as to make a difference between
Chriſtians and Infidels, and that ſomewhat
wider then the bare Names. He that is a
Chriſtian ſhall be more encouraged by this
courſe, and he that is not, cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtened
by us. If men will not unchriſten
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:120705:143"/>
themſelves, they need not fear leſt the juſt
trying and approving of their Chriſtianity
ſhould unchriſten them. 2. How little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
it is to Chriſt and the Church, to have
the number made up, by ſuch as we would
diſallow; I have ſhewed you before, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
what a miſchief that is to themſelves,
which ſome would give them as a benefit.
3. If Magiſtrates and Miniſters do their duty,
(yea or but Miniſters alone) they will better
be kept from Heatheniſm, or other evils in
the ſtate of <hi>Expectants</hi> and <hi>Catechumens,</hi>
then in the ſtate of Church-members, where
Diſcipline will make them mad.</p>
               <p>Object. 14.  <hi>But at leaſt your deſigne
lookes as if you would keep the Children of all
ſuch unchriſtened; and what work would that
make?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I medle not with that Queſtion,
but leave every man to his own Judgment.
And if I did my ſelf keep off ſuch children,
I think it would prove but very few. For 1.
I would refuſe none of the Parents that had
<hi>aliquid Chriſti,</hi> that made but a <hi>Credible
Profeſſion</hi> of Chriſtianity. 2. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that this Practiſe would bring almoſt
all the people to a tollerable Profeſſion, when
they know it is expected, and what lieth on
it. 3. Upon experience now I find, that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:120705:144"/>
                  <hi>both</hi> the Parents are ſeldom ſo bad as to be
uncapable of offering their child to God, (in
the Judgment of the Church) Nay common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here the more one of the perſons is in ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
ſinne, the more the other hates it:
And they are ſeldom <hi>both</hi> groſly ignorant.
And thoſe that were delayed on theſe terms,
would receive no wrong by it. Gods way
is the beſt. The Children of unbelievers muſt
not be inchurched in waies of our deviſing,
nor reſpected before the honour of Chriſt,
and the common good of the Church of God.
But of this I ſay againe, I interpoſe not

know of none in force with us, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
and if they were, it is a work without
their line, which Chriſt hath done before
them, and not left to them, to deſcribe the

14. A Dioceſane Biſhop is uncapable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it faithfully: Could one man Try, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
and Confirm faithfully, all the Souls
in 200 or 300 Churches? It's known that
here they did not: and it's plain they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.
If they lay hands on them without Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
upon the Presbyters word, then 1. This
yieldeth, all ſave the Ceremony, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
2. And it is a venturing their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
on the judgment and fidelity of other
men; who may ſend them Infidels to be
Confirmed for ought they know. But if they
Try themſelves, they are never able to do
for ſo many, in ſeaſon: ſome will be old
men, before the Biſhop will have leiſure to
Confirm them; and many a hundred die
without it. Nor do they know the people
as their Paſtours do.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The Doctrine and Practiſe of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> under the Biſhops, is
for the Power of Presbyters herein as far as
we deſire: For 1. The Presbyters of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
had by the Rubrick, the Tryal and
Approbation of thoſe, that were ſent to the
Biſhop for Confirmation. 2. The Biſhops
accordingly tooke them on <hi>their words,</hi> with
a Certificate, and uſed not to try them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but only to Impoſe hands with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and bleſſing. 3. And this by the Canon,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:120705:147"/>
their <hi>ſuffragane</hi> alſo might do; which yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that a Presbyter may do it.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The Pope himſelf doth yield that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
may do it. And <hi>Gregories</hi> Epiſt. to
that end, is put into their Canon Law,
<hi>Diſt. 95. 1, part. Baptizatos etiam Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
eos tangere conceditur,</hi> and <hi>Gregories
Epiſt. to Januar. Calaritan.</hi> is annexed: By
which it appeareth that they took his former
prohibition ſo ill, that he was faine to reverſe
it. And though <hi>c.</hi> 11. he be forbidden <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes
ſignare,</hi> in the preſence of the Biſhop,
without his command, yet ſo he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

and the Rural Presbyters, might not give
the cup or bread, in preſence of the City
Presbyters, <hi>c. 12. ex Concil. Neocaeſar.</hi> 1.
<hi>c.</hi> 13. But certainly this proveth neither the
one nor the other, out of their Power.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Papiſts commonly confeſs, that
Presbyters may <hi>ex dispenſatione,</hi> Confirm
by Impoſition of hands: ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
And the Shool-men ordinarily make it
an act of the Presbyters Power.</p>
               <p n="18">18. If it be proper to Biſhops, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe of their <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Juriſdiction:</hi>

differ but in <hi>degree:</hi> Not of <hi>Juriſdiction:</hi>
for it is no more an act of Juriſdiction to
Confirm, then to Baptize or give the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</p>
               <p>19 Proteſtant Divines are commonly
agreed, that Confirmation is not proper to
Biſhops, but may be uſed by Presbyters.
For 1. <hi>France, Belgia, Helvetia, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,
Saxonie, Sweden,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate,</hi>
the Countries of the Duke of <hi>Brandenburge,</hi>

are all without Biſhops, having put them
down: And though three or foure of theſe
countries have ſuperintendents, yet they
make not Confirmation proper to them.
2. The Engliſh Biſhops, ordinarily main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
againſt the Papiſts, that Presbyters
may Confirm, and therefore we have their
concurrance, as in Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,
Maſon,</hi> and many others is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p n="20">20. If all this will not ſatisfie you, for

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:120705:148"/>
to do no more, then Presbyters alwaies did
in Baptizing the Adult; even to judge and
Approve of the Capacity of thoſe whom they
Baptized: and ſo will we only judge of the

charge of, and own as Adult-Chriſtians, and
muſt adminiſter the Lords Supper to: And
this common reaſon cannot deny us.</p>
               <p>Object. 16. <hi>But if Presbyters may do it,
yet ſo cannot you; For you are no Presbyters,
as wanting Epiſcopal Ordination: or elſe

Judgment, and the reſt of the Prelates, were
againſt the reordaining the Scots Miniſters,
me thinks, few ſhould be ſo much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate,
then that intemperate Prelate,
as to judge their Ordination Null. And if
the Papiſts in the Canon Law, do judge that
in ſome caſes an excommunicate mans Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is valid, me thinks Proteſtants ſhould

not be worſe to the Church then they: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe that are for the Neceſſity of an
uninterrupted ſucceſſion of juſtly ordained
Paſtours; who muſt (I dare boldly ſay) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
their ſucceſſion from unmeeter, and
more uncapable hands, then <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">☜</note> No more is neceſſary to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Papiſts have made another
thing of it: They uſe it to Infants, and ſo
will not we: They make a proper Sacrament
of it: They make the viſible ſignes to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
and Croſſing, in the name of the
Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt; and they
make Impoſition of hands no part of it, but
caſt it off, (though in words they own it)
They adjoyn a boxe of the eare, to ſignifie,
the oppoſition that Chriſts
Souldiers muſt expect:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Chamier. l. 4. <hi>de Sacra.</hi> cap. 10, &amp; 11.</note> They
make it to imprint I know not
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:120705:150"/>
what indelible Caracter, and to give grace
<hi>ex opere operato:</hi> They make it to be an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of us into Chriſts <hi>militia</hi> abuſing Baptiſm,
as being but an entering us into his <hi>Family,</hi>
and not his warfare: All this is nothing to
that, which I am pleading for, and which the
proteſtant writers do wiſh for.</p>
               <p>Object. 18. <hi>At leaſt you will revive the
Prelatical Confirmation againe, which the old
non-conformiſts were againſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We will revive nothing of it, but
what was good: The corruption we ſhall
omit. They did it but on a few, (contrary to
their own Laws) but we would have it uſed
to all. They Confirmed children that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
not what they ſaid: But we ſhall
expect an underſtanding Profeſſion of Faith.
They did it in a hurry as an idle Ceremony:
we would have it done deliberately and with
great reverence. The Biſhop only did it with
them, that knew not whom he did Confirm,
but ventured on other mens words, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
But we would have the Paſtour do it,
that knoweth the perſons, and hath time to
try them, having one Pariſh and not two
hundred to overſee.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But, at leaſt, the Papiſts
and Prelats will be hardened or encouraged by
your coming ſo neare them.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will not caſt off the Work of
God, becauſe that any will make it an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of ſinne. And I take it to be the more
my duty and not the leſs, becauſe it tends to
Peace with all. I take it not to be any part
of my Religion, to ſtudy how to croſs my
brethren, or forbeare a practice (yea ſo
neceſſary a duty) becauſe they like it. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
that principle and ſpirit. I rather feare,
leſt their own ſelfconceitedneſs, intereſt,
prejudice and diſcontent, will make them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
it.</p>
               <p>Object. 19. <hi>What have we to do with
the ſigne, when the thing that occaſioned the
uſe of it is ceaſed? Impoſition of hands was
at firſt only for the gift of Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It was <hi>much</hi> for the gift of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
but not only. And if the giving of
one ſort of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt be
ceaſed; yet the other, more excellent and
neceſſary gifts continue; and therefore no
reaſon the ſigne ſhould ceaſe, becauſe it was
not appropriated to the gift of Miracles.
But 2. If any man ſcruple either the ſigne of
Impoſing hands, or the Name of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we deſire him his liberty: theſe are
not the things that we contend for: Let him
but yield us that which I have ſhewed to be
moſt Certaine, and moſt uſefull to the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:120705:151"/>
Church; that is, <hi>a ſolemn Tranſition out of
an Infant Church-ſtate into an Adult, under
Approbation of the Paſtours,</hi> and the <hi>juſt cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance
of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Church;</hi> and let him call it what
he will, I ſhall not much contend with him
about the name, or ſigne of Impoſition.</p>
               <p>Object. 20. <hi>Abundance of Miniſters are
raw, imprudent young men, and not fit to
manage ſo great a truſt: and ſo it will marre
all; while ſome are ſo ſtrict, that they will
refuſe all that ſeem not godly to their cenſorious
minds; and ſome will be looſe man-pleaſers,
and let in all, and turn it but to an unprofitable
formality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. While men are men, they will
act as men. If we ſhall have no Church-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
and Adminiſtrations, till you are
ſecured from humane abuſe of them, you
muſt ſhut up the Church doors, and give up
all; and ſhut up your Bibles, till Papiſts and
Infidels can find no matter of cavelling at the
Tranſlation. 2. As I ſaid before, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſhould provoke the Magiſtrate to ſet a
faithfull guard on the Church doores, that
ſeeing the Paſtours have ſo great a Truſt, and
the danger of abuſing it is ſo great, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt
ſhould be choſen that can be had. And
if it be not ſo, you reproach your ſelves,
that are chooſers and Paſtours, and have the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:120705:151"/>
Rule. Why chooſe you not better if you
know where to find them? 3. This Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
is as much againſt our Judging of
thoſe that are to be <hi>Baptized,</hi> which yet the
Miniſters that did Baptize, have ever done,
and were you not Baptized already, we muſt
admit you, and judge who is to be admitted,
as the ancient Preachers of the Goſpel did.
4. The Epiſcopal B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ethren had more wit,
then to be againſt Confirmation, becauſe
one man may uſe it too ſtrictly, and another
too looſely: The Congregational men are
not againſt Church-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ovenants or Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
becauſe one Paſtour or Church may be
too ſtrict; and another too looſe in judging
of mens Piety: The Presbyterians are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Trying men before admiſſion to the
Lords Supper, nor againſt Diſcipline, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
one Elderſhip may be too ſtrict, and
another too looſe. The Anabaptiſts are not
againſt Rebaptizing men at age, becauſe one
Miniſter may refuſe the fit, and another
may take in all that come. Why then ſhould
a poſſibility of Miniſters miſcarriage, cauſe
you to be more againſt this, then all the reſt?
5. If Miniſters be Aſſociated, they will be
accountable for ſuch miſcariages; and the
Adviſe and Admonition of their Brethren,
may do much to prevent or reform ſuch
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:120705:152"/>
abuſes: And the faithfull people of their
charge, will ſomewhat obſerve them, and
<hi>bid Archippus take heed to the Miniſtry that
he hath received in the Lord, that he fulfill it,</hi>
Col. 4. 17. 6. As long as you are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into our charge, but have your Liberty
to chooſe your Paſtour, (as now it is) you
have the leſs reaſon for this complaint. If
the Laws of <hi>Zeno</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> be thought too
ſtrict in their Schooles, as long as the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
may chooſe to come there, and all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers,
they may the better beare it.
7. As I ſaid before, the truſt muſt be put
in ſome or other to judge: And where can
it be fitter then in them, who by ſtudy are
prepared, and by office appointed by Chriſt
hereunto. 8. If you will give a Presbytery,
or one Eminent Miniſter in every market-Town,
or viſiters of your own appointment,
a ſpecial care to overſee the reſt in doing this,
and ſuch like works, I ſhall be no gainſayer,
ſo the work be but done: the more inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and circumſpection the better. 9 If one
Miniſter refuſe the fit, there be many
more that will not. 10 Your Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
may have power moderately to correct
the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>niſters abuſes in their work.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I perceive that Rulers are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably
jealous, leſt the Paſtours of the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:120705:152"/>
Church will do too much, rather then left
they do too little, and are more ſolicitous to
uſe the bridle of reſtraint, then the ſpurre of
inſtigation: I intreate them to conſider theſe
things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That moſt certainly there is no part of
all our Miniſtry, that ſtirs up neer ſo much
ill will, paſſion, malice, yea and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt us, as this part, about taking in
and caſting out, and exerciſing the Keyes
of the Kingdom; in which you are ſo jealous
of us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And alas Miniſters are fleſh and Blood,
as well as others: and all of them too tender
of their Intereſt, of Profit, Reputation, and
Eaſe: which are all contradicted notably by
this work. Do you think Miniſters will be
ſo hot on it, to have their neighbours hate
them and revile them, and to live as Owles in
the places where they live, and to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on a great deal of trouble? Surely it is a
very ſelf-diſpleaſing thing to the very Nature
of man, unleſs he be a monſter, to diſpleaſe
his neighbours, and be hated and baited by
them. And it will provoke them not only
to forbeare all acts of kindneſs or bounty,
but to deny them their due maintenance, as
far as ever they can: And many, if not moſt
Miniſters, have no great mind to be ſo uſed;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:120705:153"/>
nay had rather loſe it, then go to Law for all
their dues; the trouble, and coſt, and <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
of it is ſo great. So that our Parliaments
have been too much afraid, leſt Miniſters
ſhould ceaſe to be men, or to be ſinners,
and to be manpleaſers, and to indulge their
fleſh; and leſt we ſhould runne into the fire,
and lie down among the thorns, and chooſe
a life of trouble and ſufferings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And me thinks experience ſhould ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
men of this. Do you not ſee how back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Miniſters are to Church-Reformation,
and Diſcipline in the exerciſe, when they have
been moſt forward for the Power? How
little is yet done in it, for all our liberty, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all our Prayers, and petitions, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for it? Do you find in moſt Pariſhes
that Miniſters are prone to overdo? certainly
you do not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Do you not know that all the Work
of God is ſo much againſt Nature, and hath
ſuch abundance of enemies and difficulties in
the way, that few men are like to be guilty
of over-doing? Why be you not as carefull
to hinder men from overdoing in ſanctifying
the Lords day, in teaching and praying with
their families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but becauſe you ſee that
few need your curb. I am confident, ſhould
Parliaments do their <hi>beſt</hi> to drive on Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:120705:153"/>
to ſuch works as theſe, and make Laws
upon Laws, to ſpur them to the practice,
they would not be able to bring one half of
us, nor the tenth man, to reach ſo farre,
as Chriſt hath bound us; no nor one man of
us, in all reſpects.</p>
               <p>And yet I againe ſay, that if any raſh men
are overrigid and abuſe their truſt (which is
likeſt to be thoſe whoſe maintenance no whit
cometh from the people; for in the reſt there
is more danger of the contrary,) we deſire
not that they ſhould be exempted from the
Magiſtrates, Miniſters, or peoples due means
for their amendment. But let the ſpurre be
moſt uſed, ſeeing there is moſt need; and let
us ſee ſome ſevere Laws, to drive us on to
thoſe duties, that fleſh and blood, and all the
world is ſo much againſt.</p>
               <p>I Come now to the laſt part of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>aske,
which is to give ſome brief Directions for
the moſt effectual Practice of this excellent,
needfull work. And I ſhall firſt ſpeake of
the Duty of Miniſters in order to it, and
2. Of the peoples Duty, and laſtly of the
Magiſtrates. The Duty of the Paſtours I
judge to conſiſt in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. Let the Paſtours in each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:120705:154"/>
meet together, and agree as one man in
faithfulneſs, and ſelf-denial, to do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that the moſt conſcionable may not be
liable to the reproach of ſingularity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the reſt betray them, and the Church
and Cauſe of Chriſt, by withdrawing, and
leaving the work undone: ſo long hath the
Church already ſuffered the neglect, even of
godly Miniſters, that in ſuch a time of leave
and helpe, we ſtill hold off, and dare not
venture on a little diſpleaſure of the people,
when our Anceſtours ventered on the flames;
I grieve to think what a ſhame it will be to
our names, and to the Reformed Churches,
and what a confuſion it may bring upon our
faces, before our Righteous Judge. And it
is a griefe to me, if I were ſure of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
aſſiſtance, that all our Enemies ſhall
ſay, and that the Hiſtories of this age ſhall
tell poſterity, that the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi>
after faſting, prayers, warres and vowes
pretended for Reformation, would yet do
little or nothing toward it, but preach; even
in times of Liberty and encouragement, till
the Magiſtrate did it: And that it muſt be the
work of the Magiſtrate, after our unworthy,
lazy, or treacherous deſertion of it. Had we
no more help then we have, we might do
much, were we willing and unanimous.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Let us take heed of extending
theſe Agreements to any unneceſſary Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
ſo as to lay the ſtreſs of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
on them, or to make that neceſſary,
which is unneceſſary: But let us Agree on
the Generall certain points, and leave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men to their Liberty, in modes and
circumſtances, not judging each other, if
we differ herein: or if one be more or leſs
ſtrict then another in the execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Let us yet all be very carefull,
that in point of tryall and judging mens Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
we avoid extreames: On one ſide let
us not be Righteous overmuch, by keeping
out any, that make the moſt broken, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
Profeſſion of Faith and Repentance,
and a Godly life, that may be taken for
credible: and remember that we are not
ſearchers of the heart, and that charity
judgeth not evil of any, that are capable of a
better Judgment. And certainly a humble
Soul that's conſcious of its own infirmities,
and unworthineſs will be very tender of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
another, without very ſatisfying
Evidence. Of this I referre you to my firſt
Diſpute, of Right to Sacraments.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, let us take heed of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this duty into a meer formality, and
making nothing of it, but mocking the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:120705:155"/>
Church and God. Let us not take up with a
Profeſſion of any other kind of Faith, but
the true Chriſtian ſaving Faith; nor with any
Profeſſion of this Faith, which we are able
to prove to be Incredible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. None of the Aged that have
already been admitted to the Communion of
the Church in the Lords Supper, may be
brought under Confirmation by Impoſition
of hands, as we have before ſhewed. But
all that were yet never admitted to this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
part of Communion, nor have made any
ſolemne Approved Profeſſion, ſhould yet
be called to it, be they young or ould, when
they demand Church-Communion.</p>
               <p>If you ask me what ſhall be done with the
reſt, ſeeing they were admitted irregularly,
without any Profeſſion of the Faith? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
1. Acquaint them plainly with the
Nature of Chriſtianity, and what a Church
is, and what is the Office of a Paſtour, and
what the duty of the flock, to God, to him,
and themſelves, and one another. 2. Then
tell them, that you reſolve to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to theſe Rules in the Government of
your flock; and to exerciſe this Diſcipline.
Tell them plainly (that they be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
both what are the benefits of a Church-ſtate
and Diſcipline, and what are the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:120705:155"/>
that unprepared men are like to grudg at;
and how hardly they will take it to be
followed, and not ſuffered to reſt in ſinne,
and openly reproved, and caſt out with
ſhame, if they will not be Penitent and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.
And then tell them, that if there
be any that have ſlipt into a Church-ſtate (in
ſhew) and knew not what Chriſtianity was,
or what they did, and finde themſelves as
yet unfit for it, if they do forbeare the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the Church, till they are better
prepared, and acquainted with them, and
can uſe them to their profit, you ſhall in
meane time be ready to Teach them publik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and privatly, till they are prepared: And
thoſe that are fit to continue, and uſe ſuch
Priviledges, adviſe not to forbeare them.
But let them know, that you can neither
take all the Pariſh as ſuch for members of the
Univerſal Church, or of your charge, and
therefore muſt have ſome better Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
eſpecially after ſuch a confuſion,
that negligence hath brough into the Church:
And you cannot take any man to be of your
charge againſt his will, and therefore you
muſt know their minds. 3. Give them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that all that own their Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip,
and will have Communion with
that Church, under your Miniſtry and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:120705:156"/>
overſight, are deſired by you to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
their deſires, by giving in their names to
the Cleark of the Pariſh, or ſome other fit
perſon; or if they refuſe that, by coming
to you. 4. When you have their names,
keep them ſome time, while you get infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the perſons lives. And then give
notice to all (if it may be, to avoid impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of partiality; or at leaſt of all that you
have reaſon to ſuſpect, of groſs ignorance
or impiety) by ſtreets, Villages, or houſes,
to come to ſpeak with you, on ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
daies: where you may diſcerne the
fitneſs of ſome; and ſuch as you find to be
groſly ignorant or ſcandalous, adviſe them
to ſtay till they are prepared, offering them
your help, becauſe elſe you muſt do that
in a way of Diſcipline, that they are unfit
to beare. 5. All that diſown their own
ſtanding and Church-memberſhip, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Right to Priviledges, and withdraw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the order of <hi>Catechumens,</hi> as being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in what they did before, you may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
teach them as <hi>Catechumens,</hi> and are not
bound to enrage them by Church-Diſcipline,
which they conſent not to, and are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of. 6. All thoſe that you find tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that have owned their Churchmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip,
and not withdrawne themſelves,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:120705:156"/>
you ought to keep their names, in a Church
Book for memory, and to call them ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(at ſome day of humiliation, or other
fit ſeaſon) to own their Relation publikly,
their names being-read, that all may know
with whom they are to hold Communion.
And if there be need, you may juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
them there openly to renew their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and Covenant with God. 7. Your flock
being then Reformed and known, you need
not call them againe, to examination before
particular Sacraments, or other parts of
Church-communion. 8. When any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are after added, they ſhould, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confirmed,
and ſuch as never did Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
be received ſolemnly by Prayer and
Benediction; and if they be ſuch as have
been admitted to Communion, let them be
only Approved upon renewing their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
For the one ſort are Confirmed in
their Relation to both Catholike and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

his ſinne were open) that ſo he may be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially

And the fuller Confeſſion he makes of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly

that live within the reach of any Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

And thoſe that differ in ſuch tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
matters, as may not hinder their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

not ſatisfied to joyne in Synods with the

Communion and Chriſtian correſpondence
as their Principles will admit. And let no

either the Churches neerly Aſſociated, or
thoſe that we agree to take for Brethren.
And thoſe that bring ſuch Certificates muſt
be admitted by us, without any further Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
or Confirmation; unleſs there be ſome
notable cauſe of ſuſpition. But for thoſe
that live in Heretical, or Impious Societies,
or ſuch as refuſe all Church-order, and
Communion with neighbour Churches, or
are juſtly diſowned by the Aſſociated
Churches, we ſhould not admit them to our
Communion, without a particular Tryal, or a
better Certificate then thoſe Churches can
give them. And thus ſhould all the Churches
be concatenated, and their Communion
ſetled.</p>

                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 8. Above all let every Miniſter
ſee that he wiſely and diligently carry himſelf
to the reſt of his Pariſh; avoiding indeed the
excommunicate as Heathens: but for all
that are willing to learne in an Expectant-ſtate,
let us deale lovingly, gently and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
with them, denying them nothing that
lawfully we can yield them, in matters of
Buryal, Marrying, Praying, Preaching, or
the like. And be ſure to carry on the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
duty of Catechizing, and perſonal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and Inſtruction with them, family by
family, by which you may the better know
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:120705:158"/>
them and prepare them for Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and have opportunity to quiet them,
and anſwer their Objections; and they may
ſee that you caſt them not off as Heathens,
but only prepare them for the ſtate and
Priviledges, which they are yet unfit for.</p>
               <p>And eſpecially let us by all poſſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion,
meekneſs, loving carriage,
blameleſs lives, and charitable contribution
to the utmoſt of our abilities, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to win them and take off that Offence, or
at leaſt abate it, or hinder the ſucceſs of the
reproaches of thoſe, that will undoubtedly
be offended, by our Reformation and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
And let us have a vigilant eye upon
any Seducers, eſpecially Infidels and Papiſts
that may creep in among them, to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of their diſcontents; that we may pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and effectually counterwork them.
This much faithfully done by Miniſters, might
be an admirable mercy to the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THe <hi>Peoples</hi> duty in order to this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
before mentioned, is, 1. Of the
godly, and ſuch as are fit for Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
2. Of the groſly ignorant and
ungodly that are unfit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The duty of the firſt ſort lyeth in theſe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:120705:159"/>
Particulars. 1. They muſt highly value the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Paſtorall overſight and Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and therefore be ready to promote
any work of Reformation that is neceſſary,
to their more fruitfull and comfortable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They muſt ſo behave themſelves as may
honour and further the work, and take heed
of that by which it may be hindered; leaſt
they weaken our hands and be a ſtumbling
block to others. For what can a Miniſter do
himſelf, if the Church aſſiſt him not? much
leſs if they hinder him? Eſpecially, 1. They
muſt take heed of ſcandalous ſinnes, which
may be a ſhame to their Profeſſion, and open
the mouthes of the enemies of the Church.
2. They muſt take heed of Sects and Div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and quarrellings among themſelves,
which will break them in pieces, or hinder
their Edification, and make them a ſtumbling
block to the weak, and a laughing ſtock to the
wicked. 3. They muſt take heed of ſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yneſs
and pride, and domineering carriage towards
thoſe that are yet without: And muſt be
as eminent in meekneſs, and humility, and
patience, and forbearance, and ſelf-denyal,
as they are in the Profeſſion of Religion. For
a proud domineering ſpirit, or ſtrangeneſs
and unneceſſary diſtance, doth loſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:120705:159"/>
whom you ſhould be means to win.
4. They muſt ſtudy to do all the good they
can to thoſe without; be as little as may be in
executing penalties on them, and as much
as may be poſſibly, in ſpeaking kindly and
familiarly to them, and relieving them in
wants, and viſiting them in ſickneſs, and
think it not much to purchaſe their love,
in order to their Salvation, with the loſs of
your right, or with the price of much of
your worldly goods. For all men love
thoſe, or at leaſt will leſs diſlike them, that
do no hurt to any, but do good to all, or
as many as they can. To be the ſervants
of all, is the higheſt Chriſtian dignity,
and the way to winne them. 5. Take
heed of falling out, or contending with any
of them, or of giving them any harſh,
provoking words, to their faces, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
their backs. But put up any wrong
that is meerly your own, and is in your
power to forgive, for the ſake of Peace,
and your own neighbours good. 6. Be
not men of common ſpirits, or common
ſpeech, or a common converſation: but
as we muſt make a difference between you
and others in our communion and Church-adminiſtrations,
ſo let the reſt ſee that it
is not without cauſe. For if you be but
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:120705:160"/>
like other men, we ſhall ſeeme to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
in making a difference, between you and
other men. Let your Light therefore ſhine
before men to the Glory of your Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father. Let them ſee that you deſpiſe
the world, and live above it, and can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
part with it; that you can forgive
and bear a wrong; that your heart is in
Heaven, and your treaſure there; and that
you are the heires of another world: Let
all men heare and ſee by you, that you
have a higher deſigne in your eye, then
the ungodly, and that you are driving on
another trade, then the men that have
their portion in this life. Heaven is your
Reall Glory: and to be Heavenly is your
true Reputative Glory, not only in the eies
of the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, but of the common earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms
of the world. 7. Set your ſelves
in the moſt diligent and faithfull improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all your parts and Intereſts to help
on the Work of God on mens Souls.
Though you preach not, you have work
enough in your own places to do, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Preachers work. Speake to poore
people prudently, ſeaſonably, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
about the ſtate of their Souls, and
Everlaſting Life: and conſult with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
how to deale with them: Tell
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:120705:160"/>
them in what ſtate you find the people,
and take their advice in further dealing
with them. O if our neighbours would
but helpe us in private, and do their parts,
and not caſt all the burden on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
there would much more be done then is!
Nay, alas, to our grief and hindrance,
ſome of our Profeſſing people are ſo hot,
and ſelf-conceited, and proud, that unleſs
we will outrunne our own underſtandings,
and be ruled by them, and ſhut out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
that the Word of God allows us not
to ſhut out, and be Righteous overmuch,
and ſhut up the Church of Chriſt, as in
a nut-ſhell; they preſently murmure and
rebell, and ſeparate, and muſt betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvel
to a ſtricter Congregation. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of them, muſt have us caſt off Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline,
and cut up the hedge, and admit
all to the Communion and Priviledges of the
Church, and all under a blind pretenſe of
Charity; and ſome Learned Gentlemen by
words and writings, do enrage our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and ungodly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neighbours againſt us,
and make them believe, that we do them
ſome grievous wrong, becauſe we will not
indeed deceive them and undo them, and ſet
up new Church-orders (or diſorders) now
in the end of the world, ſo contrary to all
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:120705:161"/>
the ancient Canons and Orders of the
Church. I honour and deerly love the names
of many of theſe ſtudious, pious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
But ſeriouſly I muſt tell them, that
they want humility, and in their good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
do the Church a world of wrong. And
though they may be more learned even in
Theology, then we, yet it is a great matter
to have or to want experience. They have
not been ſo much in Church-adminiſtrations
as we, nor had ſo much to do with ignorant
Souls. And verily I muſt ſay againe, that
the bare Theory maketh but a bungler in this
work: I muſt much ſuſpect the Judgment of
that man in matters of Church-government,
or dealing with poor Souls, that wants expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
Let theſe Gentlemen, but turn Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
(be it known to their faces, there's
none of them too good for it, nor too great)
and let them but try our life a little while, and
I ſhall ſet more by their Judgments, then now
I do. I red many a Phyſicians writings,
before I was fit to attempt a Cure. It's a
raw deceitful kind of knowledg in theſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
affaires, that is not furthered by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as for the duty of the ignorant,
ungodly people, I ſhall ſay little of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I ſuppoſe they are not like to read or
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:120705:161"/>
regard what I ſay. Only in general, it is
their firſt duty, to become truly godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and ſo to live in communion with the
Church. But upon ſuppoſition that they will
not yet be ſuch, their next choice ſhould be
to live in quiet ſubmiſſion to their Teachers,
and patiently ſtay among the <hi>Catechumens,</hi>
and <hi>Expectants,</hi> till they are fit for a higher
place and Priviledges. And with the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs
of this motion, and how it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
to their good, we ſhould labour to
acquaint them, and make them ſenſible of
it, that they may be patient in their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. OUr laſt work is to tell you, what is
the Magiſtrates part, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of this work. And I ſhall urge them
here to no great matters, becauſe they ſhall
not ſay, that we would either drive them in
the darke upon queſtionable things, or put
them upon that, which any reaſon can call
perſecution, or make them think, that we
can do nothing but by their ſword And
therefore whether they ſhould force people
to be Church-members, or Chriſtians, or
to come under Diſcipline, are Queſtions that
at this time I ſhall not meddle with; But

to keep in their viſible ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as Expectants, and
ſubmit to that Inſtruction
of their Teachers, which is
neceſſary to prepare them
for the Priviledges of the
Church: and to this End
the Magiſtrate ſhould by
Laws and Proclamations,
own this Miniſterial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
Alas how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
knew they, what they
did, that have ſo long
been jealous of us, leſt we
would do too much, and
under pretence of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
enflame, or abuſe
them by ſeverity? When
as it is a work that caſteth
us on ſo much rage and
hatred, of rich and poor,
and calls for ſuch abundance of Faith and
Zeale, and diligence and ſelf-denial, when
we have ſo little, and are commonly like other
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:120705:162"/>
men addicted too much to man-pleaſing, and
to ſave our ſelves, that if we had all the help
that Magiſtrates can give us, it's ten to one
but we ſhould leve the moſt of this work
undone. Preaching is a very cheap and eaſy
work, in compariſon of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They have taken great pains to ſtop
poor, lazy, ſhort-winded men from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the ſteepeſt hill, and carrying the
heavieſt burden, and paſſing through the
greateſt ſufferings, that in thoſe proſperous
times we can expect. And indeed I know it
to be true, that for all the countenance of
Authority, he that will faithfully execute
the Paſtoral Overſight and Diſcipline, ſhall
live a perſecuted life, which by meer Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he might avoid.</p>
               <p>Therefore the chief Governours of the
Nation ought to make Laws, and cauſe them
to be executed, for the conſtraining of the
groſly Ignorant and ungodly, to heare the
Word preached publikly, and to ſubmit to
be privately Catechiſed, and Inſtructed by the
Miniſters: and to command them patiently
to waite, as learners in this Condition, till
they are fit to be Approved members of the
Church. Theſe carnal people look more at
the ſword, and will of the Magiſtrate, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, then others do; becauſe
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:120705:163"/>
they underſtand no other argument, and can
favour nothing but the things of the fleſh.
Did but the Rulers of the Nation heare how
they daily enquire what Religion ſhall be
owned and ſetled by them, they would ſure
think it their duty, to lend them a little more
of their help. We deſire you not to drive
them to Chriſtianity, nor to Sacraments,
or Church-Communion: only drive them
to heare, and learne, and be inſtructed, that
the Light of Truth may do the reſt. Surely
none can reaſonably ſuſpect, that this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Liberty of their Conſciences, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the ſlavery of Satan be their Liberty:
and it be their Liberty to be free from Chriſt,
and Righteouſneſs, and Heaven. It's hard
to believe that Governour to be a Chriſtian,
that will not do this much to help his Subjects
to be Chriſtians.</p>

conſtraine ſuch <hi>People</hi> to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
ſo ſhould he conſtraine the <hi>Miniſters</hi>
to <hi>Inſtruct</hi> them, both by publike preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and by private conference and Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
if they be able: and if through the

able to perform it, there ſhould be ſo many
maintained proportionably, to the number
and neceſſities of Souls, as may be able.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:120705:163"/>
The Reaſon why Miniſters themſelves ſhould
be compelled by Penalties are, 1. Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome are ſo dull, that they need the
ſpur. 2. Becauſe our performances will be
the leſs reſiſted by the people, when they
know we are forced by the Magiſtrate. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Magiſtrates Judgment puts much
authority and honour on the work, in the
peoples eies: compel us therefore, as well as
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. The Magiſtrate ſhould alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a penalty upon all that undertake to be
Paſtours of a Church, and adminiſter the
Lords Supper, and yet will not make any
neceſſary Tryal of the Knowledg, Faith, and
Lives of thoſe, to whom they do adminiſter it,
nor exerciſe any Church Diſcipline on the
ſcandalous; but utterly neglect that Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
and Church-Government, which is as
much a part of the Paſtoral work, as publike
preaching is. They that will undertake to
be Paſtours, and meddle with Sacraments,
muſt be compelled to do the work of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours,
and to diſpence the Sacraments in a
tollerable order. Though yet we are not
for compulſion in any doubtfull points, of
leſſer moment, where a difference among
the Godly may be tollerated: But that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
ſhould act as no Paſtours, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:120705:164"/>
of the Churches be as no Rectors, and
ſhould cheriſh all ignorance, infidelity, and
impiety, and profane Gods Ordinances,
and ſubvert the Communion of Saints, and
lay the Garden of Chriſt open to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wilderneſs, and thereby make all ſeeme
ſingular to the people, that will not do as
wickedly as theſe; this is not to be tolerated;
but the Commiſſioners for ejecting ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Miniſters, with the advice of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
ſhould have power to correct them,
and in caſe of obſtinate unreformedneſs to
eject them: Not to ſilence them from
preaching to the Catechumens or any; but
to prohibite them from the actions proper to
Church Rulers or Paſtours, till they will
performe them more agreeably to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Rule.</p>
               <p>And this compulſion alſo of the Miniſters,
we deſire eſpecially for the peoples ſake, who
we are content ſhould be excuſed themſelves
from any ſuch penal Laws, to reſtraine them
from Sacraments; but when they know that
Miniſters are under ſuch penalties, they will
beare it at their hands, and take it the better,
when we deale with them, as the Word of
God requireth. I heare it with my eares,
to the grief of my heart, how ſome of my
neighbour Miniſters are ſpoken againſt, with
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:120705:164"/>
bitterneſs by their people, becauſe they give
not the Lords Supper to all, even to the moſt
ignorant and ungodly, that refuſe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed;
or ſo much as to take themſelves
for any members of the Miniſters charge:
And that which they ſay is, that <hi>though Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Common Prayer be taken down, yet
the giving of the Sacrament to all the Pariſh,
is not taken down.</hi> And they that now ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſo quietly to the diſuſing of many other
things, becauſe Miniſters are puniſhable if
they uſe them, would alſo do the like in this
caſe. And yet if you are jealous, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
will go as far on the other hand, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
the people that are not to be refuſed,
(though with one of an hundred, there's
little feare of that) we are contented that you
looke to us alſo in this: To which end theſe
two things will be ſufficient. 1. Let the
Magiſtrate joyne with the Paſtours and Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
of the Church in their meetings,
where Church-affaires are tranſacted, that
he may ſee what we do. If there be no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of Peace in the Pariſh, let every Church
have a Church-Magiſtrate purpoſely choſen
by the chief Magiſtrate; or ſome Agent on
his behalf deputed hereunto. 2. And let the
Magiſtrates Agent acquaint the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
how things are tranſacted, in caſes of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:120705:165"/>
Complaint, and let them by the adviſe of the
Aſſiſtant Miniſters, correct us as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
if you ſhould imagine this to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. The Magiſtrate ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,

the Paſtours to Aſſociations and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
correſpondencies, for the more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous,
and vigorous, and effectual manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of theſe works; and for the concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Communion of Churches, and the
right underſtanding of each others affaires;
that he that hath Communion in one Church,
may by Communicatory Letters, have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in any of the reſt; and he that is caſt
or kept out of one, may not be received by
the reſt, till it be proved that he is excluded
unjuſtly. And thoſe that joyne not ſo fully
as the reſt, may yet be provoked to owne
one another, as farre as they can; that ſo we
may maintaine brotherly Love, with all that
differ from us by tollerable defferences; and
may own them as Churches, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
own their different opinions or waies;
and may have ſuch Communion with them, as
we may, and upon their Letters may admit
their members to our Communion. This
the Magiſtrate ſhould at leaſt openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke,
and encourage the Churches and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:120705:165"/>
to; ſeeing no man can doubt whether
it be for the edification of the Church.</p>

this Neceſſary work, I conceive it would be
a very ready and unqueſtionable way, for the
Magiſtrate to appoint an able, Godly, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Miniſter, to be a Viſiter in each
County, or rather in each half or quarter of

I do not move to have
men driven into our
Churches: Nor do I move
to have an unneceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
laid upon mens
tongues or pens, in caſe
of tollerable differences,
among the Servants of
Chriſt. In this caſe I only
deſire now, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Godly Brethren, would agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to meddle with their differences no
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:120705:166"/>
more then needs, and to manage their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements
with ſuch Cautions, and in ſuch
manner, and ſeaſon, and meaſure, as may
leaſt hinder their ſucceſs in the common
work, <hi>viz.</hi> the promoting of the common
Fundamental Verities, and the converting
and ſaving of the Ignorant and ungodly, and
getting down the reigning ſinnes of the
world. And then they will find, 1. That if
there by any truth in the private Opinions,
which they would propagate, it will farre
eaſier be received, when the minds of their
brethren are ſedate and peaceable, then when
they are allarmed to the conflict, by unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
preaching for the ſaid Opinions.
2. And that the Errours (of this lower na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
among Brethren) which ſome feare a
tolleration of, will ſooner die of themſelves
for want of fewel in ſuch Peaceable deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then when the bellowes of oppoſition,
contradiction, reproach, and violence are
blowing them up, and putting life continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into them. For moſt Dividers are proud
and ſelfiſh, and muſt needs be noted, for
ſomewhat extraordinary: And you take the
principal way to animate them, when you
make ſo much ado with them: Whereas a few
yeares neglect, and not obſerving them, as if
there were no ſuch men in the world, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:120705:167"/>
when they impoſe a Neceſſity on us)
would more happily extinguiſh them. I
ſpeak but what I have ſeen and tryed. This
therefore is not the matter of my preſent
requeſt, that Magiſtrates would uſe rigor and
violence with godly men, about tollerable
differences; which the Power of greater
Light and Love in the contrary minded, is
the principal means to reconcile.</p>
               <p>But the thing requeſted now of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
is, that they would keep out the
Wolves, while we are feeding the Sheep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or help us in it. That they ſuffer not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deceivers, or any that plainly go about
to ſubvert mens Souls, or the ſtate of the
Church, to fall in with our Ignorant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
people, in the time of their Learning
and Expectancy. And as I ſhall be ready
againſt any Libertine, Infidel, or Papiſt in
the world, to prove this to be in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
Power, and his flat duty (of which
I hope no ſober Chriſtian doubteth) ſo I
ſhall here lay before the Magiſtrate, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that ſhall evince the need of his help,
in the preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. The people that we now ſpeak
of, are ſo utterly ignorant, that it's eaſy
to deceive them. It's no diſhonour to Truth,
that a foole, or a child my be deluded: but
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:120705:167"/>
ſuch are not to be left to the malice and craft
of jugling enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. So wicked are the hearts of
thoſe, that we now ſpeak of (or many of
them) that they are prepared for <hi>Deceit,</hi>
and willing of it <hi>Materially,</hi> though not <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi>
as ſuch. It's eaſy drawing men from
that which they hate, or their hearts are
bent againſt, and to that which they Love,
and their hearts are ſet upon. Such gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will ſoon take fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. Our people by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned
work of Reformation, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
be caſt into <hi>Diſcontents:</hi> They
will be ſorely diſpleaſed with their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
which is a ſmall matter, were it not
that it hindreth their own Salvation. They
have ſo long been uſed to have their own will,
and to be admitted even in Heatheniſh Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Impiety to the Communion of the
Saints, and all the outward Priviledges,
without any conſiderable exerciſe of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
over them, that now it will be a ſtrange
provoking thing to them, when their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
ſhall be altered. So that in the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and hatred of their minds, if Infidels,
or Papiſts, or any ſuch Malignant adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ſhall come among them, their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
and diſcontent, will drive them by
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:120705:168"/>
multitudes into their nets; and they will
turn to the firſt that comes with any plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
though pernicious doctrine. With half
an eie we may eaſily ſee this: And therefore,
if the Magiſtrate will not help us to quiet and
ſecure the people, and keep off deceivers,
while we are Catechiſing, and Inſtructing,
and Preparing the groſly Ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
it will be to the hazard of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ſouls, and a temptation to many faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
Miniſters, againe to caſt open the
hedge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lay the Churches Communion
common, for feare of the ill conſequence,
that will follow to the people by diſpleaſing
them.</p>
               <p>And yet I may well conclude, that though
ſtill the Church will have need of ſome of the
Magiſtrates help in this ſame way, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo much hereafter, as at firſt. 1 It is <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi>
that moſt holdeth the people now, and
enrageth them againſt the breakers of it. And
when once the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is broken and turned,
they will be much more quiet. 2. We now
find the Churches in the rubbiſh, and have
the harſheſt work at firſt to do, which will
ſoone be over, and the Churches and minds
of men more ſetled. 3. A few yeares Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of Confirmation, in the foredeſcribed
way, I hope will introduce ſuch abundance
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:120705:168"/>
of Knowledg, and ſo increaſe the face of
Godlineſs, that we ſhall have little need of
the Magiſtrates helpe, in this kind as now
we have. But now at firſt our Neceſſity is
very great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4. Moreover, our Doctrine and
Practice is moſt contrary to mens ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and carnall Intereſt, and therefore though it
be <hi>True,</hi> yet it is <hi>Provoking,</hi> and ſeemeth
to be againſt them; as blood letting, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
and bitter medicines to a Child, or
a fooliſh Patient. And therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if tolerated Seducers can draw them
from it, by ſence or non-ſence, in ſuch a
caſe. A little Reaſon ſeemes to take men
off from that, which ſeemes againſt them, or
which they hate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 5. On the contrary, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Practice of Deceivers, is ſuited
to their nature, and purpoſely ſugered for
them by Art. For Inſtance: If Papiſts fall
in with them in the depth of their diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and firſt raile at us as no Miniſters,
but Lyars and Hereticks; and then revile
us for receiving maintenance (which is their
way, though their Clergie receive ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
much more) and then tell them
of all their Anceſtours, and then ſet them
upon an eaſy, outſide Piety, which <hi>ex opere
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:120705:169"/>
operato,</hi> will certainly conferre grace, and
ſhall take up at the ſtricteſt with an Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
Confeſſion, inſtead of neceſſary humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and true Church-Diſcipline; and ſhall
make thoſe veniall, and improper ſinnes,
which we make damnable; and ſhall ſend
many but to Purgrtory, that according to
Scripture, we ſend to Hell. In a word, when
they ſhall comply with carnal hearts and
Intereſts, but as much, as <hi>Montalte</hi> the <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenian</hi>
ſheweth us, that the Jeſuites do;
what wonder if our Ignorant, diſcontented
people, do greedily ſwallow ſuch baits as
theſe, and turn to ſuch a kind of Religiouſneſs?
And this makes the Jeſuites glad of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and ſtand by us as the Crows by
Sheep, that they may have our leavings,
or all that we cut off: For it's <hi>Number</hi> that
they regard; and if they will but believe in
the Pope, they ſhall be welcom to them;
yea, be Catholikes and be ſaved, though
they believe not in Chriſt and the Holy
Ghoſt, nor know not what Chriſtianity is.
He that thinks I wrong them: 1. Let them
look on millions, and

induſtrious, and have many advantages of
us from without. In moſt Churches they
will meet, though with Godly, yet with
young, unexperienced Diſputers; becauſe
our Miniſtery is but Reviving, and the
young ones muſt have time to grow. And
the Jeſuites, Fryars and other Miſſioners,
have a Pope and Cardinals, and Biſhops, and
Princes, and Lords, and Revenews, and
wealth, and Seminaries, and trayned Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in abundance, at their backs beyond.
Sea, to furniſh them with continual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
And how eager and buſy they are,
the Chriſtian world hath had long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
ſo that if ſuch be let looſe on Ignorant
Souls, what wonder if they prevaile?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 7. And for the Event, if the
Magiſtrates ſhall refuſe us this Reaſonable and
unqueſtionably lawfull aide, it may be the
means of the damnation of many thouſand
Souls. I ſuppoſe I ſpeak to Chriſtians, that
believe that ſinne is the poyſon of the Soul,
and believe that Faith in Chriſt is neceſſary,
and that there is a Heaven and a Hell: And
if ſo, they muſt needs underſtand, what it
is, to ſuffer men to draw their Subjects
from Chriſt, from Scripture, from the
meanes of Grace, and a Holy Life; and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:120705:170"/>
to draw them into ſinne: that this is but to
give men leave to do their worſt, to undo
and damne as many as they can; and to take
them at the greateſt vantage in their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and diſcontent to trip up their heels,
and tiſe them into Hell. How dreadfull a
thing is this to a Magiſtrate, once to think
of, that hath but any belief of Scripture,
and pitty on the Souls of men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(as long as we do not now call upon
them, ſo much as to force Papiſts, or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
either to be of our Religion, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that they are ſo, or joyne in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with us, but only deſire, that they may
keep their venom to themſelves, and may
not be ſuffered to take the advantage of our
peoples Ignorance and Diſcontent) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the Rulers that are friends to
Chriſt, and the Souls of men, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
find in their hearts, to deny this aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 8. And if they ſhould deny it, in
Reaſon they muſt needs ſee, that they will
fully give up the Churches of Chriſt, that
are under their government, to diſtraction
and confuſion. They know well enough
wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t would come of it, if every man have
but liberty to perſwade their Armies into
Mutinies and Rebellion; or to perſwade the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:120705:170"/>
Subjects againſt themſelves, that Rule them;
or to entice mens Children, or ſervants to
lewdneſs, or their wives to unchaſtity. And
will they, under pretence of Mercy or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
permit men to do that againſt Chriſt,
and the Church, and the Souls of many that
are bad enough already, which they would
not, they durſt not permit againſt mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
or againſt themſelves, or againſt the

               <p>And what a diſhonour will it be to Chriſt,
to the Church, and Reformation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and what a joy to all the Enemies of
theſe, to ſee that our Reformation ſhall breed
ſuch Confuſion, and bring upon us ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies?
And all becauſe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
ſhall refuſe his help.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 9. And perhaps, the Magiſtrates
will quickly find, that the Diſtractions of
the Church will breed, and feed ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
in the Common-wealth, as may
make them wiſh they had quenched the fire,
while it was yet quenchable. Our Unity
is not only <hi>Our</hi> ſtrength, but <hi>their</hi> ſtrength,
eſpecially if they promote it. Our Diviſions
weaken us as well as them. What will the
Magiſtrate do, if he help us not in this
caſe? Miniſters cannot in Conſcience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
forbeare their Duty, but will ſet about

it? Either the Rulers will <hi>ſuffer</hi> us to do it,
<hi>or not:</hi> If they <hi>ſuffer us and aſſiſt us,</hi> it will

as is now deſired, we ſhall exaſperate ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

provoketh them, and ſo the people will be ſtill
in Diſcontents, and prepared for Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or any violent change. And the fire
that begun in the Church, if it be let alone,
may reach the Court. But if to mend this,
they will <hi>put down or hinder Miniſters,</hi> their

and to be Guilty of the fruſtrating of much

and many others are afraid, leſt by
going too far in ſuch aſſiſtance, they may
be guilty of Perſecution, by reſtraining
men from Preaching, or private peſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

theſe following things, for ſuch a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of their granted Liberty, as may
free them from all danger of perſecuting,
without depriving us of their principall

1. If you compel not the Ignorant and
ungodly to heare, and be peſonally Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
by the Miniſter of the Pariſh where
they live, yet at leaſt compel them thus to
ſubmit to ſome Miniſter: and let that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
certifie under his hand, that he takes
care of him as a Catechumene, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectant,
by publike and private Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let not every man that will, be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
either to Teach, perſwade, or hold
Aſſemblies; but let your Toleration be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated,
as well as your Approbation is.
To which end 1. Let ſuch perſons as are
thought meet for ſuch a worke, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
as Comiſſioners, to Approve, or

the Land, as the Commiſſioners now Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

the Tollerated ſhould not go under Tryal,
as well as the Allowed. And indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome ſuch courſe to keep the Doore
of Toleration, as well as the doore of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Allowed Teachers, you cannot put any
reaſonable Laws for Toleration in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but any will come in, what ever
your Law ſay. 2. Let theſe Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
for Trying the Tolerated, have Rules

3. Let all that will gather Aſſemblies, or

an Inſtrument of Toleration, under the
hands and ſeale of theſe Commiſſioners, and
let them be hindered, that have no ſuch
Inſtrument. Otherwiſe if you ſtay till they
are convict of Blaſphemie, they may do
more miſchief firſt, (for who will perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

that I have here propoſed, and as

on by all the Parties before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I am yet far from expecting, that all
men ſhould acknowledg it and obey it; or
that no perſon of contrary apprehenſions
or intentions, ſhould riſe up againſt it as an
enemy, with all the ſtrength that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of his wit and paſſions can prepare. We
cannot ſpeak for God himſelf, for Chriſt,
for Scripture, for mens own Salvation, but
we meet with contradiction and reſiſtance,
even from them that we would ſave. And
were it not for this, what bleſſed work
would the Goſpel make? and why might we

ungratefull, and ſtrenuouſly vindicate the

not that the Church hath many, very many

cauſe and do his work, and reſiſt and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
that which would diſpleaſe him; and
all this under pretence of enmity to Satan,
and friendſhip to Chriſt, and a better doing
of his work. As the names of the chiefeſt of
Chriſt Servants, were not caſt out as Holy,
but as evil, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 22. So their Doctrine
was not caſt out as <hi>Truth,</hi> nor as <hi>Saving,</hi>

might know, that it is proper to none of

them, which is common to them all. If it
be Prelacie, how comes it to be found with
Independants? If it be Independancy, how
comes it to be approved by Prelates, and
Presbyterians? Is it not rather like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
it ſelf, and the Truths and Duties
which we commonly own; and therefore
not to be appropriated to any.</p>
            <p>By all that I have heard and read of late,
concerning this Subject, I underſtand that
the principal Objections that are likely to be
uſed againſt the Doctrine of this Treatiſe, are
theſe following.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>We were all Baptized in our Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and therefore are Church-members, and
have Right to the Priviledges of the Adult,
when we are Adult, without any new Title or
Condition: Our firſt Right continueth, though
we never make Profeſſion of the Chriſtian
Faith, nor perſonally renewed the Covenant
with God that we made in Baptiſm. And
therefore though in ſome caſes, ſuch an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Profeſſion be a duty, yet is not any more
Neceſſary to our Church-ſtate, and Right to
the Communion of the Adult, then that we
were borne Church-members, and ſo Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
Nothing but Hereſie, Schiſme, or
Apoſtacie can cut us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ff. And therefore all
that were Baptized, and are not thus cut off,
<pb facs="tcp:120705:176"/>
are ſtill Church-members, and have Right to
all the Ordinances in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I have ſaid enough to this alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſatisfie the conſiderate impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
proving the Neceſſity of a perſonall
Faith before God, and of ſome Profeſſion
of it <hi>Eccleſia Judice,</hi> before the Church, to the
Being of the ſaid Title of the Adult, as its
Condition: and that all Scripture-Examples
do make for the Confirmation of this Truth.
Moreover let me adde, to anſwer the new,
or foreſeen aſſaults,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If there be no word of Promiſe in the
Scripture, that giveth the Priviledge of
Adult-Communion to any, upon their Infant
title-condition only, nor any example in the
Goſpel, or the ancient Church, that any
poſſeſſed or uſed that Priviledg upon that
Title-condition only, then are we not to
imagine that the Infant Title-condition alone,
is ſufficient to the ſaid Priviledge: But the
Antecedent is true; as hath in part been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted,
and will be more, when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter
ſhall bring forth his pretended Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
by which his Title ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Title-condition of Infants is not
ſufficient to make any morally capable of the
<hi>Ends</hi> of Adult. Communion: therefore it is
<pb facs="tcp:120705:176"/>
not ſufficient to make them capable of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
plenary Right to ſuch Communion.
For the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Relation</hi> are for theſe <hi>Ends;</hi>
if a natural incapacity may conſiſt with a Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Title, ſo cannot a Moral. No man
can really poſſeſs and exerciſe the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Adult intrinſically without Faith,
or extrinſecall without Profeſſion of Faith:
therefore no man without Faith or Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Faith, can have a plenary Right to
that Communion. For a man to have a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Right to praiſe God, and celeberate
with the Church the memorial of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and participate of the Redeemer,
and his Benefits, that believeth not in him,
is a palpable abſurdity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the meer Title-Condition of Infants
will ſerve <hi>in foro Eccleſiae,</hi> for the Adult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then it will ſerve alſo <hi>in foro Dei:</hi> For the
Church looks but to the outward appearance,
or viſibility of that, whoſe Reality and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
God expecteth. And it is Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
that giveth us our Right: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the Churh fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> us to have true Right,
it muſt find us receiving it from Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
and therefore find us the heires of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe: The Reaſon why the Church
takes our Birth Priviledges for a ſufficient
Title-Condition, is becauſe God is ſuppoſed
<pb facs="tcp:120705:177"/>
ſo to take it. But that this will not ſerve the
Adult <hi>in foro Dei</hi> is manifeſt; becauſe
God will not own ſuch Infidels, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have Faith, nor a Profeſſion of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the litle-Condition of Infidels may
ſerve them when Adult, then is there no
perſonal difference in acts, or qualities; no
not ſo much as in Profeſſion, required on
our part, to diſtinguiſh Chriſtians from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
and Ath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſts: (<hi>required</hi> I mean as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Conditions) But the Conſequent is
abſurd: therefore ſo is the Antecedent. If
no di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ferencing character between Actual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
and Infidels or Atheiſts, be made
thus neceſſary, then the Church and the
Infidel world, are laid together; and
the Body of Chriſt, and conſequently Chriſt
himſelf is diſhonoured, and blaſpheamed, as
common and uncleane. But if any perſonal
difference be neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry, it muſt be the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, or nothing
leſſe then this can be it. For our Birth-Priviledge
cannot be it. Atheiſts and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
are borne of Chriſtian Parents. Much of
the Turkiſh Army of <hi>Jani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aries,</hi> have their
Birth-Priviledges to ſhew, as well as we It
is a probable Argument: <hi>Such an Infant is
horne of Chriſtian Parents: therefore he will
be an Actual Believer.</hi> But it is not a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:120705:177"/>
Argument, <hi>Such a man at age, that
profeſſeth not Chriſtianity, had Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
therefore he is a believer:</hi> much leſs;
<hi>therefore he had Right to the Benefits of the
Covenant, whether he be an Actual Believer
or not.</hi> If Chriſtians have no viſible note,
by which they muſt be known from Infidels,
then either the Church is not Viſible, or
Infidels may be the Viſible Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſo much as diſowning their Infidelity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the Title-Condition of Infants may
ſuffice the Adult for Church-Right and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
then Hereticks and Apoſtates have
ſuch Right: But the Conſequent is denyed
by them that I now diſpute with. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that Hereſie and ſome Schiſm, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie,
do cut off from the Church, and ſo
from this Right. But it's plaine that ſuch
Hereticks and Apoſtates have that which was
their Infant-Condition: as they were the
ſeed of Believers in Infancy, ſo they are
ſince Apoſtacy: They ceaſe not to be the
ſeed of Believers, by their renouncing
Chriſt. If this therefore would prove a
Right in <hi>ſilent</hi> Infidels, it will prove a Right
in <hi>profeſt</hi> Apoſtates.</p>

               </gap>t, then they cannot caſt it away.
They may refuſe to uſe their Right, but they
cannot caſt it away, or nullifie it: For they
cannot make themſelves not to be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Chriſtian Parents. The foundation
ſtands whether they will or no: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo muſt the Relation. But if the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

ordinarily as we have now in queſtion, are
<hi>actual Apoſtates,</hi> and are ſo to be taken by
the Church; and therefore not to be taken
as Church-members, having Right to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.
He that being engaged to God
the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt in his

<pb facs="tcp:120705:178"/>
Such alſo as have their tongues cut out, are
ſeparated from Humane ſociety, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
diſabled from Profeſſion. But for the
common caſe of mankind. 1. It is plaine that
they have their tongues given them by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of expreſs their minds; and 2. That
Chriſt commandeth Confeſſion with the
tongue, and profeſſing him before men.
3. That much of his Worſhip lieth in holy
Profeſſion, and all of it containeth anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Profeſſion. 4. That we have conſtant
calls from God, even to profeſs our
Chriſtianity: the godly and the wicked that
live among us call us to it: we have daily
invitations to profeſs out Chriſtianity one
way or other. And among all theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Profeſſion, he that Profeſſeth not,
is to be taken for an Infidel and Apoſtate.
For the buſineſs is ſo exceeding great and
weighty, and the Object ſo glorious, and
the duty ſo incumbent, and the very Life of
Chriſtianity ſo inconſiſtent with a non-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
that we have juſt reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that he that Profeſſeth not himſelf a
Chriſtian, ordinarily is to be taken for none
by the Church.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But though at the firſt admitting
of a forraIner into a Common-wealth, you
require an Oath of fidelity, or Profeſſion of

we muſt be ſuppoſed to continue ſuch, till we

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The caſe doth exceedingly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from ours in hand. Princes vary their
Commands as their affaires require. If you
are borne in the midſt of a peaceable Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
you may perhaps have no Oath of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
impoſed, becauſe the Peace of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom-wealth
requireth it not: For while
there is no enemy neer you, to ſolicite you
to rebellion or treaſon, or with whom you
may conjoyn, it is ſuppoſed, that you have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
no mind, or no power to it. And it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the common peace that is concerned in the
cauſe. But our caſe is otherwiſe: For we
live among Devils and wicked men, and are
known to have hearts our ſelves, that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
treacherous, and at enmity to God.
So that we are ſtill among enemies, that
would ſeduce us, and with whom we are
enclined to take part. And beſides that, our
Profeſſion is not only neceſſary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſafety, but to our perſonal performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and daily Communion with the Saints,
and worſhip of God. 2. If it be in a Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that's neer the enemy, or in a Country
that is inclined to Rebellion, or where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
<pb facs="tcp:120705:179"/>
is on foot, and the enemy hat a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
there Princes uſe to cauſe all their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to take an Oath of fidelity; and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
alſo in peaceable Kingdoms this is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed:
At ſuch an age all perſons are to take
an Oath of Allegiance, or fidelity, or to
make Profeſſion of their ſubjection, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places: and in other places they do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they enter upon any Office. And if you
will come neerer the caſe, and ſuppoſe that
men were borne in a Schoole, or an Army,
as well as a Republike, I think you would
yield, that when they come to age, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that they have more then their Birth-Priviledg
to ſhew, to prove them Schollars,
or Soldiers. We are Chriſts Diſciples and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
as well as his Subjects; and one is as
eſſential to our Chriſtianity as the other. We
may be initiated into his School and Army in
our Infancy, and ſo ſtand Related to him:
But ſure we are Apoſtates, if when we come to
age, we have nothing to ſhew but our meer
Infant-Condition; and to more we muſt be
called. 3. The caſe alſo differeth in this:
Princes do make known to all in their Laws,
that no man that is an enemy, yea or that is
not (<hi>pro tempore</hi>) a Subject, ſhall dwell on
their Soile, among their Subjects: They
ſuffer not Subjects and Enemies to live pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly

they live in obedience to the Laws, and hold
their eſtates by them. But Chriſt dealeth not
thus: He ſuffereth Believers and Infidels to
live together, and his flock to be but little in
the world; ſo that it cannot be the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
that a man is a Chriſtian, becauſe he
liveth among Chriſtians. 4. At leaſt let us
not teach Chriſt, what he ſhould have done,
when we find he hath done otherwiſe; we
find that he requireth perſonall Faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of all at age, that are naturally capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and therefore we muſt perform it, and
not give reaſons why we ſhould not do it.

            <p>So that I may conclude, that an Adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Chriſtian, notwithſtanding his birth privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges:
and therefore not a viſible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member;
and therefore an Apoſtate, ſeeing
he was once engaged in Covenant to Chriſt,
(though not an Apoſtate from actuall Faith)
and therefore ſuch as hath no proper right to

Church-communion and priviledges.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>If his Infant Title be cut off, it is
either by Ignorance, Wickedneſſe, Hereſie, or
Schiſm, or Apoſtacie: but ignorance and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
do not cut him off; and Hereſie, Schiſm,
or Apoſtacie he is not guilty of; therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. His Infant Title will ceaſe of it
ſelf without any other cutting off, if it be
not continued by his perſonall actuall believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when he comes to capable age. His birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledges
alone, or his <hi>Parents</hi> dedicating
him to God in Baptiſm, will ſerve no longer
of it ſelf. It is therefore for want of <hi>Perſonal
Faith Coram Deo,</hi> and of the profeſſion of
Faith <hi>Coram eccleſiâ,</hi> that his right doth ceaſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Ignorance, where it proveth Infidelity,
muſt needs prove a Ceſſation of the Infant
Title, when they come to a capable age, and
ignorance is privative. He that knoweth not,
that there is a God, a Chriſt, or what he hath
done for us, or what a Chriſtian is, can have
no Faith in God, or Chriſt; and therefore is
an Atheiſt, and an Infidell privatively, if at a
capable age, among meanes at leaſt. It is not
only he that denyeth Chriſt, that is an Infidell,
but he that never heard of him, Negatively
at leaſt; and he that having heard of him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
not what he heard, and therefore
believeth not in him, becauſe he knoweth not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:120705:181"/>
And it is not only he that denyeth God, that
is an Atheiſt, but he that knoweth not that
there is a God. And therefore if ingorance
cut not off, then Infidelity and Atheiſm cut not
off. And if neither of theſe cut off, then no
particular Hereſie can: nor any ſuch Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie,
as men are capable of, that had but an
Infant Church-ſtate: groſs ignorance at a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
age, proveth groſs ungodlineſſe, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie.
For if mens hearts had been towards
God, they would have ſought to know him,
and if they know him not, their hearts are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſticall,
and without him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wickedneſs is either ſuch as may conſiſt
with habituall adhering to God in Chriſt; or
ſuch as ſhews a ſeparation or renunciation; the
one being ungodlineſs partiall, and <hi>quoad
actum particularem,</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi>'s deniall) and
the other being <hi>ungodlineſſe quoad ſtatum.</hi>
He that ſaith the former cutteth not off from
the Church, will ſcarcely ſay, that it doth
not meritoriouſly ſuſpend the Offender from
the Communion of the Church, till he appear
penitent. And he that ſaith the latter cuts not
off, from the Church meritoriouſly, muſt
ſay that nothing doth it. For this is Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie,
and comprehendeth the greateſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
Such Hereticks, hold that the pleaſure of
ſin for a ſeaſon, is to be choſen before a life
<pb facs="tcp:120705:181"/>
of Holineſs with the Hopes of Everlaſting life;
and the fleſh to be pleaſed before the Lord:
And I think this is Hereſie. But whether
theſe be cut off from the Church or not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they bring the perſon under the guilt of
excommunication, or elſe there is no excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
to be uſed. And if they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
we ſhall not much contend
with you about their rights. As long as you
grant that they have no ſuch right as that they
may have the uſe of Church communion, we
are ſatisfied. And yet I muſt ſay, that it is
a blind concluſion, that the excommunicate
are Church-members, without diſtinguiſhing
of excommunication. If a man ſhall openly
declare that he believeth not in Jeſus Chriſt
that dyed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor that there is any
life to come; but yet he believeth in a Chriſt
within him, and a Heaven and Hell within
men; (as the Ranters, Familiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did)
and yet this man, that he may pervert the
ſouls of others, will hold communion with the
Church, and declare, that he takes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in his ſenſe, I doubt not but this man,
though a profeſſed Infidell and Apoſtate, is
yet to be excommunicated, while he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to Communion; and if this excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
man be not out of the Catholike Church,
then no man is out of it, and you may next
<pb facs="tcp:120705:182"/>
queſtion whether the Devill be not a Member,
that believeth much more then he.</p>
            <p>But when I ſay that Infidelity, Impiety,
Hereſie, do cut off or caſt out, I meane it but
<hi>Meritoriouſly.</hi> Either theſe crimes are <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

But the Conſequent is falſe: therefore ſo

is, becauſe though the benefits be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
yet the Covenant and Conditions are
the ſame, by which we have right to one and
to the other. It is the Appearance of the

give Title, <hi>Coram eccleſiâ,</hi> whoſe inward ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
giveth right <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> (as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid)
And God giveth Title to all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of the Covenant, <hi>Coram Deo</hi> on the
ſame conditions. And there is alſo a parity
of reaſon. For if it be enough to prove our
right to Adult Communion (to praiſe God,
and have all his Ordinances and helps in the
Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that we had Chriſtian Parents,
then muſt it be enough to prove our Title in
<pb facs="tcp:120705:184"/>
all the reſt of our benefits. The ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

And if the ſame Covenant give both on the

cuts not off. But ignorance

If you chooſe to ſay, <hi>it cuts not off,</hi>
I eaſily can prove, that it <hi>manifeſteth</hi> that he

               </gap>ame, when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to anſwer it? A
Negative Faith, in eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
is Infidelity, or not
believing. Is not this a
deluſory teaching of the
Church, to call unbelief
by the name of Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Faith, or Negative
Conſent? If a block, a
bruit, or a Subject other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Naturally uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
be the Subject; then
indeed it is inculpable, and
your Negative Conſent or
Faith, is properly but a
Negative diſſent, or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
But if a capable
<pb facs="tcp:120705:189"/>
oblieged perſon be the Subject (which is our
caſe) then your Negative conſent is in engliſh
privative not conſenting, and privative unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
or rejecting Chriſt. What a meanneſs
is here to convey flat Infidels into the Church,
or continue them there, under the Cloake of
an abuſive name! even by calling a non-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
conjunct with their Infidelity, or not
conſenting to the Covenant of grace, by the
name of <hi>Negative conſent.</hi> Were it a perſon
that had entered at age, yet if he have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
but your Negative conſent, (which is
neither to conſent or diſſent) he is an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate:
And if he refuſe conſent, when called
to it, by his lawfull governours, he gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to be ſuſpected of Apoſtacie, much
more when he continueth to refuſe conſent,
when ſo much of the life and practiſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
conſiſteth in it, and in the manifeſtation
of it. But eſpecially when perſons were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in Infancy, and never yet profeſſed a
Faith or Conſent of their own. If that man
that had no Faith but his Parents, (and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Believers ſeed, which <hi>you</hi> call Faederall
Faith) ſhall be continued at age a Member of
the Church, by a not-actuall diſſenting or
renouncing Chriſt, by expreſſe words, then
lets talk no more of a Church, nor abuſe poor
Heathens and Infidels ſo much as to queſtion
<pb facs="tcp:120705:189"/>
their ſalvation, or let them below us. But
again, I anſwer you, that not conſenting, is
diſſenting in the inward act; it is undoubted,
that he that for one year, or moneth doth not
conſent, doth certainly diſſent. There's no
middle ſtate between Believers and Infidels;
Conſenters, and Refuſers. How ſhall they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
that <hi>neglect</hi> of ſo great ſalvation? Negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,
and not conſenting in a capable invited
Subject is certain Infidelity: and therefore
in the externall profeſſion, we muſt judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
He that will not confeſs Chriſt,
even in a Chriſtian Church, and a peaceable
age, deſerves not to be called a Chriſtian: He
that is not for him is againſt him.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But Gods Covenant-people under
the Law, were not only admitted without their
voluntary conſent or knowledg, but commanded
to renue their Covenant in ſuch a manner, as
that they that were abſent, and not in place to
expreſſe conſent, were included in thoſe that were
preſent.</hi>

made on Gods part as a promiſe, to
them and their poſterity, even to many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations:
But thoſe unborn generations,
were not in Covenant on their parts, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſers

            <p>Object. <hi>Wickedneſs it ſelf doth not put a

when the Church knoweth not whether

but an Excluſion from <hi>Actual</hi> Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
(called ſuſpenſion by ſome) as it

ſecond ſort muſt have an Excluſion from their
<hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church-relation, as</hi> it is a <hi>State</hi> of
Impenitency, that deſerveth it. The firſt
ſort of Excommunication, leaveth a man in

The ſecond ſort leaves him out of it, both
in <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> Not that the Excomuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
puts him out of the Church, as Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
For that he did firſt himſelf meritoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſo efficiently; even by the efficiency
of his demerits; as the Law of Chriſt did it,
by its Obligatory efficiency: But when he
hath put himſelf out of the Church inviſible,

declareth it by their <hi>Sentence,</hi> and puts him
out of the Church <hi>Viſible executively,</hi> when
he had before, put out himſelf <hi>meritoriouſly.</hi>
5. As I ſaid before, the perſons <hi>wickedneſs</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:120705:191"/>
is either <hi>Notorious</hi> and out of queſtion, (as

or daily blaſpheame God in the open ſtreets,
or Congregation, and many lower caſes) or
elſe it is <hi>Controvertible,</hi> needing proof, and
<hi>not notorious.</hi> In the latter caſe a wicked man
is not <hi>Actually</hi> caſt out of the Communion
of the Viſible Church, or cut off from it,
by his demerits, till his fault be proved, and
ſentence be paſſed. But in the former caſe
he is Excommmunicate <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> which is
more then <hi>de jure.</hi> We call him excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<hi>de jure,</hi> who <hi>ought</hi> to be excommucate<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nicate
<hi>de facto:</hi> but we call him excommuni-<hi>ipſo

by the Law, without any further ſentence
of a Judge, the Law it ſelf ſufficing to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Chriſt commanding us to avoid and have no

already.</hi>

by adding a <hi>Second Obligation</hi> to the firſt. A

Arguments againſt them that remaine unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:
But that all their Arguments, that I

for them that tell us of the Church member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Adult, conſidered without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to ſaving Grace, I ſhall regard them,
when they have proved, either that Faith and
Repentance are no ſaving Graces; or that
Profeſſion of Faith hath no Reſpect to Faith;
or that men may have Title to Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip,
without reſpect to Profeſſion of
Faith; even of their Parents, if they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants;

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſhall eaſily grant, that <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
as it is a ſolemn Reception of the
perſon by Impoſition of hands, or without
Impoſition in a purpoſed ſolemnity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
known by <hi>that name,</hi> is not of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to the Being of our memberſhip: and
<pb facs="tcp:120705:193"/>
that all thoſe that are received upon profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith may be Church-members; and
that the ordinary uſe of Chriſtian Aſſemblies,
and exerciſes of worſhip, is a <hi>Profeſſion,</hi>
though <hi>obſcure;</hi> and that a baptized perſon
that never was called to a Verball Profeſſion,
may be taken for a Chriſtian, or Church-member,
upon ſuch a <hi>Practical ſort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
joyned with a not denying of Chriſt
in word or life. But yet we are far from
thinking that the Infant-Title-condition of
ſuch a one, ſerveth to prove his preſent
Church-ſtate and Title, now he is at capable
age. The Infant-Title ceaſeth, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it not by a <hi>Perſonal Profeſſion at age.</hi>
And as there is no middle betweene Believers
and unbelievers, ſo there is no ſuch thing in
a capable ſubject, as <hi>non-diſſenting,</hi> in a
moral ſenſe, but true <hi>Conſenting.</hi> It is not
poſſible for the Soul to be neuter, when the
thing is offered to our conſent, but we muſt
either will or nill, conſent or diſſent; though
if it were, yet not willing, or not conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is Infidelity and Rebellion in ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
And accordingly we maintaine, and
<hi>muſt maintaine</hi> that <hi>Profeſſion of ſome ſort or
other</hi> is a neceſſary Condition of the Title and
Church-ſtate of the capable Adult, and of
Right to the Priviledges: And as an <hi>obſcure</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:120705:194"/>
kind of Profeſſion may ſerve (when a man is
called to no more) to prove his Right, ſo a
<hi>clearer</hi> ſort of Profeſſion is neceſſary to the
clearer proof, and <hi>ad bene eſſe Eccleſiae.</hi> And
I have ſhewed what great and weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
we have, to require an open, cleare,
intelligible Profeſſion: And he that is juſtly
called to for ſuch, giveth cauſe to the Church
to queſtion him of Apoſtacy, if he refuſe
without cauſe. So that of the three Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in queſtion, the firſt (which is our Infant-condition)
is utterly inſufficient to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Adult: and the ſecond (which is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
ſignification of our mind, by our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
practiſes) may ſerve <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> at leaſt
when no more is required: and the third
(which is an open approved Profeſſion by
word or ſubſcription) is neceſſary ordinarily
<hi>ad bene eſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus farre we are agred: But what if we
were not? Muſt we therefore refuſe to agree
in the practice of the aforeſaid Confirmation?
Will any good and peaceable man refuſe to
joyne with thoſe that think it neceſſary to
Adult Church-memberſhip? If this opinion
(of the ſaid Non-neceſſity) had been an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith, and among the neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry
<hi>Credenda</hi> of the Church, we ſhould have had
it in ſome Creed, or heard more of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb facs="tcp:120705:194"/>
of it then we have done, from the
Ancient Churches. If we meet about the
<hi>agenda</hi> in our practice, let men take head
how they divide from ſuch as differ in the
<hi>Reaſons</hi> of their Practice, till they can prove
that they deny ſome Article of the Faith,
which is of neceſſity to be believed.</p>
            <p>And as for the peoples unfitneſs, or any
diſturbance that will follow thereupon: 1. If
there be ſuch a thing, it will be much long
of the Miniſters: Let them unanimouſly agree,
and they may do well enough with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or much the better. But when Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
themſelves are the bellows of faction,
and think they can never ſufficiently vilifie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
and ſo have themſelves taught the
people to take ſuch a Practice for a <hi>Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
foppery,</hi> or <hi>formality,</hi> or for an <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
rigidity</hi> and <hi>extreamity;</hi> no wonder, if
when they come to practice their duty, they
meet with ſuch reproaches from the people, as
they have taught them. 2. But ſuppoſe that
people would diſturb us, that may in ſome
caſes excuſe us, as to the <hi>mode</hi> of Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Profeſſion: but no unfitneſs of the
people can excuſe us, as to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the
duty; the requiring and approving their
Profeſſion. We are falſe to our truſt, and
the Church of God, if to avoid diſturbance,
<pb facs="tcp:120705:195"/>
we will confound Believers and Infidels, and
deſtroy the nature of the Church and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
under pretence of the peoples
good.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But it would be your only ſure and
happy courſe to exerciſe Diſcipline upon all
that are baptized in their Infancy; whether at
age they conſent or no: And finding them in
the Church, you muſt do ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have ſaid enough to this before.
Have they that talk thus, <hi>tried</hi> this courſe, or
have they not? If they have not, we will
beare with them as well meaning men, that
talk of what they never tryed; as we would
do with a confident man, that would condemn
the actions of Souldiours and Seamen, that
himſelf was never in at warres, nor at Sea.
But if they have tryed it, what kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline
do they exerciſe? Would they make
us believe, that they are able in a Pariſh of
4000, or 5000, or 6000 Souls, to exerciſe
the Diſcipline mentioned in Scripture, and
the Canons of the Ancient Churches, and
that upon ſuch perſons, as our Pariſhes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
conſiſt of? I know they cannot do
it: I have had tryall to tell me what a man
can do. With the help of divers Miniſters,
and many hundred godly people, to watch
over others, and promote this work, I am
<pb facs="tcp:120705:195"/>
not able to do it on all this Pariſh, if I might.
There is ſo many offendours weekely to be
dealt with, and ſo much time required to
heare witneſſes, and admoniſh them, that
it's more then I could p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſibly do. How
Biſhops deale with Dioceſſes, let them ſee
themſelves. And if we could do it, yet the
people will not conſent If you ſend for them,
they will not come neer you: If you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh
them in the Congregation by name,
they will have an Action at Law againſt you,
if they can? However, you will have ſuch
a multitude enraged by the exerciſe of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
if it be faithfully (though never ſo
tenderly done) that the Church will be in a
flame, and your M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>niſtry hated, and the
people undone, as I have before declared.
So that it is but a <hi>name</hi> of Diſcipline, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of diſcipline, that this Objection
pleadeth for; or elſe it diſhonoure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h it ſelf
and the Authors.</p>
            <p>And as they do by Diſcipline, ſo they do
by Chriſtian Charity, which is a greater
thing. Of old, the Viſible members of the
Church were the Objects of brotherly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Love: And ſo as they ſeemed to them
to be Believers and penitent perſons, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
members did love all the body with
that ſpecial Love, that was the matter of
<pb facs="tcp:120705:196"/>
the new Commandment, and proved them
to be Chriſt's Diſciples. No man knew the
hearts of others, and therefore knew not
whom to Love as Chriſtians infallibly diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But the Profeſſion of Saving Faith and
Holineſs, being then (and ever) the teſt
of Adult-members, they took all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Viſible Church as credibly of the
inviſible; though with different degrees of
Credibility. And accordingly they loved
them all, with a Chriſtian ſpecial Love,
of the ſame ſpecies, though with different
degrees of that Love. Whereas this Popiſh
new found trick, of making a new common
ſort of Faith, and Viſible memberſhip,
that hath no reſpect to ſaving Faith, doth
teach all Chriſtians, to Love the members of
the Viſible Church, but with a common love;
and relieve and help them, but with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Charity. And ſo the device is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
our ſpecial Brotherly Love and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to a corner of the Viſible Church; to a
few, whom we will pleaſe to think to be
godly.</p>
            <p>I have oft marvelled in obſerving ſome
Learned Divines, that bend that way, that
they think compaſſion, and Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is on their ſide. What Charity can their
Doctrine glory of? They will be ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:120705:196"/>
to Infidels, that are uncapable of a
Church-ſtate, as to plead them into the
Church; and when they are there, they leave
them under the curſe, and in a ſtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in their own judgments; teaching us
to judge uncharitably, of the Viſible Church
in general for their ſakes; and to look on
them as without reſpect to any ſaving grace,
and ſo without any ſpecial Love. A cold
comfort I to bring them into no more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Gods Mercy, nor of our Charity;
but into much more capacity of aggravated
damnation: which they might better have
prevented by being kept in their proper ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
till they were capable of more. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
(though my belief of mens Profeſſion,
have different degrees, as I ſee in them dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
degrees of Credibility) yet I have Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritabler
thoughts of the members of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church, then theſe that make ſo low
and miſerable a deſcription of them. And
though I know that there are abundance
among them, that are Hypocrites, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified,
yet know I none but Saints and
Hypocrites, that are tolerable in the Church;
nor will I accuſe particular perſons of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
till I have cauſe. Neither in my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
or open cenſures, will I pluck up the
tares upon any ſuch terms, as will not ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:120705:197"/>
with the ſafety of the wheate, but rather let
them grow together in my eſteeme in the
Church, till the time of harveſt. And that
I may think charitably of the Church, and
walk charitably in, and towards it, therefore
I would not have it conſiſt of ſuch notorious,
ungodly, or heretical men, as are uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
objects of Chriſtian, Brotherly Love.
For Hereſie, the foreſaid learned Brother
tells us, that it cuts men off from the Church.
I ſay ſo to (meritoriouſly at leaſt) if by
Hereſie be meant the excluſion of any eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Article of the Chriſtian Faith: But <hi>pag.</hi>
199, where he ſaith, <hi>the Controverſie may
be eaſily ended, by parting ſtakes:</hi> viz. <hi>that
ſome Hereſie, which abſolutely denyeth ſome
particular fundamental truth, and taketh
up ſome one, or few ſtones thereof, is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with Church intereſt: and other Hereſie,
which raiſeth up the very foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
denying moſt, or the moſt chief, if not all
of the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
therewith.</hi> I muſt humbly, but
very confidently ſay, that this anſwer will
not ſerve the turne. If by <hi>Fundamentals,</hi>
be meant (as commonly) the Eſſential
Articles of Chriſtian Faith, then the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
denying of any one Article, doth prove
that perſon to be no Chriſtian, nor capable
<pb facs="tcp:120705:197"/>
of a Church ſtate: For the form is wanting,
where any Eſſential part is wanting. But if
any thing elſe be meant by <hi>Fundamentals,</hi>
no man can decide the Controveſie by it,
till it be known what it is: And it will be
hard to faſten it on any thing, where the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
denyal of many points ſhall unchurch,
and the abſolute denial of one or two points
of the ſame rank and kind not <hi>do it.</hi> Saith
he <hi>p. 198. The Jews held that an heretical
Iſralite, had no communion with the Church
of Iſrael: and why? but becauſe Communion
ſuppoſeth union; and union with Iſrael, or the
true Church, is loſt with Faith: They alſo
held, (as</hi> Selden <hi>noteth) that an Iſraelite
turning an Heretike</hi> i. e. <hi>denying any of the
thirteene fundamental Articles, to be as an
Heathen man.</hi> And a few lines before, he
ſaith, that <hi>hiſtorical Faith, which hath the
Doctrine of Faith for its Object, none do
doubt to be an Eſſential, requiſite to a true
Church-member.</hi> Yet that with me is a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
member, that hath not this much,
which is ſaid to be <hi>Eſſential, no man doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it.</hi> If they Profeſs true Faith, though
they are ſtark Atheiſts at the heart, and
have not ſo much as hiſtorical Faith, I ſhall
believe them, till they nullifie their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion:
But if they profeſs not alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:120705:198"/>
to have Chriſt to be their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
I ſhall not take it for a <hi>Profeſſion</hi>
of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Certain I am, that the ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
with one conſent, did look on
the baptized generally as pardoned, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
and adopted; and therefore
thought that Viſible Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
did imply a credibility (at leaſt)
of a ſtate of ſaving grace. Saith <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,

that it ſhall be uncapable of Diſcipline,
we ſhall never be able to anſwer it

or the profeſſion of a Faith that is not
ſaving, we ſhould come too neere the
making of a new Baptiſm, and Church.
And truly if we do but ſlubber over the
buſineſs, and to avoid offence or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our ſelves,<note place="margin">I am ſenſible alſo how the arguments for both extreams do either drive or draw the Reader to the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
               </note> ſhould
take up with a profeſſion
<pb facs="tcp:120705:200"/>
utterly incredible, eſpecially
in theſe times when we have
ſo much liberty and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
from the Magiſtrate,
for a fuller Reformation,
we ſhall be guilty of ſo much
injury to the Church, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
name, and our people ſouls;
as is little conſidered by many that have
their eye only on the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame,
as if there were no danger but on one
ſide.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On the other ſide, if we go ſo
rigidly and unrighteouſly to work, as
ſome men are bent to do, we may
accompliſh thoſe ends, that we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to overthrow, and fruſtrate
our own, which we think to attain. If
we will reject the Scripture-ancient-Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
or Evidence of Title to Church-priviledges,
even a <hi>credible profeſſion
of Chriſtianity,</hi> we ſhall confound our
ſelves, and trouble the Church, and
be at a loſſe for a certain Evidence, and
never know what ground to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And we ſhall injure the ſouls of
multitudes of true Believers, and keep
out thoſe, that Chriſt will entertain.
For there are no other terms, beſides
<pb facs="tcp:120705:200"/>
taking mens profeſſion by a humane
Faith, on which we can admit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
without excluding multitudes, that
ſhould not be excluded. I doubt many
Miniſters, that have had a more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
education themſelves, are not
ſufficiently ſenſible of the great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that Countrey People are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
by their want of ſuch Education.
Many that are bred where holy diſcourſe
is ſtrange, and never were uſed to
any thing of that nature, no nor
to common Urbanity of ſpeech, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
may be brought to hearty
ſorrow for ſinne, and deſires after
Chriſt and Grace, long before they can
expreſſe their knowledg, or deſires, in any
ſuch manner, as ſome men do expect. Many
gracious ſouls (as farre as I can diſcerne) I
have met with, that never were noted for
any thing extraordinary in Religion,
though they lived among ſuch. I had
rather let in many, that are unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
into the Church, then keep out
one that's a true Believer, if there be
no other remedy. The Lord Jeſus that
died for them, and ſent the Miniſtery for
them, and will at laſt admit them into
<pb facs="tcp:120705:201"/>
Heaven, will give us little thanks, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
his weakeſt Members from the
Church, and from the uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
and Communion of Saints, who
have moſt need of them, of any that
have right to them. For my part, I
deſire not, nor dare be guilty of that
way of Government in the Church,
as ſhall grieve thoſe that Chriſt would
not have grieved, and exclude the weak,
and turne or keep out the Infants in
Grace, from the Family of the Lord.
A compaſſionate Miniſter is likeſt to
Chriſt, that will not break the bruiſed
reed. How dealt he with the woman
taken in adultery? How tenderly excuſeth
he the ſluggiſhneſſe of his Diſciples, that
could not watch and pray with him one
houre, in his laſt extreamity, with <hi>the
Spirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak?</hi>
when many now that think well of themſelves
would almoſt excommunicate men for
as ſmall a fault; We know not in ſuch
caſes, what Spirit we are of.</p>
            <p>But this is not all: I muſt confeſſe
Brethren (which I beſeech you patiently
to hear) theſe three things very much
ſtick upon my thoughts. 1. I cannot
<pb facs="tcp:120705:201"/>
but obſerve, how many eminent Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of Piety have miſcarried, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
miſcarried of late, when ſome
of lower Profeſſions have ſtood faſt.
And I think God ſuffers the falls of many
of his own, to let them know the
frailty of our natures, and cauſe them
to be compaſſionate to others. And
ſome cenſorious mens hearts might ſmite
them, if they had heard from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<hi>Let him that is faultleſs, caſt the firſt
ſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And it ſticks very much upon my
thoughts, how ſmall a handfull the cenſorious
way would reduce the Catholike Church of
Chriſt to.<note place="margin">The moſt experienced holy of my flock are very tender of the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous themſelves, and would not have me to caſt them out while there appeareth any preſent hope: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the condition that once they were themſelves in, and their failings after convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them if then they had been caſt out.</note> When it is
but about the ſixth part
of the world that are at
all Baptized Chriſtians;
and ſcarce the ſixth part
of them, that are <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;</hi>
and of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
ſo few, except
in <hi>England,</hi> that are ſo
qualified for holineſs, as
in your admiſſions you
exſpect: and in <hi>England</hi>
how ſmall is the number
<pb facs="tcp:120705:202"/>
that you would admit, I am deeply afraid
leſt you hainouſly injure the Cauſe of
Chriſt, by your exceſſive rigor: and
leſt confining even the viſible Church into
ſo exceeding ſmall a compaſs, ſhould
tempt men to infidelity. For he that
to day can believe, that Chriſt died not
for one of a hundred thouſand in the
world, may to morrow believe, that he
died for none at all. I hope the little
flock of the Elect, is not ſo little, as
ſome would have the viſible Church of the
called.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are deeply ſenſible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Infidels here in <hi>England.</hi> They
are too thick about us, under ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
garbs, eſpecially under the maske of
Seekers; and are perſwading people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Chriſtian Faith, and truth of
Scripture, and the life to come: and
ſo much do theſe Apoſtates now abound,
that we have reaſon to be jealous of
them. And if any of you ſhould ſtrike
in with good men, that are of this cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
over rigorous way, conſider how
farre they may make uſe of ſuch to
accompliſh their deſigns. If by you
they can get almoſt all the world
<pb facs="tcp:120705:202"/>
un-Churched in eſtimation; and fifty for
one, if not an hundred for one in
<hi>England,</hi> actually un-Chriſtened, and
their children after them left unbaptized:
what will follow? I doubt this, if God
ſhould not ſave us from your miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
When there is but one of an
hundred in all the Land, that is a Chriſtian,
the reſt will want neither malice, nor pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to put an end here to the Chriſtian
name; or at leaſt to the liberty and
glory of Chriſtianity. They may chooſe
our Parliaments for us, and in a word,
do with us what they liſt, when they
are exaſperated to the greateſt hatred of
us; and cut off our liberties, and ſet up
Infidelity or Heatheniſm by a Law. I truſt
God will never ſuffer this: But let us take
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eed of gratifying Infidels, and caſting all
our ſafety upon miracles, leſt we be found
to be but fooliſh builders, and tempters
of God: ſtill you may find that over-doing
is the moſt effectuall undoing.
And if you would find out the moſt
dangerous enemies of the Goſpell, look
for them among thoſe, that ſeem over
zealous againſt the enemies of the Goſpell,
and ſeem to over-doe in the work of
<pb facs="tcp:120705:203"/>
the Goſpell, I deſire to bring no party<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of godly men into ſuſpicion, or odium
by this: but indeed I deſire to counter-mine
the Apoſtates; and it would be the
moſt amazing conſounding thing, that could
befall us in this world, if we ſhould ſee
the Church of God betraied into the
hands of Infidels, and the Goſpell loſt,
by the indiſcreet and inconſiderate over-doing
of thoſe well-meaning men, that
did the work of Infidels, and ungodly men
for them, while they thought that none
were ſo much againſt them. If the neck of
Religion be broken among us, I am a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fraid
the imprudent will be ſome cauſe,
that would lead us above the top of the
Ladder.</p>
            <p>Sure I am between you both, you have
the eaſieſt way to the fleſh, that run
into extreams. Durſt I caſt off Diſcipline,
and only preach, and pleaſe all the pariſh
in Sacraments and other Ordinances,
how eaſie a life ſhould I have to the
fleſh? And if I durſt take out one of
a hundred, that are eminent in Piety,
that will ſcarce ever call me to any
penall acts of Diſcipline, I ſhould have
a much more eaſie life then the former.
<pb facs="tcp:120705:203"/>
But they are both ſo eaſie, that I the
more ſuſpect them, to be the fruit of
the wiſdome of the fleſh. Indeed, both
the extreames do caſt off Diſcipline, for
the moſt part, whatever they pretend.
One ſort never meane to exerciſe it:
And the other ſort extoll it; and when
they have done, they ſeparate a few
of the beſt that are like to have no
need of the troubleſome part of it, and
ſo ſit down without the exerciſe of it;
pretending to be Phyſicians, but refuſing
to receive the ſick into their Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
Brethren, I ſpeake not as an
accuſer, but a Monitour, and ſhall

§. 41. <hi>p.</hi> 45, 46. For
Confirmation, which being ſo long and ſo
ſcandalouſly neglected in this Kingdome
(though the Rule have alſo been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
and carefull in requiring it)
will now not ſo eaſily be digeſted,
having thoſe vulgar prejudices againſt
it; yet muſt I moſt ſolemny pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
my opinion of it; That it is a
moſt ancient Chriſtian Cuſtome,
tending very much to Edification:
which I ſhall make good by giving
you this view of the manner of it. It
is this; that every Rector of any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
or Curate of charge, ſhould by
a Familiar way of Chatechizing,
inſtruct the Youth of both Sexes
within his Cure, in the Principles
of Religion, ſo farre that every one of
them before the uſuall time of coming
to the Lords-Supper, ſhould be able
to underſtand the particulars of that
vow, made in Baptiſm, for the <hi>Credenda</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:120705:204"/>
and <hi>Facienda;</hi> yea and <hi>Fugienda</hi> alſo:
what muſt be <hi>Believed,</hi> what <hi>done,</hi>
and what <hi>forſaken;</hi> and be able to
give an intelligent account of every
one of theſe: which being done, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſuch Childe ſo prepared, ought
to be brought to the <hi>B<hi rend="sup">P</hi>
               </hi> for Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
Wherein the intent is, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſuch Child, attain'd to years of
Underſtanding, ſhall ſingly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
before God, the <hi>B<hi rend="sup">P</hi>,</hi> and the
whole Congregation, with his own
conſent, take upon himſelf the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to that, which his God-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and God-Mothers in Baptiſm,
promiſed in his Name; and before all
thoſe Reverend Witneſſes, make a
Firm, Publick, Renued promiſe,
that by Gods help he will Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavour, to diſcharge that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
in every point of it, and
perſevere in it all the dayes of his
life. Which reſolution and promiſe
ſo heightned with all thoſe ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
will in any reaſon have a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:120705:205"/>
impreſsion on the Child, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on his actions for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And this being thus perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, the <hi>B<hi rend="sup">P</hi>
               </hi> ſhall ſeverally
impoſe his hands on every ſuch
Child (a ceremony uſed to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
by Chriſt himſelf) and bleſs
and pray for him, that now, that
the Temptations of ſinne begin more
ſtrongly in reſpect of his age, to
aſſault him, he may receive Grace
and Strength againſt all ſuch Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
or Aſſaults, by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
and ſpeciall aſsiſtance; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, obtained by Prayer from
God, he will never be able to do
it. This is the Sum of Confirmation;
and were it rightly obſerved (and no
man admitted to the Lords-Table, that
had not thus taken the Baptiſme-Bond
from the Sureties into his
own Name; and no man after
that, ſuffered to continue in the Church,
which brake it wilfully; but turned
out of thoſe Sacred Courts by the
<pb facs="tcp:120705:205"/>
power of the keys in Excommunication)
It would certainly prove by the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God, were it begun, a moſt
effectuall meanes to keep men (at

Enormious ſinnes; and that
the defaming and caſting out of
