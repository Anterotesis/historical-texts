            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Fra. Chadwel, <hi>that old disturber of our Assemblies, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently abuseth the Name of Christ, and whom the Truth, hath often confounded and discovered his Wickedness and Lyes:</hi>

               <hi>This is the Fruit of</hi> W.

               <p>THe first part makes a great Shew, and proclaims him an eminent Asserter of a conscientious Liberty against some great Infringement and Bondage; but he varies in his very next Words [<hi>proposed in several Queries</hi>] as if he could not write consistant Matter; for this contadicts his great Pretence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and discredits it to those that understand the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>asserting</hi> Liberty and <hi>proposing Queries,</hi> which are about the <hi>Imposition</hi> as well as <hi>Liberty:</hi> However we will take the Substance of them (insinuating Aspersions upon us) as positive as his Title; but the ground of his Queries and Charge implyed throughout them against <hi>those of the People called Quakers,</hi> is as false as is his Work inconsistent; and in order to make it so appear, Let us inquire,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> What this <hi>Imposition</hi> is in his Sence that he pretends to oppose?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly,</hi> Who <hi>those of</hi> the Pople called <hi>Quakers</hi> that have assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to impose, contratry to their former Testimonies, as he saith?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly,</hi> What this Liberty of Conscience is in the Exercise of it that he pretends to assert</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:107144:4"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To the first, This <hi>Imposition</hi> in his Sence, <hi>and an inforcing Uniformity and Unity in outward Ceremonies and Gestures, yea, and that upon Persons before they found Convictions in themselves, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by retaining and letting in the complying Hypocrite that should be cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2ly, Those of <hi>the People called Quakers</hi> thus charged, and <hi>some Persons counted famous and renowned in the Congregation at the City of</hi> London, <hi>Ancient Heads, Elders in God, &amp;c. that have reduced the People under this Yoak of Bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3ly, The <hi>Liberty of his Conscience</hi> is <hi>to keep on his Hat in the time of publick Prayer to God in our Assemblies,</hi> when owned by him (an unreverent Posture and causless Sign, as among Beleivers <note n="*" place="margin">Howbeit it hath been a Mark of our disowning the Prayers of the wicked and Unbelievers, and the same Spirit that hath led us to deny doffing our Hats to Men, or to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour proud Flesh, hath led us to doff them in Prayer to God in our Assemblies.</note> contrary to that Order and Custom in the Churches of Christ, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was at first brought forth and setled among us by his Power and in the Unity of the Spirit, and not by any Man's Imposition whatsoever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of this Man's Work against us is both groundless, and he hath stated the matter very falsly and disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously; for in the same Spirit and Power of Christ we have endeavoured to remove <hi>Joh. Perrot's Imposition</hi> (who was the great Examplar) of disorderly <hi>keeping on the Hat in time of publick Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> among us, as they may remember, he first gave the Occasion and Offence to the Church of Christ, by severely imposing it, and judging our innocent Practice (of putting of our Hat in publick Prayer) to be <hi>Accursed, Idolatrous, a Romish Tradition, and to be repented of, as his Soul had done, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby (together with his Example) some were seduced into a Party and Prejudice; this in the Name and Power of our Lord Jesus Christ we witnessed against, and that imposing exalted Spirit, as repugnant to that Unity and good Order, which in the beginning the Lord led us freely into, upon which <hi>J. P.</hi> the Imposer, being frustrated of his singular Rule and Sect-Mastership, did grant a Relaxation, leaving all <hi>to the free Spirit of God in keeping on or putting off the Hat in Prayer,</hi> contrary to his judging the latrer <hi>Idolatry, Accursed,</hi> &amp;c, But afterward his pretended Liberty of Conscience extended to this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107144:5"/>
                  <hi>that he might do that to day in Truth and Righteousness, which to morrow he might be ashamed of, or be denyed in by the same Spirit</hi> [Sordid Ranterism and Blasphemy] and after he went into <hi>Jamaica</hi> he could get <hi>into worldy pomp and preferment, put of his Hat to Men, and</hi> (in officiating the place of a Clark) <hi>most strictly tender Men Oathes,</hi> &amp;c. insomuch that some that had admired him, then were ashamed of him and his Ranterism; and some of them who for a time were drawn aside and darkned, who were of the more honest and conscientious, after some Labour of Love used (with them to convince them) came to a Sence of the Power of God, which rent the Vail, and broke their Hearts, brought them to judge that dividing Spirit, and reduced them back to their first Love and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Order; therefore his Charge of <hi>inforcing Uniformity and Unity in outward Gestures upon Men before Conviction, and so far retaining and letting in the complying Hypocrite</hi> (which he flings upon those that are accounted renowned Elders among us in the City of <hi>London</hi>) Is all of it utterly false, and also contains a slanderous Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against those that are let in and owned among us, as being <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Hypocrites,</hi> which he cannot prove, nor instance any of them that hath thus hypocritically complyed before Conviction, nor that we have Unity with such; I doubt not but many can with good Conscience testifie against him in this Matter; and he might have given a more honest Account if his Conscience were rightly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized; for hath not he himself been sought in Love and Tenderness both by perswasive Means for his Conviction with Patience and long-Suffering (by Friends that wished him well) to reduce him out of that Spirit of Prejudice and Opposition (which would cover it self with the Hat) that he might have come into the Unity of the Spirit and Society of the Lord's People? But he hath rejected Counsel, and persisted in Hardness and Wilfulness, crucified and slain the just one in himself, and become an open Enemy, having entred into <hi>Judas</hi>'s Way, both to the Grief of God's Spirit and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with whom we include his tender Wife or Mother, or those Relations, whose Respect to the Truth and People of God might have some Influence upon him, if he were not a surly, wilful and conceited Man; yet his great Pretence is for <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> but what a tender Conscience he hath we may casily judge from what follows.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:107144:5"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> In his Query, viz. <hi>Whether it hath not been experienced how difficult it is to root out such, when once they have reduced a People to this Belief, and they in the Exercise of this Authority, because the Honour of being invested in such a Capacity, doth obliege Men to secure themselves in this superior Orbe, and stirs up Men of Parts and Ambition to support such an Hirarchy, in Expectation that it will at last fall unto themselves.</hi>

                  <hi>2dly,</hi> By his insinuating against us in Print, <hi>as supporting such an Hirarchy, as usurps the Place of the Head, breaks in sunder the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Body, sets up another Head besides Christ, with</hi> Romish <hi>Positions, such kind of Apellations, Principles and Pretences, as the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>did obtain her unlimitted Power by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How now <hi>William,</hi> Is this thy tender Conscience, Moderation, Love and Charity professed towards the People of God called <hi>Quakers?</hi> O envious Man, and peevish Incendiary, who art thus revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and slandering them in the Sight of the Sun; do not these thy invective Insinuations savour of the Malice of Satan in the height? Tending to stir up Persecution to destroy and root us out (if the Lord were not a Wall about us) and to beget that Jealousie in the Powers against us that's more cruel then Death; and even at this Juncture when the Stream appears against the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>'s Hirarchy? Let the Lord and all that fear him, or are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, judge concerning thy Conscience and Charity towards us in these inveterate Suggestions; who yet knowest in thy Conscience that we deny the Pope and <hi>Rome</hi>'s Hirarchy.</p>
               <p>But though the <hi>Romish Hirarchy, usurping the Place of the Head, enforcing Men to an Uniformity before Conviction, making them Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, Arbritary Rule or Judicature, excommunicating Persons meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their tender Consciences,</hi> be all utterly denyed and detested by us: Yet in the true Church, which Christ was (and still is) the Foundation and Head of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God was known to be the God of Order and not of Confusion, and he afforded <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Governments</hi> in the Church, which could be no such Usurpation or Arbritaries as this Man falsly insinuates against the ancient Friends and Elders amongst us: There were Elders that did rule well, Overseers made by the Holy Ghost, and they had Power from God therein, to set divers things in order, and not only to exhort, perswade and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Persons among them, but also to reprove, rebuke and (in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107144:6"/>
Name and Authority of Christ) to command, charge, enjoyn (and in that Sence) to <hi>impose</hi> among themselves matters or things telating to Society and good Order in the Church (as we know no religious Society but hath a Care of its Preservation) as in the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God they saw Cause; the Churches of Christ had also Power and Authority in his Name to reject, withdraw from, exclude out of their Communion obstinate and disordily Walkers among them, and all this before <hi>Rome's</hi> usurped Hirarchy: See <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Ch.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>Ch.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 2. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19, 20. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8, 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37. <hi>Ch.</hi> 4. 17, 19. with many more.</p>
               <p>Now let us consider <hi>W. M</hi>'s <hi>tender Conscience as to the Lord his further Manifestation, &amp;c.</hi> for his <hi>wearing his Hat in time of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer,</hi> where he tells us, <hi>that we greatly err who say, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Hat is a Practice introduced, unless we can prove it is done upon a religious Account, when as in Truth it is only a Custom left which they formerly practized;</hi> this agrees with what they say in their <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Ha,</hi> p. 24. <hi>That they keep it neither off nor on upon a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Account:</hi> Then this bespeaks their meer Indifferency in the Case, if not upon a religious Account; there is no such tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science nor farther Manifestation in the matter on their parts; wherefore their Pretence of both is a meer Dissimulation and Cheat; and if then this Man's Conscience were not asleep, or much hardned, he might see it is in his Wilfulness and Opposition, that he hath persisted in such a reproved and offensive Gesture, as he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Exercise of Conscience nor Religion in: See what his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting Liberty of Conscience amounts to; he should have rather entituled his Paper [<hi>Liberty of self-Will and a perverse Spirit asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against the Unity and Order of the Church of Christ and People of God called</hi> Quakers] And how do we err in saying, their irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Posture <hi>is introduced,</hi> when it was both brought in and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed long after they accustomed the contrary in the Church?</p>
               <p>But his main Allegation is, <hi>He wants</hi> (or finds not) <hi>the Lord's Requiring for the Practice of him.</hi> How should he know his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, for that which he is prejudicially engaged against? And in such a hardned wilful State (that feels not the living Union) wherein he hath resisted the holy Spirit in his People, and quencht it in himself? and how should such a one that despises the Church of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107144:6"/>
Christ, and reviles the Lord's People (in that State) joyn with them either in the Unity or Order of Life? This Man therefore playes the hardned Hypocrite and Dissembler, while he seems to complain of <hi>being excluded out of our Communion,</hi> when he desires it not with us, having excluded himself, and odified us as grosly as he can to the World.</p>
               <p>His Complaint of <hi>Excommunication, denying him, and others, the Benefit of Marriage and Burial, having a Propriety therein, only for the Omittance of keeping of the Hat in time of Prayer,</hi> is neither fully nor truly stated; for first, we do not deny them Marriage in it self, but among us, and as being out of Unity and Charity with us (which is more then only for the said Omission) we may not in Conscience be their Witnesses.</p>
               <p>2dly, <hi>Denyal of him Burial,</hi> He hath not Cause to cast that upon us without Distinction.</p>
               <p>3dly, Yet our Friends have Reason to take Care whom they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Burial among us, to prevent Reproach, as much as in them lies.</p>
               <p>His saying, <hi>They give that Meeting this Appellation, THE BODY,</hi> is not true, but also falsly &amp; scornfully given in the <hi>Spirit of the Hat,</hi> to the Meeting in <hi>Devon-shire-House;</hi> for <hi>the Lody</hi> is but one, and hath many Members; so also is Christ, which is not made up of one particular Meeting, but of the universal Church of Christ, or general Assembly of the first-born; and the <hi>Tryal of Motions and Unity</hi> is by that Life and Spirit which searches all things, and whereby the spiritual Man judgeth all things, and not by a few <hi>that seek Preheminence,</hi> nor do such sway <hi>over us or our Body,</hi> as he falsly insinuates, who himself is one of the same Spirit.</p>
               <p>Many are filled with Prayer and Praises to the Lord <hi>in silent Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi> who notwithstanding sometimes requires some outward Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions thereof, both in Words and Gestures, and that in deep Humility of Soul, <hi>with unvailed Spirits and Heads too,</hi> which for this Man to oppose and shew a publick Sign against, is no token of Humility, but of Hardness and self-Exaltation.</p>
               <p>As for what <hi>Gestures</hi> we may use in our private Devotion and Prayer, whether <hi>walking by the Way,</hi> or on our Beds; it follows not that we must needs be in the same posture in publick Prayer in Meetings, any more then we are to follow our usual Labours or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107144:7"/>
Vocations in our publick Meetings; and we are not accountable to Apostates of the manner of our private Devotion: What we do is singly to the Lord without Respect to Spectators (none being present) but in our Assemblies, he who is the God of Order and not of Confusion, hath called us to express or shew forth <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Order,</hi> for the Sake of others, and to do <hi>all things to Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> and God's Power &amp; Presence we feel with us in what we do; but one while this Man is heaping Questions against our Practice, another while his Complaint is only about <hi>imposing Postures upon our Fellow-Members,</hi> which is false; for they give us no such Occasion, nor hath he approved himself <hi>as our Fellow-Member,</hi> who hath slighted our Testimony and Exhortation, and refused to hear the Church, being one of them that <hi>went out from us, for that they were not of us; for had they been of us, they would have continued with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To his Query,</hi> Whether the Head mentioned in Cor. 11. may not be covered with a Hat off, and uncovered with a Hat on?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Head Christ (whom he means) may; but this Man hath nor rightly considered the Apostle's Words in restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them only to that Sence of <hi>the Head,</hi> when they also relate to an outward Order or different Postures of Men and Women; see <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 13. which argue that the Women would be uncovered then, which was not comely in them as in the Men; and the men's being uncovered appears to be in Opposition to the <hi>Jews</hi> Vails and Coverings under the Law; as for the Head Christ, he ought not to be covered in the Women any more then in the Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Que.</hi> Have not some kneeled, sat, and stood in publick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. Whether a Cap is not as real a Covering to the Head as a Hat?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ. No,</hi> that it is not; but these Questions are to excuse himself, and recriminate our Friends; he states not the Ground of the Difference, which lies chiefly in that <hi>Spirit of Division and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> in himself and some others, which should it seek to make Discord and Parties, either about <hi>kneeling, Cap on, or Cap off in Prayer;</hi> the Life and Power of God in the Church would rise up in Judgment against it and the Discord-Makers; he triffles touching <hi>wearing a Cap, standing or sitting;</hi> for God allows a Conveniency, and what is expedient for the Necessity of the weak, and aged, and feeble in Body, who are not in Prejudice or Opposition in what
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107144:7"/>
they do; yet however, where the substantial part of true Worship is known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is in <hi>Spirit and Truth,</hi> with <hi>a naked, bowed and broken Heart before the Lord;</hi> there will be no Straitness nor Scruple to express it with uncovered <hi>Head and bended Knees as to the Lord,</hi> which was practiced among the Saints of old; but the Liberty we have in Christ touching these lesser matters, we are not bound to give a particular Account of to an Apostate, who with an evil Eye hath sought to spy it out, and with a prejudiced Mind heaps a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Queries to us; but for no serious or good End to be sure, having slandered and traduced us as <hi>Usurpers, Imposors, self-Seekers Romish,</hi> and what not? However God and our own Consciences bear us Witnesses, that we would not use or strain our Liberty to give either Offence or Occasion of stumbling to our weak Brethren, as false Brethren give by their fleshly Liberty of <hi>Self-Will,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Man cannot excuse himself by his pleading <hi>the Apostles for bidding to judge one another in Meats, or Drinks or Dayes;</hi> so he was so tender of offending his weak Brother about Meat, thar he would rather forbear eating Flesh, which may condemn thit man's Hardness, who would not so much as forbear his Hat a littls space in Prayer to shun such an Occasion; so little Regard hath hee either to his weak Brethren, or to the Church for their Sake; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, when abstaining from Meats came to be imposed, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle opposed it as a Doctrine of Devils, which is to our Purpose of opposing <hi>John Perrot</hi>'s Imposition about the Hat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Que.</hi> Why not in prophesying <hi>(he meanes)</hi> keep off the Hat.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Query</hi> is because men's praying or prophesying with the head covered is forbidden; wherein he seems to tell us, we fail in the latter, which, if it were so, is no ground to oppose us in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or to gain-say that part of Obedience that appears: But he is mistaken in taking the whole Course of preaching to be that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying intended, that is brought in with Praying; for <hi>all</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot be that <hi>intire</hi> or <hi>peculiar Prophecying,</hi> which where any one is immediately called to; I grant, that its most comely to stand up with the Hat of; besides there is a difference between praying to God and preaching to Men: I could say more to this Matter, but the Man is unworthy; also I am informed <hi>W. Penn</hi> did pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately answer him to the Substance of his Queries, which he takes no notice of as an Answer, which he might have published with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107144:8"/>
his Queries; but that he is willing to heap upon us, and reitterate a Multitude of triffling Questions, as if he would not regard any serious Answer; and most unjustly and peevishly reflects, like some angry <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> in saying, <hi>When you can pretend Scriptures, prove your Practices, then they shall be your Rule and Touch-Stone; but when you are out of their Practices and Commands, then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and not the Scriptures is your Rule:</hi> Whereas we have alwayes preferred the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> as our Rule and Touch-Stone, and to produce the Scripture to prove our Practice (is not to make them our Rule and Touch-Stone instead of the Spirit) which therefore shews our Belief and Esteem of the Scriptures in their place. Oh envious and confused Man! How dishonestly and perversly hast thou stated the Controversie; our citing that, 1 <hi>Cor. Ch.</hi> 11. was not the <hi>Ground, Touch-Stone</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of our Practice; for the Spirit of Life which moves us to pray, singly brought us into it in the beginning without any such outward Consideration, but it was truely cited to prove that our reverent Order and Practice in Prayer was not a <hi>Romish Tradition,</hi> brought forth in the <hi>Apostacy and Curse,</hi> as <hi>J. P.</hi> and some of his Disciples falsly charged this our Order and Custom in the Church of Christ, after they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had been some time therein with us.</p>
               <p>His alledging, <hi>different Measures, Growths, Motions, further Manifestation, Addition,</hi> and <hi>how ab<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ndantly different Gestures will contend the Unity of true faith;</hi> for his contradictory and offensive Behaviour in time of publick Prayer these are but false Covers, and savor of meer <hi>Ranterism</hi> in the bottom, like the <hi>Ranters,</hi> VARIETY IN UNITY, AND UNITY IN VA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIETY for their fleshly Liberty, wherein they contemptuously have stood staring at us with their Hats on in time of publick Prayer, whose Spirits we Judged in the beginning; whereas <hi>different Measures, Growths or further Manifestations,</hi> in the true Church (which must relate to one and the same Light and Truth) do neither change the Property of the thing, nor make it another Dispensation; nor can they cause Contradiction, Opposition or Division in one Member against another, as is between this Apposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>Ranting</hi> Spirit (that Quarels about the Hat) and the Spirit of the true Church, which acts in Unity, Peace and good Order. His pretence of <hi>a further Manifestation, Growth or Addition, for that</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:107144:8"/>
his irreverent Custom which is not upheld by him upon <hi>a Religious Account,</hi> is a manifest and gross Contradiction; and his further Manifestation, Growth and Addition, <hi>pretended,</hi> must be beyond us all, and above the whole Church (if we will believe him) for therein he assumes an Authority to judge and revile both <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Ancient Friends,</hi> and infamously to notifie particular persons to the World, as he pleaseth, and to set a Mark upon them: and all this without either dealing with them as Christ injoyned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 16, 17. or having the least Consent of the Church, which he hath owned among us; and indeed contrary to all Gospel and Christian order in the Church. Thus while he is accusing ancient Friends, with <hi>Usurping a Head-Ship, setting up a Romish Hirarthy;</hi> he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is acting the part of an <hi>usurping Pope, proud Prelate,</hi> and <hi>exalted Diotrophes, that loved Preheminence,</hi> and yet would make the World believe, that he is a man of <hi>a very tender conscience,</hi> and <hi>great Humility; but this is as real as his Brother John Penyman</hi> entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himself, <hi>One of the least of thousands in Israel,</hi> or the Popes being <hi>a Servant of Servants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit his great Capital and Charge <hi>is, That we assert those Romish Positions, which having enslaved Nations, and destroyed thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and is of a most dangerous unutterable Consequence</hi> [Mark, Reader, by the way how he acts the part of a most malitious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary what more envious an Instigation to Persecution could he have brought forth at this Juncture against us? Oh Treacherous Apostate, <hi>Judas</hi> the Lord Rebuke thee] But what are those Romish positions? They are namely, 1st, <hi>That we are to believe as the Church believes:</hi> 2dly, <hi>That the Church cannot err:</hi> 3dly, <hi>That she hath Power to bind and to loose:</hi> 4thly, <hi>That it is abominable Pride not to submit to her Judgment, she having alwayes the infallible Spirit, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However to his own Confutation, he seems herein to clear us from setting up an usurped Hirarchy of <hi>some that seek Preheminence over the Body, &amp; limitting the Power to persons</hi> (as he falsly suggests) for here the Power is attributed to <hi>the Church</hi> in general, yet in these Positions he deals very unfairly; for <hi>to believe as the Church believes, &amp;c.</hi> May be taken, as if we use to preach those bare posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as our great Arguments to enforce People into our Faith; which we never did; but commend our selves to every man's
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107144:9"/>
Conscience in the Sight of God, and therein are we manifested; yet that I may loose nothing of Truth's Testimony.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>first</hi> I affirm, That the true Church is in the true Faith that is in God, and we must either believe thus as the true Church believes, or else it were but both a Folly and Hypocrisie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess our selves Members thereof; this man hath treacherously betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both his own Conscience and Testimony, who while he would seem to own the Church of Christ, as a Member of her; yet tells the World, <hi>It is a most dangerous Position that we are to believe as the Church believes, Oh, Treacherous Enemy to the Church of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> Is it so dangerous, <hi>that this Church</hi> (or universal Body of Christ) <hi>cannot err?</hi> Whenas <hi>the Church</hi> signifies <hi>the Elect,</hi> and Christ implies an Impossibility that the <hi>very Elect</hi> should be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24 Or that the Gates of Hell should prevail against his Church, and promiseth his Presence to the End of the World: Were it either reasonable or just to conclude, the whole Body or Church of Christ is liable to err, because some particular Members may? Observe the Darkness and perverse Spirit of this Apostate and Accuser of (not only the Brethren, but) the whole Church; for he states not this Charge against a false Application made of the said Positions by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but against the Positions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as being destructive and dangerous, and as asserted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Church,</hi> not this nor that particular <hi>Church, Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Assembly,</hi> but its the <hi>Church</hi> his Quarrel lies against.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> He is even also against the Church having Power to <hi>bind and to loose,</hi> though this was a certain Priviledge given of Christ Jesus unto the Church (who in him received a living Sence of both Judgment and Mercy) even to bind and to loose, by the Power of the holy Ghost given unto her, see <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18 <hi>Joh.</hi> 20, 22, 23. If it must needs be accounted dangerous to assert this? then its dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to confess the power of Christ that is in the true Church the man hath greatly wronged and out faced his own Conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly, If he will not hear the Church let him be to thee as a Heathen man,</hi> &amp;c. what is it but abominable Pride for any one (especially that professeth himself a Member of the true Church) to Refuse to hear her, or submit to her judgment? when demonstrated? for she must needs have both the infallible Spirit and true Judgment; if every living Member pertake thereof, <hi>he that hath not the Spirit of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107144:9"/>
Christ is none of his;</hi> and God is come in ten Thousand of his Saints to judge the Ungodly, and the Saints shall judge the World; and doth not <hi>W. M.</hi> profess the Spirit of Christ, that he hath it? Yet tells the Word, <hi>It is a Romish Position, destructive and dangerous to assert, that the Church hath alwayes the infallible Spirit</hi> (that is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ) but did not Christ promise the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> the <hi>Comforter</hi> to his Church, saying, <hi>He shall abide with you forever;</hi> and is not this infallible, and the Church's Judgment therefore of Value? Oh how sadly hath this Opposer violated his own Conscience, perverted the right Wayes of God, and abused the pretious Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Truth? And seeing his Charge is so high against us for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting those four Positions afore-said on the behalf of the Church; and that they are both <hi>Romish, Destructive</hi> and of <hi>a most dangerous Consequence;</hi> it naturally follows that he deems it <hi>not dangerous nor destructive for him</hi> to assert the <hi>contrary,</hi> namely, 1. <hi>That we are not to believe as the Church believes</hi> (but rather as <hi>W. Mucklow</hi> and his Brother <hi>J. Pennyman</hi> believe) seeing that they have assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Jurisdiction over the Church, and a Power to judge her. 2. <hi>That the Church can err, is fallible, or is liable to be deceived and apostatize</hi> (as he questions us.) 3. <hi>That she hath no such Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as to bind and to loose:</hi> [Wherein he sets his Judgment above Christ's, in Opposition to his express Promise to his Church.] 4. <hi>That the Church hath not alwayes the infallible Spirit</hi> (which is Christ's) <hi>and therefore it is no Pride, but great Humility in</hi> W. M. <hi>and</hi> J. P. (as being the lowly Ones) <hi>not to submit to the Church in matter of Judgment:</hi> So that at this Rate they will claim a Superiority and Preheminence above the Church (which heretofore they have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and confessed to the <hi>Power of God</hi> in her) as if this <hi>had the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit,</hi> when <hi>the Church wants it;</hi> if this be not a Head-ship and Usurpation, a degree higher then the Pope himself pretends to, let all intelligent Readers judge; is so be the Pope pretends to an Infallibility, not as in a Separation from the Church, but as profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Unity with her still, though he be really Anti-christian in his usurping the Headship, that he doth; and so are these Men, who like evil Spies have brought Evil Reports upon the good Land, and despise the Church of God, even his People (called <hi>Quakers</hi>) contrary to their first Love, Testimony and Conviction.</p>

               <p>A manifest Slander against the Body of Christ; never such a Doctrine was preached or owned among us, <hi>That now the Body without us is to be the Head, and not Christ</hi> (as implyed) and yet he grants, <hi>Christ to be the Head of the Body;</hi> and is not that Body the Church which he hath owned?

                  <hi>W.

               </p>
               <p>Herein he hath intermixt his perverse Parenthesis, falsly charging us in divers Respects, as if the Heavenly Gift and the Church were now separate; and what the Lord and his People require in Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or as if we were promoting <hi>a Body without the Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Subjection to what the Lord requires,</hi> as if our Testimony were now so much <hi>varied from</hi> what it was <hi>in the Beginning;</hi> these are all most falsly suggested, his saying, <hi>It was to direct our minds to the Heavenly Gift, not to the Church, to what the Lord, not the Body required:</hi> See what Division this would make between the Lord, and his People; but he mistakes [<hi>Not to the Church</hi>] for our Testimony

was in the beginning and still is, to promote the Unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our directing the Minds to the Spirit, and to them that love the Lord, to dwell in Love and Unity, which all come unto who come unto the Heavenly Gift, and to follow the Lord's Requirings therein, which is unerring; and what is this but to preach up a true Church-State, which hath been the real Intent and Tendency of our Testimony from the Beginning? And had this Man been faithful to what was testfied in the Beginning (as he pretends a great Esteem thereof) the Unity and Society of the Church and People of God called <hi>Quakers</hi> would have been of more value with him, then now so enviously and confusedly to quarrel with them, or any <hi>comely Order</hi> or <hi>reverent Custom in the Church,</hi> as he doth, which he did not in the Beginning; for when his Mind was directed to the <hi>Manifestation of the Spirit, which would infallibly teach us our Duty towards God, our Neighbour and our selves</hi> (as he saith) then he (and the rest concerned) in the Beginning did not <hi>irreverently sit with their Hats on in publick Prayer among us,</hi> nor say that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary among us was <hi>a going forth into Reasonings to promote comely Orders after the manner of Men;</hi> for what needed that, when the infallible Spirit, which was then owned to be their Teacher, freely led them into it? Nor did the Apostle so go out into reasoning, when he exhorted the <hi>Saints to think on whatsoever things were true, honest, just, pure, lovely, of good Report, &amp;c.</hi> But this Man is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at our vindicating that Order which was made both lovely and comely (by that Spirit that set it up) since he is gone out from that infallible Spirit which he was directed to in the Beginning, which then moved and led them into both Reverence to God, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to his People, and how to behave themselves in the Church of Christ, both in Decency and in Order. Note that <hi>W. M.</hi> in so plainly professing, and (in Words) owning the <hi>Truth's Testimony and Infallibility of the Spirits Teaching, as it was in the Beginning testified to among us,</hi> he hath therein said more for the comely Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that then was brought forth in our Assemblies, and for the Church having <hi>the infallible Spirit to know Truth from Error and the right from the wrong Spirit,</hi> then ever he can say or produce for the contrary, viz. <hi>for his keeping on his Hat in Prayer,</hi> for his accusing the Church <hi>with Fallibility, Apostacy,</hi> or <hi>the Antient Friends</hi> with <hi>Imposing, Usurping, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>He still boggles and seems offended at the Body, the Church, having <hi>the infallible Spirit, the certain unerring Judgment reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with them upon all Occasions to know Truth from Error and the right from the wrong Spirit; will you limit the Lord?</hi> saith he.</p>

What gross Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is come over this Man? Doth not the spiritual Man judge all Things? And the Saints shall judge the World; and dare he say that the Spirit of Christ hath not taught the Church Truth from Error, nor to know the right from the wrong Spirit? Whenas the Principle we direct unto, and our Testimony concerning it, he dares not say is fallible; but seems to justifie our Testimony as it <hi>was in the Beginning,</hi> and in Words to own <hi>Inward Motions, Voice and Teachings of the infallible Spirit, and the measure thereof within to try the Verity of our Doctrine:</hi> And why should it be rendred a limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Lord for the Church to claim this Priviledge, as thus, having the unerring Spirit?

Surely then we need not want true Understanding and Judgment in things of lesser Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>Now it were very gross and impious to deny that Priviledge to the <hi>whole Church, Body or general Assembly,</hi> which two or three met in the Name of Christ pertake of, namely, <hi>his Presence in the midst of them;</hi> and if his Presence be in the midst of two or three met in his Name, surely he will not be absent from a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber so met; but saith W.
