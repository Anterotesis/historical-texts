            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS it was the Diſciples Religion principle and practice to obey Chriſts command as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 34. <hi>But I ſay unto you ſwear not at all neither by Heaven for it is Gods throne nor by the Earth for it is his footſtool, neither by Jeruſalem for it is the City of the great king, neither ſhalt thou ſwear by thy head, for thou canſt not make one hair white or black but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, for whatſoever is more then theſe cometh of evil,</hi> and this being the Apoſtles Religion and practiſe, they preached this doctrine unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as it is written, <hi>James</hi> 5. 12. <hi>But above all things my brethren ſwear not neither by heaven neither by the earth, neither by any other oath, but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, leaſt you fall into condemnation,</hi> ſo this is our doctrine, principle and practiſe that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſwear at all; by any oath leaſt we fall into condemnation, and ſo ſin againſt Chriſt, and if we do ſuffer or be perſecuted, and impriſoned, becauſe we cannot ſwear. then it is for our Religion, and exerciſe of our Conſciences, and obedience of Truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our God in which ſuffering we ſhall rather dye then ſin againſt him.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is required of us to teſtifie our obedience as ſubjects unto CHARLES the ſecond, as our lawful King and own his Supremacy and Government in all juſt and lawful commands, whereupon an oath of Allegiance and Supremacy is tendred.</p>
            <p>As it is our principle and hath ever been our practiſe to be obedient ſubjects under every Power ordained of God, <hi>and to every ordinance of man</hi> (ſet up by him) <hi>for the Lords ſake whether unto King as ſupream, or unto Governors or any ſet up in Authoritie by him who are for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14. and unto ſuch we do freely promiſe obedience unto all juſt and lawful Commands: And we do own and believe that it is not without but according to the purpoſe of the Lord, that he hath this Day and Power given him as King head and chief Magiſtrate over this Nation, that while he hath his Day and Power he may rule for God in civil and outward affairs, and matters relating unto the outward man and eſtate, in which all his juſt, and lawful commands we can willingly be ſubject unto <hi>not for wrath but even for conſcience ſake,</hi> and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which are otherwiſe, whether from him, or any other, we ſhall willingly and patiently ſuffer under them what men ſhall be permitted to impoſe upon us, and thus we do accept and own the King and his Government, as he and it is according to God, and anſwerable unto him, we are willingly obedient, and in Conſcience bound to accept it, and ſhall yeeld ſubjection thereunto, but if otherwiſe contrary to God, he rule in Tyranny, oppreſſion injuſtce or the like that we muſt bear witneſs aginſt by the ſpirit of Truth, but not by outward oppoſition as rebellion by inſurrections plots, or carnal weapons to deſtroy or overthrow, either him or the Government thereby; for that is contrary to our life.</p>
            <p>But as for ſwearing it being contrary both to Chriſts Command, and our Conſciences as we never have, ſo we never ſhall ſwear, neither for nor againſt any Man Power or Government but ſhall be true and faithful, to what we promiſe and profeſs.</p>
            <p>And as concerning the Church of God, and ſpiritual things relating unto Gods Kingdom, we own onely Jeſus Chriſt as ſupreme Head, Ruler and Lawgiver there according to <hi>James</hi> 4. 12. <hi>There is one Lawgiver which is able to ſave and to deſtroy,</hi> and as it is written, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>that God hath given him to be the h<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And him we do own as Head Ruler and Commander in all matters of Faith obedience and worſhip in things appertaining unto his king come, and he onely is to rule (give laws and order) in the Conſciences of men, by his ſpirit light and power, and as he is the Author of his peoples Faith, ſo he is the defender of it; and them in it, and ſo to him we give the Dominion Rule and Government, as head and ſupreme over his Church, and not unto man: ſo in him who is our Life King and Lawgiver we honour all men, and do ſeek the peace of all men and not the deſtruction, and unto this we do acknowledge, and bear witneſs to, who are members of his body which is his Church.</p>
