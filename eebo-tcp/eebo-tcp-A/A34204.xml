         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and much Rain, the Spring before; the Winter

and hot Bliſters. I thinke the Seaſons of this
Yeare have not been ſuch. 'Tis true that in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall
Diſeaſes, which take many away, ſome
are Peſtilentiall, ſome onely Maligne of an ill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
yet their ill Seminaries eaſily become veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108956:3"/>
So Maligne ſpotted Feauers may precede
Peſtilentiall; yet a Peſtilentiall Feaver may be
without a Plague, and a Plague without a Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall
Feaver.<note place="margin">1. De differ. Feb.</note> So <hi>Galen</hi> ſayes. A Plague followes
all Diſeaſes, and may ſtrike you ſuddenly without
a Feaver. The laſt Yeare more died of thoſe ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Feavers than now, as our Sextons ſay.</p>
            <p>Theſe Feavers now are Peſtilentiall, from the
putrefaction of the humours in a high degree,
which the Tumours and Sores witneſſe: the
Plague then is in the humours now, as earſt it was
in the ſpirits, in the ſweating ſickneſſe which was
<hi>Ephemera pestilens,</hi> according to the beſt Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Now putrid humorall Feavers may be either
Maligne or Peſtilentiall, according to the ſeverall
degrees of putrefaction in the humours. And the
Ancients, ſayes <hi>Galen,</hi> not knowing the great
cauſe of corruption in the bloud; referred it to
the Gods for their ſinnes: 'twere well if we did
ſo too; for a high degree of corruption in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
is argued by Plague-ſores; yet all that die
here, die not of the Plague. Publique Authority
hath carefully provided for it, even in their care to
leſſen our feares: and we muſt be heedfull not
to encreaſe them, by thinking that each man
dies, to die of the Plague. Though this Town be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108956:3"/>
infected, which I deny not, yet we muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Infection. The Spots laſt Yeare were
contagious, yet none ſhut up for them, I hereby
perſwade none to ſtay here, but rather adviſe
them to anſwer their feares and be gone. <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi>
his Temple was out of the City; and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
thence may be for health, eſpecially when
feare expoſes the heart to danger, and betrayes the
Fort: onely the extent of our apprehenſions in
dangers may be rightly bounded, conſidering by
the true ſignes, whither the affliction which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to particulars be peſtilentiall or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valeſius</hi> ſometimes Phyſician to the King of
<hi>Spaine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Epid. Hip.</note> a learned man, carefully conſiders of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral
Feavers, whither they be Maligne or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilentiall.
In rotten peſtilentiall Diſeaſes, now
Nature would disburden herſelfe, and therefore
would vent thoſe putrid matters by the common
ſinkes; it appeares in Sores in the glandulous
parts, the Groine, the Arme-pits, yet Tumours in
theſe parts are not alwayes peſtilentiall. Some
quickly come up, and increaſe, are red, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purate
quickly; a true ſigne of an inflammation
onely.</p>
            <p>So it may not perhaps be uſeleſſe to deſcribe
what Sores are truly peſtilentiall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:108956:4"/>
There are either large blacke<note n="*" place="margin">vulgarly <hi>Tokens.</hi>
               </note> Spots in the Plague,
or peſtilent Tumours in the glandulous parts, as
Groine, Arme-pits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſo <hi>Bubones peſtiferi</hi>
are deſigned to be, or Carbuncles.</p>
            <p>Peſtilent Tumours are worſe than Carbuncles
according to <hi>Ficinus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bubo peſtifer.</note> for the expulſion of the
matter into the Tumour argues the principall
parts to have been charged with it: but if it be a
criticall Tumour, Nature is eaſed by it. <hi>Bubones

               <note place="margin">Hip.</note> If in colour they
be yellowiſh, livid, or blacke, they are the worſe;
if they go backe they are moſt dangerous; thoſe
under the Arme-pits, are worſe than elſewhere;
next thoſe in the necke, and under the eares.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Signes.</note> Sudden faintings in the beginning of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Feaver, without any manifeſt Cauſe is a true
ſigne of Infection, bleeding, vacuations, want of
ſleep, ſadneſſe, feares, are evident cauſes.</p>
            <p>2. If with theſe Tumours and Carbuncles li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
and blacke Spots appeare, with blacke excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and exceſſive thirſt, 'tis evidently peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall.</p>
            <p>3. The body ſeemes not to be hot, neither pulſe
or urines bad, yet they are unquiet and burne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
As it was in the Plague <hi>Thucidides</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes:
'tis ſo in all peſtilentiall Conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:108956:4"/>
Some would have theſe Tumours to be the
ſame with the Carbuncle, but men experienced
diſtinguiſh them. The more there comes forth of
thoſe Tumours the better it is; but this holds not
in Carbuncles.</p>
            <p>A Carbuncle (<hi>Ignis Perſicus, Pruna</hi>) hath in the
middle a cruſt like a Coale, and thence 'tis ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
'tis a fire and burnes the circumjacent parts.
The cruſt is not alwayes blacke, but ſometimes a
blackiſh yellow, ſo <hi>Galen;</hi> the blacke colour is
with a kinde of ſhining; ſo <hi>Paulus Aegin.</hi> It
hath a pitchy colour in the brightneſſe: the pain
is ſo great that the Patient thinkes himſelfe girded
with irons: ſome finde an itching in the middle
part of it, and ſcratching, a pimple ariſes, under
which the fleſh is burnt, and of a livid colour:
and if it be peſtilentiall he nauſeates and vomits:
Leſſer Carbuncles are worſe than greater, harder
and livid, worſe than ſoft. Thoſe in the upper
parts above the other former Tumours are worſt
of all, neare the heart and ſtomacke. The farther
off from the principall parts the leſſe dangerous:
ſo <hi>Celſus.</hi> A <hi>delirium</hi> is an ill ſigne, when the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle
is in the upper parts, for the membranes of
the brain may be inflamed. The plaineſt Cure for
theſe Swellings is to apply Cupping-glaſſes to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108956:5"/>
them, then the bare breech of a Pullet, for it
drawes the poyſon: after the death of the Pullet,
ſcarifie the place. Some cautenze it. Some uſe
this vulgar Cauſticke, they wrap a few aſhes in a
linnen cloath, and boyle it in oyle, and rub the
Tumour with it a good while; when it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
burnt, they cure it as they do a Carbuncle.
They ſuppurate the Cruſt with Mallowes, Lilly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rootes
and Butter: they keep it open as long as
poſſible, and cleanſe it with juice of Smallage,
and honey of Roſes. Sometimes theſe Spots,
Tumours and Carbuncles appeare in dead men,
which in their ſickneſſe did not appeare, as 'twas
obſerved in a Plague at <hi>Lyons.</hi> If they be driven
backe, the Spots are brought again if the Body
be waſhed with hot water.</p>
