            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER <hi>From a</hi> GENTLEMAN <hi>at</hi> London <hi>to his</hi> FRIEND <hi>at</hi> Edinburgh.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am inform'd that thoſe, who in the laſt Meeting of our Parliament appear'd for the Intereſt of the Country, have taken a Reſolution to begin the enſuing Seſſion with an Act declaring the Nations Right to <hi>Caledonia;</hi> which I preſume to be a very wrong ſtep, and ſuch as will prove of very bad conſequence. I ſuppoſe, the great Argument that has been offer'd for this Method, is, that nothing will more Unite the Members of Parliament, than the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Injury done to the Nation by the Deſtruction of that Colony. But, I hope, that upon better conſideration Men of Honeſty and good Intentions will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be led into ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake. For a Declaration of our right to <hi>Caledonia</hi> can do no real good to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this time: But the disbanding of the Army will. If they would be even with thoſe who have ruin'd our Colony, they can never do it any way effectually, but by breaking the Army. They are now to chuſe upon which of theſe two Heads they will again break with the Court; for in my Opinion neither of them will be granted. But if it ſhould be thought convenient to yield to either of theſe Propoſitions, 'twill certainly be to that of disbanding the Army, on Account of the Intereſt the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> might take in it, and perhaps ſecond it for their own Security. Whereas the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring our Right to <hi>Caledonia</hi> will (how unjuſtly ſoever) be attributed to meer pique and humour, becauſe of no preſent Advantage to the Nation; and will ſound ridiculouſly among our Neighbors, where our Weakneſs, and ill Conduct in that Affair has but too much expos'd us. So that the Court can never deſire a fairer pretence to vindicate themſelves both to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> then to break up our Parliament upon ſuch an Account. And we who are cruſh'd by a Power which we are no way able to reſiſt, ought to have great regard to ſuch things as may engage all Men of good Intentions in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to be our Friends; and not continue to miſtake what is done in both by the Court Party, as proceeding from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themſelves. Beſides, till the Army be disbanded, there is not the leaſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of obtaining Money from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, for carrying on the Trade of the Company. We muſt have loſt our ſenſes, if we do not ſee that a quarrel with us is induſtriouſly ſought, that a pretence may be found to keep up an Army. And if the Court Party ſhould prevail in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England,</hi> who knows, how far our inſiſting upon the Buſineſs of <hi>Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> without any proſpect of preſent good to the Nation, might be made a handle to excite that Nation againſt us? I cannot but think there's juſt-ground to ſuſpect the Conduct of thoſe who by all means would puſh the Affair of the Colony at ſo unſeaſonable a time. We don't aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our Rights and Privileges in this point, becauſe we think fit in the firſt place to enter upon another Affair, which threatens us with the utmoſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. As long as we have a ſtanding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, we can have neither Trade nor Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. We expell'd King <hi>James</hi> becauſe he would keep up an Army in time of Peace. We are now ſtrugling with this Government about the ſame thing. And a certain Perſon, tho' he ſtand looking on a Crown at ſuch a diſtance, as amounts to a Viſion, is yet ſo dazled with its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to make it his buſineſs to imploy the preſent Spirit and Vigor of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any thing rather than in breaking the Army. I value not Proteſtations; they are Nauſeous things; I look only upon what Men do, and cannot forbear to think, that thoſe, who after due conſideration of our preſent Circumſtances, ſhall in the Enſuing Seſſion of Parliament, prefer any other Buſineſs to that of disbanding the Army, are Men ſeeking their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and not the good of their Country.</p>
