         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Aſsigned by <hi>WILLIAM PRYNNE,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEing on the 7 of this inſtant <hi>June</hi> 1649 informed by the Aſſeſſors of the Pariſh of <hi>Swainſwicke,</hi> that I was aſſeſſed at 2 l. 5 s. for three months <hi>Contribution,</hi> by vertue of a (pretended), <hi>Act of the Commons aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> bearing date the 7 of <hi>April</hi> laſt, aſſeſſing the Kingdom at ninty thouſand-pounds monthly, beginning from the 25 of <hi>March</hi> laſt, and continuing for ſix months next enſuing, <hi>towards the maintenance of the forces to be continued in England and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the paying of ſuch as are thought fit to be diſbanded, that ſo Free-quarter may be taken off</hi>; whereof 3075 l. 17 s. 1 d. ob. is monthly impoſed on the County, and 2 l. 5 s. 3 d. on the ſmall poor Pariſh where I live; and being ſince on the 15 of <hi>June</hi> required to pay in 2 l. 5 s. for my proportion: I returned the <hi>Collector</hi> this Anſwer, That I could neither in <hi>Conſcience, Law, nor Prudence in the leaſt meaſure ſubmit to the voluntary payment of this illegall Tax, and unreaſonable Contribution, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all my unrepaired loſſes and ſufferings for the publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty) amounting to ſix times more then</hi> Ship-money, (the times conſidered) <hi>or any other illegall Tax of the late beheaded King, ſo much declaimed againſt in our three laſt Parliaments by ſome of thoſe who impoſed this. And that I would rather ſubmit to the painfulleſt death and ſevereſt puniſhment the Impoſers or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actors of it could inflict upon me by their arbitrary power (for le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall they had none) then voluntarily pay, or not oppoſe it in my place and calling to the uttermoſt, upon the ſame, if not better reaſons as I oppugned</hi>

               <hi>Ship-money, Knighthood, and other unlawfull impoſitions of the late King and his Councel hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> And that they and all the world might bear witneſſe, I did
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60650:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it not from meer obſtinacy or fullenneſſe; but out of ſolid reall grounds of <hi>Conſcience, Law, Prudence,</hi> and publick affection to the weal and Liberty of my native Country (now in danger of being enſlaved under a <hi>new vaſſalage,</hi> more grievous then the worſt it ever yet ſuſtained under the late, or any other of our worſt Kings) I promiſed to draw up the Reaſons of this my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal in writing, and to publiſh them ſo ſoon as poſſible to the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> for my own <hi>Vindication,</hi> and the better information and ſatisfaction of all ſuch as are any wayes concerned in the impoſing, collecting, levying or paying of this ſtrange kinde of Contribution. In purſuance whereof, I immediately penned theſe enſuing <hi>Reaſons</hi>; which I humbly ſubmit to the <hi>imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Cenſure</hi> of all <hi>conſcientious</hi> and <hi>judicious Engliſhmen</hi>; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring either their <hi>ingenuous Refutation,</hi> if <hi>erronious</hi>; or <hi>candid Approbation,</hi> if <hi>ſubſtantiall and irrefragable,</hi> as my <hi>conſcience</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> perſwade me they are, and that they will appear ſo to all <hi>impartiall Perſons,</hi> after full examination.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By the fundamental Laws, and known Statutes of this Realme, No Tax, Tallage, Ayd, Impoſition, Contribution, Loan or Aſſeſſment whatſoever may or ought to be impoſed or levied on the free men and people of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> but by the WILL and COMMON ASSENT of the EARLS, BARONS, Knights, Burgeſſes, Commons, and WHOLE REALM in a free and full PARLIAMENT, by ACT OF PARLIAMENT: All <hi>Taxes</hi> &amp;c. not ſo impoſed, levyed (though for the common defence and profit of the Realm) <hi>being unjuſt, oppreſſive, inconſiſtent with the liberty and propertie of the Subject, Laws and Statutes of the Realm</hi>; as is undeniably evident by the expreſſe Statutes of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> cap. 29.30. 25.

and <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> of that ſubject: Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in his 2 <hi>Inſtit.</hi> (publiſhed by Order of the Commons Houſe) pag. 59.60. &amp;c. 527.528.529.532.533, &amp;c. with ſundry other Records and Law-books cited by theſe great Rabbies of the Law, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots of the Peoples Liberties. But the preſent Tax of Ninety Thouſand pounds a Month, now exacted of me, was not thus impoſed. Therefore it ought not to be demanded of, nor le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied on me; and I ought in conſcience, Law, and prudence to withſtand it as unjuſt, oppreſſive, inconſiſtent with the Liberty and Property of the Subject, Laws and Statutes of the Realm.</p>
            <p>To make good the Aſſumption, which is onely queſtionable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This Tax was not impoſed in, but out of any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the late Parliament being actually diſſolved above two months before this pretended Act of theſe Tax-impoſers taking away the King by a violent death, as is expreſly reſolved by the Parliament of 1 H. 4.

HIS, and HIS KINGDOMS <hi>affairs</hi> &amp;c. being thereby abſolutely determined, without any hopes of revivall; the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it ſelf muſt thereupon abſolutely be determined like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (eſpecially to thoſe who have disinherited HIS HEIRS and SUCCESSORS, and voted down our Monarchy it ſelf) and theſe with all other Members of Parliament, ceaſe to be any longer Members of it, being made ſuch onely by the King's aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Writ; even as all Judges, Juſtices of peace, and Sheriffs made onely by the Kings Writ or Commiſſion, not by Letters Patents, ceaſe to be Judges, Juſtices and Sheriffs by the Kings death, for this very reaſon, becauſe they are conſtituted <hi>Juſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arios &amp; Vicecomites NOSTROS ad Pacem NOSTRAM &amp;c. cuſtodiendam</hi>; and he being dead, and his Writs and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions expired by his death, they can be his Judges, Juſtices and Sheriffs no longer to <hi>preſerve</hi> HIS Peace, &amp;c. (no more then a wife can be her deceaſed Husbands Wife, and bound to his obedience, from which ſhe was loſed by his death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.2.3.)

               <hi>Law-Books</hi> and Judges have frequently reſolved upon this very reaſon, which equally extends to Members of Parliament, as to Judges, Juſtices and Sheriffs, as is agreed in 4 E. 4.43.44. and <hi>Brooke, Office</hi> and <hi>Officer,</hi> 25. Therefore this Tax being cleerly impoſed not in, but out of, and after the Parliament end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Kings decapitation, and that by ſuch who were then no lawfull Knights, Citizens, Burgeſſes or Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but onely private men, their Parliamentary Authority expiring with the King, it muſt needs be illegall, and contrary to all the fore-cited Statutes; as by the Convocations and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies Tax and Benevolence granted after the Parliament diſſolved in the yeer 1640, was reſolved to be by both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, and thoſe adjudged high Delinquents who had any hand in promoting it.</p>

               </note> Firſt, That though regularly it be true, that forty Members are ſufficient to make a Commons Houſe to begin prayers, and buſineſſes of leſſer moment in the beginning of the day, till the other Members come, and the Houſe be full; yet forty were never in any Parliament reputed a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to grant Subſidies, paſſe, or record Bils, or debate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude matters of greateſt moment; which by the conſtant Rules and uſage of Parliament, were never debated, concluded, paſſed, but in a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>full Houſe,</hi> when all or moſt of the Members were preſent, as the Parliament <hi>Rolls, Journals, Modus tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Parliamentum,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> 4.

            <p>Secondly, Though forty Members onely may peradventure make an Houſe in caſes of abſolute neceſſity, when the reſt through ſickneſſe, and publick or private occaſions, are volutarily or negligently abſent; and might freely repair thither to ſit or give their Votes if they pleaſed: yet forty Members never yet made a Commons Houſe by cuſtome of Parliament (there being never yet any ſuch caſe till now) when the reſt (being above four hundred) were forcibly ſecluded, or driven thence by an Army, through the practice or connivance of thoſe forty ſitting, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they ſhould not over nor counter-vote them; much leſſe an Houſe to ſequeſter or expell the other Members, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any Tax upon them. Till they ſhew me ſuch a Law, Cuſtom, or Preſident of Parliament (not to be found in any age) all they pretend is nothing to purpoſe, or the preſent caſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Neither forty Members, nor a whole Houſe of Commons were ever enough in any age, by the Cuſtom of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

executing our late King, againſt the Votes, faith, and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of both Houſes, and diſinheriting his Poſterity, uſurping the Regal, Parliamental, Magiſtratical and Eccleſiaſtical power of the Kingdom to their Generall Councel of Officers of the Army, as the ſupreme ſwaying Authority of the Kingdom, and attempting to alter and ſubvert the ancient Government, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Laws and Cuſtoms of our Realm: And upon ſerious conſideration of the ordinary unſufferable Aſſertions of their Officers and Souldiers uttered in moſt places where they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to my ſelf in particular, ſundry times. <hi>That the whole Kingdom, with all our Lands, Houſes, goods, and whatſoever we have, is theirs, and that by right of conqueſt, they having twice conquered the Kingdom: That we are but their conquered ſlaves and Vaſſals, and they the Lords and Heads of the Kingdome: That our very lives are at their mercy and courteſie. That when they have gotten all we have from us by Taxes and Free-quarter, and we have nothing left to pay them, then themſelves will ſelfe upon our Lands as their own, and turn us and our Families out of doors. That there is now no Law in England</hi> (nor never was if we beleeve their lying Oracle <hi>Peters) but the ſword</hi>; with many ſuch like vapouring Speeches and diſcourſes, of which there are thouſands of witneſſes: I can neither in <hi>Conſcience, Law</hi> nor <hi>Prudence</hi> aſſent, much leſſe contribute in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for their preſent maintenance, or future continuance, thus to inſult, inſlave, and tyrannize over King, Kingdom, Parliament, people at their pleaſure, like their conquered vaſſals. And for me in particular to contribute to the maintenance of thoſe, who againſt the Law of the Land, the priviledges of Parliament, and liberty of the Subject, pulled me forcibly from the Commons Houſe, and kept me priſoner about two months ſpace under their Martiall, to my great expence and prejudice, without any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cauſe pretended or aſſigned, only for diſcharging my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Kingdom, and thoſe for whom I ſerved in the Houſe, without giving me the leaſt reparation for this unparallell'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, or acknowledging their offence (and yet detain ſome of my then fellow-Members under cuſtody by the meer power of the Sword without bringing them to tryall) would be not onely abſurd, unreaſonable, and a tacite juſtification of this their horrid violence and breach of priviledge, but monſtrous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60650:8"/>
perfidious, againſt my Oath and Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No Tax ought to be impoſed on the Kingdom in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, but in caſe of neceſſity, for its common Good, as is cleer by the Stat. of 25. E. 1. c 6. and <hi>Cooks</hi> 2 Inſtit. p. 528. Now it is evident to me, that there is no neceſſity of keeping up this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for the Kingdoms common Good, but rather a neceſſity of disbanding it, or the greateſt part of it, for theſe reaſons: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Kingdom is generally exhauſted with the late 7 years Wars, Plunders and heavie Taxes; there being more moneys levied on it by both ſides, during theſe eight laſt years, then in all the Kings Reigns ſince the Conqueſt, as will appear upon a juſt computation: all Counties being thereby utterly unable to pay it. 2. In regard of the great decay of Trade, the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary dearth of cattel, corn, and proviſions of all ſorts; the charge of relieving a multitude of poor people, who ſtarve with famine in many places, the richer ſort eaten out by Taxes and Free-quarter, being utterly unable to relieve them. To which I might add the multitude of maimed Souldiers, with the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and children of thoſe who have loſt their lives in the Wars, which is very coſtly. 3. This heavie Contribution to ſupport the Army, deſtroys all Trade, by fore-ſtalling and engroſſing moſt of the moneys of the Kingdom, the ſinews and life of Trade; waſting the proviſions of the Kingdom, and enhanſing their prices, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many thouſands of able men and horſes idle, only to conſume other labouring mens proviſions, eſtates and the publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Kingdom, when as their imployment in their trades and callings, might much advance trading, and enrich the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 4. There is now no viſible Enemy in the field or Gariſons, and the ſitting Members boaſt there is no fear from any abroad, their Navie being ſo Victorious. And why ſuch a vaſt Army ſhould be ſtill continued in the Kingdom to increaſe its debts and payments, when charged with ſo many great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears and debts already, eat up the Country with Taxes and Free-quarter, only to play, drink, whore, ſteal, rob, murther, quarrel, fight with, impeach and ſhoot one another to death as Traytors, Rebels and Enemies to the Kingdom and Peoples Liberties, as now the Levellers and Cromwelliſts do, for want of other imployments, and this for the publick good, tranſcends my underſtanding. 5. When the King had two great Armies
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60650:9"/>
in the Field, and many Gariſons in the Kingdom, this whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by its primitive Eſtabliſhment, conſiſted but of twenty two thouſand Horſe, Dragoons, and Foot, and had an Eſtabliſhment only of about forty five thouſand pounds a month for their pay; which both Houſes then thought ſufficient, as is evident by their <note n="o" place="margin">Collect. &amp;c. pag. 599.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>6.</note> Ordinances of Febr. 15. 1644. and April 4. 1646. And when the Army was much increaſed without their Order, ſixty thouſand pounds a month was thought abundantly ſufficient by the Officers and Army themſelves to disband and reduce all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-numeraries, maintain the Eſtabliſhed Army and Gariſons, and eaſe the Country of all Free-quarter; which Tax hath been conſtantly paid in all Counties. Why then this Tax to the Army ſhould now be raiſed above the firſt Eſtabliſhment, when redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to twenty thouſand, whereof ſundry Regiments are deſigned for <hi>Ireland,</hi> (for which there is thirty thouſand pounds a month now exacted beſides the ſixty for the Army) and this for the common good of the Realm, is a riddle unto me, or rather, a Myſtery of iniquity, for ſome mens private lucre, rather then the publick weal. 6. The <hi>Militia</hi> of every County (for which there was ſo great conteſt in Parliament with the late King) and theſe perſons of livelihood and eſtates in every Shire or Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration who have been cordiall to the Parliament and Kingdom heretofore, put into a poſture of defence under Gentlemen of quality and known integrity, would be a far better Guard to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Kingdom againſt forraign Invaſions or domeſtick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections, then a mercinary Army of perſons and ſouldiers of no fortunes, and that with more generall content, and the tenth part of that charge the Kingdom is now at to maintain this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and prevent all danger of the undoing peſt of Free-quarter. Therefore there is no neceſſity to keep up this Army, or impoſe any new Tax for their maintenance, or defraying their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arrears, which I dare averr, the Free-quarter they have taken in kinde, and levied in money, if brought to a juſt account, as it ought, will double if not treble moſt of their Arrears, and make them much indebted to the Country. And no reaſon they ſhould have full pay and Free-quarter too, and the Country bear the burthen of both, without full allowance of all the quarters levied or taken on them againſt Law, out of their pretended ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears.</p>

               </note> 1. That upon theſe pretences theſe new Lords may intail and enforce an Army, and Taxes to ſupport them, on the Kingdom till Dooms-day 2. If they be reall Members who make this objection, elected by the Counties, Cities and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs for which they ſerve, and deriving their Parliamental Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority onely from the people (the <hi>only new fountain of all Power and Authority,</hi> as themſelves now dogmatize) then they are but the Servants and Truſtees, who are to allow them wages, and give them Commiſſion for what they act. And if they dare not now truſt the people, and thoſe perſons of quality, fidelity, and eſtate, who both elected, intruſted and impowred them, and are the primitive and ſupreme Power; it is high time for their Electors and Maſters the people, to revoke their authority and truſts, and no longer to truſt thoſe with their purſes, liberties, ſafety, who dare not now to confide in them, and would rather commit the ſafeguard of the Kingdom to mercinary, indigent ſoudiers, then to thoſe Gentlemen, Free-holders, Citizens, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, and perſons of Eſtate who elected them, whoſe Truſtees and Attourneys only they profeſſe themſelves, and who have greateſt intereſt both in them and the Kingdoms weal, and thoſe who muſt pay theſe Mercinaries, if continued. 3. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Free-men of <hi>England</hi> have very little reaſon any longer to truſt the Army with the Kingdoms, Parliaments, or their own Liberties, Laws and Priviledges ſafeguard, which they have ſo oft invaded; profeſſing now that they did not fight to preſerve the Kingdom, King, Parliament, Laws, Liberties and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Subject; but to conquer and pull them down, and make us conquered ſlaves in ſtead of free-men: averring, that <hi>all is theirs by conqueſt.</hi> And if ſo, then this Army is not, cannot be upheld and maintained for the Kingdoms and peoples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good and ſafety, but their enſlaving, deſtruction, and the meer ſupport of the uſurped Power, Authority, Offices, Wealth, and abſolute Domination only of thoſe who have exalted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the preſent above King, Parliament, Kingdom, Laws,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60650:10"/>
Liberties, and thoſe that did intruſt them, by the help of this truſt-breaking Army, who have ſtained all the glory of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Noble Victories and Heroick Actions, by their late dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous unworthy practices, and are become a reproach to the Engliſh Nation in all Chriſtian Kingdoms and Churches.</p>
            <p>The ſecond end of this heavie Tax, is the ſupport and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for which there was onely twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand pounds a month formerly allowed, now mounted unto thirty thouſand.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer in the firſt place, That it is apparent by the printed Statutes of 25. E. 1. c. 6. 1 E. 3. cap. 5.7. 18. E. 3. c. 7. 25. E. 3. c. 8. 4. H. 4. cap. 13. <hi>Cooks</hi> 2 Inſtitutes p. 528. and the <hi>Proteſtations of all the Commons of England in the Parliaments</hi> of 1 H. 5. nu. 17. and 7. H. 5. n. 9. <hi>That no freeman of England ought to be compelled to go in perſon, or to finde Souldiers, Arms, Conduct-money, Wages, or pay any Tax for or towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of any forreign War in</hi> Ireland, <hi>or any other parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea, without their free conſents in full Parliament.</hi> And therefore this Tax to maintain Souldiers and the War in <hi>Ireland</hi> (neither impoſed in Parliament, much leſſe in a full and free one, as I have proved) muſt needs be illegall, and no ways obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to me, or any other. 2. Moſt of the ancient Forces in <hi>Ireland</hi> (as the <hi>Brittiſh Army, Scots,</hi> and <hi>Inchiqueen</hi>'s) towards whoſe ſupport the twenty thouſand pounds a month was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, have been ever ſince declared <hi>Rebels, Traytors, Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and are not to ſhare in this Contribution: and thoſe now pretending for <hi>Ireland,</hi> being members of the preſent Army and to be paid out of that Eſtabliſhment, there is no ground at all to augment, but decreaſe this former monthly Tax for <hi>Ireland,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what it was before. 3. Many of thoſe now pretending for <hi>Ireland,</hi> have been the greateſt obſtructers of its relief hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and many of thoſe deſigned for this Service by lot, have in words, writing, and print proteſted they never intend to go thither, and diſſwade others from going, yet take free-quarter on the Country and pay too under that pretext. And to force the Country to pay Contribution and give Free-quarter to ſuch Cheaters and Impoſtors, who never intend this Service, is both unjuſt and diſhonourable. 4. If the Relief of <hi>Ireland</hi> be now really intended, it is not upon the firſt juſt and pious grounds, to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60650:10"/>
preſerve the Proteſtant party there from the forces of the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Popiſh Iriſh Rebels, with whom (if report be true) theſe ſitting <hi>Anti-Monarchiſts</hi> ſeek and hold correſpondence, and are now actually accorded with <hi>Owen Ro-Oneal</hi> and his party of blodieſt Papiſts; but to oppoſe the Kings intereſt and title to that Kingdome, and the Proteſtant remaining party there adhering to and proclaiming, acknowledging him for their Soveraign; leaſt his gaining of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould prove fatall to their uſurped ſoveraignty in <hi>England,</hi> or conduce to his enthroning here: And by what Authority theſe now ſitting can impoſe, or with what conſcience any loyall Subject who hath taken the Oaths of <hi>Supremacy, Allegiance,</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> can voluntarily pay any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution to deprive the King of his hereditary right &amp; undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Title to the Kingdoms and Crowns of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland</hi> and alter the frame of the ancient Government &amp; Parliaments of our Kingdoms<note n="p" place="margin">See a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection p 94, 95 99 698.700.877, 878.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> (Which heightens the illegality of theſe illegall means of levying it) if any perſon whoſe goods are deſtrained, or perſon impriſoned for this illegall tax, ſhall bring his <hi>Action at Law,</hi> or an <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> for his relief. The <hi>Committee of Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> will ſtay his legall proceedings, award coſt againſt him; and commit him a new till he pay them, and releaſe his ſuits at Law, and upon an <hi>Habeas corpus,</hi> their own Sworn Judges created by them, dare not bayle but remaund him againſt Law.

            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The time of oppoſing this illegall Tax, with theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull ways of levying it, is very conſiderable and ſticks much with me; it is (as the Impoſers of it declare and publiſh in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their new kind of Acts and devices) <hi>in the first yeare of Englands Liberty, and redemption from thraldom.</hi> And if this unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Tax, thus illegallly to be levied, be the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of our <hi>firſt years Freedom,</hi> and <hi>redemption from thraldom,</hi> how great may we expect our next years <hi>thraldome</hi> will be, when this <hi>little finger of theirs is heavier by far then the Kings whole loynes, whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for Tyranny and Oppreſſion</hi>?</p>
            <p>

            <p n="2">2.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60650:13"/>
they have been freequartered on as much or more then formerly: the Souldiers, when we tell them of any Orders againſt Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter, ſlighting them as ſo many waſt papers, and carrying themſelves more unruly: And when complaint thereof hath been made to the Officers, Members, or the Committee for the Army, or in the Houſe; anſwer hath ſtill been made, <hi>That as long as there is an Army on foot, there will be freequarter taken, and there can be no prevention of it, there being a neceſſity of it</hi>: and when any have craved allowance of it, they have found ſo many put-offs and delayes, and ſuch difficulties in obtaining it, that their expences have equalled their allowance; and after allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances made, the moneys allowed have been called for again. So as few have had any allowance for quarters, and given over ſuing for them, being put to play an <hi>after-game</hi> to ſue for them after all their contributions firſt paid, and not to deduct them out of their Contributions, which they are ſtill put to do. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text therefore of taking away Free-quarter, is but a <hi>ſhoo-horn</hi> to draw on the payment of this Tax, and a fair pretext to delude the <hi>People,</hi> as they finde by ſad experience every-where, and in the County and Hundred where I reſide. For, not to look back to the laſt yeers free-quarter taken on us (though we daily paid our Contributions,) In <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> laſt paſt, ſince this very Tax impoſed for taking away Free-quarter, <hi>Colonel Harriſons</hi> Troopers under the command of Captain <hi>Spencer,</hi> (who quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſix days together in a place, and exacted and received moſt of them 3 s. others 3 s. 6 d. and the leaſt 2 s. 6 d. a day for their Quarters, telling their Landlords, that their Lands, and the whole Kingdom was theirs) have put <hi>Bathwick, Bathford, Claverton, Combe, Hampton, Toustock, Walcot</hi> and <hi>Wedcombe,</hi> ſmall pariſhes in our Hundred and Liberty, as they will prove upon Oath, and given it me under their hands, to 94 li. 4 s. 3 d. charge; beſide what quarters in other pariſhes of the Hundred Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Wallers</hi> Souldiers upon pretext of collecting arrears of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution not due from the hundred, put it to at leaſt 30 l. charge more for free-quarter, they being very rude and diſorderly; and no ſooner were we quit of them: but on the 22 and 23 of <hi>May</hi> laſt, Col. <hi>Hunks</hi> his Foot under the conduct of Captain <hi>Flower</hi> and Captain <hi>Eliot</hi> pretending for <hi>Ireland,</hi> but profeſſing they never intended to go thither, marching from <hi>Minehead</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> (the next Weſterne Ports to <hi>Ireland</hi> further from it to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

Their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in all places was very rude, to extort money from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, drawing out their ſwords, ranſacking their houſes, beating and threatning to kill them, if they would not give them two ſhillings ſix pence, three ſhillings, three ſhillings ſix pence, or at leaſt two ſhillings a day for their quarters, which when extorted from ſome, they took free-quarter upon others, taking two, three, and ſome four quarters a man: At my houſe they were moſt exorbitant, having (as their Quarter-Maſter told me, who affirmed to me they had twice conquered the Kingdom, and all was theirs) <hi>directions from ſome great ones above,</hi> from <hi>ſome others in the Country</hi> (intimating ſome of the Committee) <hi>and their own Officers</hi> (who abſented themſelves purpoſely, that the <hi>Souldiers</hi> might have none to controll them) <hi>to abuſe me.</hi> In purſuance whereof ſome thirty of them coming to my houſe, ſhouting and hollowing in a rude manner on <hi>May</hi> 22, when their Billet was but for twenty, not ſhewing any Authority, but only a Ticket, [Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>— 20] climbed over my walls, forced my doors, beat my ſervants and workmen without any provocation, drew their ſwords upon me (who demanded whoſe Souldiers they were, by what authority they demanded free-quarter, my houſe being neither Inne, nor Alehouſe; and Free quarter againſt Law and Orders of Parliament, and the Generals) uſing many high provoking Speeches, brake ſome of my windows, forced my ſtrong-beer cellar door, and took the key from my ſervant, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked ſome of my chambers under pretext to ſearch for Arms, taking away my ſervants clothes, ſhirts, ſtockings, bands, cuffs, handkerchiefs, and picking the money out of one of their pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets; hollowed, roared, ſtamped, beat the Tables with their Swords and Muskets like ſo many Bedlams, ſwearing, curſing, and blaſpheming at every word; brake the Tankards, Bottles,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60650:14"/>
Cups, Diſhes wherein they fetched ſtrong beer againſt the ground, abuſed my maid-ſervants, throwing Beef &amp; other good proviſions at their heads, and caſting it to the dogs, as no fit meat for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and the Heads and Conquerors of the Kingdom, as they called themſelves; ſearched the out-houſes for Turkies, which they took from their eggs and young ones, Veal and Mutton being not good enough for them: They continued drinking and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, at, and after Supper, till moſt of them were mad-drunk, and ſome of them dead-drunk under the Table. Then they muſt have 14 beds provided for them (for they would lie but two in a bed) and all their linnen waſhed: My Siſter anſwering them, that there were not ſo many beds in the houſe, and that they muſt be content as other Souldiers had been, with ſuch beds as could be ſpared; they thereupon threatned to force open her chamber door, and to pull her and her children out of their beds, unleſſe ſhe would give them three ſhillings a peece for their beds, and next dayes quarters; and at laſt forced her for fear of their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence (being all drunk) to give them eighteen pence a piece, aſſoon as they were forth of doors, and ſix pence a peece the next day, if they marched not; whereupon they promiſed to trouble the Houſe no more. Upon this agreement all but eight (who were gone to bed) departed that night, and the reſt the next morning. But I going to the Lecture at <hi>Bath,</hi> ſome thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them in my abſence came about ten of the clock, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the moneys received of my Siſter for their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, re-entered the houſe, and would have Quarters again, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe would give them three ſhillings a peece; which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, they thereupon abuſed and beat the ſervants and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, forced them to drink with them all that day and night, ſwearing, curſing, roaring like ſo many Furies and Divels, brake open my Parlour, Milk-houſe, and Garden-doors, abuſed my Pictures and brake an hole in one of them; hacked my Table-boards with their ſwords from one end to the other, threw the chairs, ſtools, meat, drink about the houſe; aſſaulted my Siſter, and her little children and Maid-ſervants with their naked ſwords, threatning to kill them, and kick them to gelly, ſhot at them with their Muskets, forced them out of the Houſe to ſave their lives: which I hearing of, repaired to my houſe, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

them all ſo Bedlam mad, and that they would not hearken to any reaſon, nor be quieted, I thereupon rode to ſeek their Captain and Officers at <hi>Bath,</hi> who purpoſely abſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and not finding them till the next morning, I acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Captain then, (as I had done the firſt night by Letter) with all theſe unſufferable outrages of his Souldiers (contrary to the Generals Orders to carry themſelves civilly in their quarters, and abuſe none in word or deed) which would render him and them odious, not onely to the Country and Kingdom, but all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers who had any civility in them, and be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to the <hi>Generall,</hi> by whoſe Proclamation he ought to be preſent with his Company to keep them in good order, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of caſhiering: And therefore I expected and required Juſtice and Reparations at his hands; the rather, becauſe I was informed by ſome of his own Souldiers and others, that they had not been ſo barbarouſly rude, but by his incouragement, which if he refuſed, I ſhould complain of him to his Superiours, and right my ſelf the beſt way I might. After ſome expoſtulations, he promiſed to make them examples, and caſhier them, and remove them forthwith from my houſe: But the onely right I had, was, that more of his company repaired thither, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the ſpoil they could, and taking away ſome braſſe and Pewter, continuing there till neer four of the clock; and then marched away onely out of fear I would raiſe the Country upon them; many of whom profered me their aſſiſtance; but I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to forbear till I ſaw what their Officers would do; who in ſtead of puniſhing any of them, permitted them to play the like <hi>Rex</hi> almoſt in other places where they quartered ſince, marching but three or four miles a day, and extorting what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys they could from the Country by their violence and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Now, for me or any other to give moneys to maintain ſuch deboiſt <hi>Bedlams</hi> and <hi>Beaſts</hi> as theſe (<hi>who boasted of their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies and that they had done me at leaſt twenty pounds ſpoil in Beer and Proviſions, drinking out five barrels of good ſtrong Beer, and waſting as much meat as would have ſerved an hundred civill perſons)</hi> to be Maſters of our Houſes, Goods, Servants, Lives, and all we have, to ride over our heads like our Lords and Conquerours, and take Free quarter on us, amounting to at
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60650:15"/>
leaſt a full yeares contribution, without any allowance for it, and that ſince the laſt Orders againſt Free-quarter, and warrants for paying in this Tax to prevent it for the future, iſſued; is ſo far againſt my reaſon, Judgement and conſcience, that I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give all away to ſuppreſs, diſcard them, or caſt it into the fire then maintain ſuch graceleſs wretches with it to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, enſlave, conſume, ruine the Country and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; who every where complain of the like inſolences; and of taking free quarter ſince the 9 of <hi>June,</hi> as above two <hi>hundred</hi> of Colonel <hi>Coxe</hi> his men did in <hi>Bath</hi> the laſt <hi>Lords day</hi>; who drew up in a body about the <hi>Majors</hi> Houſe, and threatned <hi>to ſeiſe and carry him away priſoner for denying to give them free quarter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the New Act for aboliſhing it.</hi> Laſtly this pretended Act implies, that thoſe who refuſe to pay this contribution without diſtreſs or impriſonment ſhall be ſtil oppreſſed with freequarter: And what an height of oppreſſion and injuſtice this will prove not only to diſtrain &amp; impriſon thoſe who cannot in conſcience, Law or prudence ſubmit to this illegall Tax, but likewiſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe them by expoſing them to free-quarter, which themſelves condemne as the heighſt peſt and oppreſſion; let all ſober men conſider; and what reaſon I and others have to oppoſe ſuch a dangerous deſtructive preſident in its firſt appearing to the world.</p>
            <p>Ninethly, The principal end of impoſing this Tax to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Army and forces now raiſed, is not the defence and fafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our ancient and firſt Chriſtian Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> its Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, Laws, Liberties, and Religion, as at firſt, but to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the King of the Crown of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> (to which he hath an <hi>undoubted right by common and Statute Law</hi>; as the Parliament of 1 <hi>Jacobi.</hi> ch. 1. reſolves) and to levy war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to deprive him of it: To ſubvert the ancient Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Government of this Realm, under which our Anceſters have always lived and flouriſhed, to ſet up a <hi>New republick,</hi> the oppreſſions and greivances whereof we have already felt (by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing our Taxes, ſetting up arbitrary Courts and Proceedings to the taking away of the lives of the late King, Peers, and other Subjects againſt the Fundamental Laws of the Land, creating new monſtrous Treaſons never heard off in the world before, and

            <p>Tenthly, The payment of this Tax for the premiſed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, will (in my poor judgment and conſcience) be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to God and all good men, ſcandalous to the Proteſtant Religion, diſhonourable to our Engliſh Nation, and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious and deſtructive to our whole Kingdom, hindering the ſpeedy ſettlement of our Peace, the re-eſtabliſhment of our Laws and Government, eſtabliſhing of our Taxes, disbanding of our Forces, revivall of our decayed Trade, by the renewing and perpetuating our bloudy uncivill Warrs; engaging <hi>Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and all forreign Princes and Kingdoms in a juſt War againſt us, to avenge the death of our late beheaded King, the

diſ-inheriting of his poſterity, and reſtore his lawfull Heirs and Succeſſors to their juſt, undoubted Rights, from which they are now forcibly ſecluded; who will undoubtedly moleſt us with continuall Warrs (what-ever ſome may fondly conceit to the contrary) till they be ſetled in the Throne in peace upon juſt and honorable terms, and inveſted in their juſt poſſeſſions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can neither in conſcience, piety nor prudence, enſnare my ſelf in the guilt of all theſe dangerous conſequences, by any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to this illegall Tax.</p>
            <p>Upon all theſe weighty Reaſons, and ſerious grounds of Conſcience, Law, Prudence, (which I humbly ſubmit to the Conſciences and Judgments of all conſcientious and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons, whom they do or ſhall concern) I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by the aſſiſtance and ſtrength of that Omnipotent God (who hath miraculouſly ſupported me under, and carried me through all my former ſufferings for the Peoples publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties with exceeding joy, comfort, and the ruine of my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemies and Oppoſers) to oppugne this <hi>unlawfull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trbution,</hi> and the payment of it to the uttermoſt, in all juſt and lawfull wayes, I may; And if any will forcibly levie it by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe or otherwiſe, without Law or Right (as Theeves and Robbers take mens goods and Purſes) let them doe it at their own utmoſt perill. And I truſt God and men will in due ſeaſon doe me juſtice, and award me recompence for all the injuries in this kinde, and any ſufferings for my Countries Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.

            <p>Whence it is moſt apparent. 1. That the <hi>General, Liutenant General Cromwel, Ireton, Harriſon,</hi> and other Officers of the Army now ſitting as Members, and over-ruling all the reſt, have willingly acted againſt their own knowledges, Declarations, Judgments, Conſciences in ſuppreſſing the Lords Houſe; and depriving them of their <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and <hi>Juriſdictive</hi> Right and power, by preſuming to make Acts, paſs ſentences, and impoſe Taxes without them, or their aſſents in Parliament. 2. That this Tax enforced upon the Commons and Kingdom, for their own particular advantage, pay and enrichment, is in their own judgment and conſcience, both unjuſt and directly contrary to the Laws of the Realm, being not aſſented to by the <hi>Lords</hi>: and therefore to be unanimouſly and ſtrenuouſly oppoſed by all who love their own or Countries Liberty, or have any <hi>Nobility,</hi> or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity</hi> in them.</p>
            <q>Thirdly, he <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 34, 39, 40.56, 57.</note> there aſſerts in poſitive terms in his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and his confederates; That the purged Parliament now ſitting, is but, a <hi>pretended Parliament, a mock-Parliament</hi>; yea, <hi>and in plain Engliſh,</hi> NO PARLIAMENT AT ALL, <hi>but the ſhadow of a Parliament.</hi> That thoſe company of men at <hi>Weſtminſter, that gave Commiſſion to the High Court of Juſtice to try and behead the King, &amp;c. were no more a Parliament by Law, or Repreſentatives of the people, by the rules of Juſtice and Reaſon, then ſuch a company of men are a Parliament or Repreſentative of the People, that a company of armed Theeves chooſe and ſet apart to try, judge, condemn, hang, or behead any man that they pleaſe, or can prevail over by the power of their ſwords, to bring before them by force of arms, to have their lives taken away by pretence of Juſtice, grounded upon rules meerly flowing from their wills and ſwords.</hi> That no Law in <hi>England</hi> authoriſeth a company of ſervants to puniſh and correct their Maſters, or to give a Law unto them, or to throw them at their pleaſure out of their power, and ſet themſelves down in it; which is the Armies caſe with the Parliament, eſpecially at <hi>Thomas Pride</hi>'s late purge, which was an abſolute diſſolution of the very Eſſence and being of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60650:19"/>
Houſe of Commons: to ſet up indeed a <hi>MOCK-POWER,</hi> and a <hi>MOCK-PARLIAMENT</hi>; by purging out all thoſe, that they were any way jealous of, would not Vote as they would have them; and ſuffering and permitting none to ſit but (for the major part of them) <hi>a company of abſolute School-boys, that will, like good Boys, ſay their Leſſons after them their Lords and Maſters, and vote what they would have them</hi>: and ſo be a skreen betwixt them and the people, with the <hi>name of Parliament,</hi> and the ſhadow and imperfect image of legall and juſt Authority to pick their pockets for them by <hi>Aſſeſſments</hi> and <hi>Taxations</hi>; and by their <hi>arbitrary</hi> and <hi>tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Courts and Committees</hi> (the beſt of which is now become a perfect <hi>Star-chamber, High-Commiſſion,</hi> and <hi>Councel-board</hi>) make them their perfect <hi>ſlaves</hi> and <hi>vaſſals.</hi> With much more to this purpoſe.</q>
            <p>If then their Principall admirers, who confederated with the Army, and thoſe now ſitting, in all their late proceedings; and cryed them up moſt of any, as the Parliament and ſupreme Authority of <hi>England,</hi> before, at and ſince the late force upon the Houſe, and its violent purgation, doe thus in print profeſſedly diſclaim them, for being any reall <hi>Parliament</hi> or Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> to make <hi>Acts</hi> or impoſe <hi>Taxes</hi> upon the people; the ſecluded <hi>Members, Presbyterians, Royalliſts,</hi> and all others, have much more cauſe and ground to diſavow and oppoſe their uſurped Parliamentary authority and illegall Taxes Acts, as not made by any true <hi>Engliſh Parliament,</hi> but a <hi>Mock-Parliament</hi> only.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He therein further averrs: <q>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 52.53.56.57.58.59.</note> 
                  <hi>That the death of the King in Law indiſputably diſſolves this Parliament,</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>though it had been all the time before never ſo intire and unquestionable to that very houre.</hi> That no Neceſſity can be pretended for the continuance of it; the rather, becauſe the men that would have it continue ſo long, as they pleaſe, are thoſe who have created theſe neceſſities on purpoſe, that by the colour thereof they may make themſelves great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. That the main end wherefore the Members of the Commons houſe were choſen and ſent thither, was, <hi>To hear and conferr with King Charles and the Houſe of Peers, about the great affairs of the Nation, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore are but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60650:19"/>
a third part, or third eſtate of that Parliament, to which they were to come and joyn with, and who were legally to make paramount and binding Laws for the people of the Nation. And therefore having taken away two of the three Eſtates that they were choſen on purpoſe to joyn with to make Laws; the end both in reaſon and Law of the peoples truſt is ceaſed: for a Minor joyned with a Major for one and the ſame end, cannot play Lord paramount over the Major, and then do what it pleaſe; no more can the Minor or a Major; <hi>viz.</hi> one Eſtate of three, legally or juſtly deſtroy two of three, without their own aſſent, &amp;c. That the Houſe of Commons ſitting freely within it's limited time, in all its ſplendor of glory, without the awe of armed men, neither in Law, nor in the intention of their Chooſers were a Parliament; and therefore of themſelves alone have no pretence in Law to alter the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Parliaments, &amp;c. concluding thus: <hi>For ſhame</hi> let no man be ſo audaciouſly or ſottiſhly void of reaſon, as to call <hi>Tho. Prides</hi> pittifull Junto <hi>A PARLIAMENT,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that called, avowed, proteſted and declared again &amp; again thoſe TO BE NONE that ſate at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the 26, 27. &amp;c. of <hi>July</hi> 1647. when a few of their Members were ſcared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the Army, by a few hours tumult of a company of a few diſorderly Apprentices. And being no repreſentative of the People, much leſs A PARLIAMENT, what pretence of Law, Reaſon, Juſtice or Nature can there be for you to alter the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Parliaments, and force upon the people the ſhew of their own wills, luſts and pleaſures for Lawes and Rules of Government, made by a PRETENDED, EVERLASTING, NULLED PARLIAMENT, a Councel of State, or Star cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and a Councel of War, or rather by <hi>Fairfax, Cromwel,</hi> and <hi>Ireton.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if their own late confederates and creatures argue thus in print againſt their continuing a Parliament, Juriſdiction, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, Taxes, and arbitrary pleaſures, ſhould not all others much more doe it, and oppoſe them to the utmoſt upon the ſelf-ſame grounds?</p>
            <q>Fifthly, He there likewiſe affirms, <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 53.54.59 41.</note> That thoſe now ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have perverted the ends of their truſts more
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60650:20"/>
then ever <hi>Strafford</hi> did: 1. In not eaſing the people of, (but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing) their greivances. 2. In exhauſting of their Eſtates to maintain and promote pernitious Deſigns to the peoples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The King did it by a little <hi>Ship-money</hi> and <hi>Monopolies</hi>; but ſince they began, they have raiſed and extorted more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from the people and Nation then half the Kings ſince the Conqueſt ever did; as particularly: 1. by <hi>exciſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> 3. <hi>Sequeſtrations of lands to an infinite value.</hi> 4. <hi>Fift parts.</hi> 5. <hi>Twenty parts.</hi> 6. <hi>Meal-mony.</hi> 7. <hi>Sale of the plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red goods.</hi> 8. <hi>Lones.</hi> 9. <hi>Benevolences.</hi> 10. <hi>Collections upon their faſt days.</hi> 11. <hi>New impoſitions or cuſtoms upon Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.</hi> 12. <hi>Guards maintained upon the charge of private men.</hi> 13. <hi>Fifty Subſidies at one time.</hi> 14. <hi>Compoſitions with Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents to an infinite value.</hi> 15. <hi>Sale of Biſhops lands.</hi> 16. <hi>Sale of dean and Chapters lands:</hi> and now after the wars are done. 17. <hi>Sale of King, Queen, Prince, Duke, and the reſt of the Childrens revenues.</hi> 18. <hi>Sale of their rich goods which coſt an infinite ſum.</hi> 19.

that ſaying of the ſpirit of God, <hi>That whoſo hath this worlds goods, and ſeeth his brother hath need, and ſhutteth up his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of compaſſion from him</hi> (which he abſolutely doth that any way takes a little of his little from him) <hi>how dwelleth the love of God in him</hi>) 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.17.

Without all doubt, theſe pretended, Godly Religious men, have got a degree beyond thoſe <hi>Atheſts</hi> or <hi>Fools, that ſay in their hearts, there is no God. Pſal.</hi> 14.1. and 53.1.3.

Now the intent of the Makers of this act, and the end of enacting it, was not to prevent the diſſolution of this Parliament by the Kings death (no ways intimated or inſinuated in any clauſe thereof, being a clear unavoidable diſſolution of it to all intents not provided for by this Law) but by any writ, or Proclamation of the King by his Regal power without conſent of both Houſes; which I ſhall manifeſt by theſe enſuing reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, from the principal occaſion of making this act. The King (as the <hi>Commons</hi> in their <note n="*" place="margin">Exact Collect. p. 5.6.</note>

Now the fear and preventing of the like diſſolution, prorogation or adjournment of this Parliament after the Scotiſh Armies disbanding, before the things mentioned in the preamble were effected by the Kings abſolute power, was the only gronud and occaſion of this law (not any fear or thoughts of its diſſolution by the Kings untimely death, then not ſo much as imagined being before the wars or Iriſh Rebellion brake

            </p>
            <p>In which paſſages we have a clear reſolution of the Commons themſelves, immediately after the paſſing of this Act; that the ſcope and intention of it was only to provide againſt the Kings <hi>abrupt diſſolution of the Parliament by the meer royal power in ſuſpending the execution of it for this time and occaſion only</hi>; and that <hi>for the Kings own ſecurity,</hi> (not his Heirs and Succeſſors) <hi>as wel as his peoples peace and ſafety.</hi> Therefore not againſt any diſſolutions of it by his natural (much leſſe his violent) death; which can no ways be interpreted, <hi>an Act of his Royal power,</hi> which they intended hereby, <hi>not to take out of the Crown, but only to ſuſpend the execution of it for this time and occaſion, and that for his ſecurity:</hi> but a natural <hi>impotency,</hi> or <hi>unnatural diſloyalty,</hi> which not only ſuſpends the execution of the Kings power for a time, but utterly deſtroys and takes away him and it without hopes of revival for ever.</p>

And therefore this title and act coupling adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, proroguing and diſſolving this Parliament together without conſent of both Houſes, by act of Parliament, intended only a diſſolution of this Parliament by ſuch Prerogative wayes and meanes by which Parliaments had formerly been untimely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed and prorogued as well as diſſolved by the Kings meer will without their aſſents; not of a diſſolution of it by the Kings death which never adjourned nor prorogued any Parliament, nor diſſolved any formerly ſitting Parliament in this Kings reign, or his Anceſtors ſince the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th; the only Parliament we read of diſſolved by death of the King ſince the conqueſt; and ſo a miſchief not intended nor remedied by Act.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The prologue of the act implies as much; <hi>Whereas great ſums of money muſt of neceſſity be</hi> SPEEDILY <hi>advanced &amp; procured for the relief of</hi> HIS MAJESTIES ARMY and PEOPLE (not his Heirs or Succeſſors) <hi>in the Northern parts</hi>: &amp;c.

And ſo it muſt neceſſarily be diſſolved by his Death.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This is moſt clear by the body of the Act it ſelf: <hi>And be it declared and enacted</hi> By THE KING OUR SOVERAGIN LORD, with the aſſent of the LORDS &amp; Commonsin this PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENT PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED, &amp; by the authority of the ſame, That <hi>THIS PRESENT PARLIAMENT NOW AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEMBLED,</hi> ſhall not be <hi>DISSOLVED</hi> unleſſe it be By <hi>ACT OF PARLIAMENT TO BE PASSED FOR THAT P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RPOSE</hi>; nor ſhall any time or times <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RING THE CONTIN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ANCE THEREOF BE PROROG<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ED OR ADJO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RNED</hi> unleſs it be By ACT OF PARLIAMENT to be likewiſe PASSED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

               <hi>day in Law:</hi> but to make proviſion only againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely diſſolving of this, till the things mentioned in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble were accompliſhed and ſetled; as the Preamble, and thoſe oft repeated words, any time or times, <hi>during the continuance of this preſent Parliament,</hi> conclude; and that during His Majeſties Reign and life, not after his <hi>death</hi>; as theſe words coupled with, <hi>The relief of His Majeſties Army and People; and for ſupply of His Majeſties preſent and urgent occaſions,</hi> in the <hi>Preamble</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. Therefore this Act can no wayes continue it a Parliament after the Kings beheading; much leſs after the excluſion both of the King and Lords Houſe out of Parliament by thoſe now ſitting, contrary to the very letter and proviſion of this Act; by which deviſe the King alone, had he conquered and cut off, or ſecluded by his Forces the Lords and Commons houſe from ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, might with much more colour have made himſelf an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Parliament to impoſe what Taxes and Lawes he pleaſed, without Lords or Commons on the people by vertue of this Act, then thoſe few Commons now ſitting ſince his tryall and death doe. 6. The laſt clauſe of this Act: <hi>And that all and every thing or things whatſoever</hi> DONE OR TO BE DONE (to wit by the King or His authority) <hi>for the adjournment,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing or diſſolving of <hi>THIS PRESENT PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, CONTRARY TO THIS PRESENT ACT, SHALL BE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TTERLY VOID</hi> and of <hi>NONE EFFECT</hi>: Now death, and a diſſolution of this Parliament by the Kings death, cannot (as to the King) be properly ſtiled, <hi>A thing done or to be done</hi> (by Him) for the adjournment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing or diſſolving of this Parliament, <hi>contrary to this preſent Act</hi>; which cannot make the <hi>Kings death utterly void and of none effect,</hi> by reſtoring him to his life again. Therefore the diſſolution of the Parliament by the Kings death, is clearly out of the words and intentions of this Act, eſpecially ſo many years
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60650:27"/>
after its Enacting. 7. This preſent Parliament and every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof, being ſpecially ſummoned by the Kings <hi>Writ,</hi> only to be HIS <hi>Parliament and Councell, and to conferre with</hi> HIM <hi>of the great and urgent affaires concerning</hi> HIM <hi>and</hi> HIS <hi>Kingdom</hi>; and theſe Writs and Elections of them, returned unto HIM and HIS COURT by Indenture, and the perſons ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and choſen by vertue of them appearing only in HIS Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for no other ends but thoſe expreſſed in HIS WRITS; it would be both an abſurdity and abſolute impoſſibility to aſſert, that the Houſes intended by this Act to continue this Parliament in being after the Kings beheading or death: unleſs they that maintain this paradox be able to inform me and thoſe now ſitting, how they can conferr and adviſe wirh a <hi>dead King</hi> of <hi>things</hi> concerning <hi>Him and His</hi> Kingdom; and that even after they have extirpated Monarchy it ſelf, and made it Treaſon to aſſert or revive it; and how they can continue ſtill HIS <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Councell</hi> whoſe head they have cut off: and that without reviving or raiſing him from his grave, or enſtalling His <hi>right Heir and Succeſſor in His Throne</hi> to repreſent His Perſon; neither of which they dare to doe, for fear of loſing their own <hi>Heads and Quarters</hi> too, for beheading him. This Tax therefore being impoſed on the Kingdom long after the Kings beheading, and the Parliaments diſſolution by it, muſt needs be illegall and meerly void in Law to all intents; becauſe not granted nor impoſed in, but out of Parliament; by thoſe who were then no Commons nor Members of a Parliament, and had no more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to impoſe any Tax upon the Kingdom, then any other forty or fifty Commoners whatſoever out of Parliament, who may uſurp the like authority by this preſident to Tax the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or any County what they pleaſe, and then Levy it by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or force of Armes, to the peoples infinite, endleſs oppreſſion and undoing: This is my firſt and principall exception againſt the Legality of this Tax, which I deſire the Impoſers and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyers of it moſt ſeriouſly to conſider; and that upon theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conſiderations from their own late <hi>Declarations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, themſelves in their own <hi>Declaration</hi> of the 9th February, 1648. have proteſted to the whole Kingdom: <hi>That they are fully reſolved to maintain, and shall and will uphold, preſerve, and keep the fundamentall Lawes of this Nation, for, and concerning
