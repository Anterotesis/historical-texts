         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE
ROBERT
EARL OF
Sunderland,
Principall Secretary of State, One of
His Majesties most Honourable
Privy Council, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce I cannot promise you much of Poetry in my Play, 'tis but
reasonable that I shou'd secure you from any part of it in my
Dedication. And indeed I cannot better distinguish the exactness
of your taste from that of other men, than by the plainness and
sincerity of my Address. I must keep my Hyperboles in reserve for men
of other understandings: An hungry Appetite after praise: and a
strong digestion of it, will bear the grossnesse of that diet: But one
of so criticall a judgement as your Lordship, who can set the bounds of
just and proper in every subject, would give me small encouragement
for so bold an undertaking. I more than suspect, my Lord, that you
wou'd not do common Justice to your self: and therefore, were I to
give that Character of you, which I think you truly merit, I wou'd
make my appeal from your Lordship to the Reader, and wou'd justify
my self from flattery by the publique voice, whatever protestation you
might enter to the contrary. But <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> find I am to take other measures with
your Lordship; I am to stand upon my guard with you, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
you as warily as <hi>Horace</hi> did <hi>Augustus.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <pb facs="tcp:65973:3"/>
Cui male si palpere, recalcitrat undique tutus.</q>
            <p>An ill tim'd, or an extravagant commendation, wou'd not pass upon
you: but you wou'd keep off such a Dedicator at arms end; and send
him back with his <hi>Encomiums,</hi> to this Lord, or that Lady, who stood
in need of such triffling merchandise. You see, my Lord, what an awe
you have upon me, when I dare not offer you that incense, which wou'd
be acceptable to other Patrons: but am forc'd to curb my self, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
to you those honours, which even an Enemy cou'd not deny
you. Yet I must confess I never practis'd that virtue of moderation
(which is properly your Character) with so much reluctancy as
now. For it hinders me from being true to my own knowledge, in not
witnessing your worth; and deprives me of the only means which I had
left to shew the world that true honour and uninteressed respect which
I have always payed you. I would say somewhat, if it were possible,
which might distinguish that veneration have for you, from the
flatteries of those who adore your fortune. But the eminence of
your condition, in this particular, is my unhappiness: for it renders
whatever I would say suspected. Professions of Service, submissions,
and attendance, are the practise of all men to the great: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
they who have the least sincerity, perform them best; as
they who are least ingag'd in love, have their tongues the freest to
counterfeit a passion: for my own part, I never cou'd shake off the
rustique bashfulness which hangs upon my nature; but valluing my
self, at as little as I am worth, have been affraid to render even
the common duties of respect to those who are in power. The Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious
visits which are generally payed on such occasions, are
not my tallent. They may be real even in Courtiers; but they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with such a face of interest, that a modest man wou'd think
himself in danger of having his sincerity mistaken for his design.
My congratulations keep their distance, and pass no farther than
my heart. There it is, that I have all the joy imaginable when I see
true worth rewarded; and virtue uppermost in the world.</p>
            <p>If therefore there were one to whom I had the honour to be
known; and to know him so perfectly, that I could say without
flattery, he had all the depth of understanding that was requisite
in any able Statesman, and all that honesty which commonly is
wanting; that he was brave without vanity, and knowing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
positiveness: that he was loyall to his Prince, and a lover of
his Country; that his principles were full of moderation, and all
his Councils such as tended to heal and not to widen the breaches
of the Nation: that in all his conversation there appear'd a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
candour, and a desire of doing good in all his actions; if such
<pb facs="tcp:65973:3"/>
an one whom I have describ'd; were at the helm, if he had risen
by his merits, and were chosen out in the necessity and pressure of
affairs, to remedy our confusions by the seasonableness of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and to put a stop to our ruine, when we were just rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
downward to the precipice, I shou'd then congratulate the Age
in which I liv'd, for the common safety; I should not despair
of the Republique though <hi>Hannibal</hi> were at the gates; I should
send up my vows for the success of such an action as <hi>Virgil</hi> did on
the like occasion for his Patron, when he was raising up his country
from the desolations of a civill war.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Hunc saltem everso juvenem succurrere seclo,</l>
               <l>Ne superi prohibete.</l>
            </q>
            <p>I know not whether I am running, in this extasy which is now
upon me: I am almost ready to reassume the ancient rights of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry;
to point out, and Prophecy the man, who was born for
no lesse an undertaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whom posterity shall bless for its
accomplishment. Methinks I am already taking fire from such a
Character, and making room for him, under a borrow'd name
amongst the Heroes of an <hi>Epique</hi> Poem. Neither could mine, or
some more happy Genius, want encouragement under such a
Patron.</p>
            <q>Pollio amat nostram, quamvis sit rustica Musam.</q>
            <p>But these are considerations afar off my Lord: the former part
of the Prophecy must be first accomplish'd: the quiet of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation
must be secur'd; and a mutuall trust, betwixt Prince and people be
renew'd: and then this great and good man will have leisure for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of peace: and make our language as much indebted to his care,
as the French is to the memorie of their famous <hi>Richelieu.</hi> You know
My Lord, how low he lay'd the foundations of so great a work:
That he began it with a <hi>Grammar</hi> and a <hi>Dictionary;</hi> without
which all those Remarques and Observations, which have since
been made, had been perform'd to as little purpose as it wou'd
be to consider the furniture of the Rooms before the contrivance
of the House. Propriety must first be stated, ere any measures of
elegance can be taken. Neither is one <hi>Vaugelas</hi> sufficient for
such a work. 'Twas the employment of the whole Academy
for many years, for the perfect knowledge of a Tongue, was
never attain'd by any single person. The Court, the Colledge,
and the Town, must be joyn'd in it. And as our English is a
composition of the dead and living Tongues, there is requir'd a
<pb facs="tcp:65973:4"/>
perfect knowledge, not onely of the Greek and Latine, but of
the Old German, the French and the Italian: and to help all
these, a conversation with those Authours of our own, who have
written with the fewest faults in prose and verse. But how bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously
we yet write and speak, your Lordship knows, and I
am sufficiently sensible in my own English. For I am often put
to a stand, in considering whether what I write be the Idiom of
the Tongue, or false <hi>Grammar,</hi> and nonsence couch'd beneath that
specious Name of <hi>Anglieisme.</hi> And have no other way to clear
my doubts, but by translating my English into Latine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
trying what sence the words will bear in a more stable lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
I am desirous if it were possible, that we might all write
with the same certainty of words and purity of phrase, to which
the Italians first arriv'd, and after them the French: At least
that we might advance so far, as our Tongue is capable of such
a standard. It wou'd mortify an English man to consider, that
from the time of <hi>Boccace</hi> and of <hi>Petrarche,</hi> the Italian has varied
very little: And that the English of <hi>Chaucer</hi> their contemporary
is not to be understood without the help of an Old <hi>Dictionary.</hi>
But their Goth and Vandall had the fortune to be graffed on a
Roman stock: Ours has the disadvantage, to be founded on the
Dutch. We are full of Monosyllables, and those clog'd with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonants,
and our pronunciation is effeminate. All which are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to a sonnding language: 'Tis true that to supply our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
we have trafficqued with our Neighbour Nations; by
which means we abound as much in words, as <hi>Amsterdam</hi> does in
Religions; but to order them, and make them usefull after their
admission is the difficulty. A greater progress has been made in
this, since his Majesties return, then perhaps since the conquest to
his time. But the better part of the work remains unfinish'd:
And that which has been done already, since it has only been in
the practise of some few writers, must be digested into Rules
and Method; before it can be profitable to the General.
Will your Lordship give me leave to speak out at last? and to
acquaint the world, that from your encouragement and patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
we may one day expect to speak and write a language,
worthy of the English wit, and which foreigners may not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
to learn. Your birth, your Education, your naturall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
the former Employments which you have had abroad,
and that which to the joy of good men you now exercise at
home, seem all to conspire to this design: the Genius of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
seems to call you out as it were by name, to polish and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
your native language, and to take from it the reproach of
its barbarity. 'Tis upon this encouragement that I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
<pb facs="tcp:65973:4"/>
on the following Critique, which I humbly present you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Play: In which, though I have not had the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
nor indeed the encouragement to proceed to the Principal
Subject of it, which is the words and thoughts that are sutable
to Tragedie; yet the whole discourse has a tendency that
way, and is preliminary to it. In what I have already done, I
doubt not but I have contradicted some of my former opinions,
in my loose Essays of the like nature: but of this, I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that it is the fruit of my riper age and experience, and
that self-love, or envy have no part in it. The application to
English Authours is my own, and therein perhaps I may have
err'd unknowingly: But the foundation of the rules is reason, and
the authority of those living Critiques who have had the honour
to be known to you abroad, as well as of the Ancients, who are
not lesse of your acquaintance. Whatsoever it be, I submit it to
your Lordships Judgment, from which I never will appeal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be to your good nature, and your candour. If you can
allow an hour of leisure to the perusal of it, I shall be fortunate
that I cou'd so long entertain you; if not, I shall at least have
the satisfaction to know, that your time was more usefully employ'd
upon the publique. I am,</p>

            <head>The PREFACE to the Play.</head>
            <p>THe Poet <hi>Aeschylus</hi> was held in the same veneration by the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> of after Ages as <hi>Shakespear</hi> is by us; and <hi>Longinus</hi> has
judg'd, in favour of him, that he had a noble boldnesse of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and that his imaginations were lofty and Heroick: but on
the other side <hi>Quintilian</hi> affirms, that he was daring to extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.
'Tis certain, that he affected pompous words, and that his sence too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
was obscur'd by Figures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Notwithstanding these imperfections, the value
of his Writings after his decease was such, that his Countrymen ordain'd an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
reward to those Poets who could alter his Plays to be Acted on the Theater,
with those whose productions were wholly new, and of their own. The case is
not the same in <hi>England;</hi> though the difficulties of altering are greater, and
our reverence for <hi>Shakespear</hi> much more just, then that of the <hi>Grecians</hi> for
<hi>Aeschylus.</hi> In the Age of that Poet, the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue was arriv'd to its full
perfection; they had then amongst them an exact Standard of Writing, and of
Speaking: The <hi>English</hi> Language is not capable of such a certainty; and we
are at present so far from it, that we are wanting in the very Foundation of it,
a perfect Grammar. Yet it must be allow'd to the present Age, that the tongue in
general is so much refin'd since <hi>Shakespear's</hi> time, that many of his words, and
more of his Phrases, are scarce intelligible. And of those which we understand
some are ungrammatical, others course; and his whole stile is so pester'd with
Figurative expressions, that it is as affected as it is obscure. 'Tis true, that in
his later Plays he had worn off somewhat of the rust; but the Tragedy which I
have undertaken to correct, was, in all prrbability, one of his first endeavours
on the Stage.</p>
            <p>The Original story was Written by one <hi>Lollius</hi> a <hi>Lombard,</hi>
in Latin verse,
and Translated by <hi>Chaucer</hi> into English: intended I suppose a Satyr on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy
of Women: I find nothing of it among the Ancients; not so much as the
name once <hi>Cressida</hi> mention'd. <hi>Shakespear,</hi> (as I hinted) in the Aprenticeship
of his Writing, model'd it into that Play, which is now call'd by the name of
<hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Cressida;</hi> but so lamely is it left to us, that it is not divided into
Acts: which fault I ascribe to the Actors, who printed it after <hi>Shakespear's</hi>
death; and that too, so carelesly, that a more uncorrect Copy I never saw. For
the Play it self, the Author seems to have begun it with some fire; the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of <hi>Pandarus</hi> and <hi>Thersites,</hi> are promising enough; but as if he grew
weary of his task, after an Entrance or two, he lets 'em fall: and the later
part of the Tragedy is nothing but a confusion of Drums and Trumpets, Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Alarms. The chief persons, who give name to the Tragedy, are
left alive: <hi>Cressida</hi> is false, and is not punish'd. Yet after all, because the
Play was <hi>Shakespear's,</hi> and that there appear'd in some places of it, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Genius of the Author; I undertook to remove that heap of Rubbish, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which many excellent thoughts lay wholly bury'd. Accordingly, I new
model'd the Plot; threw out many unnecessary persons; improv'd those Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb facs="tcp:65973:5"/>
which were begun, and left unfinish'd: as <hi>Hector, Troilus, Panda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
and <hi>Thersites;</hi> and added that of <hi>Andromache.</hi> After this, I made
with no small trouble, an Order and Connexion of all the Scenes; removing
them from the places where they were inartificially set: and though it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to keep 'em all unbroken, because the Scene must be sometimes in the City,
and sometimes in the Camp, yet I have so order'd them that there is a coherence
of 'em with one another, and a dependence on the main design: no leaping from
<hi>Troy</hi> to the Grecian Tents, and thence back again in the same Act; but a due
proportion of time allow'd for every motion. I need not say that I have refin'd
his Language, which before was obsolete; but I am willing to acknowledg, that as
I have often drawn his English nearer to our times So I have sometimes conform'd
my own to his: &amp; consequently, the Language is not altogether so pure, as it is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant.
The Scenes of <hi>Pandarus</hi> and <hi>Cressida,</hi> of <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Pandarus,</hi> of
<hi>Andromache</hi> with <hi>Hector</hi> and the Trojans, in the second Act, are wholly
<hi>New:</hi> together with that of <hi>Nestor</hi> and <hi>Ulysses</hi> with <hi>Thersites;</hi> and that
of <hi>Thersites,</hi> with <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Achilles.</hi> I will not weary my Reader with the
Scenes which are added of <hi>Pandarus</hi> and the Lovers, in the Third; and those
of <hi>Thersites,</hi> which are wholly alter'd: but I cannot omit the last Scene in it,
which is almost half the Act, betwixt <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Hector.</hi> The occasion of
raising it was hinted to me by Mr. <hi>Betterton:</hi> the contrivance and
working of it was my own. They who think to do me an injury, by saying that
it is an imitation of the Scene betwixt <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> do me an honour, by
supposing I could imitate the incomparable <hi>Shakespear:</hi> but let me add, that if
<hi>Shakespears</hi> Scene, or that faulty Copy of it in <hi>Amintor</hi> and <hi>Melantius</hi> had
never been, yet <hi>Euripides</hi> had furnish'd me with an excellent example in his
<hi>Iphigenia,</hi> between <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Menelaus:</hi> and from thence indeed,
the last turn of it is borrow'd. The occasion which <hi>Shakespear, Euripides,</hi> and
<hi>Fletcher,</hi> have all taken, is the same; grounded upon Friendship: and the
quarrel of two virtuous men, rais'd by natural degrees, to the extremity of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
is conducted in all three, to the declination of the same passion; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
with a warm renewing of their Friendship. But the particular ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
which <hi>Shakespear</hi> has taken, is incomparably the best: Because he has
not only chosen two the greatest Heroes of their Age; but has likewise interested
the Liberty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their own honors, who were the redeemers of it, in this
debate. And if he has made <hi>Brutus</hi> who was naturally a patient man, to fly
into excess at first; let it be remembred in his defence, that just before, he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the news of <hi>Portia's</hi> death: whom the Poet on purpose neglecting a little
Chronology, supposes to have dy'd before <hi>Brutus,</hi> only to give him an occasion
of being more easily exasperated. Add to this, that the injury he had receiv'd
from <hi>Cassius,</hi> had long been brooding in his mind; and that a melancholy man,
upon consideration of an affront, especially from a Friend, would be more eager
in his passion, than he who had given it, though naturally more cholerick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi>
whom I have follow'd, has rais'd the quarrel betwixt two Brothers
who were friends. The foundation of the Scene was this: The Grecians were
wind-bound at the Port of <hi>Aulis,</hi> and the Oracle had said, that they could not
<pb facs="tcp:65973:6"/>
Sail, unless <hi>Agamemnon</hi> deliver'd up his Daughter to be Sacrific'd: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses;
his Brother <hi>Menelaus</hi> urges the publick safety, the Father defends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
by arguments of natural affection, and hereupon they quarrel. <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> is at last convinc'd, and promises to deliver up <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> but so passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
laments his loss, that <hi>Menelaus</hi> is griev'd to have been the occasion of
it, and by a return of kindness, offers to intercede for him with the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
that his Daughter might not be sacrific'd. But my friend Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> has so
largly, and with so much judgement describ'd this Scene, in comparing it with
that of <hi>Melantius</hi> and <hi>Amintor,</hi> that it is superfluous to say more of it: I only
nam'd the heads of it, that any reasonable man might judge it was from thence
I model'd my Scene betwixt <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Hector.</hi> I will conclude my reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on it, with a passage of <hi>Longinus,</hi> concerning <hi>Plato's</hi> imitation of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi>
               <q>We ought not to regard a good imitation as a theft; but as a beautifull
Idea of him who undertakes to imitate, by forming himself on the invention and
the work of another man; for he enters into the lists like a new wrestler, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the prize with the former Champion. This sort of emulation says <hi>Hesiod,</hi>
is honourable <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—When we combat for Victory with
a Hero, and are not without glory even in our overthrow. Those great men
whom we propose to our selves as patterns of our imitation, serve us as a Torch,
which is lifted up before us, to enlighten our passage; and often elevate our
thoughts as high, as the conception we have of our Authors Genius.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have been so tedious in three Acts, that I shall contract my self in the two
last. The beginning Scenes of the fourth Act are either added, or chang'd
wholly by me; the middle of it is <hi>Shakespear</hi> alter'd, and mingled with my
own, three or four of the last Scenes are altogether new. And the whole Fifth
Act, both the Plot and the Writing are my own Additions.</p>
            <p>But having written so much for imitation of what is excellent, in that part
of the <hi>Preface</hi> which related only to my self; methinks it would neither be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
nor unpleasant to enquire how far we ought to imitate our own Poets,
<hi>Shakespear</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> in their Tragedies: And this will occasion another
enquiry, how those two Writers differ between themselves: but since neither
of these questions can be solv'd unless some measures be first taken, by which we
may be enabled to judge truly of their Writings: I shall endeavour as briefly as
I can, to discover the grounds and reason of all Criticism, applying them in this
place only to Tragedy. <hi>Aristotle</hi> with his Interpreters, and <hi>Horace,</hi> and
<hi>Longinus,</hi> are the Authors to whom I owe my lights; and what part soever
of my own Plays, or of this, which no mending could make regular, shall fall
under the condemnation of such Iudges, it would be impudence in me to defend.
I think it no shame to retract my errors, and am well pleas'd to suffer in the cause,
if the Art may be improv'd at my expence: I therefore proceed to,</p>
            <div type="essay">
               <head>The Grounds of Criticism in Tragedy.</head>
               <p>TRagedy is thus defin'd by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (omiting what I thought unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in his Definition.) 'Tis an imitation of one intire, great, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
action; not told but represented, which by moving in us fear and pity, is
<pb facs="tcp:65973:6"/>
conducive to the purging of these two passions in our minds. More largly thus,
Tragedy describes or paints <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Action, which Action must have all the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
above nam'd. First, it must be one or single, that is, it must not be a
History of one Mans life: Suppose of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, or <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi>
but one single action of theirs. This condemns all <hi>Shakespears</hi> Historical Plays,
which are rather Chronicles represented, than Tragedies, and all double acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Plays. As to avoid a Satyr upon others, I will make bold with my
own <hi>Marriage-A-la-Mode,</hi> where there are manifestly two Actions, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on one another: but in <hi>Oedipus</hi> there cannot properly be said to be
two Actions, because the love of <hi>Adrastus</hi> and <hi>Euridice</hi> has a necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on the principal design, into which it is woven. The natural reason of
this Rule is plain, for two different independant actions, distract the attention
and concernment of the Audience, and consequently destroy the intention of the
Poet: If his business be to move terror and pity, and one of his Actions be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,
the other Tragical, the former will divert the people, and utterly make
void his greater purpose. Therefore as in Perspective, so in Tragedy, there
must be a point of sight in which all the lines terminate: Otherwise the eye wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and the work is false. This was the practice of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Stage. But
<hi>Terence</hi> made an innovation in the <hi>Roman:</hi> all his Plays have double Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for it was his custome to Translate two Greek Comedies, and to weave
them into one of his, yet so, that both the Actions were Comical; and one was
principal, the other but secondary or subservient. And this has obtain'd on the
<hi>English</hi> Stage, to give us the pleasure of variety.</p>
               <p>As the Action ought to be one, it ought as such, to have Order in it, that
is, to have a natural beginning, a middle, and an end: A natural beginning
says <hi>Aristotle,</hi> is that which could not necessarily have been plac'd after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, and so of the rest. This consideration will arraign all Plays after the
new model of <hi>Spanish</hi> Plots, where accident is heap'd upon accident, and that
which is first might as reasonably be last: an inconvenience not to be remedyed,
but by making one accident naturally produce another, otherwise 'tis a Farce,
and not a Play. Of this nature, is the <hi>Slighted Maid;</hi> where there is no Scene
in the first Act, which might not by as good reason be in the fifth. And if the
Action ought to be one, the Tragedy ought likewise to conclude with the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. Thus in <hi>Mustapha,</hi> the Play should naturally have ended with the
death of <hi>Zanger,</hi> and not have given us the grace Cup after Dinner, of <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> divorce from <hi>Roxolana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The following properties of the Action are so easy, that they need not my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining.
It ought to be great, and to consist of great Persons, to distinguish it
from Comedy; where the Action is trivial, and the persons of inferior rank.
The last quality of the action is, that it ought to be probable, as well as admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and great. 'Tis not necessary that there should be Historical truth in it;
but always necessary that there should be a likeness of truth, something that is
more then barely possible, probable being that which succeds or happens oftner
than it mi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es. To invent therefore a probability, and to make it wonderfull, is
the most difficult undertaking in the Art of Poetry: for that which is not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull,
<pb facs="tcp:65973:7"/>
is not great, and that which is not probable, will not delight a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Audience. This action thus describ'd, must be represented and not told,
to distinguish Dramatic Poetry from Epic: but I hasten to the end, or scope
of Tragedy; which is to rectify or purge our passions, fear and pity.</p>
               <p>To instruct delightfully is the general end of all Poetry: Philosophy instructs,
but it performs its work by precept: which is not delightfull, or not so delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as Example. To purge the passions by Example, is therefore the particular
instruction which belongs to Tragedy. <hi>Rapin</hi> a judicious Critic, has observ'd
from <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that pride and want of commiseration are the most predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
vices in Mankinde: therefore to cure us of these two, the inventors of
Tragedy, have chosen to work upon two other passions, which are fear and
pity. We are wrought to fear, by their seting before our eyes some terrible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of misfortune, which hapned to persons of the highest Quality; for such
an action demonstrates to us, that no condition is privileg'd from the turns of
Fortune: this must of necessity cause terror in us, and consequently abate our
pride. But when we see that the most virtuous, as well as the greatest, are not
exempt from such misfortunes, that consideration moves pity in us: and insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
works us to be helpfull to, and tender over the distress'd, which is the
noblest and most God-like of moral virtues. Here 'tis observable, that it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to make a man virtuous, if we desire he should be pity'd: We
lament not, but detest a wicked man, we are glad when we behold his crimes
are punish'd, and that Poetical justice is done upon him. <hi>Euripides</hi> was cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
by the Critics of his time, for making his chief characters too wicked:
for example, <hi>Phaedra</hi> though she lov'd her Son-in-law with reluctancy, and
that it was acurse upon her Family for offending <hi>Venus;</hi> yet was thought too
ill a pattern for the Stage. Shall we therefore banish all characters of villany?
I confess I am not of that opinion; but it is necessary that the Hero of the Play
be not a Villain: that is, the characters which should move our pity ought to
have virtuous inclinations, and degrees of morall goodness in them. As for a
perfect character of virtue, it never was in Nature; and therefore there can
be no imitation of it: but there are allays of frailty to be allow'd for the chief
Persons, yet so that the good which is in them, shall outweigh the bad; and
consequently leave room for punishment on the one side, and pity on the other.</p>
               <p>After all, if any one will ask me, whether a Tragedy cannot be made upon
any other grounds, than those of exciting pity and terror in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Bossu,</hi> the
best of modern Critics, answers thus in general: That all excellent Arts, and
particularly that of Poetry, have been invented and brought to perfection by
men of a transcendent Genius; and that therefore they who practice afterwards
the same Arts, are oblig'd to tread in their footsteps, and to search in their
Writings the foundation of them: for it is not just that new Rules should destroy
the authority of the old. But <hi>Rapin</hi> writes more particularly thus: That no passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in a story are so proper to move our concernment as Fear and pity; and that
it is from our concernment we receive our pleasure, is undoubted; when the Soul
becomes agitated with fear for one character, or hope for another; then it is that
we are pleas'd in Tragedy, by the interest which we take in their adventures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65973:7"/>
Here therefore the general answer may be given to the first question, how
far we ought to imitate <hi>Shakespear</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> in their Plots; namely that
we ought to follow them so far only, as they have Copy'd the excellencies of those
who invented and brought to perfection Dramatic Poetry: those things only
excepted which Religion, customs of Countries, Idioms of Languages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
have alter'd in the Superstructures, but not in the foundation of the design.</p>
               <p>How defcctive <hi>Shakespear</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> have been in all their Plots, Mr.
<hi>Rymer</hi> has discover'd in his <hi>Criticisms:</hi> neither can we, who follow them, be
excus'd from the same or greater errors; which are the more unpardon<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>le in us,
because we want their beauties to counterveil our faults. The best of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
the most approaching to Antiquity, and the most conducing to move pity,
is the <hi>King and no King;</hi> which if the Farce of <hi>Bessus</hi> were thrown away, is
of that inferior sort of Tragedies, which end with a prosperous event. 'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
deriv'd from the story of <hi>OEdipus,</hi> with the character of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the <hi>Great,</hi> in his extravagancies, given to <hi>Arbaces.</hi> The taking of this
Play, amongst many others, I cannot wholly ascribe to the excellency of the
action; for I finde it moving when it is read: 'tis true, the faults of the Plot
are so evidently prov'd, that they can no longer be deny'd. The beauties of it
must therefore lie either in the livel touches of the passions: or we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
as I think we may, that even in imperfect Plots, there are less degrees of
Nature, by which some faint emotions of pity and terror are rais'd in us: as
a less Engine will raise a less proportion of weight, though not so much as one of
<hi>Archimedes</hi> making; for nothing can move our nature, but by some natural
reason, which works upon passions. And since we acknowledge the effect, there
must be something in the cause.</p>
               <p>The difference between <hi>Shakespear</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> in their Plotting seems to
be this, that <hi>Shakespear</hi> generally moves more terror, and <hi>Fletcher</hi> more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion:
For the first had a more Masculine, a bolder and more fiery Genius;
the Second a more soft and Womanish. In the mechanic beauties of the Plot,
which are the Observation of the three Vnities, Time, Place, and Action,
they are both deficient; but <hi>Shakespear</hi> most. <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi> reform'd those
errors in his Comedies, yet one of <hi>Shakespear's</hi> was Regular before him:
which is, <hi>The Merry Wives of Windsor.</hi> For what remains concerning
the design, you are to be refer'd to our English Critic. That method which he has
prescrib'd to raise it from mistake, or ignorance of the crime, is certainly the
best though 'tis not the only: for amongst all the Tragedies of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is but one, <hi>OEdipus,</hi> which is wholly built after that model.</p>
               <p>After the Plot, which is the foundation of the Play, the next thing to which
we ought to apply our Iudgment is the manners, for now the Poet comes to work
above ground: the ground-work indeed is that which is most necessary, as that
upon which depends the firmness of the whole Fabric; yet it strikes not the eye
so much, as the beauties or imperfections of the manners, the thoughts and the expressions.</p>
               <p>The first Rule which <hi>Bossu,</hi> prescribes to the Writer of an Heroic poem,
and which holds too by the same reason in all Dramatic Poetry, is to make the
<pb facs="tcp:65973:8"/>
moral of the work; that is, to lay down to your self what that precept of morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shall be, which you would insinuate into the people: as namely, <hi>Homer's,</hi>
(which I have Copy'd in my <hi>Conquest of Granada</hi>) was, that Vnion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
a Common-wealth, and discord destroys it. <hi>Sophocles,</hi> in his <hi>OEdipus,</hi>
that no man is to be accounted happy before his death. 'Tis the Moral that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
the whole action of the Play to one center; and that action or Fable, is
the example built upon the moral, which confirms the truth of it to our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
when the Fable is design'd, then and not before, the Persons are to be
introduc'd with their manners, characters and passions.</p>
               <p>The manners in a Poem, are understood to be those inclinations, whether
natural or acquir'd, which move and carry us to actions, good, bad, or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in a Play; or which incline the persons to such, or such actions: I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated
part of this discourse already, in declaring that a Poet ought not to
make the manners perfectly good in his best persons, but neither are they to be
more wicked in any of his characters, than necessity requires. To produce a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
without other reason than a natural inclination to villany, is in Poetry
to produce an effect without a cause: and to make him more a Villain than he
has just reason to be, is to make an effect which is stronger then the cause.</p>
               <p>The manners arise from many causes: and are either distinguish'd by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
as choleric and phlegmatic, or by the differences of Age or Sex, of
Climates, or Quality of the persons, or their present condition: they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be gather'd from the several Virtues, Vices, or Passions, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
common-places which a Poet must be suppos'd to have learn'd from natural
Philosophy, Ethics, and History; of all which whosoever is ignorant, does not
deserve the Name of Poet.</p>
               <p>But as the manners are usefull in this Art, they may be all compris'd under
these general heads: First, they must be apparent, that is in every character
of the Play, some inclinations of the Person must appear: and these are shown
in the actions and discourse. Secondly the manners must be suitable or agreeing
to the Persons; that is, to the Age, Sex, dignity, and the other general heads
of Manners: thus when a Poet has given the Dignity of a King to one of his
persons, in all his actions and speeches, that person must discover Majesty, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity,
and jealousy of power; because these are sutable to the general man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of a King. The third property of manners is resemblance; and this is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the particular characters of men, as we have them deliver'd to us by
relation or History: that is, when a Poet has the known character of this or that
man before him, he is bound to represent him such, at least not contrary to that
which Fame has reported him to have been: thus it is not a Poets choice to make
<hi>Ulysses</hi> choleric, or <hi>Achilles</hi> patient, because <hi>Homer</hi> has describ'd 'em quite
otherwise. Yet this is a Rock, on which ignorant Writers daily split: and the
absurdity is as monstrous, as if a Painter should draw a Coward running from a Battle, and tell us it was the Picture of <hi>Alexander the Great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last property of manners is, that they be constant, and equal, that is,
maintain'd the same through the whole design: thus when <hi>Virgil</hi> had once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the name of <hi>Pious</hi> to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> he was bound to show him such, in all his
<pb facs="tcp:65973:8"/>
words and actions through the whole Poem. All these properties <hi>Horace</hi> has

               <p>From the manners, the Characters of persons are deriv'd, for indeed the
characters are no other than the inclinations, as they appear in the several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Poem. A character being thus defin'd, that which distinguishes one
man from another. Not to repeat the same things over again which have been
said of the manners, I will only add what is necessary here. A character, or
that which distinguishes one man from all others, cannot be suppos'd to consist of
one particular Virtue, or Vice, or passion only; but 'tis a composition of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which are not contrary to one another in the same person: thus the same
man may be liberal and valiant, but not liberal and convetous; so in a Comical
character, or humour, (which is an inclination to this, or that particular fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
<hi>Falstaff</hi> is a lyar, and a coward, a Glutton, and a Buffon, because all
these qualities may agree in the same man; yet it is still to be observ'd, that one
virtue, vice, and passion, ought to be shown in every man, as predominant over
all the rest: as covetousness in <hi>Crassus,</hi> love of his Country in <hi>Brutus;</hi> and
the same in characters which are feign'd.</p>
               <p>The chief character or Hero in a Tragedy, as I have already shown, ought
in prudence to be such a man, who has so much more in him of Virtue than of Vice, that he may be left amiable to the Audience, which otherwise cannot
have any concernment for his sufferings: and 'tis on this one character that the
pity and terror must be principally, if not wholly founded. A Rule which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
necessary, and which none of the Critics that I know, have fully enough
discover'd to us. For terror and compassion work but weakly, when they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into many persons. If <hi>Creon</hi> had been the chief character in <hi>OEdipus,</hi>
there had neither been terror nor compassion mov'd; but only detestation of the
man and joy for his punishment; if <hi>Adrastus</hi> and <hi>Euridice</hi> had been made
more appearing characters, then the pity had been divided, and lessen'd on the
part of <hi>OEdipus:</hi> but making <hi>OEdipus</hi> the best and bravest person, and even
<hi>Jocasta</hi> but an underpart to him; his virtues and the punishment of his fatall
crime, drew both the pity, and the terror to himself.</p>
               <p>By what had been said of the manners, it will be easy for a reasonable man
to judge, whether the characters be truly or falsely drawn in a Tragedy; for
if there be no manners appearing in the characters, no concernment for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
can he rais'd: no pity or horror can be mov'd, but by vice or virtue, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without them, no person can have any business in the Play. If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
be obscure, 'tis a sign the Poet is in the dark, and knows not what
manner of man be presents to you; and consequently you can have no Idea, or
very imperfect, of that man: nor can judge what resolutions he ought to take;
or what words or actions are proper for him: Most Comedies made up of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
or adventures, are liable to fall into this error: and Tragedies with
many turns are subject to it: for the manners never can be evident, where the
surprises of Fortune take up all the business of the Stage; and where the Poet is
<pb facs="tcp:65973:9"/>
more in pain, to tell you that hapned to such a man, than what he was. 'Tis
one of the excellencies of <hi>Shakespear,</hi> that the manners of his persons are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
apparent; and you see their bent and inclinations. <hi>Fletcher</hi> comes far
short of him in this, as indeed he does almost in every thing: there are but glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings
of manners in most of his Comedies, which run upon adventures: and
in his Tragedies, <hi>Rollo, Otto,</hi> the <hi>King and No King, Melantius,</hi> and
many others of his best, are but Pictures shown you in the twi-light; you know
not whether they resemble vice, or virtue, and they are either good bad, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
as the present Scene requires it. But of all Poets, this commendation
is to be given to <hi>Ben. Johnson,</hi> that the manners even of the most inconsiderable
persons in his Plays are every where apparent.</p>
               <p>By considering the Second quality of manners, which is that they be sutable to
the Age, Quality, Country, Dignity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the character, we may likewise
judge whether a Poet has follow'd Nature. In this kinde <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi>
have more excell'd among the Greeks than <hi>Aeschylus:</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi>
more then <hi>Plautus</hi> among the Romans: Thus <hi>Sophocles</hi> gives to <hi>OEdipus</hi>
the true qualities of a King, in both those Plays which bear his Name: but in
the latter which is the <hi>OEdipus Colonoeus,</hi> he lets fall on purpose his Tragic
Stile, his Hero speaks not in the Arbitrary tone; but remembers in the softness
of his complaints, that he is an unfortunate blind Old-man, that he is banish'd
from his Country, and persecuted by his next Relations. The present French
Poets are generally accus'd, that wheresoever they lay the Scene, or in whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Age, the manners of their Heroes are wholly French: <hi>Racin's Bajazet</hi>
is bred at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> but his civilities are convey'd to him by some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
passage, from <hi>Versailles</hi> into the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> But our <hi>Shakespear,</hi> having
ascrib'd to <hi>Henry the Fourth</hi> the character of a King, and of a Father, gives
him the perfect manners of each Relation, when either he transacts with his
Son, or with his Subjects. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> on the other side gives neither to <hi>Arba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
nor to his King in the <hi>Maids Tragedy,</hi> the qualities which are sutable to
a Monarch: though he may be excus'd a little in the latter; for the King
there is not uppermost in the character; 'tis the Lover of <hi>Evadne,</hi> who is King
only, in a second consideration; and though he be unjust, and has other faults
which shall be nameless, yet he is not the Hero of the Play: 'tis true we finde him
a lawfull Prince, (though I never heard of any King that was in <hi>Rhodes</hi>)
and therefore Mr. <hi>Rymers</hi> Criticism stands good; that he should not be shown
in so vicious a character. <hi>Sophocles</hi> has been more judicious in his <hi>Antigona</hi>
for though he represent in <hi>Creon</hi> a bloody Prince, yet he makes him not a lawful
King, but an Vsurper, and <hi>Antigona</hi> her self is the Heroin of the Tragedy:
But when <hi>Philaster</hi> wounds <hi>Arethusa</hi> and the Boy; and <hi>Perigot</hi> his Mistress,
in the faithfull Sheperdess, both these are contrary to the character of Manhood:
Nor is <hi>Valentinian</hi> manag'd much better, for though <hi>Fletcher</hi> has taken his
Picture truly, and shown him as he was, an effeminate voluptuous man, yet he
has forgotten that he was an Emperor, and has given him none of those Royal
marks, which ought to appear in a lawfull Successor of the Throne. If it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
what <hi>Fletcher</hi> should have done on this occasion; ought he not to have
<pb facs="tcp:65973:9"/>
represented <hi>Valentinian</hi> as he was? <hi>Bossu</hi> shall answer this question for me,
by an instance of the like nature: <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Greek Emperor, was a Prince
far surpassing <hi>Valentinian,</hi> for he was indu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d with many Kingly virtues; he
was Religious, Mercifull, and Valiant, but withall he was noted of extream
covetousness, a vice which is contrary to the character of a Hero, or a Prince:
therefore says the Critic, that Emperor was no fit person to be represented in a
Tragedy, unless his good qualities were only to be shown, and his covetousness
(which sullyed them all) were slur'd over by the artifice of the Poet. To return
once more to <hi>Shakespear;</hi> no man ever drew so many characters, or generally
distinguished 'em better from one another, excepting only <hi>Johnson:</hi> I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
but in one, to show the copiousnesls of his Invention; 'tis that of <hi>Calyban,</hi>
or the Monster in the <hi>Tempest.</hi> He seems there to have created a person which
was not in Nature, a boldness which at first sight would appear intolerable: for
he makes him a Species of himself, begotten by an <hi>Incubus</hi> on a Witch; but
this as I have elsewhere prov'd, is not wholly beyond the bounds of credibility,
at least the vulgar stile believe it. We have the separated notions of a spirit,
and of a Witch; (and Spirits according to <hi>Plato,</hi> are vested with a subtil body;
according to some of his followers; have different Sexes) therefore as from
the distinct apprehensions of a Horse, and of a Man, Imagination has form'd
a <hi>Centaur,</hi> so from those of an <hi>Incubus</hi> and a <hi>Sorceress, Shakespear</hi> has
produc'd his Monster. Whether or no his Generation can be defended, I leave
to Philosophy; but of this I am certain, that the Poet has most judiciously fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
him with a person, a Language, and a character, which will suit him,
both by Fathers and Mothers side: he has all the discontents, and malice of a
Witch, and of a Devil; besides a convenient proportion of the deadly sins;
Gluttony, Sloth, and Lust, are manifest; the dejectedness of a slave is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
given him, and the ignorance of one bred up in a Desart Island. His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is monstrous, as he is the product of unnatural Lust; and his language is as hobgoblin as his person: in all things he is distinguish'd from other mortals.
The characters of <hi>Fletcher</hi> are poor &amp; narrow, in comparison of <hi>Shakespears;</hi>
I remember not one which is not borrow'd from him; unless you will except that
strange mixture of a man in the <hi>King and no King:</hi> So that in this part
<hi>Shakespear</hi> is generally worth our Imitation; and to imitate <hi>Fletcher</hi> is but
to Copy after him who was a Copyer.</p>
               <p>Vnder this general head of Manners, the passions are naturally included, as
belonging to the Characters. I speak not of pity and of terror, which are to be
mov'd in the Audience by the Plot; but of Anger, Hatred, Love, Ambition,
Iealousy, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they are shown in this or that person of the Play.
To describe these naturally, and to move then artfully, is one of the greatest
commendations which can be given to a Poet: to write pathetically, says <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus,</hi>
cannot proceed but for a lofty <hi>Genius.</hi> A Poet must be born with this
quality; yet, unless he help himself by an acquir'd knowledg of the Passions,
what they are in their own nature, and by what springs they are to be mov'd,
he will be subject either to raise them where they ought not to be rais'd, or not to
raise them by the just degrees of Nature, or to amplify them beyond the natural
<pb facs="tcp:65973:10"/>
bounds, or not to observe the crisis and turns of them, in their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and decay:
all which errors proceed from want of Judgment in the Poet, and from being
unskill'd in the Principles of Moral Philosophy. Nothing is more frequent in a
Fanciful Writer, than to foil himself by not managing his strength: therefore,
as in a Wrestler, there is first requir'd some measure of force, a well-knit body,
and active Limbs, without which all instruction would be vain; yet, these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
granted, if he want the skill which is necessary to a Wrestler, he shall make
but small advantage of his natural robustuousness: So in a Poet, his inborn vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
and force of spirit, will only run him out of breath the sooner, if it be not
supported by the help of Art. The roar of passion indeed may please an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
three parts of which are ignorant enough to think all is moving which is
noise, and it may stretch the lungs of an ambitious Actor, who will dye upon the
spot for a thundring clap; but it will move no other passion than indignation and
contempt from judicious men. <hi>Longinus,</hi> whom I have hitherto follow'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
thus: If the passions be Artfully employ'd, the discourse becomes vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and lofty; if otherwise, there is nothing more ridiculous than a great passion
out of season: And to this purpose he animadverts severely upon <hi>Aeschylus,</hi> who
writ nothing in cold bloud, but was always in arapture, and in fury with his
Audience: the Inspiration was still upon him, he was ever tearing it upon the
Tripos; or (to run off as madly as he does, from one similitude to another) he
was always at high floud of Passion, even in the dead Ebb, and lowest Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
of the Scene. He who would raise the passion of a judicious Audience,
says a Learned Critic, must be sure to take his hearers along with him; if they
be in a Calm, 'tis in vain for him to be in a huff: he must move them by degrees,
and kindle with 'em; otherwise he will be in danger of setting his own heap of
Stubble on a fire, and of burning out by himself without warming the company
that stand about him. They who would justify the madness of Poetry from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> have mistaken the text, &amp; consequently the Interpretation:
I imagine it to be false read, where he says of Poetry, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
that it had always somewhat in it either of a genius, or of a madman. 'Tis more
probable that the Original ran thus, that Poetry was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, That it
belongs to a Witty man, but not to a madman. Thus then the Passions, as they
are consider'd simply and in themselves, suffer violence when they are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
maintain'd at the same height; for what melody can be made on that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
all whose strings are screw'd up at first to their utmost stretch, and to
the same sound? But this is not the worst; for the Characters likewise bear a
part in the general calamity, if you consider the Passions as embody'd in them:
for it follows of necessity, that no man can be distinguish'd from another by his
discourse, when every man is ranting, swaggering, and exclaiming with the
same excess: as if it were the only business of all the Characters to contend with
each other for the prize at <hi>Billingsgate;</hi> or that the Scene of the Tragedy lay in
<hi>Bet'lem.</hi> Suppose the Poet should intend this man to be Cholerick, and that man
to be patient; yet when they are confounded in the Writing, you cannot distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
them from one another: for the man who was call'd patient and tame, is
only so before he speaks; but let his clack be set a going, and he shall tongue it as
<pb facs="tcp:65973:10"/>
impetuously, and as loudly the errantest Hero in the Play. By this means, the
characters are only distinct in name; but in reality, all the men and women in
the Play are the same person. No man should pretend to write, who cannot tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
his fancy with his Iudgment: nothing is more dangerous to a raw horse-man,
than a hot-mouth'd Jade without a curb.</p>
               <p>'Tis necessary therefore for a Poet, who would concern an Audience by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
of a Passion, first to prepare it, and not to rush upon it all at once. <hi>Ovid</hi>
has judiciously shown the difference of these two ways, in the speeches of <hi>Ajax</hi> and
<hi>Ulysses: Ajax</hi> from the very beginning breaks out into his exclamations, and is
swearing by his Maker.—<hi>Agimus proh Jupiter inquit. Ulysses</hi> on the
contrary, prepares his Audience with all the submissiveness he can practice, &amp; all
the calmness of a reasonable man; he found his Iudges in a tranquillity of spirit,
and therefore set out leasurely and softly with 'em, till he had warm'd 'em by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
and then he began to mend his pace, and to draw them along with his
own impetuousness: yet so managing his breath, that it might not fail him at his
need, and reserving his utmost proofs of ability even to the last. The success you
see was answerable; for the croud only applauded the spech of <hi>Ajax;</hi>—
<q>
                     <l>Vulgique secutum ultima murmur erat:—</l>
                  </q>
But the Iudges awarded the prize for which they contended to <hi>Ulysses.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Mota manus Procerum est, et quid facundia possit</l>
                  <l>Tum patuit, fortisque viri and arma Disertus.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The next necessary rule is to put nothing into the discourse which may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your moving of the passions. Too many accidents as I have said, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the Poet, as much as the Arms of <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>David;</hi> for the variety of
passions which they produce, are ever crossing and justling each other out of
the way. He who treats of joy and grief together, is in a fair way of causing
neither of those effects. There is yet another obstacle to be remov'd, which is
pointed Wit, and Sentences affected out of season; these are nothing of kin
to the violence of passion: no man is at leisure to make sentences and similes,
when his soul is in an Agony. I the rather name this fault, that it may serve
to mind me of my former errors; neither will I spare myself, but give an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this kind from my Indian Emperor: <hi>Montezuma,</hi> pursu'd by his
enemies, and seeking Sanctuary, stands parlying without the Fort, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
his danger to <hi>Cydaria,</hi> in a simile of six lines;
<q>
                     <l>As on the sands the frighted Traveller</l>
                     <l>Sees the high Seas come rowling from afar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>My Indian Potent ate was well skill'd in the Sea for an Inland Prince,
and well improv'd since the first Act, when he sent his son to discover it. The
Image had not been amiss from another man, at another time: <hi>Sed nunc non
erat hisce locus:</hi> he destroy'd the concernment which the Audience might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wise have had for him; for they could not think the danger near, when
he had the leisure to invent a Simile.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Shakespear</hi> be allow'd, as I think be must, to have made his Characters
distinct, it will easily be infer'd that he understood the nature of the Passions:
because it has been prov'd already, that confus'd passions make undistingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shable
<pb facs="tcp:65973:11"/>
Characters: yet I cannot deny that he has his failings; but they are
not so much in the passions themselves, as in his manner of expression: he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
obscures his meaning by his words, and sometimes makes it unintelligible.
I will not say of so great a Poet, that he distinguish'd not the blown puffy
stile, from true sublimity; but I may venture to maintain that the fury of his
fancy often transported him, beyond the bounds of Iudgment, either in coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of new words and phrases, or racking words which were in use, into the
violence of a Catachresis: 'Tis not that I would explode the use of Metaphors
from passions, for <hi>Longinus</hi> thinks 'em necessary to raise it; but to use 'em
at every word, to say nothing without a Metaphor, a Simile, an Image, or
description, is I doubt to smell a little too strongly of the Buskin. I must be
forc'd to give an example of expressing passion figuratively<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that I may
do it with respect to <hi>Shakespear,</hi> it shall not be taken from any thing of his:
'tis an exclamation against Fortune, quoted in his <hi>Hamlet,</hi> but written
by some other Poet.
<q>
                     <l>Out, out, thou strumpet fortune; all you Gods,</l>

                     <l>As low as to the Fiends.</l>
                  </q>
And immediately after, speaking of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> when <hi>Priam</hi> was kill'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her eyes:
<q>
                     <l>The mobbled Queen ran up and down,</l>
                     <l>Threatning the flame with bisson rheum: a clout about that head,</l>
                     <l>Where late the Diadem stood; and for a Robe</l>
                     <l>About her lank and all or'e-teemed loyns,</l>
                     <l>A blanket in th' alarm of fear caught up.</l>
                     <l>Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd</l>
                     <l>'Gainst Fortune's state would Treason have pronounc'd;</l>
                     <l>But if the Gods themselves did see her then,</l>
                     <l>When she saw <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> make malicious sport</l>
                     <l>In mincing with his sword her Husband's Limbs,</l>
                     <l>The instant burst of clamor that she made</l>
                     <l>(Unless things mortal meant them not at all)</l>
                     <l>Would have made milch the burning eyes of Heav'n,</l>
                     <l>And passion in the Gods.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>What a pudder is here kept in raising the expression of triffling thoughts.
Would not a man have thought that the Poet had been bound Prentice to a
Wheel-wright, for his first Rant? and had follow'd a Ragman, for the clout
and blanket, in the second? Fortune is painted on a wheet; and therefore
the writer in a rage, will have Poetical Iustice done upon every member of
<pb facs="tcp:65973:11"/>
that Engin: after this execution, he bowls the Nave downhill, from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to the Fiends: (an unreasonable long mark a man would think;) 'tis
well there are no solid Orbs to stop it in the way, or no Element of fire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
it: but when it came to the earth, it must be monstrous heavy, to break
ground as low as to the Center. His making milch the burning eyes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
was a pretty tollerable flight too; and I think no man ever drew milk out
of eyes before him: yet to make the wonder greater, these eyes were burning.
Such a sight indeed were enough to have rais' d passion in the Gods, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the effects of it, he tells you perhaps they did not see it. Wise men would
be glad to find a little sence couch'd under all those pompous words; for Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bast
is commonly the delight of that Audience, which loves Poetry, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
stands it not: and as commonly has been the practice of those Writers, who
not being able to infuse a natural passion into the mind, have made it their
business to ply the ears, and to st<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> their Iudges by the noise. But <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spear</hi>
does not often thus; for the passions in his Scene between <hi>Brutus</hi> and
<hi>Cassius</hi> are extreamly natural, the thoughts are such as arise from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the expression of 'em not viciously figurative. I cannot leave this
Subject before I do justce to that Divine Poet, by giving you one of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
descriptions: 'tis of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second when he was depos'd, and led
in Triumph through the Streets of <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bullingbrook:</hi> the
painting of it is so lively, and the words so moving, that I have scarce read
any thing comparable to it, in any other language, Suppose you have seen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
the fortunate Vsurper passing through the croud, and follow'd by the
shouts and acclamations of the people; and now behold King <hi>Richard</hi> entring
upon the Scene: consider the wretchedness of his condition, and his carriage

proper place; but 'tis a false measure of all these, something which is like 'em<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and is not them: 'tis the <hi>Bristol-stone,</hi> which appears like a Diamond; 'tis
an extravagant thought, instead of a sublime one; 'tis roaring madness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
<pb facs="tcp:65973:12"/>
of vehemence; and a sound of words, instead of sence. If <hi>Shakespear</hi>
were stript of all the Bombast in the passions, and dress'd in the most vulgar
words, we should find the beauties of his thoughts remaining; if his embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were burnt down, there would still be silver at the bottom of the melting-pot:
but I fear (at least, let me fear it for my self) that we who Ape his soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
words, have nothing of his thought, but are all out-side; there is not so
much as a dwarf within our Giants cloaths. Therefore, let not <hi>Shakespear</hi>
suffer for our sakes; 'tis our fault, who succeed him in an Age which is more
refin'd, if we imitate him so ill, that we coppy his failings only, and make a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of that in our Writings, which in his was an imperfection.</p>
               <p>For what remains, the excellency of that Poet was, as I have said, in the
more manly passions; <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s in the softer: <hi>Shakespear</hi> writ better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
man and man; <hi>Fletcher,</hi> betwixt man and woman: consequently, the
one describ'd friendship better; the other love: yet <hi>Shakespear</hi> taught <hi>Flet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi>
to write love; and <hi>Juliet,</hi> and <hi>Desdemona,</hi> are Originals. 'Tis true,
the Scholar had the softer soul; but the Master had the kinder. Friendship
is both a virtue, and a Passion essentially; love is a passion only in its
nature, and is not a virtue but by Accident: good nature makes Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
but effeminacy Love. <hi>Shakespear</hi> had an Vniversal mind, which
comprehended all Characters and Passions; <hi>Fletcher</hi> a more confin'd, and
limited: for though be treated love in perfection, yet Honour, Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Revenge, and generally all the stronger Passions, he either touch'd
not, or not <hi>Masterly.</hi> To conclude all; he was a Limb of <hi>Shakespear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had intended to have proceeded to the last property of manners, which
is, that they must be constant; and the characters maintain'd the same
from the beginning to the end; and from thence to have proceeded to
the thoughts and expressions sutable to a Tragedy: but I will first see
how this will relish with the Age. 'Tis I confess but cursorily written;
yet the Judgment which is given here, is generally founded upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:
But because many men are shock'd at the name of Rules, as if
they were a kinde of Magisterial prescription upon Poets, I will conclude
with the words of <hi>Rapin,</hi> in his reflections on <hi>Arisotles</hi> work of Poetry: If
the <hi>Rules</hi> be well consider'd: we shall find them to be made only to reduce
Nature into Method, to trace her step by step, and not to suffer the least
mark of her to escape us: 'tis only by these, that probability in Fiction is
maintain'd, which is the Soul of Poetry: they are founded upon good Sence,
and Sound Reason, rather than on Authority; for, though <hi>Aristotle</hi> and
<hi>Horace</hi> are produc'd, yet no man must argue, that what they write is true,
because they writ it; but 'tis evident, by the ridiculous mistakes and gross absurdities,
which have been made by those Poets who have taken their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy only
for their guide, that if this Fancy be not regulated, 'tis a meer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price,
and utterly incapable to produce a reasonable and judicious Poem.</p>

            <head>The Prologue Spoken by Mr. Betterton,
Representing the Ghost of Shakespear.</head>
            <l>SEE, my lov'd <hi>Britons,</hi> see your <hi>Shakespeare</hi> rise,</l>
            <l>An awfull ghost confess'd to human eyes!</l>
            <l>Vnnam'd, methinks, distinguish'd I had been</l>
            <l>From other shades, by this eternal green,</l>
            <l>About whose wreaths the vulgar Poets strive,</l>
            <l>And with a touch, their wither'd Bays revive.</l>
            <l>Vntaught, unpractis'd, in a barbarous Age,</l>
            <l>I found not, but created first the Stage.</l>
            <l>And, if I drain'd no <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> store,</l>
            <l>'Twas, that my own abundance gave me more.</l>
            <l>On foreign trade I needed not rely</l>
            <l>Like fruitfull <hi>Britain,</hi> rich without supply.</l>
            <l>In this my rough-drawn Play, you shall behold</l>
            <l>Some Master-strokes, so manly and so bold</l>
            <l>That he, who meant to alter, found 'em such</l>
            <l>He shook; and thought it Sacrilege to touch.</l>
            <l>Now, where are the Successours to my name?</l>
            <l>What bring they to fill out a Poets fame?</l>
            <l>Weak, short-liv'd issues of a feeble Age;</l>
            <l>Scarce living to be Christen'd on the Stage!</l>
            <l>For Humour farce, for love they rhyme dispence,</l>
            <l>That tolls the knell, for their departed sence.</l>
            <l>Dulness might thrive in any trade but this:</l>
            <l>'T wou'd recommend to some fat Benefice.</l>
            <l>Dulness, that in a Playhouse meets disgrace</l>
            <l>Might meet with Reverence, in its proper place.</l>
            <l>The fulsome clench that nauseats the Town</l>
            <l>Wou'd from a Iudge or Alderman go down!</l>
            <l>Such virtue is there in a Robe and gown!</l>
            <l>And that insipid stuff which here you hate</l>
            <l>Might somewhere else be call'd a grave debate:</l>
            <l>Dulness is decent in the Church and State.</l>
            <l>But I forget that still 'tis understood</l>
            <l>Bad Plays are best decry'd by showing good:</l>
            <l>Sit silent then, that my pleas'd Soul may see</l>
            <l>A Iudging Audience once, and worthy me:</l>
            <l>My faithfull Scene from true Records shall tell</l>
            <l>How <hi>Trojan</hi> valour did the <hi>Greek</hi> excell;</l>
            <l>Your great forefathers shall their fame regain,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Homers</hi> angry Ghost repine in vain.</l>

sighing, if Prince <hi>Troilus</hi> had her at this advantage, and I were holding

of the door.—And she were a thought taller, but as she is, she wants not
an Inch of <hi>Hellen</hi> neither; but there's no more comparison between the
Women—there was wit, there was a sweet tongue: How her

            <l>Ye expect a Satyr, and I seldom fail,</l>
            <l>When I'm first beaten, 'tis my part to rail.</l>
            <l>You British fools, of the Old Trojan stock,</l>
            <l>That stand so thick one cannot miss the flock,</l>
            <l>Poets have cause to dread a keeping Pit,</l>

            <l>As we strow Rats-bane when we vermine fear,</l>

            <l>Those Ophs shou'd be restraind, during their lives,</l>
            <l>From Pen and Ink, as Madmen are from knives:</l>

            <l>As preaching truth at <hi>Rome,</hi> or wit in <hi>Spain,</hi>
