            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Sheridan</hi>'s Speech after his Examination before the late House of Commons, on <hi>Wednesday</hi> the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1680.</head>
            <p>TIs, I confess Sir, a great misfortune to fall under the Displeasure of the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble House of Commons, it is a Burden that no man, tho' never so great, is able to bear; It cannot then be a wonder, if so inconsiderable a Person, and of so little strength as I, should stoop under the weight; Not that I fear any Danger to my Person, but grieve for the wounds it gives my Reputation, which I have always valu'd above my Life, and that it might be preserv'd spotless, I have ever made it my study to <hi>keep a good Conscience, void of Offence, towards God and towards Man</hi>; and therefore I little expected to be brought as a Criminal to this Bar, or any Tribunal.</p>
            <p>But I am convinc'd, Innocence is no security against the Darts of Envy or Malice, and that he who will hazard his Body or his Soul, may take away the Life and Fame of any one at pleasure; 'tis to men of such principles I owe my present Trouble: I do not say this to reflect upon any Member of this Great and Honourable Assembly. My Evil is from without Doors, and I know the Authors and the Contrivance so well, that, if it were convenient, I cou'd name them, and trace the whole Chain, Link by Link, to the very first, hammer'd by Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and particular Interest.</p>
            <p>I do not wonder that, in the present circumstances, you shou'd have an ear open to all reports that any way relate to the publick, this is due to your Station, and to your Prudence; and because Justice and your Honour require it, I as little doubt your reserving the other ear for the Pleas and Defences of the Accus'd, or that you will condemn any man unheard: Upon this assurance it is, that I am bold to beg, with all due respect and reverence, that I may have liberty to speak for my self without interruption; If you are pleas'd to grant me this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, I will use it as fully and briefly as I can, for your satisfaction and my own vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>I have been represented (I hope without offence I may say, traduc'd, for so I can make it appear) for a person of no Fortune, a Papist, a second <hi>Coleman,</hi> and what is more ridiculous, tho' not more false, a Jesuit, and the Duke's Confessor.</p>
            <p>In clearing my self from these Aspersions, I must be forc'd to say something, which nothing but necessity, that either has none, or breaks all Laws, can excuse from vanity. As that I was born a Gentleman, of one of the antientest Families, and related to many Considerable, in <hi>Ireland</hi>; in one County there is a Castle, and a large Demean, and in another a greater tract of Land for several Miles together, yet known by our Name, I need not say who was the head or chief, 'tis too much that my Grand-father was the last who enjoy'd the Estate, and that my Father left an Orphan in the beginning of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Reign, soon found himself dispossess'd and expos'd to the World, that whole County, with five others, being intirely escheated to the Crown. My Parents Protestants, my Mother a Gentlewoman of <hi>England,</hi> of good Fortune, a <hi>Foster,</hi> who for my Fathers sake quitted her Country and her Relations, both fam'd for honesty, for their Loyalty and Sufferings in the <hi>late Rebellion,</hi> when my Father scap'd twice narrowly with his Life, and at last was forc'd to fly, for relieving and protecting both the Fortunes and Persons of very many <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To my Birth I had a suitable Education; I have some slender pretence to Letters, am not altogether a Stranger to the Civil-law, nor the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> the means intended for my Livelyhood.</p>
            <p>But, without my seeking or knowledge, some Friends procur'd for me the Collectorship of the Customs of <hi>Cork,</hi> and the management of most of the Inland-Revenue of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: This Employment, and the Accidents attending it, together with that of the <hi>East-India</hi> Prizes, and others in the last War with <hi>Holland,</hi> put into <hi>Kinsale,</hi> enabl'd me to bring for my own proportion of Advance-money, for the present Revenue-Farm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> 9532 l. as appears upon Record in the <hi>Chancery</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; and being by a Brother of mine, then here, without my privity or desire, engag'd in this undertaking, and a stranger to all the Partnership, excepting one, <hi>Iune</hi> last was 3 years I sold my Interest for 4000 <hi>l,</hi> profit. This Money I employ'd in Corporation and Church-Leases, in Mortgages and other secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, at 10 <hi>l. per Cent,</hi> the Interest of that Kingdom. And after this account, if I have no visible real Estate, I hope no man can doubt but that I may live independently, tho' besides I happen to be a younger Brother, so far from being a prejudice, that it's possible to prove my advantage, being defign'd the Heir of two elder Brothers, who neither have, nor are like to have any Children. The Bills of Exchnge drawn and remitted to and from <hi>Ireland,</hi> by Sir <hi>Iohn Frederick</hi> and Company, Mr. <hi>D. Arthur</hi> and other known Merchants, will shew my proper Fond, and no man's Bounty supported my Expences; and therefore, because I can with great Truth, I do the more freely declare, That I neither have, nor ever had any Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Duke or Dutchess of <hi>York,</hi> as a Servant or Dependent, a Sallary-man or Pensio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and was so far from succeeding Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> that his Employment never enter'd into my Thoughts taken up with Affairs of a far different nature. My journey to <hi>Flanders</hi> was no way criminal, and in a great measure the effect of curiosity, having before seen very little of that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43710:2"/>
Country, <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi>; and as I went not with the Duke, so my return in his Train was purely accident.</p>
            <p>For my Religion, as I was born of Protestant Parents, so I was all along bred a member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and (by the Grace of God) will live and die in this Profession; for it is not so much owing to the chance of Education, as to my choice, being satisfi'd by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by Scripture, and the Laws of my Country, no inconsiderable Argument, that of all, it is the most purely Christian.</p>
            <p>Since I was seventeen years of Age I have gone duly to Church, and several times in every year receiv'd the Sacrament; I did so twice while in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Lake</hi> and Dr. <hi>Doughty</hi> (the Duke's Chaplains) and others can witness; and I have done so six times since my return thence, there are in this Honourable House that can testifie some part of this Truth. I have taken the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy eleven times, am ready to submit to all further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of Law in matters of Religion, have in Disputes encounter'd, tho' unwillingly, with many of the several Orders abroad, remain'd unshaken in my Principles; This at <hi>Ghent,</hi> putting a Jesuit (more zealous than the rest) into great passion, made him pronounce me obstinate, and declare, <hi>He cou'd sooner bring over ten of the most rigid Phanaticks of</hi> England, <hi>than hope to make me a Proselyte.</hi> Now if all this be not sufficient to wipe off the imputation of Popery, I confess I am to seek for a defence.</p>
            <p>Among others 'tis objected, That by my Interest in his R. H. I got my Brother made a Bishop, in opposition to the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and contrary to Merit. To this I answer, That my Brother has been as much, and as injuriously, though not so publicly defam'd as I; that he came off with Honour; that a peak between two Great Lords of that Kingdom, and one of the greatest of this, did not only prevent his being sooner promoted, but was the occasion of his being bespatter'd with many falshoods and calumnies; that few in <hi>Ireland</hi> deserve it better; that what he enjoys, he obtain'd not in opposition to, tho' without the recommendation of the chief Governour, nor by the mediation of the Duke, but of a great Minister, in the presence of my Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> from the King's immediate Grace openly shewn in Council, and with a particular mark of His Royal Favour.</p>
            <p>I hope 'tis no Crime to honour and revere the Duke as he is a Prince, or if a private man to love and value his innate Worth and Qualities; or to have said, as it is reported (I wish nothing else had been with less Truth) That I wou'd hazard my Life and Fortune to do him any lawful and just Service; If it be a Crime, as I can no ways apprehend of the Brother of my King, while publickly pray'd for in all the Churches of the three Kingdoms, I confess my self guilty; But I am not so wedded to his Interest, as to espouse or pursue them, if he can have any such, contrary to the Duty I owe, and ever will pay my Sovereign, my Country, my Religion and my God.</p>
            <p>And I do here most solemnly protest, as I hope for Heaven, if I knew him in any instance a Conspirator or a Traitor, I wou'd not only detest, but endeavour to bring him to publick Justice; and if ever he can be prov'd a Criminal of this nature, I will have no more respect nor regard, but less, for him, than I wou'd for any common Offender. And therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hopes of reward, or the fears of punishment, I declare in the presence of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, If I knew any part of the <hi>Popish-Plot,</hi> or the persons concern'd in't, I wou'd long since have reveal'd the whole Contrivance. But none in their senses can believe, that a known Protestant cou'd be made privy to such a Conspiracy; to which, if necessary, might be added, that I was in a Country remote from that, where the Design is said to be hatch'd.</p>
            <p>I own my self of so extensive a Charity, to love the persons of all honest Men, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their differing from me in opinion, about the Modes and Circumstances of Religion, and to be for Liberty of Conscience, when consistent with the safety of the state, to all quiet and peaceable Dissenters; But when 'tis urg'd and made use of to other ends, or as a Cloak for Rebellion or Treachery, I abominate all such Indulgence.</p>
            <p>But I will no longer dwell on this Subject, than to mind you of Collonel <hi>Mansel</hi>'s mistake or forgetfulness, when he informs this Honourable House, <hi>That in or about</hi> July, 1678. <hi>I din'd at his Treat for a</hi> German <hi>Lord, in order to a Design of his upon a Foreign Command, and that</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>days after, I shou'd advise him against it, telling him the Duke wou'd very soon have occasion for such Officers.</hi> First, I do say, to have said so was no Crime; But I easily see through this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, 'tis to serve as an argument, that I understood somewhat of the Plot, of which I am as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as any man living, beyond what I have since learnt from the Prints and public Fame. In the next place, I do utterly deny I ever said the words, because I do not know the Duke had any such Design, and am certain I cannot invent. Besides, by many circumstances, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less here to mention, that Dinner was after the Courts return from <hi>Windsor,</hi> and consequently after the breaking forth of the Plot. I desire the Gentleman wou'd recollect himself; at that time he was very great and intimate with a Roman Catholick, <hi>H. N.</hi> from whom if he heard not the words, as I am not apt to imagine, I am confident he dream'd them. He cannot be ignorant that I knew why he was disbanded in <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. and that I always declin'd, not only as having no Interest, but as unwilling for other reasons, to introduce him to the Duke, as he often press'd; and therefore he made his application to others, but with as ill success.</p>
            <p>And now give me leave, I beseech you, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> to answer an Objection, that I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43710:2"/>
have prescrib'd a way how the King shou'd live without Parliaments: I am so far from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining such a thought, that I ever esteem'd the Constitutions of <hi>England</hi> by King, Lords and Commons the happiest kind of Government in the world; and if the discourse called, <hi>The Rise and Power of Parliaments,</hi> &amp;c. be mine, of which many will have me the Author, the reading it, would be of this a sufficient Confutation: In that, Parliaments are magnifi'd, their power rather enlarg'd than lessen'd, and their frequent meetings recommended as most convenient.</p>
            <p>In a word, whatever Character my Adversaries have given of me, I am not a Protestant in Masquerade, I can neither Lie nor Dissemble, I am really what I profess, and as the word is commonly taken, no lover of Arbitrary Government, in any single or complicated body.</p>
            <p>As to the Letter Subscrib'd by <hi>Fitz-Iames,</hi> I do sincerely protest I have no Acquaintance with any of the Name, nor ever saw the Hand before, nor the intended Messenger <hi>C.</hi> who not finding me, left it with the Maid-servant: But in this there is nothing Criminal.</p>
            <p>As to the Computations, they are a Transcript from a Paper of Sir <hi>Peter Petts,</hi> containing the number of Conformists, Non-Conformists and Papists throughout <hi>England,</hi> taken by the Bishops order, in, or about the time of the General Indulgence and by him produc'd presently after the <hi>Plot,</hi> upon the talk that there were fifty thousand Papists, able to bear Arms, within <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> and about <hi>Westminster</hi>; a number near double to what, at the taking this survey, they were found men, women and children in the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>For the Copy of my Cousin <hi>Wilsons</hi> Writing, I confess it the only thing I endeavour'd to evade, having ingenuously and without reserve answer'd all other questions. That individual Paper I never saw before the preceding night, when meeting it in the Drawer of my Bed-Chamber, (always open, whether I am at home or abroad) I laid it uppermost with purpose of Inquiring how he came by it, and whether he knew the Author; But not seeing him till next day in presence of the Members sent to search my Lodgings, I cou'd not ask him, and was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to have so Indiscreet and Reflective a Paper found in his hand, and among mine. 'Tis true, that about three Weeks before, I found another of the same Contents, in an Old Crabbed hand, to me unknown; which after I had Read, and concluded it might possibly be left by some of my Acquaintance in their Visits, and being unable to guess at the perso<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> not knowing how long it had layn there, being Dated above a Month before I immediatly threw it into the fire. Yet in this Paper, which has made so great a noise, there is neither Felony nor Treason; and being the Act of another, and never by me publish'd, having neither Sub, nor Superscription, nor Writ to, nor for from me, nor Copi'd by my Order, cannot, I presume, be a Libel, nor I hope imputed to me, to whom it came perfectly by Accident: If it were lawful to speak ones guesses from the Contents, it shou'd seem to have come from a Learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, one of your own Members, then in the Country Skill'd in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongue, to which both my Cousin and I are perfect strangers; nor was either of us out of <hi>London</hi> then, or for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before: If I cou'd as well hit upon the person, as his Quality, I wou'd give a more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory account of this matter; and I hope this Honourable Assembly will the sooner Credit me, when they reflect, that upon seeing another Paper of my Kinsmans writing, I wou'd not by a lie deny this to be his hand.</p>
            <p>As for my Writing to Mr. <hi>Gadbury,</hi> I refer my self to the Letter in Sir <hi>W. Waller</hi>'s hands: I have told you the accidental occasion; I desir'd from him, (whose Acquaintance I knew large, even among the Members of that Parliament) the most material of public News; I neither ask'd for Schemes or Figures, I have ever Laugh'd at the idle and ridiculous Art of Judicial Astrology, invented, at least practis'd, to Impose upon, and Pick the Pockets of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and the Credulous.</p>
            <p>And now as to the Cause of my Commitment: The story Dr. <hi>D.</hi> told me as News, of <hi>Peter Norris</hi> his knowing as much of the <hi>Plot</hi> as any man in <hi>England,</hi> his going, or being gone into <hi>France</hi> to fetch a Priest to be a Witness. I can only say, as near as I remember, I gave the same account to Mr. <hi>Secretary</hi>; not as an Informer, but as News; for not being look'd upon as such, I was not desir'd to Swear, nor cou'd I to a hear-say. In this I call Heaven to witness I had no Sinister design, but an Honest intention of having the full Truth brought to Light: Nor do I know, nor have I any reason to believe, that Mr. <hi>Secretary</hi>'s after proceedings were from any other principle. Upon my telling him the Name of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and his saying he had never before heard it, and commanding me to send the Doctor to him, or the others Description; As soon as I met with the Doctor, which was several dayes after this Discourse; and he as not knowing Mr. <hi>Secretary</hi> refusing to go, I desir'd from him the Description, which some time after he brought me; I gave or sent to Mr. <hi>Secretary,</hi> for I cannot tell whether. But of this I am certain, that all I knew of the Affair, was from the Doctor only; and that I never communicated it to any, but Mr. <hi>Secretary,</hi> and that by what I writ under the Description, appears to be near a Month after <hi>Norris</hi> his departure, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently cou'd not be design'd to stop his Journey, or prevent the Priests coming over, or obstruct the fuller discovery of the Plot, which no man living desires more than my self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it the Interest of every honest Subject and Protestant, (out of which number I cannot be excluded) to have all in't, from the highest to the lowest punish'd according to merit; and that tranquility it has so long disturb'd, re-settl'd in the Kingdom: And now I hope none

of the Members of this Honourable House can imagine I cou'd be guilty of so Horrid a Crime, as having any knowledge of the Priests being poison'd, as is suspected, or given out he might be. I am so ignorant of this, or any part of the Conspiracy, that I do not so much despise, as decline, because not needing it, the generous offer of Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> or other Membe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for my Pardon: I acknowledge, as I ought; the Favour with all fitting respect; but I thank God, I am so Innocent, that I dare, as now I do, challenge the whole world, to make out one particular, where in Word or Action, in the whole course of my life, I have done or spoken falsly, or unjustly; and yet no man ever suffer'd more Calumnies, without any cause, or the least shadow of Truth, beyond the witty malice of those, whose Eyes are blinded, and Consciences sear'd by Envy and Interest, who from pretended Friends are become my real Adversaries, contrary to Reason and Justice. But further, none can believe I cou'd keep any dangerous Correspondence, when its well known that for these three years and a half all my Letters were no otherwise Directed, than for me at the <hi>Royal Coffee-house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides it appear'd at the Committee by <hi>Norris</hi> his own Papers, that this Priest <hi>Dowdall,</hi> (whose Name I never heard before) died <hi>September</hi> last was twelve Months, eight Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I heard there was such a man in the world as <hi>Norris,</hi> and at a time when I was in another Country. And since you have thought fit to acquit Dr <hi>D.</hi> who was my Author and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and who own'd himself a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>; I hope you will not think it equal, that I a known sincere Protestant, and but an Accessary, shou'd stand Committed, and Committed after such a manner, as neither Felon nor Traitor, not only Accus'd, but Convicted, cou'd suffer a Closer Confinement.</p>
            <p>And here, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I intreat your leave to ask Pardon, if at the Committee my behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our has offended any of the Members of this Honourable House, and to say, whatever heat I express'd, was the effect of Passion, to which I was mov'd, by hearing several of them in public, as at <hi>Locketts</hi> and other Eating and <hi>Coffee-houses,</hi> had call'd me <hi>Papist,</hi> and a second <hi>Coleman,</hi> with other Aspersions I cou'd not bear without resentment: To this was added my being commanded a Messenger for: Dr. <hi>D.</hi> an office beneath me, and wherein I cou'd not expect to be s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccessful, not knowing whether he wou'd appear without Compulsion. I hope it will not be accounted an unexpiable Crime for a Gentleman of more Years and Discretion, than I can pretend to, to shew himself disturb'd at a conceiv'd Indignity or Affront; and in hopes it may not be accounted so hainous, I do once more withall due Submission beg pardon. There is one thing more I cannot without trouble touch upon, the Reflections the Written Votes, very different from the Printed, bring upon my Reputation; In those 'tis said, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that I have succeeded Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> than which there never was a more groundless, false, or malicious invention: And also that I question'd your Authority, and said your Proceedings look'd like the late Rebellion. However Sir <hi>William Roberts</hi> came to make the Report, my words were to Sir <hi>Iohn Morton</hi> in another Room, and to him I appeal, whether they were not thus. Upon his advising that I shou'd fare the better, if I freely shew'd my Papers, I told him I wou'd not hid one, nor dispute their power, thò I had heard others did; and that the Seizing Closets and Writings, was not only Illegal, but look'd upon as one of the Causes of the last Rebellion; thereupon he wish'd I had not said the Words: I reply'd, I meant no harm by those Objections, and notwithstanding my mentioning them, they shou'd find in me a readiness to obey, and an intire submission; and added, if they were offensive, I unsaid them, and ask'd his pardon, as I now humbly do from the whole House, if I am thought herein to have offended. And to do Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> Justice, he was pleas'd to promise he wou'd take no notice of the Discourse, unless commanded; to whom with the rest of the Committee I refer my self, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my own accord I was not going along with them, when I met your Messenger.</p>
            <p>If I had been guilty of any Crime, I had not only Warning, but Threats and Advices to fly many days, some weeks before, when I was told by Letters from unknown hands, and by several persons of Honour and Quality, that I was design'd to be brought into trouble; I need not in this place say, for what reason. And here I cannot by the way but take notice of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port made by Justice <hi>Warcup</hi> at this Bar, and spread at <hi>Coffee-houses</hi>; that he shou'd have Search'd Mr. <hi>Sheridans</hi> Lodgings, and there found only a Parcel of <hi>Popish</hi> Books, whereas he never was in mine, but at Mr. <hi>Brunetty's</hi> House, an <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant, whose Books those must have been, and therefore I hope this was some Clarks, rather than his mistake.</p>
            <p>And now since no man can be plac'd beyond the reach of Malice, and the devices of the wicked, and that I happen to be brought hither as a suppos'd Criminal, I am extreamly pleas'd, I have the good fortune to meet with so wise and equal Judges, as compose this August and Honourable Assembly; where I am so far from fears, that I do not doubt, but upon an exact Scrutiny, and an Impartial Examination, my having been so infinitely traduc'd, and so wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully expos'd to the publick; will be so far from gratifying my Adversaries unjust desires, that they will not only be defeated, but my self greatly advantag'd; and therefore I leave my Cause at the Footstool of your Justice, and willingly submit to your Pleasure and Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, praying no other favour, than what I am sure you wou'd grant without asking; your full Consideration of the whole Matter, your speedy Condemnation or Acquittal, as I shall be found Guilty or Innocent.</p>
