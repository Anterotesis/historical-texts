            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By the contents of which when you read it, you will eaſily perceive what it tends to, and how deſperate and dangerous it is to the hazzard of the whole Kingdome, and to fruſtrate all thoſe endeavours of the Parliament, the Army and Kingdome for a happy ſettlement: And likewiſe to precipitate all into a new and bloody warre. We cannot therefore but acquaint you that we looke at this as a buſineſs ſet on foot, by the mallice of ſome deſperate minded men, this being their laſt engine for the putting all into confuſion, when they could not accompliſh their wicked ends by other meanes.

            <p>We wonder that divers men did calumniate that our marching ſo near the City, and put ſo bad repreſentations upon it, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ogether with ſuch information as may give them an opportunity to diſcover the bottome of this buſineſs. We were marching from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65577:3"/>
London when we received this information in obedience to the Parliament, and to give the City more content and to ſtop the mouth of ſlanderers.</p>
            <p>But if ſuch deſignes ſo diſtructive to the Parliament, and the worke in hand be ſuffered to go on, or that the Parliament be interrupted in the freedome of their debates and proceedings as we heare within this few dayes, they were by thoſe that are invited in this confederacy, We beg it of the Parliament, as they tender their own ſafety, the peace of the Kingdome, and preventing of a ſecond warre, as they would not have the Kingdome looſe the fruit and benefit of all that blood and treaſure that hath been ſpent in this cauſe that they do not ſuffer their freedome and liberty to be indangered by ſuch deſignes as theſe, they having an Army, which by the bleſſing of God in ſpight of all that their and the Kingdomes enemies can doe, will ſtand and fall with them, and be found faithfull and obedient to them in all things, and as ready to relieve Ireland when the peace and right of this Kingdome are ſetled.</p>
            <p>We write not this to deſire the Parliament to invite us to march up to them, we care not how great a diſtance we are from London, if it be the Parliaments pleaſure, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts with their ſecurity, and the breaking of thoſe combinations which are hatcht in the bowels of that City.</p>
            <p>We are haſtning our propoſals which are for the generall ſettlement, and which we are confident will ſatisfie all that love truth and peace. But we ſee plainly, we need more to intend ſecurity, then have cauſe to expect to bring things to a happy iſsue by treaty, whilſt ſuch deſignes are on foot. We pray you therefore that the Parliament would ſpeedily and throughly inquire into, and breake theſe deſignes, wherein as in all things elſe we ſhall be ready to ſerve them, as they ſhall judge it needfull, and when they ſhall command us.</p>
