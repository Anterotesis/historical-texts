            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVery Braſs Cut, or Print, is called a Table; and the ſaid Prints or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, are twenty four, and have their reſpective Numbers ſet at the Foot of the Table, or Print, on the corner that is outmoſt, and againſt the Readers right hand. Each particular Figure is alſo numbred, and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſet over its Head, and the ſeveral parts of each Figure, are diſtinguiſhed by Letters of the Alphabet, for the eaſier finding. To compare therefore, the Diſcourſe with the Tables, I ſhall teach you by an Example or two. In Chap. 8. page 9. line 21. The word <hi>Coronalis,</hi> is marked with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi rend="sup">a</hi>; to which Letter, looking at the end of the ſaid Chapter, you find <hi rend="sup">a</hi> T. 15. f. 3. a a a. □ intimating that you muſt turn to Table 15. Figure 3. and that part of the Figure which is marked a a a. which repreſents the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Suture of the Skull: The Mark □ ſhews that the former Citation is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Again, in the next line of page 9. by the word <hi>Lambdoides,</hi> you find Letter <hi rend="sup">b</hi>, to which looking at the end of the ſaid Chapter, you find <hi rend="sup">b</hi> f. 4. b b. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to teach you that in the 15 Table foregoing, Figure 4. and on that part of the Figure marked b b. you ſhall find the Suture of the Skull called <hi>Lambdoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:</hi> and this mark □ after b b. ſhews again that the Citation is ended. Again, in the ſame line, by the word <hi>Sagittalis,</hi> you find Letter <hi rend="sup">c</hi>, to which turning at the end of the Chapter, you ſhall there find <hi rend="sup">c</hi> f. 3. b b. f. 4. a a. intimating that in Figure 3. of the forenamed Table 15. and in that part of the Figure which is marked b b. Alſo in Figure 4. of the ſame Table, on that part which is marked a a you ſhall find the Sagittal Suture deſcribed. The mark □ ſhews the Citation is ended.</p>
            <p>Note that where you find not among the Directory Letters, T. for Table, that Figure belongs to the fore-mentioned Table. Alſo you are to take notice that between two Citations, you ſhall find this mark □.</p>
            <p>Finally. He that would make his moſt advantage by the uſe of this Book, ſhould, having been preſent at ſome Anatomical Diſſections of the whol Body; ſtudy the Tables firſt, with their Explanations on the oppoſite Pages; and then read the Diſcourſe of <hi>Riolanus,</hi> and compare it all along with the Tables, which may be beſt done, if the Tables be bound up by themſelves, ſo as to lie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen alwaies while he is reading the reſpective Chapters, referring to each Table.</p>

For I judged (and I ſuppoſe rightly) that for a Gentleman of name and note, at that time to dare to vindicate the true Chriſtian Baptiſme, contemning the clamorous cenſures of the weake Multitude of Pretenders to Religion and Learning, was an Act of more true and high Courage than to ſtorm a Town. And I humbly conceive, Experience has evidenced the Truth hereof, ſince hundreds (not to ſay thouſands) that have adventured their Lives to gain Honor and Riches in the Field, have in their hearts found it too hard an Adventure (however otherwiſe convinc't in their underſtandings) to own and acknowledg the true Chriſtian Baptiſme, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves to the ſcorned practice thereof, with the evident hazard of much of their acquired Honor, and of their future Repute, and the advacement depending there upon.</p>
            <p>That this action, nevertheleſs, of yours (my Lord) has not been attended, with al that Ignominy and Prejudice, which was only to be expected from Men; is the ſingular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, giving Courage and Ingenuity, to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of note, ſoon after (much animated doubtleſs by ſo noble and generous a Leader as your Lordſhip) to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and ſubmit to the Divine verity, and beautiful, and moſt

               </gap>d <hi>Solace</hi> of my Life) taken from me: but it hath been my hard hap alſo to ſee his <hi>Reputation,</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> (which wil be dear to al Poſterity, for the Works he hath written for the Common Good of this Nation) blemiſhed, and Eclipſed, by the <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>unjuſt Forgeries</hi> of one, who, though he calls himſelf <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> is far from being <hi>an Iſraelite in whom there is no guile;</hi> who was not content to publiſh a <hi>Hodgpodg</hi> of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted Collections,</hi> and <hi>Obſervations</hi> of my deer Husband deceaſed, under the Title of <hi>Culpeper's laſt Legacy;</hi> but to make the Deceit more taking, he ſteeled his Forehead ſo far, and braſed it ſo hard, as not to be aſhamed to forge <hi>two Epiſtles,</hi> one in mine, and the other in my Husbands Name; of the penning of which, he nor I, never ſo much as drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: And yet he <hi>impudently</hi> affirmeth in my Name, that my Husband <hi>Laid a ſevere Injunction on me to publiſh them for the general good, after his deceaſe; and that they are his laſt Experiences in Phyſick and Chyrurgery.</hi> And in the Title of his Book, he ſaid, <hi>They are the choyceſt, and moſt profitable ſecrets, reſolved never to be publiſhed til after his Death.</hi> Al which Expreſſions in the Title and Epiſtles, are as falſ as the Father of Lyes; and every word in them, forged and feigned. And he knew wel enough, that no diſcreet, honeſt man, that was a friend to my Husband, or me, would ever have agreed to ſuch infamous and diſhoneſt practices; and therefore I deſire all courteous Readers of the Writings of my Husband, to take notice of this <hi>Deceit,</hi> and to aſſure themſelvs that it never entred into his head, to publiſh ſuch an undigeſted <hi>Gallimoffery,</hi> under the promiſing and ſolemn Name of his <hi>Laſt Legacy,</hi> and that <hi>whereby he gained his Reputation in the World,</hi> as the Impoſter makes him speak in his forged Epiſtle. And I deſire any in different Reader, that hath obſerved my Husbands lofty, and Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line manner of expreſſing himſelf in his Prefaces, and Epiſtles Dedicatory, whether in caſe he had been minded or diſpoſed to take ſo ſolemn a farewel of the world, as the <hi>Forger</hi> makes him to do; whether, I ſay, he would have done it in ſuch a <hi>whining faſhion,</hi> and ſo in the Stile of a <hi>Balade-maker,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>And now, if it pleaſe Heaven to put a period to my Life, and Studies, that I muſt bid al things under the Sun farewel: Farewel to my dear Wife and Child, farewel Arts and Sciences, farewel al worldly Glories, adiew Readers.</hi> Certainly my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band would have been far more ſerious, and materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in ſuch a caſe, as any diſcreet man wil Judg. Neither can it be thought, that in ſuch a ſolemn <hi>Valediction,</hi> he could poſſibly forget his wonted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the <hi>Colledg of Doctors,</hi> to whom he did ſo frequently addreſs himſelf, in divers of his writings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Courteous Reader,</hi> I ſhal ſay no more touching the abuſe of the Book-ſeller, only to prevent (as much as concerns me) thy being abuſed for the future, know, That my Husband left ſeventy-nine Books of his own making, or Tranſlating, in my hand, and I have depoſited them into the hands of his, and my much honored Friend, Mr. <hi>Peter Cole,</hi> Book-ſeller, at the <hi>Printing-Preſs,</hi> neer the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> (for the good of my Child) from whom thou mayeſt expect to receive in print, ſuch of them as ſhal be thought fit to ſerve thee in due ſeaſon, without any Diſguiſes or Forgeries, unto which I do hereby give my atteſtation. Alſo my Husband left ſeventeen Books compleatly perfected, in the hands of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> for which he paid my Husband in his life-time: And Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> is ready and willing (on any good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) to ſhew any of the ſaid ſeventy-nine Books, or the ſeventeen, to ſuch as doubt thereof.</p>
            <p>And if any Perſon ſhal queſtion the Truth of any part of this Vindication, or Epiſtle; if they wil take pains to come to me, <hi>I</hi> wil face to face, juſtifie the truth of every word thereof, as <hi>I</hi> have ſubſcribed my Hand thereunto in the preſence of many witneſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> profeſs in the preſence of the great God, the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of al hearts, before whom Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> and I muſt one day give an account of al our Actions: That <hi>I</hi> have not publiſhed this Epiſtle or Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of any diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And out of tenderneſs to Mr. <hi>Brooks, I</hi> firſt tried other means of keeping, and afterwards of repairing my Husbands Credit, and then ſtayed long to ſee if he would repair (in any meaſure) the wrong done to my Husband, and myſelf. <hi>I</hi> deſire to be.</p>

ſeeing the Natural Conſtitution of every Part which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> cals <hi>Euphuian,</hi> and is commonly called <hi>Health,</hi> is three-fold, <hi>Similar, Organical,</hi> and <hi>common,</hi> The Preternatural Conſtitution of the Parts, called Sickneſs, muſt likewiſe be three-fold and make three kinds of Diſeaſes, <hi>Viz.</hi> A Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the Similar, a Diſeaſe of the Organical Parts, and a Diſeaſe common to both. <hi>The Similar Conſtitution,</hi> according to Nature, conſiſts in <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and Temper;</hi> The <hi>Organical Conſtitution,</hi> which pertains to the conſtruction of the Organ, is placed, <hi>in number, Magnitude, Scituation, and ſhape or Conformation;</hi> which Conformation is again divided into <hi>Figure, Paſſage, Cavity, Roughneſs, and ſmoothneſs; The common Conſtitution of Similar, and Organical Parts, conſiſts in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Connexion.</hi> This three-fold Natural Conſtitution, I wil declare in al the Parts; afterwards I wil lay down in a few words, what may be gathered from this Sound Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, for the Knowledg, fore knowledg, and Cure of a Diſeaſed Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And <hi>Anatomy</hi> handled in this Method, wil be the beginning, Middle, and end of the whol Art of Phyſick. This is a ſhort, eaſie, and clear Method, Quickly, and rightly to learn the Art of Curing; which propounds the ſame, viſible to the Eyes of ſuch as are wel verſt in my Fathers writings, or in the <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> of <hi>Sennertus.</hi> for by this Method, I ſhal unlock, &amp; diſplay the treaſures in Anatomy of Phyſick: But perhaps ſome Fool, that is unskilled, wil reprove our Diſigne, &amp; Object, that we confound the whol Art of Medicine, ſeing <hi>Anatomy</hi> is a Part of <hi>Phyſiology,</hi> diſtinct from the reſt; and therefore ought to be taught apart, ſeeing <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, in the beginning of his diſſection of <hi>Muſcles,</hi> reproves the Anatomical Book of <hi>Lycus;</hi> becauſe in his Treatiſe of Muſcles he inſerted the Diſeaſes of the Parts. If any prattle ſuch things againſt us, they wil quickly hold their peace, if they read <hi>Gal. Lib. 2 admin. Anatom.</hi> Relateing, That Antient Phyſitians regarded <hi>Anatomy</hi> ſo much, that in al <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did in al his Books. Many are the Sorts of the Figures, both within, and without the Body, (ſaith <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in <hi>Lib. de vet.

Therefore <hi>Galen</hi> wrote his <hi>Therapeuticks</hi> of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Medicines, according to the Parts afflicted: and <hi>Avicenna</hi> did wiſely, when perceving that <hi>the Seats of Diſeaſes could not be known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out skil in Anatomy,</hi> Before the Diſeaſes of the particular Parts he ſet down their Anatomy.

               <p>THat kind of ſtile is two-fold, which is uſed in the explication of any thing, <hi>Gal. Com. ad Part. q. Lib. 1. de fract. et Cap. 1. Lib.</hi>

For which Cauſe <hi>Galen</hi> divided his Books into Iſagogical, and perfect; the firſt being fitted to young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the other to proficients, as himſelf teſtifies. <hi>Lib. de libris Propriis.</hi> This is alſo confirmed by the authority of <hi>Hippocrates; Lib. de vet. Med.</hi> Where he adviſeth Phyſitians to teach eaſie things to young ſtudents, and ſuch as may be quickly learned; ad hereunto; That al men deſire to learn apace, according to <hi>Ariſtor. Lib. 2 de Rhetor. Chap.</hi> 10. And the Method of breife teaching, is alwaies grateful, both to young ſtudents, and to perfect Maſters; for it teacheth the former what things muſt be learned; and in the latter cals back to their memory what they have learned before, and almoſt forgotten, <hi>Gal. Lib. 4. de diff. puls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wiſely, and Elegantly, did the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian</hi> judg, That a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of the Lawes was firſt to be propounded, to invite Novices to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. <hi>Then are al things delivered moſt commodiouſly when they are firſt delivered by a plain and ſimple way, and then by an exact and diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; for if we burden weak, though ſtudious minds at beginning, with variety and Multiplicity of things, we either make them deſert their ſtudies, or elſe young Men to great labor and diſtruſt, and bring them by a longer way to what might be learned with more ſpeed, leſs labor, and no diſtruſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore following the precepts of <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> I wil deſcribe<note place="margin">Why the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor wrote a Synopſis.</note> a briefe, and cleer Manual of Anatomy, following the counſel of <hi>Galen,</hi> who had rather write a <hi>Synopſis of his Books of Pulſes</hi> himſelf, then to leave the buſineſs to another, who by not underſtanding his mind, and ſenſe, ſhould pervert or confound his meaning.</p>
               <p>I begin with the Bones, becauſe they are the foundation of al the Parts of the whol Body, which is ſubſtained, Included, Preſerved, and moved by the<note place="margin">Why he begins with the Bones.</note> Bones; which, according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> give ſtability, and form to the Body.</p>

               <p>THat the Nature of a Bone may be perfectly underſtood, there are four<note place="margin">Four Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</note> things to be conſidered in it: The Matter, Efficient, Form, and End.</p>
               <p>The Matter of the Bone is Proper, or Diverſe.<note place="margin">1. Matter, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Generation.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Proper is conſidered Generally, or Specially.</p>
               <p>Proper Matter, taken Generally, is double; the one for Generation, the other for Nouriſhment; the Bones are made of the Seed by conſent of al Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians. The Seed conſiſts of Humor, and Spirit: The Humors are of two Parts; the one thinner, of which the noble Parts are formed; the other thicker, of which the Bones are ingendred.</p>
               <p>The matter of Nouriſhment is alſo two fold; Remote, and Neer: Remote, is Blood, by which al the Parts of our Body are nouriſhed: Neer, is the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row<note place="margin">Nouriſhment.</note> contained in the Cavity of the Bones, or a Marrowy Juyce ſhut up in the Spongious Bones.</p>
               <p>The Proper Matter conſidered ſpecially, regards the Bone already made, which is various in reſpect of ſubſtance, and quality; and ſo the ſubſtance of<note place="margin">Conſtitution.</note> one Bone is diverſe, by reaſon of the <hi>Epiphyſis,</hi> which is Softer then the reſt of the Bone; or the <hi>Apophyſis,</hi> which is harder then the reſt of the Bone: alſo the whol Bone, if it be Sollid, is harder without, then it is within. If it be hollow, the Internal Superficies is hardeſt.</p>
               <p>As for what belongs to Quality, and Namely Color; the Bone, the more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Membrane which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth about the Bone, is called <hi>Perioſtion,</hi> and ſticks firmly to it. By be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of which, it Obſcurely feels. The extremities of the Bones are covered with a Cartilage, which Facilitaces the Motion of the Bone, and hinders its wearing.</p>
               <p>The Efficient Cauſe of the Bone, is the Implanted Generative Spirit, or<note place="margin">2. Efficient cauſe.</note> rather heat, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>SEeing it is not ſafe, nor comly for man, that Divine Creature, to creep<note place="margin">Why there are many Bones in man.</note> along like Worms, and Serpents; Nature hath ſet his body bolt upright, with firm, and ſollid bones; not only three, or four in number, but very many various, and diſtinct, whereby he may bow, and move himſelf every way; And that this Workmanſhip might be the more Elegant, the Bones are ſo Joyned together, that the extremity of one, enters into the Cavity of the other.</p>
               <p>This ſtructure is called a Joynt, the Nature of which, is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted amongſt Anatomiſts; ſome contending that the touching of two bones one with another, makes a Joynt; others, beſides touching, ad motion. So that it is the movable touching of two bones, which makes a Joynt.</p>
               <p>If Motion be removed from the Definition of a Joynt, <hi>Galens</hi> Doctrine may eaſily be defended. He conſtitutes two kinds of Articulation; <hi>Diarthroſis,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49866:10"/>
with mainfeſt Motion; <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> with Obſcure, or no Motion: and he aſſigns the differences of <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> which are altogether immovable, to be<note place="margin">Conjunction of Bones is either by Articulation the Differences of which are Diarthroſis &amp; Synarthroſis.</note> 
                  <hi>Sutura, Harmonia,</hi> and <hi>Gomphoſis;</hi> with thoſe which take away Motion in the Definition of Articulation, refer to the third ſpeeies of Articulation, which they cal Neutral, or mean, between <hi>Diarthroſis</hi> and <hi>Synarthroſis.</hi> Some give it a new Name, <hi>Amphiarthroſis,</hi> to wit, when the ſtructure is ſo Obſcure, and the Motion ſo hidden, that you know not whether it appertain to <hi>Diarthroſis,</hi> or <hi>Synarthroſis.</hi> But that place of <hi>Galen</hi> being il underſtood, deceives many Anatomiſts. This Doctrine of <hi>Galen</hi> ſeems more probable, thus.</p>
               <p>The bones are knit together by <hi>Articulations,</hi> and <hi>Symphyſes: Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is the knittings, or touching of two bones; the differences of which are <hi>Diarthroſis,</hi> and <hi>Synarthroſis;</hi> the one hath evident Motion, the other Obſcure, or none at al; and therefore the differences of each, are equal: but the one, for example ſake, is called <hi>Enarthroſis Diarthrodes,</hi> with a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Motion; the other <hi>Enarthroſis Synarthrodes,</hi> with an Obſcure Motion;<note place="margin">The common ſpecies of which are. 1, Enarthroſis.</note> Judg the like of the other differences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enarthroſis,</hi> is when a large, and long Head, goes into a deep Cavity; which ſeeing it is common both to <hi>Diarthroſis,</hi> and <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> we wil give an example of them Both. The Motion of <hi>Enarthroſis Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throdes,</hi> is manifeſt in the Joynt of the <hi>Iſchium:</hi> the Motion of <hi>Enar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throſis Synarthrodes,</hi> is Obſcure in the Articulation of the Ancle with the <hi>Scaphois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When a depreſſed, and plain Head, is received by a ſhallow and ſuperficial<note place="margin">2. Arthrodia.</note> Cavity, this Joynting is called <hi>Arthrodia.</hi> an exemple of <hi>Arthrodia Diarthrodes,</hi> is in the conjunction of the Shoulder with the <hi>Omoplata.</hi> An example of <hi>Arthrodia Synarthrodes,</hi> is in the Bones of the Wriſt, with the <hi>Metacarpus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ginglymos,</hi> is a mutual ingreſs of the bones, ſuch as you ſhal uſually ſee in<note place="margin">3. Ginglymus.</note> the hinges of Doors and Windows; in which that Part of the Hinge which bears and that which circles about, have a Mutual ingreſs one into another. The Motion of <hi>Ginglymus Diarthrodes,</hi> is manifeſt in the Elbow; the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ginglymus Synarthrades,</hi> is Obſcure in the joyning of the Ancle to the Heel. Modern writers add a fourth to thoſe three, which they cal <hi>Trochois,</hi> in which the Motion of converſion is apparent: ſuch is the joyning of the firſt <hi>Vertebra</hi> with the ſecond, but it is to be referred to <hi>Arthrodia;</hi> As for what belongs to <hi>Ginglimus,</hi> and its various differences, we wil thus Methodically handle them: <hi>Ginglimus</hi> is an Articulation of bones, by mutual reception;<note place="margin">Which is Simple or Compound.</note> and is ſimple, or compound: that is called ſimple, which is made of two bones, by one only and ſimple Articulation in the ſame Part, as in the juncture off the Elbow and Arm. Compound <hi>Ginglymus</hi> conſiſts of a double Articul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which is performed either in the ſame extremities, or in places diſtant, of two or three Bones, which by a double Articulation end in the ſame extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. It is ſeen in the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck. A compound <hi>Ginglymos</hi> by a double Articulation in places diſtant is ſeen in the <hi>Cubitus</hi> and <hi>Radius,</hi> in diſtant places of three bones is ſeen in al the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back and Loynes.</p>
               <p>Beſides <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> containes under it, <hi>Harmonia, Sutura,</hi> and <hi>Gom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis,</hi>

                  <hi>Harmonia,</hi> is a Conjunction of bones, by ſimple touching without mutual ingreſs; and is diſtinguiſhed by a Line, either right, or oblique, or many fold. <note n="b" place="bottom">f. 4. a. b. □</note> 
                  <hi>Sutura,</hi> is the joyning of bones: as though the Teeth of two Jawes, or two Combs were thruſt one within the other, and is altogether of one and the ſame form. <hi>Gomphoſis,</hi> is when one bone ſticks faſt, and immovably in another, like a Naile in a Poſt.</p>
               <p>Oppoſite to <hi>Articulation;</hi> is <hi>Symphyſis,</hi> which is an immovable conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">3. Gomphoſis.

When he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the deformities of Bones, which are in Children. <hi>The Natural figure,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the members, and of the whol Body, is changed either in the Womb, or at the Birth, or after the Birth; It is depraved in the Womb when the formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is vitiated, by reaſon of abounding, or unfit matter,</hi> It <hi>is depraved in the Birth, when the Midwife takes it not righly, or binds it not up rightly, being born, after the birth the Nurſe, in taking of it up laying it down, or carrying of it, or waſhing of it, or binding it up; in al theſe the Nature of every member is eaſily turned out of its courſe, and corrupted. Theſe alſo happen in unfit Motions, whilſt it is ſet to ſtand or walk, before its time, or expoſed to vehement Motions. For unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and vehement motions weaken the Limbs, and the Legs, are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or outwards by the waight of the Body; and thoſe Limbs which ſhould be ſtraight are made crooked, the Parts of the breaſt are uſually inverted by Nurſes, by binding them too bard, in their firſt education; this we ſee almoſt continually in Virgins, whilſt Nurſes ſtudy to encreaſe thoſe parts, which are about the Hips and Bowels that, they may exceed the bigneſs of the Breaſt, they bind the Parts about the Breaſt ſo vehement heard, that the breaſt becomes ſharp, and they look as though they were broken backt; and ſomtimes are crook Shouldred.</hi>

               <p>You ſee by <hi>Galen,</hi> what miſeries and deformities little Children are ſubject too; by reaſon of ill forming the Bones, which may be corrected whilſt they are Young, and Flexible, and brought into what form you will.</p>

As for the bones they are like the bones of ſuch as are grown up, both in figure, number, and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.

               <p>They begin to paſs out of the Gums about the ſeventh Month, ſomtimes ſooner if the Nurſes Milk be very hot. Some few have Teeth when they are borne as, <hi>Cneus Papyrius Carbo</hi> and <hi>M. Curtius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They do not break out altogether, but by degrees, in two years ſpace; and the<note place="margin">At what time they apear.</note> upper Teeth uſually, come out ſooner then the lower: firſt of al the Cutters, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards two Grinders, then the Dog Teeth; the breeding of which, is moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Children.</p>
               <p>When Children have twenty Teeth, then they uſually ſay, they have al their Teeth; neither indeed have they more, before they are three or four years of Age.</p>

               <p>Their generation is two-fold; one in the Womb, the other without the Womb;<note place="margin">Their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for in the Womb the Teeth are formed with the other parts, but are imperfect. Within each hole, is contained a Mucous, and hardiſh ſubſtance, concluded in a little white Membrane, which grows dry, and take a bony Nature by degrees, and to get out pierceth the Gum with its top; the Membrane compaſſeth the hole round, and like Glue retains the Tooth: The other portion, namely, the Root of the Tooth, remaines ſtil within the hole, being ſoft and Mucous, as the Feathers of

               <p>Under theſe Teeth, in every hole, is ſubjected the Seminal matter of another Tooth, a Membrane paſſing betwen them; which whilſt it is fermented by the formative faculty, and growing up, it expels the former. This ſecond matter thus included with a membrane, hath deceived many Anatomiſts, which thought the Teeth conſiſted of two Parts; and that other Part of the Tooth, was an <hi>Epiphyſis</hi> of the Root: therefore <hi>Veſalius,</hi> and <hi>Columbus,</hi> held the Teeth in Children, ought not to be pulled out by the Roots, but tranſverſly to be broken off, as thinking that a new Tooth grew up from the ſame Root, which could never be, if the former were pulled up by the Root. But <hi>Celſus</hi> in my Judgment wrote more truly, that there was a new Tooth in Children, which did expel the former, and ſomtimes grew out beſides it, either aboue, or below it.</p>

The ſecond <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, beſides the three parts common with the reſt, hath a fourth eminent <hi>Epiphyſis,</hi> called <hi>Pyrenois</hi> or the Tooth.</p>

The ſecond three hundred fourty five. The third two hundred fifty nine. The fourth one hundred ninety two. But this laſt Number I doubt is deviſed, or elſe I do not underſtand what <hi>Ingraſſias</hi> means.</p>
               <p>Theſe Numbers he thus compoſeth.</p>
               <p>In ſuch Children as are grown up are found three hundred five bones, in the Head ſeventy, to wit, eight in the Skul, twelve of the upper Jaw, one of the lower Jaw, ſix of the Ears, thirty two Teeth, eleven ſmal bones of the <hi>Os Hyois,</hi> which al joyned together make ſeventy. The Trunk comprehends ſixty ſeven, <hi>Vertebrae</hi> twenty four, <hi>Scapulae</hi> two, <hi>Ingulae</hi> two, <hi>Sternum</hi> three, <hi>Ilium</hi> two. Theſe joyned together make ſixty ſeven. But if the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> conſiſt of five and the <hi>Coccyx</hi> of three, (as often it doth) then there wil be only ſixty ſix. In both hands, eighty four, (adding the twenty four <hi>Seſamoides</hi>) in both Feet eighty four, the twenty four <hi>Seſamoides</hi> being alſo added, the total Number of bones wil be three hundred and five; form this Number if you take away thirty two Teeth which doth not appear in Infants, the reſult is two hundred ſeventy three, although the Teeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formed lie hid in the Gums, yet becauſe there is no uſe of them, they are not reckoned amongſt the bones.</p>
               <p>In reckoning the ſecond Number he proceeds thus, the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back-bone and <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> in Infants are divided into three Parts, the ſecond excepted which is divided into four by reaſon of the Teeth, the <hi>Ilium</hi> is divided into three bones the <hi>Sternum</hi> into eight, the inferior Jaw of two, and the Frontal bone is double.</p>
               <p>Theſe diligently conſidered you ſhould find amount to ſeventy two, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to two hundred ſeventy three make three hundred fourty five, from which if you take away the bones which deſerve rather the Names of Cartilages than bones, as the bones of the Wriſt ſixteen, of the Inſtep eight, of the <hi>Coccyx</hi> four, <hi>Seſamoides</hi> fourty eight; each Knee-pan and Hyois eight (the three ſmal bones remaining) which are in number eighty ſix, there remains two hundred fifty nine. In theſe Numbers the three hundred fitty one Appendices are not Numbred which if you ad to three hunded fourty five, the Body of the Infant wil be compoſed of ſix hundred ſeventy Bones.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing that according to <hi>Ariſtotle Chap. 1. Lib. 1. poſt. Analyt.</hi> Every Doctrine and diſcipline which conſiſts in reaſon and intelligence, is perfected by fore-knowledg, and <hi>Tullius Lib. 1. de nat. Deorum,</hi> ſaith that without fore-knowledg, neither any thing can be underſtood nor ſtudyed, nor diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Before I ſet about my Anatomical work I thought good to premiſe certain general Precepts, which are the foundations of Anatomy, and wil give great light to our proceeding.</p>
               <p>The Body of man is conſidered by Anatomiſts as compoſed of many<note place="margin">How Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Conſider the Body of Man.</note> Parts, which they examine Limb by Limb, and by a diligent Diſſection, they divide the whol Body, into its ſmalleſt Parts. They divide it firſt into three grand Parts, Containing, Contained, and Impelling; that is into the Parts, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and Spirits. But in the Anatomical diſſection of a dead Body, the Humors<note place="margin">Its Parts.</note> and Spirits, are not conſidered, the Speculation of which belongs to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiology, only the Sollid Parts are regarded, which are either ſuch as make, or ſuch<note place="margin">Sollid Parts how many fold.</note> as contain Humors and Spirits or the inſtruments of Motion, which is the Chief Action of a living Creature, for which it was made. The ſollid Parts are ſimilar or diſſimilar. They are called ſimilar Parts becauſe they are moſt ſimple, from<note place="margin">Similar Parts what how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> which, as from a principle, the diſſimilar Parts are compoſed. The ſimilar Parts according to Anatomiſts are Bones, Cartilages, Ligaments, Membranes, <hi>Fibres,</hi> Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Fleſh, Fat. Theſe are found almoſt in al Compound and diſſimilar Parts, and the Corpulency of the Parts is formed of them. The Hairs, and Naills are excrements of the external Parts: Therefore an Anatomiſt ought to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49866:20"/>
be wel inſtructed what theſe ſimilar Parts are, that when he ſearcheth out the ſtructure of the organical parts, Limb by Limb, he may know the Fundamentals of this ſtructure.</p>
               <p>1. A bone is a part of the Body, moſt cold and dry, Terreſtial; and therefore<note place="margin">1. A Bone.</note> hardeſt, that ſo it may prop up the other parts of the body.</p>
               <p>2. A Cartilage, or Griſtle, is not ſo hard as a bone, which in Old Men ſomtimes<note place="margin">2. A Cartilage.</note> degenerates into a bone: The Cartilages are placed about the extremities of the bone, to eaſe them in their Motion; ſome are found ſeparated from the bones, as the Cartilages of the inferior Jaw, in the Articulation of the <hi>Claviculae,</hi> in the <hi>Sternum,</hi> in the Articulation of the <hi>Tibia</hi> to the Thigh; beſides the Cartilages of the <hi>Larinx,</hi> Wind-pipe, and ſuch as are placed to prop up other ſoft Parts, as the Noſtrels, and Ears.</p>
               <p>3. A Ligament, or bond, is a part which binds the bones together, being of a<note place="margin">3. Ligament.</note> middle ſubſtance, between a Cartilage, and a Membrane; ſofter than a Cartilage, harder than a Membrane.</p>
               <p>4. A Membrane, Skin, or Coat, is very ſoft, and ſubject to dilation. It is the<note place="margin">4. Membrane.</note> covering of other parts, or the Receptacle of ſomthing; as the Stomach, Bladder of <hi>Gal:</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> being a hollow body, it receiving ſomthing, it may be called <hi>Tunica,</hi> a Coat; If it Embrace and cover a ſollid body, it is propperly called <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. A <hi>Fibrae</hi> is like a threed ſtretched over a Membrane, or Interwoven there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,<note place="margin">5. Fibra.</note> to ſtrengthen it: and becauſe of its various Scituation, it is called <hi>Right, Oblique,</hi> and <hi>Tranſverſe;</hi> not only to help the Membrane, but alſo to ſtrenghten it. Every ſort of <hi>Fibres,</hi> is thought to perform a ſeveral action; as the <hi>Right,</hi> to draw to; the <hi>Tranſverſe,</hi> to retain; and the <hi>Oblique,</hi> to expel. Which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions notwithſtanding, abſolutely depend upon the inbred faculty of the Part; which as it hath a violent dilation, ſo hath it a willing, and Natural contraction, and is helped in theſe by the <hi>Fibres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>A vein,</hi> is a Membranous Veſſel, round and hollow, allotted to contain<note place="margin">6. A Vein.</note> Blood, and diſtribute it for the Nouriſhment of the whol Body.</p>
               <p>7. An <hi>Artery</hi> is a Membranous Channel of the ſame Nature, but ſomthing<note place="margin">7. Artery.</note> harder, and thicker; ordained for the containing and Diſtributing of the Arterious blood: The original of both which, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought was from the heart; but wiſer Phyſitians, hold the beginning of the Veins to be in the liver; but of the Arteries in the heart.</p>
               <p>8. A <hi>Nerve</hi> is a Channel made to carry animal Spirit; and becauſe this ſpirit is<note place="margin">8. Nerve.</note> moſt ſubtil, therefore the Cavity is ſo ſmal, that it is not diſcernable.</p>
               <p>9. The <hi>Fleſh</hi> is the foundation of organical, and diſſimilary Parts, where bone<note place="margin">9. Fleſh.</note> is wanting, and makes up the chief Part of our bulk. The fleſh is in ſubſtance, ſoft and thick; made of blood alone, compacted together, and wel concocted, if it be red; but of blood, and Seed, if it be white.</p>
               <p>A four-fold ſort of fleſh, is obſerved in the Parts; <hi>Viſcerous,</hi> and <hi>Muſculous,</hi> both of them very red; <hi>Membranous,</hi> and <hi>Glandulous,</hi> both of them white. For every ſubſtance of the bowels is called Fleſh, or <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> The thicker ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of certain Membranes, which are the containers of ſomthing, which by dilating and contracting their bodies, they attract, retain, and expel, are alſo called Fleſh, or a Fleſh-like ſubſtance. The thick, and ſpongy ſubſtance of the <hi>Glandulae,</hi> is called Fleſh; but eſpecially the ſubſtance of the Muſcles deſerves the Name of Fleſh.</p>
               <p>10. The Fat although it appear not til the whol body be formed, and when the<note place="margin">10. Fat.</note> Child is big, and grows to the Parts; yet becauſe in the compoſition of organical Parts, it often concurs to make up the bulk, it is Numbered amongſt the ſimilar Parts. Fat is the thinneſt ſubſtance of blood, Fat, and Oyly, ſweating out through the tender Coats of the Veins, and hardning between the Membranes: It is two-fold, according to <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> Soft, and external; Hard and internal. The one is Greaſe, The other Suet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49866:21"/>Theſe three ſimilar Parts; <hi>Bones, Cartilages,</hi> and <hi>Ligaments,</hi> ſhal be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, as they are ſhewed in a Carcaſs, from top to Toe, after we have ſhewed the Muſcles; becauſe they are ſo joyned together, that one cannot be ſhewed without another.</p>
               <p>But I deſire al ſuch as are ſtudious in Phyſick, firſt to be wel acquainted in the Oſteology or Hiſtory of the dry bones in the Skeleton of a Man, before they come to the inſpection of a Carcaſs; for ſo they wil the better underſtand the whol anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſcourſe of the diſſection, and find out the reaſon of my other <hi>Oſteology</hi> in the bones of Carcaſſes.</p>
               <p>The Reſt of the ſimilar Parts ſhal be ſhewed ſeverally in the explication of the diſſimilar Parts, ſeeing of the ſimilary Parts aforeſaid, viz. <hi>Bones, Cartilages, Ligaments, Membranes, Fibres, Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Fat,</hi> the Bulk, or Material ſubſtance of the diſſimilar Parts, is made up, and therefore you ſhal hear ſimilary Parts often mentioned, in the explication of them; howbeit, in ſome places they exiſt apart, no waies joined, or united unto others, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute an Organ; but are conſidered with reference to their Particular uſes.</p>
               <p>But they concur together, and are united one with another, in organical Parts,<note place="margin">Organical Parts, what?</note> that they may perform their various Offices: for the effect of which, they are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into four orders: For in every Organ there is the principal Part by which the Action is performed: Another, without which the Action cannot be done: A third, by which the action is preſerved. But in every Organ, the principal Part ought to be ſimilar and proper to it, ſuch as is not found in another Organ. But this ſimilar Part cannot perform its action alone, unleſs it be helped by others; and therefore the concourſe and Union of ſimilary Parts is neceſſary. Wherefore, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Movable action, belongs truly, and poperly to an Organical Part; and none unleſs it be alteration, belongs to a ſimilar Part; which out of the compoſition of the Organical, hath only uſe, which notwithſtanding, it contributes to perfect the action of the Organical.</p>
               <p>More over, organical Parts according to the dignity of their action, are divided<note place="margin">How many.</note> into <hi>Principal,</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtring.</hi> They are called principal, which ſupply the whol body with matter and faculty: Phyſitians hold them to be three; the <hi>Liver, Heart,</hi> and <hi>Brain: Ariſtotle</hi> held but one principal Part of the body, <hi>viz.</hi> The Heart, which is King and Ruler of al others. The reſt of the Parts Miniſter, and are ſubſervient to the principal. According to the various compoſition of the Organical they are divided into compound, more compound, and moſt compound: For the Finger is compound; the Hand, or Foot, more compound; the Limbs, are moſt compound.</p>
               <p>But that we may ſeek out the ſtructure of eath Part exactly; we muſt obſerve<note place="margin">What is to be obſerved in each Part.</note> the <hi>Name, Subſtance, Temperature, Original, Scituation, Quantity, Number, Figure, Color, Connexion, Communion, Action,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Connection differs from communion; for Connexion is the ſticking of one Part to anther, of one or more Parts by which they depend; it is ſomtimes taken for the Original of the part it ſelf, and yet the Original of ſome Parts is diſtinguiſhed from Connexion: But communion is either univerſal, with Parts remote and neer, which is done by Veins, Arteries, and Nerves, by intervening of which, al the Parts have community with one another; or Particular, when ſome Particular Part communitates its ſelf to ſome neer, or remote Parts, and ſo the Gal communicates it ſelf by the Biliar paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to the Liver, and the Gut <hi>Duodenum:</hi> The Reins, and Bladder have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters.</hi> In this Method you may comprehend whatſoever may be ſpoken, or demanded of any Part: But in the Hiſtory of Parts we muſt begin firſt of al with thoſe things that are common to the whol Organ, then with thoſe things which are Proper to the ſame Organ: but in deſcribing the Fabrick of the body of Man, we wil follow the common order of Diſſection.</p>

               <p>SEeing my deſign and intent of handling Anatomy, doth not conſiſt in a bear and<note place="margin">The neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</note> ſimple comtemplation of the Parts of the Body, but is alſo referred to the uſe of Medicine; before we come to the diſſection of the body of man, we wil deſcribe in a few words the Legitimate and natural conformation of the Body of Man when it is alive, which is the baſis whereby we judg of the Sickneſſes and imperfections of Men or Women: this was neceſſary of Old in buying of Servants, in joyning Men and Women in Marriage that they might have Children, and in chuſing ſelect Men for Soldiers. And this knowledg is neceſſary even to this day; for in ſome <hi>Monaſteries</hi> ſuch as deſire to lead a Religious life, the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> views them Naked from the Crown of the Head, to the Sole of the foot; and notes their reſpiration, and pulſe, and voice in ſinging. This is done in buying Slaves in divers Countries, and alſo in buying Horſes; and alſo Nurſes are exactly viewed by Phyſitians for the education of Children, I mean the Children of Princes.</p>
               <p>Therefore in Man-kind, you may conſider the difference of <hi>Sex: Subſtance of</hi>

               <p>As for that which belongs to Sex, Man-kind is twofold: Male and Female. The Latin<note place="margin">1. Sex.</note> word <hi>Homo</hi> comprehends both: and a Women has been called <hi>Vira,</hi> and therefore a ſtout Women is called <hi>Virago:</hi> the differences of both I have Accurately expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my <hi>Anthopographiae.

               <p>The ſubſtance of the Boby in Man ought to be fleſhy not Fat; firm and ſollid, not<note place="margin">2. Subſtance.</note> ſoft: the Limbs meanly hairy, for ſmoothneſs in Men, ſuch as is in Women, argues effeminate conditions.</p>
               <p>A healthful temper ought to be hot and moiſt, becauſe life conſiſts in, and is<note place="margin">3.

But by what ſigns this may be known, <hi>Galen</hi> hath declared in his little book of <hi>Art of Phyſick,</hi> and other Authors.</p>
               <p>The Magnitude of the body is threefold, according to the threefold Dimenſion of<note place="margin">4. Magnitude.</note> the body. We ſhal conſider cheifly the Longitude and Latitude: The natural and decent Longitude of the body ought to be four Cubits, the Latitude one Cubit as <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> teacheth: this alſo is confirmed by <hi>Vitruvius</hi> who defined the juſt Longitude of the body of man to be ſix Roman Feet. And <hi>Agellius Lib. 3. ex Varrone,</hi> Noted that the higheſt pitch of a Mans height was ſeven Foot: but more Men are ſhorter, than taller than this. <hi>Vegetius</hi> Writes that Soldiers ought to be choſon ſix Foot high, yet by Reaſon of difference of ſex, Region, and Diſeaſes, Men are either taller or ſhorter, for each ſoyl hath its Particular Nature: ſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Aſia</hi> are taller than thoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> and in <hi>Europe,</hi> thoſe of the North parts, as <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Low-Countries and thoſe of upper <hi>Germany</hi> are tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt.</p>
               <p>The various Menſuration of bodies <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath deſcribed <hi>Leb. de aer. aq. et loc.</hi> Commonly men are taller then Women; whereas in ſome other living creatures, Foemales are greateſt.</p>
               <p>The Latitude or thickneſs in a wel Proportioned body ought to be, almoſt half the Longitude, ſo that if the Longitude be ſix Foot, the Latitude ought to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt three: ſlenderneſs of body is ſubject to Conſumptions, neither can the body be ſtrong and fit for labor unleſs it be thick.</p>
               <p>In the bigneſs of the body is Magnanimity and beauty, quoth <hi>Ariſtotle, Ethic. Lib.</hi> 4. For a man of a little and ſmal body cannot be fair; yet if you regard,

               <p>The Color of the body is diligently to be marked, for ſuch a Color as flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">5.

               <p>There is ſome difference in Authors about the Color to be Choſen in a Nurſe, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> perfers brown, others a Mingled Color of Red and white.</p>
               <p>Now the Natural and Legitimate form of the Head, Breſt, Belly, and Limbs, is to<note place="margin">6. Form. of the Head.</note> be conſidered. The Head ought to be round, and not Copped, unleſs the Neck be very thick: a great Head is preferred before a little one: from the Head ought the Nature of the Nerves, Veins, Fleſh, and Humors to be collected.</p>
               <p>A great Head requires a great Neck, which gives indication of a great breaſt, by reaſon of the Parts contained in the Neck: a great breaſt makes a large belly, and therefore the proportion of the reſt of the Cavities depends upon the Head.</p>
               <p>The Cheſt ought to be large, of an Oval Figure, and the Back-bone ſtraight, the<note place="margin">Breaſt.</note> breaſt ought to be ſomwhat convex, not ſharp, nor flat, nor depreſſed.</p>
               <p>The Papps of Men, ought to be depreſſed, but in Women ſwelling round, and Glandulous, rather than Fatty, or Fleſhy, becauſe they are the Emunctories of the breaſt if the Woman give not Suck. If the Duggs be ſmal the Women are ſickly, and if the Nipples look pale the Womb is Diſeaſed, according to <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates.</hi>

               <p>BEfore we expoſe the whol Body of Man, to Anatomical diſſection, it ought to be divided into its Parts, or principal regions, that the Number and order of the regions, and where they begin, may be known.</p>
               <p>A mongſt the various diviſions of the Body of Man, this in my mind ſeems the<note place="margin">Diviſion of the Body.</note> beſt, and to be preferred before the reſt.</p>
               <p>The body is divided into the Trunk, and the Limbs.</p>
               <p>The Trunk is divided into three Principal Regions; the Head, Breaſt, and Belly.</p>
               <p>The Head obtains the Superior place; The Breaſt, the middle: and the Belly, the lowermoſt.</p>
               <p>The Members or Limbs are four branches ſticking out from the Body, two Arms, and two Legs.</p>
               <p>What are the bands of theſe Regions, I ſhal ſhew, when I come to ſpeak of each Region apart.</p>
               <div type="medicinal_consideration">
                  <head>The Medicinal Conſideration.</head>
                  <p>I wil not ſtand here in rehearſing &amp; deſigning the external Parts of the whol body, which are expounded in every Region of the ſame; but only conſider the corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or fleſhy habit, which is covered with the Skin, like a Garment; which though it look for the moſt part beautifully without, it looks ill favoredly within. This habit of the whol body, makes the third Region of the body, to which the Humors come from the deepeſt Parts; the ill effects of which, are cleerly ſeen in the Diſeaſes, and Symptomes which appear outwardly. The juyce which is ſeen in the leaf and branch comes from the Root.</p>
                  <p>I ſhal reckon up the cheife Diſeaſes which uſe to infeſt the outward ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the body. <hi>Viz.</hi> Immoderate Fatneſs, or Leanneſs, Defluxions, Gouts, Dropſy, Cachexia, the whores Pocks, Plenty, or defect of Sweat, by reaſon of the openneſs, or cloſeneſs of the pores, Palſie, Convulſion, Unquietneſs, and wearineſs and al kind of ſwellings.</p>
                  <p>The Fleſh of man, becauſe its Nouriſhed by purer Blood, is delicater than the fleſh of other Creatures, and prefered before it by Canibals, or Man-Eaters.</p>
                  <p>Fleſh, ſeeing it is Porous and Muſculous, it hath empty ſpaces, which in men in health are filled with ſpirit and blood, but in ſuch as are ſick, with Water and wind; thence come Defluxions over the whol body, and other Diſeaſes of the Skin.</p>
                  <p>The Habit of the whol body, is Purged and emptyed by ſweating, by Cupping-Glaſſes, Scarrification, and Rubbing, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Galen, Lib. de Sanitate;</hi> by Bathings, Whippings, and Beatings, and bliſtering, and Rubify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Pimple-raiſing Applications.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing the ſmal Pocks and Meaſſes, are but the ſcum of the whol habit of body, that is, of the Fleſh, and ſollid parts, their coming out is to be furthered, either at the beginning, or at any other time, with Sweating Medicamants, and ſuch things as draw to the external Parts. Neither need you let blood ſo often, though the Patient be ſtrong, twice if need be, is enough, becauſe it hinders the Motion of Nature in expelling, unleſs either a dead ſleep, or ſtrangling with a Feaver, or bloody Flux, which is for the moſt part deadly, draw us to that remedy; not neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young Pidgeons Cut alive through the middle, laid to the Hands and Feet,: and ſomtimes to the Heart, and ſmal Cupping-Glaſſes faſtned al about the body,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49866:23"/>
with light Scarification. And ſomtimes bathing the Body in Luke warm Water profits, if the ſeaſon of the year be convenient, to make the Meaſſes and ſmal Packs come out the better.</p>

               <p>AMongſt the parts which make the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> the firſt that comes to view, the Greeks cal <hi>Epidermis,</hi> the Latins <hi>Cuticula</hi> and we the Scarf-Skin.</p>
               <p>Although, by its ſubſtance it ſeems to be Spermatical yet it differs much<note place="margin">Subſtance.</note> from it.</p>
               <p>It's Temperature is none at al, and therefore no more words about it, but for its<note place="margin">Original.</note> original, it is framed of the Excrementitious and Viſcous Vapors of the Skin, which Sweating, out grow dry by the coldneſs of the Air, and like a thin Skin, compaſſeth the Skin round, and therefore it ſticks to the Skin firmly and univerſally, and hath no other bounds then the Skin hath.</p>
               <p>And although to the ſight its ſubſtance appeares ſimple, yet <hi>Fabricius ab Aquae pendente</hi> wil have it double, one which is inſeperably fixed to the pores of the Skin, the other ſeperable, without any offence to the Skin it ſelf, but the thickneſs of the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> be it more or leſs, doth not encreaſe it's number, for though in ſome places it may be divided into many ſmal Skins, yet in no place can one be pulled off without another.</p>
               <p>It hath no Proper figure beſides what it borrows from the Skin it ſelf, from which<note place="margin">Figure.</note> it differs in this, that it is no way porous.</p>
               <p>It is thought to partake alwaies of the ſame color with the Skin, and yet in Black<note place="margin">Color.</note> Mores this being pulled of, the Skin it ſelf is white.</p>
               <p>It ſticks firmely to the true Skin, and is an Excrementitious part as the Hairs<note place="margin">Connexion.</note> are, and hath no communion with the principal parts, by Veins, Arteries, nor Nerves, becauſe it wants them, and is inſenſible, as you may find, if you pleaſe to ſcrape it off from your hands, or any parts, or thruſt a Pin or Needle under it.</p>
               <p>It hath no action, only uſe, which is to ſhut the pores of the Skin, to make it<note place="margin">

                  <p>By theſe things thus conſidered, a Phyſitian may ſee that the ſcarſe Skin hath alſo its Diſeaſes, though <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thought them to be only deformities, He makes

a diſtinction whether they may be called Impoſtumes or diſeaſes, at the end of <hi>Lib. 2. Prorrheticorum,</hi> becauſe ſuch as belong to the Scarfe-skin, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moſt of al to the dignotion and Cure of Affects.</p>
                  <p>It is infected with divers Spots, both natural, and ſickly; natural, are thoſe many deformities of the Skin; Sickly, are the Meazles, ſmal Pocks, purple ſpots in Feavers, or any Spots of other Color; ſomtimes without a Feaver, when Nature ſends any Wheyiſh ſubſtance of another Color into the Scarf-Skin.</p>
                  <p>Diſeaſed ſpots of the Scarf-Skin may, and ought to be cured: but ſuch as are Original from the birth, are very difficultly taken away, becauſe they ſtick firmely to the Skin, as wel as to the Scarf-Skin.</p>
                  <p>This Scarf-Skin may be beautified; which <hi>Galen</hi> denies to be done, by an honeſt,<note place="margin">It may be Beautified.</note> and honorable Phyſitian; but allowes it to be done, by Court Phyſitians, and Bauds, and Chamber-Maids that wait upon their Ladies. In Women, the <hi>Cuticula</hi> is thick, ſmooth, and many time ſtops the pores of the Skin, and hinders free per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. In men it's uſually ful of pores, that ſo the Hairs may paſs out.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as the Scarf-Skin of the Body, being wel looked after, and adorned, procures beauty and and comlineſs to the Body; ſo being made rough with Spots, or burnt by the Sun, it unhandſoms a man. It is ridiculous to draw it off with bliſters, that ſo it may come again the cleerer, you looſe your labor as much as though you waſhed a Black-more.</p>
                  <p>The Scarf-Skin peels off in divers perſons whilſt it is dried or burnt, and the Skin it ſelf in Leproſies, and diverſe that have the french pocks; The Skin it ſelf comes off by fleakes in ſuch as are Leprous, and in ſome that are troubled with the Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters Pox.</p>

               <p>Its temperature is cold and dry, or more properly, exquiſitly temperate, yet ſo<note place="margin">Temperature.</note> it may be the Judg of feeling.</p>
               <p>It is extended over the whol body, and on wraps it like a garment, and therefore its dimention is as the dimention of the Body is.</p>
               <p>Although it ſeem but one, both to ſight and touching, yet ſome hold it to conſiſt<note place="margin">Number.</note> of two Skins; but I could never find them to be ſeperable, only it may be cut into many parts by reaſon of its thickneſs.</p>

               <p>It takes its Color from the predominant humor; for of what color the Humor<note place="margin">Color.</note> predominant in the Body is, of that color is the Skin, unleſs it be ſuch from their birth, as in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore the Skin, ſeeing it is the breathing place of the whol body, is ſubject to an infinite number of Diſeaſes; and if the pores be ſhut, the Body ſuffers great diſcommodities, by reaſon tranſpiration is hindered; for the Body ought to eaſe it ſelf that way, according to <hi>Hippocrates, Lib. de Alimento: The motion of the Body, to perſpiration, the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Connexion of the Muſcles is twofold; in the two extremities, and in diverſe<note place="margin">Connexion.</note> Parts; the one of which ſtands ſtil, the other moves: alſo the Muſcles move the Parts to which they ſtick, though they were not appointed for that uſe.</p>
               <p>All the Muſcles have communion with the Parts, by Veins, Arteries, and Nerves;<note place="margin">Communion.</note> which they admit above the Belly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or middle part of their Body, by which they obtain their motive power.</p>
               <p>The Action of the Muſcles, is either univerſal, or particular. Univerſal action,<note place="margin">Action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> is that which agrees to al of them, <hi>Viz.</hi> Motion: particular action, is the motion of ſome one certain Part; this motion is performed by contraction of the Muſcle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whilſt it is drawn back, towards its beginning, made ſhorter, and ſwels outwardly; and this agrees withal the Muſcles, thoſe of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> excepted, which being drawn back, ſwel within, becauſe they have no oppoſite bone to with-hold them.</p>
               <p>Therefore the true action of a Muſcle, is contraction, or conſervation of what is drawn; which motion is called <hi>Tonicus,</hi> in one Muſcle remaining long in on figure; or in more Muſcles extended, and acting together, as when the whol hand is long held elevated, and extended.</p>
               <p>The motion of others Muſcles, as extention and relaxation, are only by accident; from theſe motions depend the motions of the parts, which are not only diſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed by difference of place before, behind, upwards, downwards; but alſo by figure.</p>
               <p>Their Scituation is either larger, and that right, and is called <hi>Exten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Alſo the Muſcles, by reaſon of their like motion, are called fellows, Or pairs; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows are ſomtimes in diverſe &amp; oppoſite places, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ducture of the <hi>Fibres</hi> is various alſo in the ſame Muſcle, according to the diverſity of its riſes or inſertions; and therefore one Muſcle performs diverſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the <hi>Tranpezium;</hi> for by the extremities of the <hi>Fibres,</hi> you may know the Head and Tendon.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. 11.</hi> Of a Tendon.</head>
               <p>A Tendon is the leaſt Part of a Muſcle, by which we bend and move the bones. It is thought to conſiſt of a Nerve, and a Ligament mixed together; ſo as that a Tendon is not found, unleſs it be in that Part of the Muſcle where it is affixed to the Parts moved.</p>
               <p>But a mans Eyes (if he wil beleeve them) tels him, that they are from the firſt for<note place="margin">Original.</note> mation, and that they are the cheifeſt Part of the Muſcle, and take their beginning where the Muſcle begins, and are diſſeminated through its whol Body. if it be a Nervous Tendon in the beginning, ſuch it is in the end; if it be like ſmal ſtrings at beginning, they are united to forme the Tendon afterwards. Such Tendons thoſe Muſcles have which perform ſtrong actions, in bowing and extending, and tonical motion; as in the ſuperior and inferior Limbs, and in the back to uphold the Trunk of the body. The reſt of the Muſcles, as they are fibrous at the beginning, ſo they are at the end.</p>
               <p>The hard and ſtiff Tendons have much Fat about them to ſoften them, that they may the eaſier be moved; and therefore thoſe <hi>Fibres</hi> diſperſed amongſt the Fleſh, are nothing elſe but the Tendon divided, and the Tendon nothing elſe but the <hi>Fibres</hi> united; and therefore a Tendon is either compact and ſolid, or elſe divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Fibres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo Tendons are ſollid or plain, or Membranous or round, or ſhort or long. If they are Nervous at the beginning of the Muſcle, ſo they are at the end. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are Nervous at the end of the Muſcle, though the Head of it be Fleſhy.</p>
               <p>The hardneſs of a Sollid, long and Membranous Tendon, its thickneſs and Silver color is excellent: So that <hi>Fallopius</hi> affirmed, nothing was more beautiful in the Body of man, than a Tendon, and the Chryſtalline Humor of the Eye.</p>
               <p>Wherefore a Tendon, ſeeing it is a Similary Part, is bred of Seed, and is of a peculiar ſubſtance, no where to be found out of a Muſcle. It wel deſerves to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the cheifeſt part of the Muſcle, upon which the action of the Muſcle depends; the other Parts work together with the Tendon in the ſame action.</p>

               <p>Its Subſtance is not ſimple, and uniform; but double, and unequal in thickneſs: for it is a double Membrane, joyned in ſome places, and disjoyned in other Some, to give paſſage to the Navel Veſſels; and in the <hi>Hypogaſtrium,</hi> it is ſo doubled that it contains the Bladder and the Genitals, the Reins and Vreters, the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and the great Artery, and the Seminal Veſſels in its duobling.</p>
               <p>The inequallity of the ſubſtance of it is obſerved in Women, to be thickeſt from the Navel to the <hi>Pubis,</hi> that in the conception it may be ſtretched as the Womb is.

                  <p>Beſides theſe the common Diſeaſes, the Guts ſeverally conſidered, have their peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar<note place="margin">Peculiar Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. Of the Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Duodenum</hi> may be ſtopped by compreſſion of the Sweet-bread, and then the food is Vomited up again two or three houres after it is eaten; becauſe the paſſage is ſtopped.</p>

                  <p>Al the Symptomes of the Guts are to be referred to the Excrements when they are<note place="margin">Symptomes.</note> exceſſive, as in Fluxes, or deficient, as when men go not to ſtool unleſs they be provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Medicine, both which Symptomes impair the health.</p>
                  <p>Fluxes are called <hi>Diarrhea,</hi> which is either Chylous or humoral: humoral is either Caeliacal, or Meſenterical, or Inteſtinal. When it comes with Ulceration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paine and Blood, it is called a Bloody Flux. If it come without pain, and be like the Water in which raw fleſh has bin waſht, it comes from the Liver, and is called Hepatica. If it come through ſmoothneſs of the Guts, It is called <hi>Lienteria:</hi> if it come with Quitter it is called Meſenterical.

               <p>4.

The blood of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> is ſubtile, fit for circulation, which nouriſheth the parts of the ſecond, and third Region.</p>

               <p>But in Men, and other living Creatures, which have the two Veins diſtinct, called<note place="margin">Blood, where, and how made.</note>

               <p>Such blood is furniſhed to thoſe parts, which having ſence and motion, depend upon the Brain or Heart.</p>

               <p>It is hollow that it may receivve Choler, and retaine it til a convenient time of<note place="margin">Paſſages of Choler.</note> emptying the ſame: is has certaine pipes or Channels to carry Choler: the one <note n="b" place="bottom">f. 5.

               <p>Aud therefore we muſt obſerve, that there are two ſorts of Choler in the Liver,<note place="margin">Two ſorts of Choler <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Gall Bladder communicates with the Stomach by touching the ſame, which it heates ſo, as ſomtimes to burn the ſame, when the Gall Is inflamed in its Bladder. Somtimes it ſticks to the Gut Colon which paſſes along hard by, which it often Colers Yellow, and provokes it to expell the Excrements.</p>
               <p>This expurgation of Choler, being liable to be ſtopt, does vex the body with many Inconveniences.</p>
               <p>There is ſeldom obſerved a third channel of Choler, which goes into the Stomach, unleſs ſome Part creep from the <hi>Meatus Hepaticus</hi> unto the <hi>Pylorus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has manifeſt Veins from the <hi>Porta</hi> called <hi>Venae Cyſticae.</hi> Its Arteries and <note place="margin">Its Veſſels.</note> Nerves are not ſo viſible.</p>

                  <head>The Medicinal Conſideration.</head>
                  <p>THe Gall-Bladder is ſubject to few Diſeaſes. The moſt common are, when its<note place="margin">Diſeaſes of the Gall-Bladder.</note> Cavity or its Channels are obſtructed. When its Cavity is ful of little ſtones, or filled with one great one, by reaſon of thick Choler changed into a ſtony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Its paſſages are ſtopped in the Liver, or in the Gut. Alſo it is broken, through violeut motion in Vomiting; and ſometime it is ſo diſtended with Choler, when the paſſages are ſtopped that ſhould Evacuate the ſame, that it has been ſeen as big as both a Mans Fiſts.</p>
                  <p>Somtimes, when it is empty of choler, it dries up, ſo that nothing therefore remaines ſaving the ductus Hepaticus. If we beleive <hi>Fernelius,</hi> there could be no other Cauſe found of the death of ſome perſons, than that their Gall-Bladder had no Choler in it: if ſo, the evil and venemous Quality of the ſuppreſſed Choler was ſo great, as to infect the heart, or to weaken and corrupt ſome noble part.</p>
                  <p>The Symptomes of this Part are more manifeſt; which do conſiſt in its action<note place="margin">Its Symptomes.</note> hurt, or in the undue proportion or quantity of the Excrementitious Choler. The Action of the Gall-bladder is attraction of Choler, which is either diminiſhed, or aboliſhed. The undue proportions or quantity of the Choler is, when either too little or too much is voided forth.</p>
                  <p>Which Symptomes cheifly appear in thoſe Parts which Sympathiſe with the Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder,<note place="margin">Their Signs.</note> as in the Stomach, when Choler is vomited up; in the whol body, when Choler is ſhed abroad through the Veins into the habit of the Body, and deformes the Skin; or when it takes its Courſe into the Guts and cauſes a dyſentery, or a Cholerick looſeneſs.</p>
                  <p>But the original of theſe Symptomes is to be charged upon the Liver, being il diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.<note place="margin">Their Original.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Democritus</hi> had good Reaſon to ſearch diligently into the ſeat and Nature of Choler, when he made diſſection of divers living Creatures, that he might be more able rightly to cure the Diſeaſes of Body and mind.</p>
                  <p>When I ſee in an extream Yellow Jaundice, the whol Skin infected with Choler, &amp;<note place="margin">Diverſity of Choler proved.</note> that the Urins die cloaths Yellow, the ſtooles being in the mean time whitiſh; And when I ſee in another ſort of Jaundice, both the Urins and ſtooles Yellow; This confirmes to me, that there are two ſorts of Choler, and ſeveral waies for the expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of each of them.

               <p>It is of a <note n="a" place="bottom">T. 4. f. 7. C. □</note> Subſtance ſpongy, ſoft, ſprinkled al over with very many Veſſels like<note place="margin">Its Subſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Its Color is Black and Blew and obſcurely Reddiſh.<note place="margin">Color. Greatneſs.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Its greatneſs is uncertaine and not determinable, becauſe it grows greater or leſs, according to the abundance, or defect of Humors which flow thither, &amp; are collected therein. So that there is none of the Bowels which does ſo eaſily grow bigger and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, as the Spleen.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of Number, it is wont to Be ſingle; Somtimes it has been obſerved to<note place="margin">Number.</note> be double and threefold.</p>
               <p>Conſider in the Spleen its upper Part, which is termed the Head, and its nether<note place="margin">Parts.</note> Part which is called the Taile.</p>
               <p>Tis <note n="a" place="bottom">T. 4. f. 1.

               <p>It is of an oblong ſhape, like a Tongue, in Brutes; but in Mankind, it is more<note place="margin">Shape.</note> like the Sole of a Mans Foot.

                  </gap>l Juyces thereof.</p>
               <p>The Action of the Spleen is much doubled and controverted among Phyſitians<note place="margin">Action con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Opinions thereof.</note> and Anatomiſts: ſo Many Men, ſo Many Minds: <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did beleeve that it drew ſuperfluous ſeroſity out of the Stomach: which Opinion <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> followed, though others draw it to an attraction of Chyle, either out of the Pancreas and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, or out of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> will have it emploied in Purging away Melancholy, which it draws from the Liver.</p>
               <p>Others are of Opinion that it prepares Blood for the Heart that it may become Arterial, whether it be of the thicker parts of the Chyle, or of the dregs of the Blood carried thither.</p>
               <p>Others ſay it prepares a ſuperfluous wheyiſh matter, being the excrement of its own digeſtion, which it ſends back again into the Stomach, to ferment the Meats when they are turned into Chyle.</p>
               <p>The Arabian Phyſitians acknowledg ſuch an Humor, but they aſſigne its office to be the provoking of Appetite. <hi>Galen</hi> thought that it did help to ſtrengthen the Stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49866:38"/>In ſo great diſſent of Authors what ſhal we reſolve upon? every one brings probable reaſons for his Opinion. <hi>Hofmannus</hi> conceives he has ſo ſufficiently eſtablſhed his Opinion, that no wiſe man can contradict him. Shal I venter my Opinion among ſo many learned Champions?</p>
               <p>I conceive that the Spleen does attract ſlimy Blood to nouriſh it ſelf, and that<note place="margin">The Authors Opinion.</note> it ſheds a ſpecial kind of fermentative Seroſity through the Splenick Arteries into the Stomach; and becauſe its <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or ſubſtance is of a Spongy and ſoaking Nature, it does by the Veins attract and ſuck out the ſuperfluous humidity of the Stomach, that the Coction may be the better.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, I deny not but that it may by Accident ſupply the Office of the Liver, when the ſame hath loſt its faculty of Sanguification; but Blood cannot be made ſo good and perfect in the Spleen as in the Liver, ſeeing it is but a baſtard Liver, and conſequently makes but baſtard Blood and impure, becauſe not Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hofman</hi> makes himſelf Ridiculous, while he eagerly contends in a little Book<note place="margin">Hofmans Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Spleens Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> which he has put forth, and up and down in his other writings, that the muddy part of the Chylus, is carried by the Meſaraick Arteries unto the Spleen; where it is turned into Blood, with which, the neighbouring Parts are nouriſhed: and that the Excrements of this Blood are voided by Urins, Stool, and Sweat. That good Old Man is to learn, that the thicker Parts of the Chyle are not ſucked out, but ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſent away into the greater Guts; and that the Meſaraick Arteries cannot do as he ſaies, becauſe they containe Arterial Blood. neither do they reach any of them to the Spleen, becauſe it has a peculiar Artery, which <hi>Arantius</hi> firſt deſcribed, and which I my ſelf have often ſhown.</p>
               <p>Again he ought to have rejected the Milky Veins of <hi>Aſellius,</hi> which he allowes of; ſeeing none of them reach unto the Spleen.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that ſame baſtard and impure Blood, bred of muddy Blood by a baſtard Liver, wil be unfit to nouriſh the neighbouring Parts which ſerve for Cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they appear filthy, for they need to be nouriſhed with pure Blood for their preſervation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The Cholerick, Melancholick and Wheyiſh Excrements of the ſaid Blood, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Purged away but by Veins and Arteries; the Arterics are allready taken up with carrying the muddy Parts of the Chyle. They muſt therefore of neceſſity be carried by the Splenick Vein into the liver, that they may be voided through the Guts or by the Kidnies, which would breed very great confuſion in the Liver.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Hofman</hi> had conſidered, that the ſubſtance of the Spleen is unlike the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Liver, its bigneſs different, its number uncertain, Color divers, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation variable, becauſe ſomtimes it ſinkes down to the <hi>Hypogaſtrium,</hi> more often aſcends towards the Midrif, ſomtimes deſcends upon the left Kidney, the Ligaments being ſlackned: and laſtly, its ſhape, quite contrary to that of the Liver, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is no Spleen at all: alſo that the ſtructure of the Veſſels of the Spleen, is altogether unlike that of the Veſſels of the Liver; he would never have ſo ſtifly affirmed, that that the Spleen made a peculiar kind of Blood out of the <hi>Chylus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nature does in none of the Bowels more ſport her ſelf, than in her ſhaping of the Spleen ſo variouſly and unconſtantly. But the Structure of thoſe Bowels which are neceſſary to the maintenance of life, is allwaies, one and the ſame and uniform.</p>
               <p>Furthermore you may know that the ſubſtance of the Liver &amp; ſpleen are unlike, by boyling the one and the other: for the ſubſtance of the Liver is firme, ſollid and Reddiſh; that of the Spleen is Spungy, ſoft, and black and blue in Color: The ſubſtance of the Liver of Animals boiled, as of an Ox, a Sheep, a Goat, is eaten with content: the ſubſtance of the Spleen is not Mans meat, neither will other Creatures eat it, unleſs they be very hungry. But if the Office of the Spleen and Liver were the ſame in Brute as wel as in Men, they ſhould have both alike ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and breed the ſame blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:49866:38"/>Where will you find a place to clenſe away Choler in the Spleen, as their is in the Liver? If the Spleen draw the more thick Part of the Chyle, it ought to have larger Veins, but they are exceeding ſmal, like unto threds. Wherefore <hi>Hofman</hi> does fooliſhly to enquire the <hi>Dioti</hi> or <hi>Cauſe why it is ſo,</hi> before he knows the <hi>Hoti, that it is ſo,</hi> which ought to go before, and be diligently enquired into, when the natural Action of Parts is ſought after, becauſe the natural Conſtitution is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and accommodated thereunto.

               <p>If <hi>Hofman</hi> had known out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that ſuch living Creatures as drink, have a Spleen, Reins and Bladder, he had more truly expounded that paſſage of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> of the true ſence whereof he glories.

                  <p>The Veins have in them, a Retentive Faculty, whereby they hold faſt the Blood<note place="margin">Retentive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Veins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, what follows.</note> within themſelves: which Faculty being periſhed, they ſuffer the blood to leak out through al the parts of the Body, yea, even to ſweat out, as I have ſeen in ſome Patients.

                  <p>Foraſmuch as <hi>Sylvius,</hi> and <hi>Carolus Stephanus,</hi> have written, that there is a Valve<note place="margin">A Valve in Vena Cava.</note> within the Liver, by the Trunk of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> which hinders the blood from returning back; <hi>Conringius</hi> ſaies, that it is to be found in Oxen.

                  <p>

Somtimes want of Appetite to meat, is a fore-runner of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, by reaſon the Stomachs ſympathizing with the Kidneys. Obſerve diligently
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49866:41"/>
when the Stomach is ill, if there be no Diſeaſe in the Kidney; for if there be, that's the cauſe of the Stomachs diſorder.</p>
                  <p>The Number of the Kidneys is ſeldom changed, and if there be but one, it cannot be known that there is more; neither can that one perform as much as two: and therefore thoſe that have but one Kidney, enjoy not their health ſo wel as they that have both.</p>
                  <p>Although the Kidneys ſeem faſt fixed unto the Loyns by the fat, as it were with<note place="margin">Falling down of the Kidneys.</note> glue; yet do they ſomtimes fal out of their place, and lean forward, ſomtime they ſlip into the belly, not without detriment to the Patients life and health: this is a truth not to be queſtioned. Which comes to paſs chiefly, not only by melting the fat in which they are wrapped up, but alſo by their weight, when they are grown ſo great, by reaſon of ſome tumor or ſtone contained in their Cavities, that they can no longer be kept in their place by ſuch ſtaies as were wont to hold them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen into the belly, they ſtay there a while, and at laſt they putrifie, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumate.</p>

                  <p>If the inner Subſtance of the Kidney be exulcerated, the Patient makes urine with<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</note> Matter, or Quittor in it.</p>
                  <p>If a Vein be opened, or broken, bloody urines are made: and becauſe the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys<note place="margin">Vein opened, or broke.</note> communicate with the Stomach by the Stomachical Nerves, the Stomach does ſympathize with them, being ſick, and enclined to vomiting.</p>
                  <p>The Action of the Kidney, is to attract <hi>Serum,</hi> and to ſeparate, and expel the<note place="margin">Action Hurt.</note> ſame: theſe things it cannot do, unleſs it be ſound and perfect; and therefore all the Diſeaſes aforeſaid, may pervert the ſame Action. The fleſh of the Kidneys is dul of feeling, but the inward Membrane is very ſenſible.</p>
                  <p>Stones are often bred in the Cavity of the Kidneys, either in the pipes, where they<note place="margin">ſtones bred in the Kidneys.</note> grow like Coral, or in the Baſin, where a round ſtone is formed.

                  <p>THe Piſs-bladder is ſubject to an infinite number of Diſeaſes. In its ſubſtance<note place="margin">Diſeaſes of the Bladder.</note> it is ſubject to al kind of Diſtempers, eſpecially hot and cold: it ſuffers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, Tumors, Ulcers, and Palſie both in the Neck and whol Body thereof. Of which we ſhall Diſcourſe particularly.</p>
                  <p>Its temper is perverted, when the bladder naturally cold and dry, comes to wax<note place="margin">In its Temper.</note> hot, and fils into an inflammation.</p>
                  <p>Its Scituation is changed, when that Part of the <hi>Peritoneum</hi> in which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded<note place="margin">Saituation.</note> is relaxed, whereby it ſlips a little downe; which cauſes a difficulty in piſſing, unleſs the lower Part of the Belly be lifted up with the Hand. Somtimes by the weight of many little Stones it comes to have an hollow nook, by the ſide of the ſtreight Gut near its Neck, and then the Stones do neſtle in that corner, ſo that they cannot be perceived by putting in a Catheter: but the beſt way to feel them, is by putting ones Finger into the Fundament.</p>
                  <p>Its greatneſs or widneſs cannot certainly be defined unleſs it were empty; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit<note place="margin">wideneſs.</note> it is enlarged and widened according to the quantity of Urine. But if it be ſo much enlarged as to exceed the natural meaſure, then the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the Coates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken or too much ſlacned, the party cannot make Water, becauſe the fleſhy Membrane is deprived of that motion, by which the Urine ought to be expelled. And in this Caſe the Water cannot be voided otherwiſe than by putting in of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter, which ſomtimes for a Month or two, muſt be done twice a day, until the Membrane have recovered its antient tone or contractive Vigour.</p>
                  <p>Somtimes the bladder is ſo contracted and ſtraitned, by reaſon of a painful exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration in its inner Part, and then grows thicker and as it were Cartilaginous; which hinders its diſtention: and in this Caſe, the Patient muſt often make Water with pain.</p>
                  <p>The Neck of the bladder comprehending its Orifice or the Channel of Urine, has<note place="margin">Diſeaſes of the Nick of the Bladder.</note> alſo its Diſeaſes. It is frequently inflamed, ſwelled Ulcerated, obſtructed, and is weakened by the Palſie, when it can neither be contracted not relaxed, ſeeing it is thicker and more fleſhy than the bottom of the bladder. It is eaſily inflamed, and <hi>Fernelius</hi> was of Opinion that no other Part of the bladder is ſubject to inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: from whence proceeds an Ulcer, which is not ſo hard to Cure, as that which happens within the body of the bladder, becauſe injections and convenient Candles may be conveighed thereunto.</p>
                  <p>It is frequently obſtructed by the Stone lying hid in the bladder, or by a<note place="margin">How Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note>

                  <p>If the Stone ſwel, and exceed its natural bulk, it cauſes a ſwelling in the Cod.</p>

                  <p>The Stones are faulty in point of Scituation, while they lie out of ſight in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Diſeaſes of the Stones in Scituation.</note> or when they are in the Groyns.

                  <p>I have ſeen ſome women conceive notwithſtanding this growing together, there being a little hole left for the Seed to enter at, being eagerly attracted by the hungry womb.

Maides and women that are thus cloſed up, are termed in Greek <hi>Atretae</hi> imperforated perſons, ſuch as are unboared or unbroached.</p>
                  <p>Somtimes the wideneſs and openneſs of theſe Parts is ſo great that it proves<note place="margin">Laxity.</note> loathſome and hurtful to Women, Namely ſuch as have undergone hard Labor in Child-Birth; ſo that it is needful to ſtraiten the ſame with Medicaments.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Clitoris</hi> is ſomtimes exceeding long, reſembling a Mans Yard: it is then termed <hi>Cercoſis, Caudatio,</hi> the Long-Taile Diſeaſe; ſo that ſome Women do abuſe that Part one with another when it is longer and thicker than ordinary. Such are thoſe which are termed <hi>Hermaphrodites</hi> or <hi>Rubſters:</hi> for it was never known, neither is it poſſible, that a Woman ſhould be turned or tranſformed into a Man.</p>
                  <p>But a Man being at his Birth reputed for a Woman, as aforeſaid, by the coming forth of his Genital Parts, may be turned into a Man, that is to ſay, be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Somtimes within the <hi>Sheath</hi> there hangs a fleſhy <hi>Excreſcence</hi> which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches<note place="margin">Of the Sheath.</note> as far as the <hi>Lips</hi> and farther, very deformed and troubleſome, and ſomwhat like a Mans Yard. It is rooted near the inner Orifice of the Womb, or it riſes from the ſides of the ſheath, far within. It muſt be cut up by the Roots, or elſe it wil grow again, being a great trouble to marryed Women, becauſe it hinders the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a Mans Yard, in the carnal Embracement.</p>
                  <p>Near the <hi>Caruncles</hi> or Carnoſities before mentioned, there appeares within, a<note place="margin">Of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncles.</note> Vein, two or three, which are pretty ful, and drop Blood out like the Haemorrhoides, and are ſomtimes exulcerated, and may degenerate into Malignant Ulcers, unleſs they be wel looked to.</p>
                  <p>Within the <hi>Sheath,</hi> in the upper Part, in the very Orifice of the Womb, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant<note place="margin">An <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</note> Scirrhous Tumor is bred, which at laſt degenerates into a Cancerous Ulcer. A ſad and miſerable Diſeaſe, if it ariſe through fault of the Womb and other Parts of the Body. If the ſaid Ulcer proceed from the Whoremaſters-Pocks, as oftentimes it fals out, it is curable, provided the foreſaid Orifice be not wholly eaten up, and that the Ulcer have not crept into the inner Parts of the Womb. That may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not only by the Inſtrument called <hi>Speculum Matricis,</hi> with which we look into the Womb, but alſo by putting up of a bodies Finger.</p>

               <p>Such a ſtructure of the <hi>Teſtices</hi> in women and ſuch a conformation of their <hi>Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Veſſels,</hi> made <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to doubt and others of his followers, whether the Female Sex were Proliſick and afforded Seed to the making of the infant, as well as the Male, as <hi>Galen</hi> after <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> maintaines they do.</p>
               <p>From the Body of the <hi>Teſticle</hi> the ſame Spermatick <note n="b" place="bottom">f. 2. d d. f. 4. b b.□</note> Veſſels preparatory are carryed to the bottom of the <note n="c" place="bottom">f. 2.

               <p>Theſe things thus obſerved, let us take a View of the Body of the womb with the<note place="margin">Horns of the Womb. Its Ligaments.</note> external Parts thereof. Out of it there ariſes in its upper Part, the <hi>Hornes</hi> and four Ligaments, two broad and <note n="e" place="bottom">f. 2. P P.□</note> Membranous, which are productions of the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> They are ſtretched out in Virgins and women that have not bore Children, reſembling the diſplaid wings of Bats or Flitter-Mice.

               <p>The other two Ligaments are round &amp; ſomwhat <note n="f" place="bottom">f. 2. S S. f. 3. and 4.

In their Riſe they are hollow, and in their progreſs as far as the <hi>Oſſa Pubis,</hi> we find them hollowed.</p>
               <p>When they are come as far as the <hi>Clitoris,</hi> they are cloven and ſpred forth in the ſhape of a Gooſe-foot through al the fore part of the Thigh. I was the firſt that made diſcovery of that ſame <hi>Cavity</hi> and of the formerly unknown uſe of theſe Ligaments. According to the Opinion of the Ancient and latter Anatomiſts, they keep the womb from aſcending upwards: but without theſe Ligaments, the womb cannot aſcend, unleſs it ſhould pluck away the <hi>Sheath</hi> and the <hi>Privities,</hi> which are contiuations of the body of the womb.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Horn</hi>

               <p>The womb is of an hot and moiſt Complexion: it is Scituated in the lower <note n="b" place="bottom">T. 7. f. 1. d.□</note> Part<note place="margin">Temper.

               <p>In Virgins until they have their Courſes it is little and hard, after they have had<note place="margin">Greatneſs.</note> their Courſes, it grows ſofter: in women which have had Children it is greater and thicker.</p>

               <p>It is one in number and no more, yet ſomtimes divided into two Cavities by a Partition in the middle, which is the Cauſe that ſome women bring ſorth two or three Children at a Birth.</p>

               <p>The Action of the womb is conception, or attracting the Seed, and reducing the<note place="margin">Action.</note> ſame into Act, by cauſing the ſame to ferment and proceed to formation.

               <div type="medicinal_consideration">
                  <head>The Medicinal Conſideration.</head>
                  <p>By out knowledg of the Natural Conſtitution of the <hi>Genital Parts</hi> of women<note place="margin">Diſorders of the.</note> we come more certainly to underſtand their departure from the ſaid natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution by ſeveral ſorts of Infirmities.</p>
                  <p>The Spermatick Veſſels are liable to obſtructions, whereby the uſual Flux of<note place="margin">Spermatick Veſſels. Stones.</note> Humors is ſtopped, which is very hurtful to women.</p>
                  <p>They ſwel together with the Stones, and become as big as a mans Fiſt; by a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Humors reſembling Tallow or ſuet.</p>
                  <p>This is known by a ſwelling in the bottom of the Belly at the ſides.</p>
                  <p>The Trumpet or Horn of the Womb is widened and moved by Seed, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Trumpet.</note> there corrupted, ſeekes its paſſage out. But wonderful it is that the mans Seed ſhould come thither, and that as Hiſtories report, a Child ſhould be conceived there. 'Tis very ſtrang that a Child ſhould be formed out of the Cavity of the womb; and it favours the Opinion of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Amatus Luſitanus,</hi> that a Child may be made in a Glaſs of a Mans Seed and menſtrual blood, placed in Horſes Dung, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs both of them, the one being an Athieſt the other a Jew, were known to be Impoſtors.</p>
                  <p>The womb is the Root, Seed plot and foundation of very near al womens Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,<note place="margin">Womb it ſelf.</note> being either bred in the womb, or occaſioned thereby.</p>
                  <p>It it be troubled with an hot diſtemper and inflamed, it cauſes intollerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,<note place="margin">Diſtemper.</note> the Feaver <hi>Synochos</hi> and the burning Feaver, very troubleſome Itchings? and finally it brings exulcerations, the Cancer and Gangraena.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſtung with ſervent Luſt, it becomes enraged, cauſes Uterine fury and Madneſs; wil not let the Patients reſt, but invites them to ſhake and agitate their Loins, that they may be disburthened of their Seed; and at laſt, they become ſhameles and ask men to lie with them.</p>
                  <p>Somtime it is drawn out of its place towards the ſides, and is carryed this way and<note place="margin">Motion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved.</note> that way, as far as the Ligaments and Connexions of the Womb wil give leave; and it wil riſe directly to the Liver, Stomach and Midrif, that it may be moiſtened and fanned; it Cauſes Choaking and Stranglings, and raiſes terrible and violent motions and Convulſions in the Body.</p>
                  <p>In a word, the Womb is a furious Live-wight in a Live-wight; punniſhing Poor women with many Sorrows.</p>
                  <p>Although <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath written and <hi>Fernelius</hi> confirmd the ſame, that the womb like a Globe does rowle it ſelf in the Cavity of the Belly; yet are they rather the Horns of the womb, which are receptacles of Seed Spirituous and hot or putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, which being ſwelled do move themſelves this way &amp; that way, til they have ſhed their Seed into the Cavity of the Belly: which Seed being diſperſed, brings very cruel pains and ſtretches the Belly, until the force of the Spirits be Evaporated: hence comes that ſame ſwelling of the Belly and ſtifling about the Midrif.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:49866:50"/>Somtimes malignant Vapors aſcending from the Womb by the Veins <note n="a" place="bottom">T. 7. f. 2. V V X X.□</note> and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<note place="margin">Suffocation</note> unto the Lungs and Kernels of the Throat, may cauſe choaking and ſtifling: and the malignant vapor of the Seed being ſo pernicious, is violently darted into the Brain, and al parts of the Body, from the VVomb, as from a Beaſt that ſpits poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>The VVomb is but little when empty; but when it is ſilled with evil Humors, it ſwels above meaſure; and it has been ſeen to equal the Head of a new-born Child<note place="margin">Cancerous Scirrhus.</note> which is an incurable Infirmity, becauſe it is a Cancerous <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> which is the worſe for being tampered with by Medicines.</p>
                  <p>Somtimes the Orifice of the Womb being cloſed, and firmly ſealed up, Water<note place="margin">Dropſie</note> flows out of the Belly into the Cavity thereof, and coming to a quantity, it brings the Dropſie of the Womb. Somtimes evil Humors are collected there, and by the force of Nature, do afterwards break forth. This often happens to Virgins, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from the ſuppreſſion of their Courſes, the internal Orifice being ſtopped, as I ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>The Womb is watered with a two-fold Humor, Seed, and Menſtrual Blood; the<note place="margin">Whether ſeed ſuppreſſed hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth women?</note> ſuppreſſion of both which, does many waies afflict Woman-kind, and the evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, does them much good in many reſpects. Howbeit, we do not read in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> any where, that the retention of their Seed, is hurtful unto Women: he writes indeed, that the Womb being dry, does aſcend to the ſuperior parts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive moiſture (which <hi>Galen</hi> laughs at) and that it deſires to receive the Mans Seed to moiſten it ſelf; and that therefore marriagable Virgins that are troubled with fits of the Mother, ſhould be married, and have the carnal ſociety of Men. And therefore he makes the retention, or over-great flux of the Courſes, the only general cauſe of Womens Diſeaſes, and ſaies that Women cannot be in Health, unleſs they play the Women, that is, void their Menſtrual Blood. In caſe therefore, that a<note place="margin">What muſt be obſerved in letting blood to move the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</note> Woman, or a Virgin have her Courſes ſtopt, whether or no may we hope by blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting, three or four times repeated from the Arm or Foot, to draw the blood unto the Womb? I remember the Story of a Woman in a Conſumption, becauſe of the ſtoppage of her Courſes, from whom <hi>Galen</hi> drew blood in a large quantity.</p>
                  <p>That we may know to reſolve this Queſtion, three things are to be noted; The Matter, the Place, and the Expulſive Faculty. The Matter is Blood, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains<note place="margin">1 The ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of matter.</note> over, and above what was neceſſary to nouriſh a woman for a months time, which was ordained to conceive Child, and to nouriſh it being born: wherefore we muſt conſider, whether the woman abound with blood, ſo that ſhe has what to ſpare, and void forth; for if ſhe want blood, by reaſon of ſome fore-going diſeaſe, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe eats little, we are not to expect that ſhe ſhould have her Courſes.</p>
                  <p>The place through which it ought to flow, is the womb, with the Hypogaſtrick<note place="margin">2 Fitneſs of the place</note> and Spermatick Veins: for theſe Veſſels do contain the ſuperfluous blood, until the due time appointed for this Purgation, and they ſend it forth either by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the womb, or by the Spermatick Veſſels, into the neck thereof. But if ſo be the Womb ſhal be dry, or hard, and the Spermatick Veſſels and Veins obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, we cannot hope to procure the Courſes to flow, by often blood-letting. And the Expulſive Faculty is not ſeated in the Genital Parts, which receive this blood,<note place="margin">3 Strength of the faculty</note> but depends upon the general ſtrength of Nature, which thruſts this ſuperfluous blood out of doors.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three things ought therefore to concur, that a woman may have her Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Matter, Place, and the Expulſive Faculty; and Medicaments ought to have a<note place="margin">Medicaments, &amp; other means to accompliſh the Cure</note> reſpect thereunto. A Vein is to be opened in the Foot, rather than in the Arm; Cupping-glaſſes muſt be applied without Scarrification to the inner part of the Thighs, above the Veſſels: Convenient Purges muſt be given, with Apozemes that move Urine, attenuate, and open the mouths of the Veins. Pils of Steel, Mirrh, and Aloes, muſt ſomtimes be given, and Baths made to ſit in: or a Vaporary muſt be uſed ſomtimes of blood-warm Water alone, and ſomtimes boyled with Hyſterical
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49866:50"/>
and opening Herbs, the ſteam whereof, the Patient muſt receive into her Womb. Alſo Fomentations muſt be applied to the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and the lower part of the Belly, and good Diet appointed, not heating, but attenuating and opening.</p>
                  <p>The Action of the Womb, is Conception; if it be aboliſhed, the Patient is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren:<note place="margin">Symptoms in the Actions hurt. Sterilitie</note> Which barrenneſs, depends either upon the diſtemper of the womb, or upon the il ſhape thereof, or the hardneſs of the inner Orifice, or the diſtortion thereof, or from fault of the Stones, and Spermatick Veſſels, in which ſomwhat is wanting, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in point of ſtructure, or of matter: and if a woman be ſickly, ſhe cannot make good Seed fitting to cauſe a Conception, til ſhe recover the ſoundneſs of her health, and til the faults of her womb (if not incurable) ſhal be amended.</p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as the Womb is ordained, not only for Conception, but to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate<note place="margin">Suppreſſion of blood or ſeed.</note> the Superfluicy of Natural Humors in the Body, ſuch as are, ſuperfluous Seed, and Menſtrual blood: if they be totally, or in part ſuppreſſed, the woman cannot be in Health, nor if they flow too much.

                     <hi>ſimplex</hi> [ſimple running of the Reins] or the Feminine Flux, either of blood, or Humoral, when only Humors come away: which laſt, if it be malignant, and the Humor be ſharp, exulcerating, and of evil color, it is dangerous, and comes ſomtimes from an outward, venemous, and contagious cauſe; and therfore women ought diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly to be queſtioned touching that matter, that they may be brought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg their Diſeaſe, and not deceive the Phyſitian under a pretence that they have the ordinary whites, to their own hurt, unleſs they acknowledg themſelves faulty, or lay it upon their Husbands, whom it is better to accuſe, if they be in any meaſure ſuſpected, than to cal the womans Chaſtity in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe we are treating of the Action of the Womb, which is Conception, I will ſpeak a little touching the ſame, and ſhew, How a woman is diſpoſed during Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: What is the fruit, or work of Conception, <hi>v.z.</hi> how the Infant comes out of the womb, and how the woman is conſtituted in the time of her Travel, and what happens unto her after her Travel, until ſhe be wel, and upon her Legs again.</p>

                  <p>If a Woman, during the whol time of her Conception, can make the Child par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of her paſſions, it wil partake both of her Health and Sickneſs.</p>

                  <p>And if any ill happen after blood-letting in ſuch a Caſe, it muſt be attributed rather to the violence of the Diſeaſe, than to the blood-letting, or any other Remedy applied.</p>

For if al Practitioners diſ-allow the ſame in Men, and VVomen not with Child, both Greeks, Arabians, and Latines, both Antient and Modern; much more is it to be diſ-liked in a woman ſeven or eight months gone with Child. If it be done in a ſmal quantity, it is to no purpoſe: what can the taking away of one little Porren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of blood do, to reſiſt the furious agitation of Humors, and to extinguiſh a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſeeing the blood is wont to come very ſlowly away, drop by drop, and the beſt firſt.</p>

               <p>THere is nothing which we more frequently meet with in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and in the Practice of Phyſick, than Pains of the Loyns, whether they be primary, or ſecondary; that is to ſay, Attendants of other Diſeaſes; which are oftentimes neglected by Phyſitians as Symptomatical, unleſs they be very ſtubborn, and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary without a Feaver.

               <p>And in the firſt place, it is fit to take notice, that this pain is by the Greeks called<note place="margin">The Name with its Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology.</note> in one word <hi>Oſphualgia:</hi> the Latines term it <hi>Lumbago,</hi> and he that is made weak by pain in his Loins, is called <hi>Elumbis vel Elumbatus,</hi> diſloined or unloined. In the French 'tis termed <hi>Erne</hi> as it were a <hi>Rene</hi> from the Kidney, which lies in the Loines; and when the pain ariſes from a Convulſion of the Fibres, the common people ſay their Kidneys are torn in ſunder.</p>
               <p>If this pain of the Loins be eaſed with Clyſters, the Humors being emptied which were ſhut up in the Guts or Meſentery, the Common People ſay, that their Reins or Kidneys are wel diſ-burthened.</p>
               <p>Now that our enquiry touching pains of the Loins may be clear and Methodical,<note place="margin">The Authors Method.</note> it is neceſſary in the firſt place to diſtinguiſh the Parts conſtituting the Loins, which are pained, and the bordering Parts which as efficient Cauſes do give occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe pains, not neglecting the more remote Parts. Then we ſhal enquire into the common internal and external Cauſes of thoſe pains, and to ſum up al in a word, we ſhall conſider the Parts which ſend the Humor, and the Parts which receive the ſame.</p>

               <p>Oftentimes the btanches of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Aorta</hi> do carry a Patt of boiling and Superfluous Blood, out of the greater Channels into the Loines, which they Diſeaſe either in the Muſcly Parts, or in the Membranous Parts, or in the marrow of the Back; which is the Cauſe that a Palſie follows the Colick, or an Arthritis degenerates into the Colick and the Colick is changed into the Sciatica. Alſo, outward Impoſtumes of the Kidneys, and paſſions of the Gut Colon being either diſtended or exulcerated, are Communicated to the Loines. within and without in the Loines may ariſe Tumors, Impoſtumes, and Ulcers, yea, and the Loins are diſtorted by flux of Rheum, or ſome ſwelling. Their Fibres are diſtended by the Cramp. Many times pains of the Loines are ſtirred up by external Cauſes, as<note place="margin">External Cauſes.</note> a fall on the Back, or a Blow with a thick Stick, or ſome other maſſie thing.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being premiſed and wel underſtood, it is eaſie to explain very obſcure<note place="margin">Certain places in Hippocrates expounded.</note> places in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> touching pains of the Loines, which you ſhal find in the Commentaries of <hi>Duretus</hi> upon the Coick Prognoſticks of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and others collected together in the Commentaries of <hi>Marinellus</hi> upon <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in the word <hi>Lumbi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two kinds of Loine Symptomes: for ſome are in the Loines, and others ſpring from the Loines: both of them are by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> judged to be very ſtubborn and hard to deal with,</p>
               <p>In his Coicks he hath pronounced abſolutly and without exception, Such as have pains in their Loines are in a very bad condition. And in the ſame Book, Diſeaſes which ariſe from pain of the Back, are hard to cure. And how wil you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe places, unles by a clear knowledg of the the Parts ſending and Parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, as I declared before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certain it is, if in the beginning of Diſeaſes their be pain in the Loines, with heavyneſs and a Feaver, Blood very hot or in great plenty is contained within the greater Veſſels, which being more inflamed, if not timely prevented, may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Head or into the Lungs, from whence greivous Diſeaſes may follow.</hi> In other places he does particularly explain the Cauſes of Lung pains.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:49866:53"/>If I ſhould recite thoſe places, I ſhould fil twenty Leaves and upwards, wherefore I wil take in my Sailes and diſpatch al in a word. Pains of the Loines in acute Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant<note place="margin">Danger of theſe pains in Feavers.</note> Feavers or other Feavers in the beginning are dangerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they ſignifie a great Tumult in the Blood, and irritation of Humor within the greater Veſſels, which is much to be feared if a ſpeedy courſe be not taken to prevent what may follow, by a plentyful blood letting, eſpecially in the Feet, to hinder the recourſe of the blood to the upper Parts of the Cheſt or Head, where it is wont to produce divers terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deadly Symptomes.</p>
               <p>We ought therefore to be very fearful of pains in the Loines which perſevere in Feavers, although Blood have been often let, becauſe in the Region of the Belly, Humors lie extreme deep, which may take their courſe ſuddenly to ſome of the nobler Parts, if they be not diligently Purged forth.</p>
               <p>And therefore to cure ſuch like pains of the Loins, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was went to<note place="margin">Their Cure.</note> open the Veins of the Ham or Foot: which is confirmed by him, in his Coicks: the pains of the Loins proceed from aboundance of blood there, and blood-lettings that are cauſed by pains of the Loins are large and plentyful. Theſe things declare the neceſſity of blood-letting, when the Loins are pained with a Feaver.</p>

               <p>Bleeding at the Hemorrhoid Veins is good both for the Kidneis and for pains of the Loins; and therefore the Hemorrhoids are to be provoked.</p>
               <p>A laſting pain of the Loins without Heat or any Inflammatory diſpoſition, unleſs it can be diſcuſſed with Fomentations, after purging &amp; blood-letting often repeated, the Humor muſt be drawn out with Cupping-Glaſſes and Scarification, and by Application of Veſicatories, or making Iſſues on each ſide of the Back-bone; alſo with a Bath of freſh water qualified with Herbs, or by ſitting in natural Baths, or having their water Pumped from on high upon the Parts affected. For the pains of the Loins are more vehement and ſtubborn if the ſerous matter be conteined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Muſcles as far as the Vertebras: and they are yet worſe and harder to be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they come to the Marrow of the Back.</p>
               <p>But thoſe Symptomes which are thought to ariſe from the Loins, do not ariſe from the Parts which conſtitute or make up the Loins, but from the neighbouring Parts, which being ſpread upon the Loins, do cauſe pain, and transfer their Humors into other Parts, by a quick or ſlow motion, by the Veins and Arteries, ſuch as are <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Aorta,</hi> the Haemorrhoid Veins and the Meſaraicks.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> has obſerved this Difference; and after him <hi>Duretus,</hi> the <hi>Ghoſt</hi> of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and his <hi>Faithful Interpreter:</hi> For every Pleuriſie is a pain of the ſide; but every pain of the ſide, is not a Pleuriſie, or at moſt, but a baſtard Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie.</p>
                  <p>But ſome wil ſay, both Diſeaſes require the ſame Cure in reſpect of blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, becauſe the paſſage is eaſie for the Humors to go from the external parts, unto the internal. I do not deny that blood is to be taken away, but not ſo much, and ſo often, as in a true Pleuriſy. And therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in a pain of the ſide, was wont firſt to make uſe of Fomentations, that he might try whether the pain was in the ſide, or in the Membrane called <hi>Pleura;</hi> for a ſimple pain of the ſide is eaſed by<note place="margin">How they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in</note> Fomentations, but the Pleuriſie is thereby enraged the more, in which there is a continual Feaver, an In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The Action of the Cheſt, is motion, ordained for Reſpiration; which motion, is governed by Muſcles and Nerves which are ſubject to the Palſey and Convulſion.

                  <p>Oft-times the Lungs in one, or both the ſides, do cleave unto the Membrane which<note place="margin">How it is cauſed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Author.</note> covers the Ribs: or if they do not cleave thereunto when the ſide is firſt inflamed; the Membrane <hi>Pleura</hi> being ſoaked, and made ſofter by the afflux of Humors, does ſweat out a clammy wheyiſh Humor; ſo that the Lungs when breath is drawn in, filling the whol Cheſt, do at length ſtick unto the ſaid membrane <hi>Pleura,</hi> and there cleaving is made the faſter by the heat of the Feaver. Neither does the motion of the Lungs hinder that ſame cleaving too aforeſaid, becauſe when the pain is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the Patient breaths ſhort for fear of augmenting the ſame, and ſo the Lungs are moved very little: whereupon the Lungs are faſtened to the part pained, and then the Pleuriſy turns into a <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> or Inflamation of the Lungs, or both theſe Diſeaſes are joyned together; and therefore there follows an eaſy Expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, firſt of a bloody Humor, by reaſon of a light Exulceration both of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and of the membrane of the Lungs, and then of the reſt of the matter, which comes partly out of the ſide, partly from the Excrement of the Lungs Nutriment, or from the impurity of the maſs of blood, paſſing by its circular motion through the Lungs: whence it is, that ſo great a quantity of a Cholerick and Flegmatick Humor flows, which is ſpit up with Coughing.</p>
                  <p>But if the Lungs do not cleave to the ſide, the blood-watry Humor being ſhed into the Cavity of the Cheſt, and ſcarce ever drawn back again, there is bred an <hi>Empyema;</hi> which if it be not voided of it ſelf, it muſt be let out by opening the ſide; which Operation ſomtimes lucks wel.</p>

                     <hi>Aurelianus</hi> relates) and <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> do follow, there is a true Pleuriſie, if there be joyned thereunto, an Inflamation of one ſide of the Lungs; if both ſides be pained, it is a true <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> or Univerſal Inflamation of the Lungs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whol Lungs are affected both in the right, and left ſide; and continually beating upon the Ribs, they are apt to infect them with the blood-watry Humor wherewith they abound. Wherefore the Pleuriſy, and the Inflamation of the Lungs, are Diſeaſes of a brotherly Kindred, which help one another to deſtroy the Patient, or to comfort him, according as the Conſtitution of the Lungs is weak or ſtrong; and as they are aſſiſted with Remedies, eſpecially, liberal blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  <p>Neither can the matter cauſing the Pleuriſy, be transferred, or propagated by any other waies into the Lungs by any <hi>Metaſtaſis,</hi> or <hi>Epigeneſis.</hi> Howbeit, we ſee in dead bodies, the diſeaſed <hi>Pleura</hi> ten times thicker than ordinary, which argues that the ſeat of the Diſeaſe was there. I deny not but that it may be communicated to the Lungs, and that the Pleuriſie may degenerate into a <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> or Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Lungs, after the manner aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>Touching blood-letting, there has been for an hundred and fifty yeers, an eager<note place="margin">On which ſide the blood is to be taken away in a Pleuriſie?</note> contention between the Modern Phyſitians of <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> from what part blood is to be drawn in a true Pleuriſie, whether on the ſame ſide that is pained, or on the other ſide. At laſt, the Opinion of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> confirmed with the Authority of <hi>Galen,</hi> has prevailed, and got Victory over the Doctrine of the Arabian Phyſitians. The Phyſitians of <hi>Paris,</hi> and al true Artiſts, do follow <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates;</hi> for they let blood on the Arm, of the ſame ſide which is pained.

               <p>THe proper action of the Lungs is breathing: which we muſt conſider how it<note place="margin">Neceſſity of Reſpiration.</note> ought to be in bodies that are in health, that we may diſcern faults thereof, when it is depraved. In our whole Practice, eſpecially if you regard acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, their is no Diſeaſe or Symptom ſo uſual as difficulty in breathing. It is wel for the Patient, if in al Diſeaſes, eſpecially acute ones, he breath eaſily, becauſe life is inſeparable from Reſpiration, according to <hi>Galen</hi> in his 6. Book of the Parts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed. And if with al the Patient Sleeps kindly and ſweetly, aud feels no pain in the noble Parts of his body, it is to be hoped the Diſeaſe wil end wel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> never knew any one die, in whom theſe three conditions were found.</p>
               <p>Now Reſpiration or breathing is twofold, free, or forced, free is that whereby the<note place="margin">Its twofold.</note> Air is gently drawn in and Iſſued out, without any remarkable motion of the Cheſt. And this depends only upon the Midrif, the Ribbs and whol Cheſt never moving:<note place="margin">Free, and Forced.</note> unleſs hapily the lower baſtard Ribs are gently ſtirred; and this kind of breathing is truly natural.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of breathing, which is forced and violent: is partly natural, partly againſt Nature. Natural, when it depends upon our own power, ſo that we can make it quicker or ſlower, as when we puf out our wind with a long blaſt, and when we hold our breath.

               <p>Alſo theſe Defections, as wel in exceſs, as defect, are to be conſidered, either in both parts of Reſpiration, or in one alone; alſo ſome are little without, and great within; others great without, and little within: and ſome ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But I very much doubt, whether Perſpiration can ſupply the Office of Reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a time, the Heart not being moved, becauſe I cannot perſwade my ſelf, that the Air can paſs ſo far as the Heart, by the ſmal Arteries, unleſs they did gape very wide, ſeeing it would meet with the Arterial blood, to ſtop its courſe.

blood, unleſs its dilatation be made by drawing back the <hi>Baſis</hi> thereof to the <hi>Cone;</hi> that the Veſſels may ſhed their blood, and the heart draw the ſame to it ſelf. In the <hi>Syſtole</hi> the heart is contracted, and the blood received, is thruſt out; and then the Heart becomes narrower, and longer than it was before. And becauſe it is ſhut up in the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> or Heart-caſe, which is faſtened circular-wiſe to the Sinewy Centre of the Midrif, with its <hi>Cone,</hi> or pointed end, it ſmites the Nervy Centre of the Midrif, and with its Baſis, or broad end, and the <hi>Aorta</hi> ſticking out, it ſmites the Breaſt at the ſame inſtant, when it is extended, and prolonged.</p>
               <p>This perpetual motion of the Heart, though it depend in reſpect of its produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">How neceſſary the circulation of the blood is to continue the motion of the Heart.</note> upon the inbred faculty thereof, yet can it not alwaies continue, ſave by the coming in of blood, out of which, the Heart frames the vital Spirit: and in caſe at every pulſe the Heart receive one drop of blood, or two, which it caſts into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and that in an hours ſpace, the Heart pulſes two thouſand times, it muſt needs be, that a great quantity of blood, or al the blood in the Veſſels, ſhould paſs through the Heart within the ſpace of twelve or fifteen hours.</p>
               <p>Now this quantity may come to fifteen, or twenty pounds of blood, which is as much as is contained in the Veſſels, and therefore it muſt needs be that in the ſpace of twenty four hours, the whol maſs of Blood is twice or thrice paſſed through the Heart, according as the motion of the Heart is quicker, or ſlower.</p>
               <p>And that this <hi>Circular Motion</hi> of the blood, might be performed with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Whether the blood do paſs from the right Ventricle of the Heart unto the Lungs.</note> commodity, and facility, <hi>William Harvey,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh man,</hi> the <hi>Kings Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,</hi> the Author and Inventor of this motion of the blood; and <hi>Joannes Walaeus,</hi> a Profeſſor of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and moſt eager <hi>Defender,</hi> and Protector thereof, wil have the blood to be carried through the Lungs, from the right, unto the left Ventricle of the Heart, not allowing that it ſhould paſs through the <hi>Septum,</hi> or Partition wal between the Ventricles of the Heart; and that the whol maſs of Blood, in an hour, or two hours ſpace, is circulated through the Heart, and the whol Body: which I do not allow of, and I have elſ-where laid down my reaſons of the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and inconveniency of ſuch a motion.<note place="margin">The Heart is the Original of Vena Cava.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When I had obſerved that the Trunk of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> was ſeparated from the Liver, running continually from the <hi>Jugulum,</hi> to the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, and that it paſſed not through the Liver, as we may ſee with our Eyes, and perceive alſo by thruſting a ſmal ſtick thereinto; I came to be of Opinion, that<note place="margin">The Liver of Vena Porta. They have different blood in them.</note> the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> did ſpring from the Heart, as the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> takes its riſe from the Liver; and that two ſorts of blood were contained in thoſe Veins, though both of thoſe ſorts are labored, and wrought in the Liver: the one of theſe ſorts of blood being ſent into the <hi>Porta,</hi> the other by a branch rooted in the Liver, twice as ſmal as the Trunk of <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> carried unto the Heart.<note place="margin">What kind of blood is circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated?</note>
               </p>
               <p>The blood which is contained in the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> is not circulated, although it have a flux, and reflux within its own Channels, and communicate with the Caelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Arteries, which are joyned one to another by mutual Anaſtomoſes.</p>
               <p>Within thoſe Veſſels, the blood may paſs to and fro reciprocally; but it does not run out according to the longitude of the body; neither is it in ſuch a ſenſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated.<note place="margin">In what Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels?</note>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Circulation which is made in the Heart, does borrow its matter from the Liver by the <hi>Vena Cava.</hi> The Circulatory Veſſels, are the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and <hi>Cava;</hi> neither do their branches receive that Circulation, becauſe the blood being ſhed into al the parts of the ſecond and third Region, does remain there to nouriſh the ſaid parts; neither does it flow back unto the greater Veſſels, unleſs it be revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by force, when there is great want of blood in the larger Veſſels, or when it is ſtimulated into ſome violent motion, and ſo flows unto the greater Circulatory Veſſels.<note place="margin">After what manner?</note>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo the blood which is brought from the Liver unto the right Ventricle of the Heart, does paſs through the Partition wall of the two Ventricles, into the left Ventricle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:49866:61"/>I confeſs that in a violent Circulation the blood is carried through the Lungs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">How the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed?</note> the left ventricle of the Heart, where it is forcibly ejected into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> that it may afterwards be carried into the greater Veins of the Limbs, which communicate by mutual Anaſtomoſes with the Arteries; and then from the Veins it flows up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right Ventricle of the Heart, and ſo there is made a perfect Circulation, by the continual flux and reflux of the blood.</p>
               <p>So that the blood in the Veins, does naturally, and perpetually aſcend, or return unto the Heart, the blood of the Arteries naturally, and continually deſcends, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from the Heart.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, if the ſmaller Veins of the Arms aud Legs, ſhal be emptied of blood, the blood of the Veins may deſcend to ſucceed in the place of that which is taken away, as I have cleerly demonſtrated againſt <hi>Harvey,</hi> and <hi>Walaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No man can deny the mutual Anaſtomoſes of the Veins and Arteries, ſeeing that <hi>Galen</hi> has ſaid it, and demonſtrated the ſame by Experiments, and our dayly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience confirms the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf, in his third Book of the Joynts, takes notice of this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Veins and Arteries, in a Diſcourſe by it ſelf.<note place="margin">How neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood is.</note>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee how neceſſary it is for the blood to circulate, that the motion of the Heart may not ceaſe; and how this Circulation may be performed without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and perturbation of the Humors, and without deſtroying the Ancient Art of Healing.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Circular motion of the blood is neceſſary, to continue the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart; as in Mils, the Water muſt perpetually fal upon the Wheel to make it turn about; alſo to warm again, and reſtore the ſtrength of the blood,<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility thereof.</note> which is decayed by the loſs of Spirits diſperſed up and down the body; whereas in the Heart, it is refurniſhed with new Spirits: and that the Heart being the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Native Heat, may be moiſtened with a perpetual Dew, leſt by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it ſhould parch, and wither away, for want of that dewy moiſture, or Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Nectar.</p>
               <p>By the Circulation of the blood in the Heart, the Cauſes of Life and Death, are more eaſily declared, than by the <hi>Humidum Primigenium,</hi> or Original Moiſture bred in the Heart when the Child is formed; which is ſo little that it is ſoon conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the perpetual motion of the Heart continuing day and night without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, would at length wear away the Subſtance of the Heart, unleſs by a perpetual flowing in of the circulated blood, it were moiſtened, and repaired.<note place="margin">Whether the Heart and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the ſame time?</note>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit, we muſt hold that the Heart and Arteries do move by Courſe, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, not being moved at the ſame inſtant with the ſame kind of motion; but taking their turns, and performing their work interchangably; for when the Heart ſends out the blood, the Arteries receive it, and tranſmit it into the Veins; not that which is expelled the ſame inſtant, but that which is neereſt the Veins.</p>
               <p>This being granted, theſe parts muſt of neceſſity be moved one after another, and the ſwelling motion of the Artery when it riſes under our Finger, is dilatation, or widening, and not contraction; although it ſeem very like the pulſe which the Heart makes, when it contracts it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>Oftentimes the Heart does counterfeit, and make ſhew of a kind of Apoplexy, but without ſnorting; neither does it leave a Palſey after it, or any feebleneis of Body, or mind. If this Diſeaſe return often with violence, at length it over-whelms and ſtifles the Heart, not only becauſe the blood is ſtopped from going forth, by reaſon of the fulneſs of the Veſſels, but by the Hearts being oppreſſed by ſome groſs ſubſtance of the blood, forcibly crowded into the Ventricies of the Heart, ſtopping the pulſative motion of the Heart and Arteries, and cauſing ſomtime that the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cannot ſpeak, and bringing him finally to his Grave.</p>
                  <p>This Diſeaſe is as common among the Germans, as is the Apoplexy, by reaſon of their full, and Champion-like habit of body, contracted by their dayly Feaſtings, and liberal drinking, eſpecially at dinner, which laſts til

                  <p>The motion of the Heart is depraved in the Palpitation, or Panting thereof, and<note place="margin">Palpitation</note> it is interrupted in <hi>Syncope,</hi> and <hi>Leipothymia.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Differences of Feavers. In respect of the Cauſe, a Feaver is, Spirital,</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hiſtory of Feavers belongs to this place, which I ſhal diſpatch in few words. The Hot Diſtemper of the Heart, is termed a Feaver. The Differences of Feavers are taken from their conjunct Cauſe, which is three-fold; The <hi>Spirits,</hi> the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the Veſſels,</hi> and the Humors fixed in the ſolid parts of the body.</p>
                  <p>From the Spirits, a Feaver is termed <hi>Spirituoſa,</hi> or Spirital; from the Humors in the Veſſels, it is termed <hi>Humoralis;</hi> and from the Humors fixed in the ſolid parts, it is termed <hi>Hectica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though there be three ſorts of Spirits, Natural, Vital, Animal; yet is it the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirit alone, which being inflamed, cauſes the Spirital Feaver. There are four<note place="margin">Humoral</note> Humors contained in the Veſſels, whence comes four ſorts of Humoral Feavers; the Sanguine, the Cholerick, the Flegmatick, and the Melanchollick. But the Hectick Feaver is diſtinguiſhed by three degreee: For the ſimple Hectick arites<note place="margin">Hectick,</note> from the fixed Humor, being only inflamed; the middle Hectick is when the ſaid Humor begins to waſt; and the <hi>Hectica Maraſmodes,</hi> when it is quite exhauſt, and conſumed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Modi</hi> of Feavers, or their manner of afflicting, is two-fold: for either the<note place="margin">In reſpect of the manner, Continual, Intermittent.</note> Feaver is continual, or it intermits; it is putrid, or not putrid; malignant, or wel-affected. A continual Feaver never ceaſes burning, til it go wholly away. An intermitting Feaver, leaves the Patient ſome ſpace of time free from burning.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſe of the Continualneſs of a Feaver, is the plenty of Morbiſick matter and its nearneſs to the Heart, and the diſtance and paucity of the ſaid matter is the Cauſe of its Intermiſſion. A Putrid Feaver is cauſed by Putrefaction of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors:<note place="margin">Putrid, Imputrid Malignant,</note> An Imputrid Feaver is cauſed only by the fervency of the Spirits and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors contained in the Veſſels, or fixed in the ſolid Parts. A Malignant Feaver is cauſed by extream Pucrefaction, or by divers Symptomes greivouſly afflicting the noble Parts: a Well-affected Feaver, has none of al theſe. A great Feaver is the<note place="margin">Non-malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> ſame with a Malignant, and a little Feaver differs not from a Well affected. Hence are al the differences of Feavers taken; a ſpirital Feaver is continual indeed, yet laſts but a Day, and is therefore termed <hi>Ephemera:</hi> a Sanguin Feaver is alſo continual and threefold, Encreaſing, ſtanding at a ſtay, and decreaſing; Putrid or Imputrid: It is by ſome termed continens to diſtinguiſh it ſrom the reſt of the Humoral Feavers. Cholerick, Melancholick and Flegmatick Feavers, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49866:63"/>
when the Humors from whence they ariſe do Putrifie in the great Veins: when they Putrifie in the little Veins, or out of the Veins, they make Intermitting Feavers. An Hectick Feaver is alſo continual, but ſlow and lingering.</p>
                  <p>The Return of intermitting Feavers is termed their fit; the more than ordinary<note place="margin">The ſit of a Feaver. Its Exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>Now the Acceſſions or exacerbations of Feavers are various according to the various motion of the Humor. They come every third day, by reaſon of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion of Choler, whence al bilious intermitting Feavers are called <hi>Tertians</hi> or third day Agues; as the Quartans come every fourth day, becauſe the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick Humor is moved upon that day; as Flegm is moved every day, whence quotidian Agues are Flegmatick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quintan, Septan, Nonan,</hi> or ſift, ſeventh and ninth day Agues, as they are exceeding rare, ſo ate they not comprehended under any Rules of Art.</p>
                  <p>The Proper Symptomes of the beginnings of Ague-fits, do ſhew the ſort of Ague what it is: ſo a ſhaking ſhewes a Tertian Ague, A grinding cold fit that makes a man think it would break his bones, argues a Quartan; and for the fit to begin with a mere ſimple coldneſs, is the token of a Quotidian.</p>
                  <p>A double tertian comes every day, as the Quotidian does, but with extream ſhaking; whereas the Quotidian comes only with a coldneſs.</p>
                  <p>Confuſed and implicated Feavers, are made of thoſe Feavers, which we have<note place="margin">Confuſed.</note> now explained. Confuſed or mixed Feavers, are made by mixiture of the Humors, as a Baſtard Tertian is made by a mixture of Choler and Flegm. But Implicated<note place="margin">Implicated</note> Feavers are ſtirred up by Viciſſitude of Humors put into Putrefaction or Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where upon there is obſerved in them, diſtinct ſits one following another, as in a double Tertian, and in a double and triple Quartan, and in a Semitertian, which is nothing elſe but a complication of a continual Quotidian and an Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Tertian: and in the Feaver called <hi>Triteophyaea,</hi> which laſts thitty hours and longer.</p>
                  <p>Two Agues are obſerved to follow one another, ſo that the firſt being not quite<note place="margin">Erratick</note> finiſhed, another which is worſe ſucceeds and follows the ſame. But i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> theſe ſits are inordinat keeeping no certain Courſe, and returning upon ſeveral daies, they make ſuch Agues as are termed <hi>Erraticae,</hi> wandring giddy Agues.</p>
                  <p>There are other differences of Feavers taken from the Symptomes, yet ſo as they<note place="margin">In reſpect of Symptomes.</note> may be reduced to theſe ſorts I have ſpoken of: as the Feaver <hi>Epiala, Leipyria, Typhodis, Elodis, Peſtilens, Cauſus,</hi> for they are al Humoral, and diſtinguiſhed by ſome remarkable Symptomes.</p>
                  <p>In the Feaver <hi>Epiala</hi> there is a ſence of heat and cold by reaſon of the unequal<note place="margin">Epiala Leipyria</note> motion of the Morbifick matter. In <hi>Leipyria,</hi> the outward Parts are cold, and the inner Parts burn with Heat, becauſe the Feaveriſh Heat is drawn inwards. <hi>Typhodis</hi> and <hi>Eleodis</hi> are, in which the Patient ſweats much, without any eaſe<note place="margin">Typhodes.</note> thereby. <hi>A Peſtilential Feaver</hi> is no other than a putrid, but it Springs from an extream and remarkable putrefaction, and ſo deadly, that more die than recover. <hi>Cauſus</hi> is a name ſignifying extream Heat and burnning, ſuch as is in a continual<note place="margin">Burning Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> Feaver ariſing from Choler, ſo that a Cholerick continiual Feaver by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency is ſo termed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cremnodes Febris</hi> the Feaver ſo called, is ſaid to proceed from an Inflammation<note place="margin">Symptomati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Feavers.</note> of the Lungs: but ſuch Feavers as are cauſed by Inflammation of the Internal Parts, are Symptomatical, neither are they properly termed Feavers.

               <p>You ſhal obſerve that the Trunk piercing through the Midrif, does receive that ſame<note n="a" place="bottom">T. 12. f. 1. r r. &amp;c.</note> Hepatick branch which ariſes from the top of the Liver, and carries Blood<note place="margin">Hepatica</note> into the <hi>Cava,</hi> and from that ſame Oblique inſertion, unto the opening of the Trunk, in the right Ventricle of the heart, there is the diſtance of two Fingers breadth.</p>
               <p>From whence we may gather, that Blood is carried directly from the Liver to the Heart, although it is mixed with other blood aſcending by Circulation. That ſame opening of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and its cleaving to the right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ventricle of the heart, is contained and to be ſeen within the <hi>Pericardium:</hi> which when the Trunk has paſſed through, it aſcends unto the Claves.</p>
               <p>And therefore you may know, that the blood aſcending unto the heart by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, does alſo come as far as the Throat, and is derived into the upper Limbes, with that blood which deſcends from the Head by the Veins.</p>

Each of theſe pains reaches unto the Eyes; becauſe the internal Membranes do produce the Coats of the Eye, called <hi>Cornea,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea;</hi> and the <hi>Pericranium</hi> produces the Coat <hi>Conjunctiva.</hi>

                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:49866:73"/>The kind of the Pain ſhews the Nature of the Diſeaſe. A ſharp and biting pain does argue a Cholerick Diſtemper of the Head: a heavy preſſing pain, ſhews a Flegmatick Diſtemper: a panting, or pulſing pain, argues ſomwhat of an Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: A pricking pain ſhews an Eroſion, or gnawing, cauſed by a ſharp Humor, or a Worm which is rare. A ſtretching pain, argues abundance of Humor, or of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Spirits, which diſtend the Membranes.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Pain</hi> is either in the whol Head, or in the half, or in ſome one particle thereof. If it infeſt the whol Head, it is called <hi>Cephalalgia:</hi> if half the Head, <hi>Hemicrania,</hi> becauſe the brain is divided into two parts: If the pain poſſeſs one part, as if a Nail were driven in there, the Arabians call it <hi>Clavus,</hi> and <hi>Ovum;</hi> the Nail, or Egg. If the pain of the Head, be of long Continuance, it is termed <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalaea;</hi> which together with the <hi>Hemicrania,</hi> is periodical; but the <hi>Cephalalgia</hi> is a continual univerſal Head-ach.</p>
                  <p>A continual Pain of the Head joyned with a continual Feaver, and ſigns of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, is exceeding dangerous, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the Second of his Prognoſticks.</p>
                  <p>Pains of the Head are, <hi>Primary,</hi> and <hi>Proper;</hi> or <hi>Secundary,</hi> and by <hi>Sympathy</hi> from other parts: Theſe are not ſo dangerous as the former.</p>
                  <p>The Principal Actions of the Brain, Imagination, Ratiocination, and Memory,<note place="margin">Symptomes of the Subſtance of the brain.</note> are diminiſhed, depraved, and aboliſhed. <hi>Depravation of the Fantaſie and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> is Raving; the <hi>Imminution</hi> thereof is Fooliſhneſs.</p>
                  <p>There is a three-fold <hi>Hurt of the Memory;</hi> but the Abolition thereof has only found a name, being called <hi>Oblivion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cauſe of <hi>Fooliſhneſs,</hi> is every great diſtemper of the brain, which is known<note place="margin">Fooliſhneſs.</note> by its Cauſes, as by ſigns; or ſome ill ſhaping of the Head, which is eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dotage,</hi> or <hi>Raving,</hi> conſiſts in abſurd Thoughts, Words, or Deeds. The Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings<note place="margin">Dotage.</note> of ſuch as rave, are eſtranged from Truth and Reaſon, or not to the point in hand; their Deeds are either unuſual, or undecent; their Thoughts are abſurd, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and Chymerical.</p>
                  <p>The manner of Raving, ought to be diſtinguiſhed to know the differences of the<note place="margin">Melancholy.</note> Melancholly which cauſes the ſame; for a <hi>Delirium,</hi> or raving with depravation of the Fanſie, is termed Melancholly, which conſiſts in a falſe Opinion touching things paſt, preſent, and to come; which being manifold, it is defined by vain fear, anxiety, or ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Again, Melancholly is either <hi>Primary,</hi> or <hi>Secondary:</hi> The Primary has its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal in the brain; the Secondary ſprings from the Hypochondriacal parts, whence it is termed <hi>Hypochondriaca Melancholia,</hi> which is either Humoral, or Flatulent: the former is the worſe of the two, and brings at laſt Madneſs, and Out-ragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>The Melancholy <hi>Ecſtaſie,</hi> is an exceſs of Melancholy, which is three-fold: An<note place="margin">Ecſtaſie.</note> Ecſtaſie ſimply ſo called; an Ecſtaſie with ſilence; an Ecſtaſie with a Frenzy: they are cauſed by black Choler, according to the divers degrees of its Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:</p>
                  <p>Fooliſhneſs with laughter is better and ſafer, than with ſeriouſneſs and fierceneſs. Raving without a Feaver, is ſo much the better by how much the Parts under the ſhort Ribs, or the Brain, are leſs heated.</p>
                  <p>The Reſting, and binding up of the Sences, is Natural <hi>Sleep:</hi> The breaking off, or hindrance of ſleep, is Watching: Either of which being out of meaſure, is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.<note place="margin">Coma, or Dead ſleep.</note> If Sleep be profound, 'tis called <hi>Coma,</hi> or <hi>Carus,</hi> Dead-ſleep. If this Symptome be mixed of Sleep and Watching, ſo that the Patient ſeems to incline to ſleep, with his Eyes ſhut, but is not able to ſleep; it is termed <hi>Coma-Vigilans,</hi> the Drowzy Watch. But if one that has a ſleeping Diſeaſe upon him, every time he is awakened, does rave, and talk idlely, the Diſeaſe is called <hi>Typhomania.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if a man lie ſtiff with his Eyes open, and when he comes to himſelf, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers<note place="margin">The Night-Mare.</note> what was done about him, it is termed <hi>Incubus,</hi> the Mare; which is wont to

happen in the right to ſuch as lie upon their backs, or have glutted themſelves with feaſting; and it ſeems that they are choaked, by ſome Devil lying upon them, or by ſome Theif that has laid hold upon them to Rob and Murther them.</p>
                  <p>The abolition of al ſence and motion ſaving Reſpiration, is called <hi>Catalepſis</hi> or<note place="margin">Catalepſis.</note> 
                     <hi>Catoche:</hi> whereby a Man is Frozen as it were in that poſture he was in when the fit ſeazed upon him. It ſprings from a Cold diſtemper of the Brain with Flegm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carus</hi> is a deep Sleep, which comes upon Feavers and wounds of the temporal<note place="margin">Carus.</note> Muſcles, or from an hot and moiſt diſtemper, or from much evaporation with ſero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, moiſtening the ſubſtance of the brain.</p>
                  <p>A Lethargy is an Imminution of ſence and Motion and alſo of the Memory of<note place="margin">A Lethargy.</note> neceſſary things. It Springs from a Primary hot and moiſt diſtemper of the brain, joyned with a putrid Humor which provoks a Feaver and cheriſhes and keepes it up a long time. There is alſo Dotage adjoyned. Touching this Diſeaſe there is a ſaying of <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> in his Coicks Page 75. Which explaines all the Symptomes thereof. The exiſtence or particular Nature of the Lethargy and <hi>Coma,</hi> conſiſts in a looſneſs, as that of the Catalepſis in a Tenſion or ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Thoſe that are in a Lethargick Sleep, at laſt become Apople<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Apoplexy</hi> does oft times primarily and unexpectedly invade a Man, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times<note place="margin">An Apoplexy.</note> it followes ſome other Sleepy diſeaſe. It is an Abolition of ſence and motion with reſpiration hurt, which at laſt brings ſnoring and ſuffocation, by reaſon thick Flegm flowing out of the Funnel and obſtructing the Larynx or Weſand.</p>
                  <p>It is Cauſed by a Repletion of the Ventricles of the brain, either with a pituito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us or Wheyiſh Humor, or with blood, ſome ſmal Artery of the <hi>Rete Mirabile</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken in the Baſis of the Brain, or blood being carried aloft in a Plethorick body by the fourth Channel, ruſhes into the Ventricles.</p>
                  <p>If it be Simple and meer Whey, by ſtrength of Nature out of the anterior Ventricles, it ſlips into the fourth Ventricle, and from thence into the Spinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſo Cauſes a Palſie.</p>
                  <p>If it be a Flegmatick Humor ſtopped in the fourth Ventricle, or in the third, it cannot be diſcuſſed, and the brain is overwhelmed thereby.</p>
                  <p>If the blood be ſhed out of the veſſels, it ſuddainly ſuffocates.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Carus</hi> or other Sleepy Diſeaſe, only the foremoſt Ventricles of the brain, are overwhelmed with Seroſities, ſo that there is yet freedom for the ſpirits to paſs into all Parts of the body.</p>
                  <p>But in an Apoplexy, all the ventricles of the brain, but eſpecially the fourth, are obſtructed, and unleſs the matter be diſcuſſed into the ſpinal Marrow Death fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows unavoidably.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fernelius</hi> avouches that an Apoplexy is bred by an Obſtructiou of that <hi>Rete Mirabile,</hi> the afflux of Arterial blood out of the Heart into the brain, being thereby intercepted. Therefore they are termed <hi>Carotides,</hi> becauſe being obſtructed they cauſe <hi>Carum</hi> or the Sleepy-Evil.</p>
                  <p>In the Apoplexy and Sleepy Diſeaſes, beſides general Medicines, as blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Cure of the Apoplexy, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus and ſucid like Diſeaſes.</note> liberally twice or thrice repeted out of the Arm and foot; ſtrong Purgation of watry Humors, Cupping-Glaſſes fixed unto the ſhoulders and the hinder Part of the Head, Topical Remedies, are not be neglected, which draw and Evacuate near the Part affected; ſuch as is the opening of the Veins under the Tongue and of the external Jugular Vein, and likewiſe of the Temporal Artery: great Veſicatories applied towards the top of the ſhoulders to the Cephalick Vein, ſtrong Medicines to provoke Sneezing, a Seton in the Neck, the ſtring being often drawn about and anointed with Oyl of Vitriol, that it may bite the more and attract: opening the Veins of the Noſe after the manner uſed by the Ancients, with a ſplit Toothed Quil thruſt up as far as the bottom of the Colander: a ſharp injection into the Noſtrils
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49866:74"/>
Noſtrils by a ſyring, and within the furrows placed between the ſpaces of <hi>Os Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meris:</hi> drawing out of the Flegmatick clammy matter which ſticks in the Throat and ſtops the Larynx, but thruſting a feather far into the throat: to which intent a ſtrong vomit is good to caſt forth any Humor that has flowed into the Wind-Pipe: neither muſt we omit extream hard rubbings with ſalt, and continual ſtirring of the body, if it be poſſible.</p>
                  <p>All which remedies are to be applied with all poſſible ſpeed one upon the Neck of another, in an Apoplexy, becauſe there is danger in delay. In Sleepy Diſeaſes which proceed ſlowly, and are cauſed by matter falling down from the Parts above, they are more ſlowly adminiſtred, and without Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>You ſhal obſerve alſo, that a great Part of theſe Humors is gathered together in the turnings &amp; windings which are outmoſt in the upper ſubſtance of the brain, which do either putrifie there, or ſlip into the ventricles of the brain: and yet theſe windings of the brain are not conſidered.</p>
                  <p>The Palſie is an Abolition of ſence and motion, not in the whol body, as in the Apoplexy, but only in the greateſt Part of the body, or in half<note place="margin">The Palſie.</note> thereof, which is termed <hi>Hemiplegia,</hi> or in one Part, which is called <hi>Paraplegia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fernelius</hi> obſerves, that ſence is taken away, the motion remaining unhurt: and ſomtimes motion is taken away and the ſence remains, becauſe of the difference of the Nerves of the brain and the Spinal Marrow. In the Palſie, the Nerves of the Spinal Marrow are obſtructed, but thoſe of the brain, not: and therefore many Parts remain unhurt, eſpecially the internal.</p>
                  <p>Somtimes the Palſie happens without obſtruction of the Nerves, becauſe the ſoſtning and Humectation of the Nerves, brings a kind of Palſie.</p>
                  <p>In an imperfect Palſie when motion and ſence are only dulled, the Diſeaſe is<note place="margin">Stupor.</note> termed <hi>Stupor</hi> or <hi>Nothrotis,</hi> which ariſes from a moiſt diſtemper of the brain. A Stupidity or dulneſs of ſence and motion in a Feaver, is wont to foretel a ſleepy Diſeaſe to follow. When it comes alone without Feaver, it foretels a Palſie or an Apoplexy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vertigo,</hi> is a depravation of ſence and motion, which makes the Patient think<note place="margin">Vertigo.</note> that al things turn round: it ſprings from a windy Humor, which being agitated within the foremoſt Ventricles of the Brain, cauſes the foreſaid Apprehenſion of all things turning about. If it Cauſes a darkneſs before the Patients Eyes, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Vertigo Tenebricoſa</hi> or <hi>Scotodinos.</hi> It ariſes from the Brain or from vapours aſcending from the inferior Parts. That is worſt which ariſes primarily from the brain, and it is a fore-runner of the Falling Sickneſs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>convulſion</hi> is a violent pulling back of the Muſcles towards their Head or<note place="margin">Convulſion.</note> beginning. It is threefold, <hi>Emproſthotonos,</hi> when the body is bent foreward; <hi>Opiſthotonos,</hi> when the body is drawn backward: and <hi>Tetanos</hi> when both ſides remain ſtif, by reaſon of an equal bowing or ſtretching of the Muſcles on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſe of a Convulſion, is either an obſtruction of the Nerves, or their being pricked by a ſharp Humor, or a dry diſtemper, which dries the Nerves, and ſo makes them ſtif as a dried Lurſtring; this is incurable. In one word, all Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are ſaid to ariſe either from too much emptyneſs, or over fulneſs.</p>
                  <p>An Epilepſie or Falling-ſickneſs, is a Convulſion of the whol body, coming by<note place="margin">Falling-Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> fits, and hurting the Mind and ſences. It is cauſed by an obſtruction of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Ventricles of the brain, cauſed by an Abundance of ſharp Humors, either, Cholerick or Flegmatick. Either it comes from the brain Primarily affected, or from ſome other Part ſending Malignant Humors to the brain. If it proceed from the brain Primarily affected, it is the more dangerous: if by fault of the Spleen or ſome other Bowel venemouſly infected: the coming of the fits may
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49866:74"/>
be foreſeen and prevented. The former comes in a moment, the latter by degrees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fernelius,</hi> beſides the Humor which is the common Cauſe, accounts the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Cauſe to be a venemous Air or vapour, which is exceeding hurtful to the brain; and therefore he conceives, it muſt be cured with ſpecificks and appropriate Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as wel as thoſe vulgar ones.</p>
                  <p>Trembling is a depravation of Motion through weakneſs. It is cauſed by the<note place="margin">Trembling.</note> weakneſs of the motive faculty and the bodies heavyneſs. So that look how much the motive faculty endeavours to lift up the Member, ſo much does the heavyneſs of the ſaid Member not ſufficiently illuſtrated with ſpirits, preſs it down again. And therefore it ariſes, from obſtruction of the Nerves, or from their being over-much ſoftened, or from ſome external Cauſe, as by anointing with Quick-ſilver, or other Application thereof. There is a certain mixture of the Convulſion and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, which is called <hi>Spaſmo-Tromois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shivering and ſhaking, are motions of the body, which happen in Feavers, and<note place="margin">Shivering and Shaking.</note> they are forerunners of the fits of Agues, or of the Exacerbations of Feavers. They happen alſo, to ſuch as have ripe Impoſtumes, when the Impoſtum is ready to break. And therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerves a threefold Shaking-fit; the one fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, the other Ulcerous, and the laſt Symptomatical.</p>
                  <p>Unquietneſs, Anxiety, tumbling and toſſing of the body this way and that way,<note place="margin">Tumbling and Toſſing.</note> called by the Greekes <hi>Aſſe;</hi> is a depravation of motion, which proceeds from a miſaffection of the Stomach, by reaſon of a ſharp Humor Nettling and Stinging the Nerves of the body, or the Membranes of the Back-bones Marrow. Which makes that the Sick cannot reſt in one place or poſture; but are forced every foot to change place and tumble here and there, and to change the poſture of their Bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Night-walking,</hi> ought to be reckoned among the Symptomes of motion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved:<note place="margin">Walking in ones Sleep.</note> becauſe it is not preformed by Judgment and Reaſon, but by force of a Diſeaſe, namely of ſharp Fumes which compel the Sick perſon or the healthy to riſe up and walk in their Sleep.</p>
                  <p>I proceed to the Irregularity of the Excrements. The proper excretion of the<note place="margin">Symptomes of things voided forth.</note> brain, is either an Exhalation of a thin Vapour by the ſeames of the Scul or the pores of the Skin, or it is an Efflux of a thick Humor by the Noſtrils and Palate of the Mouth. The Diſproportion of this Excretion conſiſts either in exceſs ot defect. That in defect has no Name, but it degenerates into a Cauſe of Diſeaſes of the brain, of which we have already ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>The diſproportion in Exceſs is various, either when blood does immoderatly<note place="margin">Noſe bleeding.</note> flow from the Noſe, or by drops. Both which Symptomes are Malignant. The former decaies the bodies ſtrength, by reaſon of the loſs of blood and Spirits, the latter betokens a repletion of the Head, and a Vain endeavour of oppreſſed Nature, And therefore drops of Blood coming from the Noſe, is bad in a Vaporous Feaver. both as a Cauſe, and as a Sign.</p>
                  <p>The diſproportion in Excretion of a ſerous and Phlegmatick Humor, is many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.<note place="margin">Catarrhs.</note> Their general Name is a Catarrh, which is a diſtillation of Humor from the Head into the Inferior Parts, from which Parts it receives divers Appellations. If it fal into the Noſtrils, it is called <hi>Coryza</hi> or <hi>Gravedo;</hi> if into the Throat <hi>Branchos,</hi> Hoarſneſs; if into the Mouth and Palate <hi>Ptyeliſmos,</hi> or the Spawle. And theſe three ſorts of Catarrhs, are vulgarly comprehended under the Name of Rheum.</p>
                  <p>A Catarrh falling upon the outward Parts of the body is named <hi>Rheumatiſmus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rheumatiſmus</note> or <hi>Rheumaticus</hi> affectus, the Rheumatick Pains. If it fal upon the Joynts it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the Gout, ſave that it comes not by fits: wherefore an Eunuch may ſuffer upon the Rheumatick pains, but not the true Gout. See <hi>Galens</hi> Comment upon that Aphoriſme. <hi>Boys and Eunuchs are not troubled with the Gout.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Galen</hi> makes frequent mention of the <hi>Rheumatick</hi> Diſeaſe, which was common at Rome, as it is with us in <hi>Paris:</hi> in his Second Book to <hi>Glauco: in his Book of Blood-letting, againſt Eraſiſtratus &amp;c.</hi> This Diſeaſe he cured by liberal Bloodletting. It is deſcribed by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in <hi>his Book of the internal Diſeaſes,</hi> under the Name of a Joynt-pain, which is wont to trouble young People more than Aged.</p>
                  <p>The other differences of Catarhs with Reference to the diverſity of Parts on which they fal, are Vain. It ſuffices to know, that al Fluxions upon internal Parts, are called likewiſe Rheums.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of a Catarrh or Flux of Rheum, is a cold and moiſt diſtemper, or an hot diſtemper with an abundance of Humors working in the Veſſels, or without. <hi>Galen</hi> acknowledges both theſe Cauſes, in his Comment upon the 24. Aphor. Of the third Book.</p>
                  <p>The latter Phyſitians, following the Doctrin of the Arabians wil have the Humor which Cauſes the Catarrh, to be bred in the Head, only without the Veſſels, by reaſon of Vapours aſcending.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fernelius</hi> contends that the Conjunct Cauſe of a Catarrh, is a ſerous matter, collected under the Skin of the Head, without the Veſſels: and that the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Cauſe, is an Humor ſhut up in the Veins. If you deſire to know more of this ſubject, Read <hi>Fernelius,</hi> who wil give you abundant ſatisfaction.</p>

The diſtemper of the Humors and Coats of the Eye, if it happen without a Tumor or an Ulcer, is commonly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the weakneſs of the Faculty, and the quality and quantity of the ſpirits being miſaffected: but neither of theſe is a Diſeaſe; they are rather effects of a Diſeaſe: for what is the weakneſs of a faculty other than <hi>Actio laeſa,</hi> the action hurt.</p>
                  <p>Thickneſs of the Spirits is cauſed by a cold and moiſt diſtemperature, either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<note place="margin">Thinneſs of the Spirits. Their Paucity</note> to the Eye, or by conſent with the brain or ſome inferior Parts.</p>
                  <p>Paucity of Spirits comes from a dry diſtemper, either of the Eye or the brain: the Cauſe and fomenter of which diſtemper may be a Cholerick Humor not purged out of the body, being the cauſe and Effect of a diſtempered Liver.</p>
                  <p>The thickneſs and hardneſs of the Chryſtallip Humor is properly termed <hi>Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſis</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Glaucoma</note> or <hi>Glaucoma,</hi> becauſe the color thereof reſembles that of an Owles Eyes: it proceeds from a cold and dry diſtemper, and is therefore familiar to aged Perſons.</p>
                  <p>The Diſeaſe of the Chryſtalline Humor in reſpect of its Scituation, has no name, but if it be ſomwhat higher and flatter than ordinary, it produces a Symptome, whereby all things appear double.</p>

                  <p>The Cauſes of ſight depraved is an <hi>Hypopion</hi> beginning; or an <hi>Hypochyma,</hi> Namely, when the Humor is not yet united and grown together, ſo that the viſive Spirit can paſs too and fro between the Parts of the Humor through the empty ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: whence it is that ſome ſee flies as it were, and certain dark bodies, move before their Eyes.</p>

                  <p>The hurting of the Eyes Motion, is either a Palſie, Convulſion, or Trembling.<note place="margin">Palſie Convulſion Trembling</note> In the Palſie and Convulſion, the Eyes become ſtif and fixed: in that ſort of Convulſion called <hi>Tetanus,</hi> they are unſtable, as in the Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>

               <p>That ſpace is filled up with <hi>Spungy Bones,</hi> which are portions of the Colander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.<note place="margin">Spungy Bones Spungy Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncles.</note> And thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Spungy bones are filled with <hi>Spungy bits of Fleſh,</hi> which drink up the Flegm which flows from the Head, that Snevil might not be alwaies drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of the Noſe.</p>

For <hi>as Plato reports in his Alcibiades,</hi> if the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> had a Daughter ſo born; they did thruſt Pipes into the Childs Noſe, and reduce it by little and little to its right ſhape, by widening the bones and Griſtles, whiles they were yet Waxy and pliable.</p>

                  <p>The Smelling is depraved, when al things ſeem to ſtink, and when the Patient<note place="margin">depraved.</note> perceives a ſtink in his Noſe, which is likewiſe diſcerned by the ſtanders by. The true Cauſe of this Symptome, is a putrified Humor congealed in thoſe Cavities. If the Putrefaction be within the Scul, the ſtink is not perceived by the Patient, but is diſcerned by thoſe which converſe with him, as <hi>Fernelius</hi> judiciouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</p>
                  <p>Simple affections of the external Noſe, are ſpors which are black and blew or red,<note place="margin">Spots</note> and deforme the ſame. They muſt be taken away, or corrected with ſome Fucus, if there be no other Remedy.</p>

                     <hi>Fernelius</hi> would have al bleedings at the Noſe to be ſtopped, be they what they wil, and would have a Vein opened to that end, contrary to the Doctrine of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates.</hi> Blood coming from the inner Parts of the Noſe may be ſtopped: but it is very hard to ſtop the ſame when it comes from the Menings or Coates of the Brain.</p>
                  <p>Dropping of blood from the Noſe in burning and Malignant Feavers, is bad, both<note place="margin">Its Cure.</note> as a Cauſe and a ſigne: becauſe it does not eaſe the Patient, and it ſhews a Plenitude in the brain, and that nature being weak is not able to disburthen herſelf. In ſuch a caſe, great care is to be taken of the head by Revulſion, and Derivation of the blood, and by cooling of the Head, for fear of Inflamation or ſome Sleepy Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>If bleeding at the Noſe be ſtopped in young people accuſtomed thereunto, and their brains Ake through fullneſs, they muſt be let blood.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients did open the inward Veins of the Noſe, which Practice is left off, becauſe the way they did it, is to us unknown.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fernelius</hi> writes that Wormes as long as ones Finger have been found in Saddle-Noſes, being there bred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which at laſt made the Patients mad and killed them: thoſe Wormes were thought to have been caſt out of the brain, where as indeed they were born and bred in the Cavities of the Noſe. For Wormes bred in the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the brain, cannot come out, unleſs they ſhould eat a ſunder or break the Sieve-like table of the Colander-bone.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Fernelius</hi> has written, is worthy of conſideration in reference to Diſeaſes of the Head. That in Noſe-bleedings, the blood comes out not from the brain, but out of the Veins of the Noſtrils. The Veins (ſaith he) do run into the Noſe not from the inner Parts of the brain, but out of the Cavities of the Mouth and Palate, which are wide and open enough, ſo as they ſeem to be the Emiſſaries of ſuperfluovs blood; Even as the Haernorrhoid Veins, and thoſe which belong to the Neck of the Womb. Wherefore the brain being burthened with blood is not eaſed, if the blood flow not from the Cavities of <hi>Dura Mater.</hi> But I beleive it flowes out of the brain. And <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Areteus</hi> do write, that the Veins within the Noſtrils, beneath the Colander-bone, may be opened by Art.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sneezing</hi> may be ſaid to belong unto the Noſtrils, becauſe they being vexed do<note place="margin">Sneezing</note> cauſe Sneezing.

                  <head>The Medicinal Conſideration.</head>
                  <p>The Neck is ſubiect to Similar Diſeaſes ariſing from diſtemper, and to Diſeaſes<note place="margin">Similar Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Neck.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bronchocele</hi> is a Swelling in the Neck, near the <hi>Larynx,</hi> ariſing from an humor collected in that place, or from the Kernel of the <hi>Cartilago Thuroides</hi> being longer than ordinary and producing ſuperfluous fleſh; or it is an Impoſtum proceeding from the Tumor <hi>Atheroma</hi> or <hi>Steatoma,</hi> or it is a Dropſie. <hi>Bronchocele</hi> does not proceed, as many have imagined, from immoderate Clamors and Cryings out, or by drinking of melted Snow, as the faſhion is among the Inhabitants of the Alpes or other high Mountaines; but from thick and clammmy Flegm, which ſlides thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by bittle and little out of the Head and the external Parts thereof, down behind the Eares. Which is the Judgment of <hi>Fernelius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be queſtioned, whether the matter be contained between the <hi>Muſculus latus</hi> and the Skin, or whether it lie al concealed under the <hi>Muſculus Latus.</hi> For if the matter be collected there, it cannot be drawn out, becauſe it is crept in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſpaces of the Muſcles.</p>
                  <p>If it lie outward to the ſight, it may be rooted out and cured. It is wont to begin with a wind, which diſtends and ſeparates the Skin from the Membrana <hi>Carnoſa:</hi> or the <hi>Muſculus Latus</hi> it ſelf, is ſeparated from the Parts which lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Into the which ſpace the matter flows by degrees, which differs according to the various temperament and Conſtitution of the Patients.</p>
                  <p>It grows by little and little, and receives nouriſhment, not by the Veins, but by certain little Pipes which Nature creates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bronchocele</hi> differs very much from the <hi>Kings-Evil-Swellings,</hi> which riſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Kings-Evil</note> the Jaw and in the Neck, of a rounder ſhape, diſtinct one from another, or cluſtered together. They ſpring from a Flegmatick clammy matter, which drenches the Kernels and makes them ſwel; and therefore look where there are Kernels, there the ſwellings ariſe.</p>
                  <p>Scirrhous Tumors have in them ſomwhat of the Nature of the Kings-Evil-Swellings, which makes them ſuſpected. They happen under the Jaws, in the Groins, behind the Ears, and in al Parts of the Body where there are <hi>Glandules</hi> or Kernels. And ſomtimes in certain places of the Body, a portion of Fat grows hard and makes a Scirrhous Tumor and ſomtime the Kings-Evil.</p>
                  <p>The Tumor <hi>Gongroni</hi> is muſtered among the external ſwellings of<note place="margin">Gongrone.</note> the Neck. It is cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Angina</hi> the ſquinſie, is a Tumor of the Neck either internal or external: or an<note place="margin">Squinzie.</note> internal or external inflamation of the Neck.</p>
                  <p>The external is properly called <hi>Synanche,</hi> the Internal is termed <hi>Cynanche. Galen</hi> conceives that this diſtinction of Names is vain and of no uſe in Practice. But I account the ſame neceſſary. For although general Medicines do ſerve for both, yet in <hi>Cynanche</hi> where the Patient can neither fetch breath nor ſpeak, the danger is greater: and therefore Medicines are to be ſpeeded with al haſt poſſible: yea and the Wind-Pipe muſt be opened ere twenty four hours are paſt, that the Patient may by that means receive breath, til ſuch time as the upper Part of the <hi>Larynx</hi> be unſtopped. For in that kind o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Squinſie, where no outward ſwelling appears, the <hi>Larynx</hi> alone is inflamed and obſtructed. In other Squinſies the Circumja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Muſcles of other Parts are affected: In the <hi>Cynanche,</hi> the Fluxion is in the <hi>Arytaenois</hi> and the Glottis, and in other <hi>Muſculous Carnoſities</hi> of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> by which means the paſſage of the <hi>Larynx</hi> is ſtopped, and death follows unvoidably,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49866:84"/>
for though there is ſome little paſſage left for Liquors, yet no man can live without fetching his breath.</p>
                  <p>A Leek thruſt into the Throat, with ſome ſharp biting Powder ſprinkled upon it may do good, as alſo ſome ſtrong drawing Medicine or a Veſicatory applied to the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and Scarifications made here and there about the <hi>Larynx.</hi> Touching the Squinſie, read <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the 27. and 34.

               <p>There is a twofold conſideration of the Teeth; as they are in Infants, til they are two or three years Old, and as they are in perſons of riper years.</p>

               <p>There are two ſeaſons obſerved in which Children are moſt tormented with Tooth-breeding: the one is when they firſt ſprout within the Gum, the other is when they break out of the Gum. And under the Term of Tooth-breeding <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> does in a manner comprehend al Childrens Diſeaſes, becauſe Children are troubled with many Diſeaſes upon that account, ſpringing from the pain of Teeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeding, and bringing them to their Graves.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Perſons grown up</hi> the Teeth are diſtributed into two ranks or <note n="a" place="bottom">T. 14. f. 3. □</note> rows, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">In grown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> to the two Jaws in which they are fixed.

                  <hi>Sciatica</hi> is thereby cauſed, which conſiſts wholly therein; there is a grievous paine, which afflicts not only the Hip, but reaches into the Thigh, the ankle and Foot, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all places whether the Nerve which comes from the diſeaſed Hip does reach. <hi>Fernelius in the 18.

               <p>You ſhal obſerve by the way in a baſtard ſciatica, that thoſe nerves are watered by the Hypogaſtrick veines and the Arteries above the ſame, and therefore the nerves cannot be dried unleſs the Hypogaſtrick veines are emptied, by many times letting blood in the Armes and Feet, and by Horſ-leeches often applied to the Veines of the Fundament.</p>
               <p>Now Galen in the 8 Chap. of his 16. Book of the uſe of the parts of our Body, ſhewes the reaſon why this ſame Nerve is not mixed with other fore nerves as it is in the Nerves of the Arme, but is carried behind the thigh; viz. Becauſe the joynt of the Arme ſtands farther from the Vertebra's of the Neck, than the joynt of the Thigh does from the Vertebra's of the Loines and Os ſacrum.</p>

               <p>Moreover, The external Conformation and Quality of the Bones, is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſcerned in the Bones of a Carkaſs, which loſes much in Bones that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by boyling: as for example, the Griſtly incruſtations of the extremities, the Membrane which is about the Bones, and the Mucous, or ſlimy ſubſtance lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged between the Bones; alſo the internal ſubſtance, or Marrow, or Marrowiſh Juyce, are manifeſtly diſcovered in the Bones of a freſh Body, which are not at all in dry and withered Bones.</p>
               <p>And therefore in reſpect to the Practice of Phyſick, and the Cure of vitiated<note place="margin">For the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Phyſick</note> bones, and ſuch as are broken, or out of Joynt, it is neceſſary, diligently to look into, and carefully to axamine in a dead Body, the Natural Conformation of the Bones, and their conjunction one with another.

               </head>
               <p>IN the firſt place, you ſhal obſerve the Natural Conſtitution of the Bone, that you may diſcern the fault of a bone which is out of Order.</p>
               <p>A bone in a living Body naturally diſpoſed, ought to be, 1. Hard, to procure the bodies ſtability. 2. It ought to be Oyly without, becauſe it is nouriſhed. 3. It muſt be covered with the Perioſtean Membrane, that it may have ſence; for if it loſe the Perioſtium, it becomes ſenceleſs. 4. It muſt be white tinctured with a moderate redneſs, becauſe it is a Spermatick part, and is nouriſhed with the dewy vapor of the blood. 5. It muſt be hollow, or ſpongy, that it may continue the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Marrow, or a Marrowy Liquor to nouriſh it ſelf withal. 6. It muſt be at the ends cruſted with Griſtles 7. It muſt be anointed as it were with an oyly moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, to facilitate its motion. 8. It muſt have a continued and even ſubſtance. And therefore you ſhal know that a Bone is miſaffected, if it be ſoft, as <hi>Ruellius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In what the preternatural.</note> 
                  <hi>Fernelius and Hollerius</hi> have obſerved, that in ſome perſons the Bones of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were by ſickneſs become ſo ſoft and flexible, that you might bend them which way you pleaſed, like wax. Ariſtotle in the third book of his Hiſtory of Animals, ſaies that bones are not flexible, neither are they apt to ſplit, but only ſubject to break. Scaliger in his commentary adds: I have ſeen the thigh bone by reaſon of the venerious diſeaſe, or by uſe of I know not what medicaments, bowed like an horne. Geographers write that in a Country of Ethiopia, the inhabitants have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally from their birth bodies ſo flexible, that they can turne and wind them into any poſture. I have red in Hippocrates of a boy that was borne without bones, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principal parts of his body otherwiſe diſtinct. <hi>Foreſtus</hi> ſaw a boy made after the ſame manner in ſome of his members.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if a bone ſhal be drie without, it declares a diſtemperature of the part: if it be white it argues want of heat, if red, inflammation; if black, rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and blaſting. If a bone be ſenſible, there is ſome ſecret fault in its ſubſtance, or in its perioſtean membrane. If it be ſolid and concrete without cavities or parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it renders the body heavie and ſluggiſh, and can containe no marrow. Plinie relates that there are ſome that lived having ſolid bones and without marrow, which are very rare and are termed Cornei. The ſigne of ſuch a Conſtitution is never to thirſt and never to ſweat. They are called Cornei from the Cornel or Dog-tree; becauſe the male Cornel has no pith or marrow. <hi>See Rhodiginus.</hi> Such a one the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſian Lygdamus</hi> is reported to have been, who in the three and thirteth <hi>Olymp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ade</hi> was the firſt who at the <hi>Olympick Games,</hi> became Victor at all Exerciſes and won the Paneratian Crowne: his bones were found to have no marrow in them, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus relates</hi> in his 4 Chapter. <hi>Antigonus</hi> in his Book of wonders Chap. 8 Writes that the bones of a Lion are ſo ſolid that you may ſtrike fire out of them as out of a flint; Howbeit Columbus denies that ſuch bones are void of marrow. Which Epicurus, contradicting ariſtotle maintaines, as poſſible in the 8. Booke of <hi>Athenaeus</hi> his Deipnoſophiſts. <hi>Aldrovondus</hi> has obſerved that among Fowles the Eſtrich has ſolid bones, void of marrow. But in caſe a bone ſhould be deprived of its Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly Cruſt and of its perioſtean Membrane, it is moved with difficulty, and has no feeling at all. If a bone become uneven and prominent ſo as to have bunches upon it, it is termed Exoſtoſis, which is an effect and concomitant of the venereous pocks when it is of long ſtanding and confirmed, howbeit it may ſpring from ſome other cauſe. Finally being depraued and miſhapen, or diſjointed, it hinders and mars the Action of the whole body or its parts; and being divided in its ſubſtance, it argues ſolution of Continuity by ſome cleft or fracture. and although a broken bone by the mediation of a Callus becomes ſoddered together one the outſide: Yet does it ſtill remaine divided within.</p>

               <p>While the Bone did live and was nouriſhed, it had a twofold ſuſtenance, the one<note place="margin">The remote matter that nouriſhes the Bones.</note> remote, the other conjunct or immediate according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his Book of the parts of live-wights. The remote Suſtenance of the Bones, is the thicker and more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy part of the blood. The next or immediate is the marrow, or marrowy liquor, which is contained in the hollownes and poroſitie of the bones. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his<note place="margin">The immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate matter.</note> Book <hi>de Alimento,</hi> ſaies that the marrow is the Nutriment of the bones, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that they are Joined together or ſoddered up by a callus. How can it be<note place="margin">Whether the Bones have Veines?</note> (may ſome man ſay) that the blood ſhould nouriſh the bones, ſeeing they have no veines, which are the channels to conveigh blood to all parts? <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies in his book <hi>de Oſſium Natura,</hi> that of all the bones, the lower Jaw-bone alone has veines. <hi>Galen</hi> indeed in his 8. Booke <hi>de Placitis,</hi> attributes unto every bone a Veine greater or Leſſer according to the Proportion of the Bones: and in his <hi>Comment upon the firſt Booke of Humors,</hi> he ſaies that there is a Veſſel diſtributing blood allowed to every bone. But he confeſſes in the <hi>laſt chapter of his 16. Booke de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> that the veines of the Bones are ſo ſmall and fine, that thay are not ſo much as viſible in the larger ſort of Animals or Live-wights, becauſe nature according to the Neceſſity and Indigence of the Parts, beſtowes upon ſome greater, upon other leſſer Veines, moreover the little holes which are found about the extremities of the bones,<note place="margin">Whether they have Arteries?</note> do manifeſtly declare that ſomwhat there is which goes into the ſaid Bones now their is nothing goes into the bones but little Veines. If we beleive <hi>Platerus,</hi> the Arteries doe no where enter into the bones, ſeeing the ſpirits can eaſily penetrate<note place="margin">Or Nerves?</note> into any of the bones without the ſervice of the Arteries to carry them. Neither do I conceive that there are little nerves diffuſed through the ſubſtance of the Bones to give them the ſenſe of feeling, becauſe all the feeling they are capable of, is by means of the perioſtean Membrane which does incompaſs them. Nevertheles <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Maſſa</hi> call's God to witnes that he ſaw a Man, who had an ulcer in his thigh, ſo that the bone was bare, in which bone there was a ſence of paine, ſo that he could not endure to have it touched with a rough inſtrument in regard of the paines it cauſed, and it was freed from the perioſtean Membrane. Yea and he bored the bone, and found that it had the ſenſe of feeling within the ſame, which he therefore thought good to declare, that Anatomiſts might be moved to conſider, whether ſome branches of nerves do not Penetrate into the ſubſtance of the bones.<note place="margin">

               <p>We canot looke into the Cavities and Marrowes of the Bones; unles they be firſt broken. I obſerve a threefold Cavity of the bones and a threefold marrow.</p>
               <p>In the greater Cavites of the larger Bones, <hi>the Marrow is reddiſh;</hi> in the leſſer Cavities of the ſmaller bones the <hi>marrow is white;</hi> In the ſpungy bones there is contained a <hi>marrowy Liquor.</hi>

               <p>There does concur to the Articulations of the Bones, the Head, the Cavitie, the Griſtle, the Flegmatic moiſture, and the Ligament.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>Head</hi> is in its owne nature and original an Epiphyſis, but in proceſs of time it degenerates into an apophyſis.</p>

               <p>Now the Head of a Bone is <note n="a" place="bottom">T. 21. f 1. d d. f 4. a. □</note> great and long, or ſhort and flat, which is termed <note n="b" place="bottom">T 21. f 1. &amp; 2. I I. □</note>

Through want of the foreſaid Humor in ſuch as have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and are extreamly dried, while they go and ſtir their Limbs, one may hear as it were their bones knock one againſt another, and rattle in their Skins: As is proved by a memorable Hiſtory, recorded by <hi>Symphorianus Campegius,</hi> in <hi>the Medicinal Hiſtories of</hi> Galen; and as I my ſelf have often times ſeen.</p>
               <p>Now that the bones might be ſo knit together, as to make a Joynt, there is need<note place="margin">A <hi>Ligament.</hi>
                  </note> of a Ligament or Band, whoſe ſubſtance is broad and round, its color white or bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſuch as is the round Ligament which faſtens the <note n="c" place="bottom">T 21. f 7. a a. □</note> Leg, and the <note n="d" place="bottom">T 21. f 8. a □</note> Thigh, and that which unites the <note n="e" place="bottom">T 21. f 5.

                  </p>
                  <p>A ſure thing it is, that the bones being diſeaſed, do drop blood, and <hi>Galen</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as much.</p>
                  <p>The bones are likewiſe ſubject to <hi>Fracture,</hi> or breaking, and Luxation, Diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,<note place="margin">Fracture.</note> or disjoynting. Now a Fracture of a bone, is a Diviſion made in a bone by ſome external Cauſe, cutting, or bruiſing the ſame.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of Fractures, a ſtraight one, and an oblique, or crooked<note place="margin">Its kinds.</note> one. The former is according to the length of the bone, or overthwart.</p>
                  <p>The latter, or oblique is (if we beleeve <hi>Galen</hi>) too curiouſly differenced by the latter Phyſicians which have ſucceeded <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> for it is ſaid to be Nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhioned, when the Fracture is partly ſtraight, and partly circular; another ſort is called <hi>Alphi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Another ſort there is, which is called <hi>Apotrauſis,</hi> or <hi>Detractio,</hi> whereby a Fragment of the bone is ſo taken away, that there remains a mark in the ſurface of the Bone.</p>
                  <p>Another ſort of Fracture, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> mentions, which he cals <hi>Apoclaſma,</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> terms <hi>Hapagma,</hi> when a bone is broken there where it is joyned with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bone.</p>
                  <p>Luxation, or Disjoynting, is a Diſeaſe of the bone in Scituation, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved<note place="margin">Luxation.</note> out of its place.</p>
                  <p>There is a two fold Luxation, or disjoynting of a bone; the one compleat, when the Head of the bone is ſlipt out of its ſocket, and this is called <hi>Exarthrema,</hi> a being out of Joynt.</p>
                  <p>The other is Incompleat, and termed <hi>Pararthrema,</hi> when the bone is in ſome<note place="margin">Its ſorts,</note> meaſure only removed, and lengthened as it were, which is moſtly ſeen in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luxation of the Thigh. In an <hi>Exarthrema,</hi> the Leg ſeems ſhorter than it was wont to be; in a <hi>Pararthrema</hi> it ſeems longer than uſual.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes of Luxation and Subluxation, that is to ſay, of perfect, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect<note place="margin">Cauſes,</note> disjoynting of any Member, are external, or internal: The External are, a blow, a violent diſtorſion, or wrenching, a fall, and extenſion of a Member.

                  <p>Now <hi>Anchyloſis,</hi> is a fault in the Articulation of bones, whereby the Cavity of<note place="margin">Anchyloſis.</note> a bone, which ought to receive the Head of another bone, is filled up; be it what kind of Articulation it may be, either <hi>Enarthroſis, Arthrodia,</hi> or <hi>Gynglymos.</hi> Hereupon the bone thus diſeaſed, either is held bowed in, or remains ſtretched out, and ſtiff.

                  <hi>Chap. 6.</hi> Of the Bones of the Skull.</head>
               <p>HAving diligently conſidered the Articulations, or joyntings of the Bones one<note place="margin">Things to be obſerved prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally.</note> unto another, let us now take notice what is obſervable in every particular bone being freſh, which is not to be ſeen in the Skeleton, or in dried bones. I will proceed from Head to Foot, according as I am wont to do in my Diſſection, and Demonſtration of theſe parts. Now my Demonſtration of the bones is two-fold; the one I call <hi>Oſteotome,</hi> or Bone-Diſſection, in which the bones are ſeparated each from other; the other I term <hi>Oſſifragium,</hi> in which the bones are broken, that their inner ſtructure may be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt place, let us contemplate the two-fold Table of the Skull, or<note place="margin">Two-fold plate.</note> the double Skul-board which is thinner in Women, than it is in Men.</p>
               <p>The uppermore is thicker, and harder, and more ſmoothly poliſhed than the neather: but the lower is rough and furrowed as it were, that it might afford place for thoſe Veſſels which creep along the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> from which ſome notable Veſſels ariſe, which by the Ears do inſinuate themſelves between thoſe two plates, or boards of the Skull, for to irrigate the intermediate ſpace.</p>
               <p>Now that ſame intermediate ſpace, is a certain ſpongy Subſtance, which receives<note place="margin">Intermediate ſpace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and contains a Marrowy Juyce, ſerving for the nutriment of thoſe bones. The which Marrowy Juyce is reddiſh, by reaſon of blood flowing out of the ſmal Veins ſcituate in thoſe parts; which is wont <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hen to flow out when the Skul of a living man is boared through with a Wimble, or other boaring Inſtrument. Now the Skull, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book <hi>de Vulneribus Capitis,</hi> is double in the<note place="margin">Why the Skull is double?</note> middle of the Head, that is to ſay, hollow between two plates and boards, that it might contain a Marrowy Juyce to nouriſh the bones. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adds, The whol Head, a ſmal part excepted, reſembles a ſpunge ful of ſmal Caruncles, or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bits of fleſh, which if you preſs, and ſqueeze with your finger, you ſhal perceive blood to drop out of them: alſo you ſhal ſee ſmal Veins running up and down, which abound with blood.</p>
               <p>Out of the foreſaid Caruncles, being bruiſed with a vehement blow, the blood is ſqueezed, which putrifying, does corrupt the bone, which in the mean while ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſound on the out ſide: but the Sanies ſweating out from the inner plate or Skul-board, does corrupt and putre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Touching the Fungous Excreſcences of the brain, whether they are bred from the broken bone, or from the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> ſee <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> in the firſt Book of his Practice.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Caruncles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are vainly ſought for in this intermediate ſpace, whatever <hi>Fallopius</hi> pleads to the contrary in his Book of the Wounds of the Head, unleſs a man would call the pungy ſubſtance of the bones <hi>Sarcia,</hi> or Caruncles, in regard of their Function.</p>

The entrance of the Maſtoidean Cavity, is contained in the left ſide of the <hi>Concha,</hi> neer the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſis Maſtoides, and cannot be ſeen unleſs the arched Vault of the <hi>Concha</hi> be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or the porus auditorius pulled in peices.</p>

                  <hi>Sylvius</hi> conceives and demonſtrates from Galen that flegm being tranſmitted through the little holes of the upper plate, is collected and heaped up within the<note place="margin">Whether flegm may be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the Cavity of the Sphenoides.</note> 
                  <hi>Sphenoidean</hi> cavity, and thence conveighed into the Palate: which way of the paſſage of Excrements, is by <hi>Veſalius, Columbus, Falopius,</hi> and <hi>Valverda</hi> rejected: who contradict <hi>Galen</hi> in this point, and maintain that this excrement is voided through the neighbouring holes which reſt upon the <hi>Sella Sphenoidea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of <hi>Gallen</hi> and Sylvius is, that it is better the excrements ſhould be ſtrained, and kept up for a ſeaſon in thoſe Cavities, than that a man ſhould be continually ſpitting, and holding his mouth evermore open. For although the Sphenoidean Cavities, are in the diſſections of dead bodies empty, and appear not to be ful either of flegm or ſeroſities: probable notwithſtanding it is, that the ſerous humor which flowes and diſtils out of the Choana, through the ſive-like plate of the Sella equina, is tranſcolated into the Cavities which are beneath, and from them powred back by certaine oval and ſufficiently wide Holes, and voided forth into the ſpungy bones of the Noſtrils: neither do they deny, that a part of the ſeroſities, does ſweat through the poroſities of the inferior table or plate, into the palate. But the ſerous humor received in the ſpungy bones of the Noſtrils, does by little and little ſweat out and paſs away, when by its quantity or quality, it provokes nature to an exctetion. For to what purpoſe think you has Nature fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">The uſe of the ſinus Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noides.</note> thoſe cavities? Has ſhe done it to make the ſcul ſo much the lighter? or that they might be conduit heads or ſtorehouſes of aire, which is of neceſſity breathed in, for the Generation of animal ſpirits? But they cannot be ſtorehouſes, becauſe they are a fingers breadth diſtant from the frontal Cavities, nor have they any conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation or conjunction with them. Againe the Aire which is required to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding pure, would be defiled by paſſing to and fro through the ſpungy bones. Furthermore in the many dead bodies which I have diſſected, ſome of which might be ſnotty and flegmatick, I never found the mammillary Proceſſes any larger than uſuall. But by thoſe paſſages flegm ought to be derived unto the <hi>Os Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moides</hi> or Colander Bone; or fluctuating unto the Baſis of the brain, it ought of its own accord to flow unto that place, becauſe the foremoſt Ventricles of the Braine, are ſeldom perforated before, ſo as to have a through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fare into the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I conceive that al the ſnot and flegm of the noſtrils is not ſtraind<note place="margin">By what waies the flegm of the noſe paſſes?</note> through the Colander Bone, but that it flows down into the Palate through the four pipes or channels of the Choana, or that being collected in the Cavities of <hi>Os-Sphenoides,</hi> if it paſs through the little holes of the Plate of <hi>Os Sphenoides,</hi> it may be derived into the Spungy bones of the Noſtrills.</p>

               <p>Howbeit <hi>Hieronymus Magius in his ſift Book de Exuſtione Mundi,</hi> relates that <hi>Adrianus</hi> learned experimentally of <hi>Rabbi Joſhua Ben Anime,</hi> that the foreſaid Bone is one of the Vertebra's of the Back.</p>
               <p>For he found in the Back bone, one bone that a milſtoneturning upon it would not breake, the fire could not burne it, the water would not diſſolve it, and at laſt being layed upon an Anvil and ſmitten with a ſledge or ſmiths-hammer, it was ſo

far from being broken in the leaſt, that the Anvil was crackt and the ſledge broken the Bone receiveing in the meane while no detriment. Which is as falſe as falſe can be. For all the Vertebrae, may be broken in peices, burnt and reduced to aſhes.</p>
               <p>Whence we may judge what credit is to be given to the Cabaliſts, who in things manifeſt, do ſo impudently mock and abuſe us.</p>
               <p>If Ariſtotle had obſerved the ſtructure of the eleventh or twelfth vertebras, he<note place="margin">The ſtructure of the Loines</note> would not have written in his third Book <hi>de part Anima,</hi> That the Back is fleſhy, but the Loines without fleſh, becauſe the Bending-places of al parts are voide of fleſh.</p>
               <p>But the Loines are more fleſhy than the Back. But the Articulation of the twelfth vertebra is different from al the reſt, being the Cauſe of all Motion which is performed thereupon, for both above and beneath, it receives, and is not received, as is obſerved, in other Articulations of the Vertebrae.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Nubienſian Arabick Geographie</hi> mentions a tailed Nation, in an Iſland of the Eaſtern ſeas which is called Namaneg. Page 70. I ſuppoſe that it is but a fable which Hiſtorians relate touching the <hi>Kentiſh-long-tailes</hi> in England, how that God to revenge the Injury done to <hi>Tho.

               <p>When the Crupper-bone ſuffers a Luxation inwards, a man cannot (according to <hi>Avicen</hi>) draw his Ankles, towards his buttocks, neither can he bend his Hams, which is confirmed by the Experience of <hi>Ambroſius Pareus.</hi> This Impediment is cauſed by compreſſion of a very thick nerve ſeated on the hind-ſide of the Leg, which creeps along neare the Crupper-bone.

               <p>Before the fiſtula oſſea be cut off to diſcover the ſpinal marrow: a few things are to be premiſed touching the natural conſtitution of the ſpinal marrow, and the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the Nerves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spinal Marrow</hi> ſprings from the Braine and pettie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>braine, and though it<note place="margin">The Naturall conſtitution of the ſpinal mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> appeare like the marrow of the Braine, yet is it in ſome things unlike, becauſe ſofter and beſides its two membranes propagated from the Menings, wherewith it is infol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is incompaſſed with a third membrane ſtrong and nervous, which hinders the ſpinal marrow from bruiſeing or breaking, when we ſtoop or any waies bend our Backs. I am not certaine whether or no, that ſame membrane which is propagated from the Craſſa Meninx have any pulſation: nor whether the ſpinal marrow be divided into two cavities according to the length of the back-bone as far as the loines.</p>
               <p>Certaine it is, that the ſpinal <note n="a" place="bottom">T. 18. f. 5. A. □</note> marrow deſcending by the <note n="b" place="bottom">T. 2. f. 2. a. &amp;c. □</note>

               <p>For when the Actions of the Hand and arme are forwards, the ſhoulder would eaſily be unjointed, unleſs it were retained by the coracoides: and therefore the laxation of the ſhoulder is ſeldome towards the fore part; <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did obſerve it once, and <hi>Galen</hi> ſaw it five times at Roome, as himſelf relates in <hi>his comment: ad Part. 4.

               </p>
               <p>From this place we may gather &amp; fiſh out the Interpretation of an obſcure paſſage in <hi>Cornelius Celſus,</hi> in his <hi>eighth Book Againe from the Neck two broad bones on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand doe goe vnto the Scapulae, our Countrymen call them Scoptula operta, the Greeks terme them omoplatas, Celſus</hi> cals them <hi>Scopula operta,</hi> becauſe they ſtick out<note place="margin">By Celſus.</note> like boughs of Trees, and are ſcituate in the upper part of the Cheſt.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49866:123"/>
by ſo much the Cheſt is larger. And therefore <hi>Foreſtus</hi> his wives Mother, would not marry her daughters to broad breſted and broad ſhouldered Men: for ſhe was afraid leaſt they ſhould die in their travil by reaſon of the largneſs of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which <hi>Foreſtus</hi> ſaies he had often ſeen come to paſs in the 70 Obſervation of his 28.

               <p>The Cauſe of this is as hard to aſſigne as of another inconvenience, with which<note place="margin">Why french maidens have their right ſhoulder higher than the left?</note> the young maides of <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially the Gentry are infeſted: Whoſe right ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is frequently higher and fuller than their left: ſo that among an hundred virgins you ſhal hardly find ten that have wel proportioned ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>Whether it is cauſed by the more frequent and ſtronger motion of the right arme, whereby the ſhoulder blade in widened, and raiſed up, by meanes of the interjacent muſcles lifting themſelves up. Ad thereunto that in perſons that are growen up; their right ſhoulder is more heavy than there left, if we beleeve <hi>Amatus Luſitanus in the laſt Cure of his 4 Centure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why is the right Hand ſtronger than the left? and why are there ſo few Ambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexters<note place="margin">Why ſo few that can uſe both hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like?</note> that can uſe both hands alike?

               <p>Is it becauſe Mothers would maketheire daughters low ſhoulderd while they ſtudy to make them ſmal and waſpe-waſted?

It hangs over another, that it might forme that cavity, which is in the inner part of the wriſt, and to this bone the Muſcle Cubiteus flex or carpi does adhere.</p>
               <p>The three wriſtbones of the firſt order, being joyned together, do make a cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Their Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> which receives two Bones of the ſecond order, which being joyned one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, do make the joints Head: whence you may know that the firſt order is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely moved with the ſecond, and that <hi rend="sup">c</hi> the articulation is by way of Arthrodia, and in a dead body, having taken away the tendons, you may diſcover this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  </gap>nd the Patella to the hard fat which is palced beneath.</p>
               <p>The office of this bone, is to defend the joint to guard the bowing and bending of the Part, and to render the motion more facil: for it hinders the extenſion of the leg from paſſing out of a right line; and when we ſit with our knees bent, it keepes the thigh from luxation forward.

               <p>And he goes not much from the ſame opinion in <hi>his Anatomy,</hi> where he ſaies it performes the ſame office in the knee, which the Seſemoidean bones do in other joints.</p>

               <p>And therefore by how much thicker the Bones are, by ſo much the more noriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the longer time they require to be ſoddered together; to that ſuppoſe the Noſe-bone require ten parts of nutriment, and the Noſe being broken ſhall need ten daies time to grow together: the Aliment of the ribs, Jawbone and Jugular, (which are twice as thick) muſt be double in quantity, and they ſhall require tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And the Cubit-bone, becauſe it is thrice as thick as the Noſe-bone, therefore it will need thrice as much nutriment, and thrice as long time to grow together.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Brachium</hi> becauſe they are four times as thick as the Noſe-bone, will require four times as much nutriment and four times longer ſpace to grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

               <p>But if you are not minded to breake the bones, but deſire to preſerve and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare<note place="margin">Two parts of this works.</note> them for a ſceleton. You ſhal obſerve that there are two things required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; firſt the purifieing and clenſing of the bones, ſecondly their apt uniting and faſtening together, which may be termed Sceleto-paeia.<note place="margin">The Clenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bones.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As for what concerns the clenſing of Bones, Scaliger in his Exercitations obſerves, that the ſtone termed Sarcophagus does in a ſhort ſpace eat off and conſume the fleſh from the Bones. And ſo the bones remaine bare and naked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pauſanias in Eliacis</hi> relates that the Divel <hi>Eurynymus</hi> eates off the fleſh of dead People, ſo as nothing but the bones remaine.</p>
               <p>The Jewes imagine that there is an internal Divel named Azazel; who in Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus is named Princeps deſertorum, and eates and devoures the fleſh of the dead, leaveing only the bones behind.</p>
               <p>But we are not wont to uſe the ſtone ſarcophagus, becauſe we have it not; neither are we acquainted with its operations. Neither do we uſe the aſſiſtance of the Divel <hi>Eurynomus,</hi> becauſe we defie and execrate thoſe wicked ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Wherefore haveing cut the Bones one from another and taken their fleſh off, you ſhal caſt them into a large Kettle or Caldron, except the Breſt-bone, the Hyoides, and Coccyx. Then fil the Caldron with ſcalding water, ſo as to cover all the Bones and ſet them on the fire and boile them foure or five houres.</p>
               <p>You ſhal be careful while they are boiling that no bone ſtick out, ſo as to be fainted by the ſmoak.</p>
               <p>Alſo you ſhal ever and anon take off the ſcum and fat which ſwims aloft, that the Bones may be the more neat and cleane.</p>
               <p>Which that it may be more effectually performed, you ſhal perce the larger bones that are ful of Marrow, in the Head with an Awle that all the ſuperfluous marrow may flow and ſoake out.</p>
               <p>You may throw away the firſt water and boile them in a ſecond, that all the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may be drawn forth.</p>
               <p>Then take them out while the water is hot (for if it be cold they wil be greaſie) and ſcrape and clenſe them with a ſmal knife.</p>
               <p>Some, while they are boyling, throw in a pound of Lime or Chalke, to make them the whiter, but this eates off the Epiphyſies and the Griſtles which do cruſt the extremities of the Bones; which you muſt take heed you pul not away, when you ſcrape the Bones.</p>
               <p>Then you ſhal put the Bones againe into moſt pure water boiling hot, and boile them for an houre, that all the marrow and fat may be ſeparate and exhauſted. After that caſt them into cold water, and take them out and wipe and rub them wel with courſe linnen cloaths.</p>
               <p>When the Bones are thus prepared, many lay them two or three moneths in the open aire to bleach and grow white. Others put them into a wooden caſe, bored ful of holes and hang them in a running brooke, or in the ſtreames of a ſwift River, that the rubbing of the ſtreame may whiten them.</p>
               <p>I had rather lay them under the falling of a Mil-ſtream for the ſpace of ten or twelve daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellonius in his Book de Admirandis,</hi> relates that he ſaw in the ſhoare of <hi>Bononia</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> an inumerable company of exceeding white bones of Bodies which had been drownd and caſt out upon the ſhore haveing been buried in the Sea ſand. He ſaw the like by the Red-ſea, ſo that the bones ſo prepared, and ſticking and growing together by their nerves and Ligaments, are exceeding neate, and cleane and whiter then Snow. Such as were thoſe two Sceletons which <hi>Galen</hi> had to ſerve him in Anatomy. <hi>Bellonius</hi> obſerves in the ſame place, that dead bodies are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:49866:127"/>
from corruption if they be anointed with the Balme that drops out of Cedar trees; alſo that bones moiſtened with the ſame juice remaine uncorrupted.</p>
               <p>The Bones accurately clenſed and dried, you ſhal preſerve in a Cheſt, or you may faſten them together with braſs-wire, and ſo keep them ſtanding in a Caſe. It is needful that you have bones both waies, viz. ſingle and united. And the truth is, as <hi>Veſalius</hi> has rightly obſerved, the Bones united ſerve more for oſtentation than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>Moreover by long boileing, firſt in water, and then in oile, al the Bones of the<note place="margin">The manner of faſtening the Bones to make a Skeleton.</note> Head and of the upper jawbone are eaſily ſeparated, as I have often obſerved: and by this meanes you may have them ſevered one from another, that you may view and meaſure the ſize and dimentions of every one. The manner of faſtening the bones together, depends either upon the Induſtry of the Artiſt; or it is done by imitation of another Sceleton neatly compoſed. You may read more of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in <hi>Veſalius and Columbus.</hi> Alſo <hi>Carolus Stephanus,</hi> has noted ſome things upon thoſe Authors, worthy of Conſideration.</p>
