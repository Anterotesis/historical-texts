            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Secondly, the forme of our Church gouernment, which imposeth a submitting of our labours, to the censure and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of those, to whom by right that charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth; wherein seeing your authoritie and care, next vnto our dread Soueraigne, is, and is to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed greatest, I desire you to vouchsafe to giue that allowance, which your Grace in your wisdome shall thinke fit. The last reason, is the person of him, who (whilest he liued) was aduanced, honoured, and esteemed by you; and now being dead, his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and sinceritie, against the false accusations of others, challengeth a defence at your Graces

This as reason, euer expecteth at the hands of vertue; so especially then, when men of worth, of desert, of learning, are mistaken and accused, by those that doe want all. I craue to the rest of all your Graces fauours, that this last may be added; That whatsoeuer my imperfections are, in this iust and temperate Defence, they may no way diminish the honourable remembrance of him, whom I doe defend: all allowance is his due; the faults are mine; for which in all humilitie, I craue pardon.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing we are all bound, in the dutifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of a common iust cause, euen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend those who are strangers to vs; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not seeme vnfit to any, if we affoord the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so much fauour, whose persons, and deserts are verie well knowne. There is no better contentment for our labour past, then in the assurance from our conscience, that it is well imployed: for doubtlesse the spurning at vertue, giueth a greater stroke to the doer, then to him that suffereth; &amp; yet euen that religion, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth patience, forbiddeth not the iust defence of our selues in a good cause; especially then, when by wronging a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, there may be some hazard of the truth it selfe. Our Church hath had some enemies, more openly discontent in the case of Discipline, then they now appeare; whom to satisfie with reason, Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> indeuoured with much paines; that which might haue contented all, was in diuers, a spurre to a more violent choler: for medicines how profitable soeuer, worke not equally in all humours. From hence proceeded a desire in some, to make question of things, whereof there was no doubt, and a request for resolution, of some points, where in there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: to this end a Letter (which heere is answered) was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by certaine Protestants (as they tearme themselues) which I heare (how true I know not) is translated into other tongues; this they presume hath giuen that wound, to that reuerend and learned man, that it was not the least cause to procure his death. But it is farre otherwise; for he contemned it in his wisdome (as it was fit) and yet in his humilitie would haue answered it, if he had liued. Surely for mine owne part, I neuer thought it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb facs="tcp:21624:4"/>
that the grauity of this present businesse, and the reuerend worthinesse of him that is accused, should not be answered with grauitie both of person and speech; and my witnesses are both in heauen and earth, how iustly I can excuse my selfe, as <hi>Elihu</hi> did: <hi>Behold, I did wait vpon the word of the ancient, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened for their knowledge:</hi>

               <hi>I stayed the time,</hi> and a long time, vntill some elder and of viper iudgement, might haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited me from all opinion of presumption in this cause; which being not done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom many reasons might haue induced to this Defence, I could not for that part which I beare in that Church, whose gouernment was defended by Maister <hi>Hooker,</hi> with patience endure so weake a Letter anie longer to remaine vnanswered. And herein I haue dealt as with men (although to me vnknown) of some learning and grauitie, to whom peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in manie respects I am farre inferiour; and yet for anie thing that I know, or appeareth in this Letter, they may bee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the same infirmities that I am.

               </gap>s malice, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie doth seeke to hide them. Fewe things are eminently good, which are indured amongst distempered iudgements without bitter reprehension; for where weakenesse hath not strength enough to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and reuerence that vertue which it feareth; it hath violence and malice sufficient to detract from that vertue which it hateth. Amongst euill persons, as there be fewe things that are good, in themselues; so there be not manie things which they are willing should appeare good in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for vertue, where it is not followed, must either be dispraised, or our negligence shall want excuse. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer hath the power to conuince, must suffer reproofe, where the heart of man wanteth humilitie to giue obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The worlds greatest errour, is in esteeming, when our corruptions making vs ambitious to seeme, whilest we are carelesse to be, winneth allowance from a fond opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the streame of violent fancies, denieth to rest vpon those that are truly vertuous. Because for anie man to oppose himselfe, against that euill which is growne heady, either by custome, or patience, is to hazard much of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, if he be strong; and in the opinion of many vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly to perish, if he be weake. And therefore as vice hath
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21624:5"/>
euer had mo that did dislike it, then durst dispraise it; so vertue wil euer haue mo that are willing to allow it in their iudgements, then dare aduenture to interpose themselues, for the defence of that which they do allow. <hi>Iealousie</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king those to depraue, euen the very defence of that, which their owne iudgements did thinke worthy, and their wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes desired, might be defended. For to do that which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man accounteth his own duty, as it argueth oftentimes more strength then courage; so amongst many, it reapeth little else but an opinion of singularitie. From this corrupt fountaine (a fountaine poisoned by malicious ignorance) haue flowed these bitter, but small streames, which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of some mens commendations (arising out of a blind loue) haue made for power and greatnesse, like the red sea, to drown (as they say) <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his host. Let them perish in it without helpe, beaten downe with that hand, that striketh from aboue, who seeke to hold <hi>Israel</hi> a seruant in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or captiue in the house of bondage: but let them passe through without harme, who couragiously haue freed the posterity of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and led <hi>Israel</hi> to the land of promise. I doubt not but without a miracle, a man of small stature may goe through these waters and not bee drowned; yet sometimes the most righteous, may say with <hi>Dauid,</hi> the ouerflowing of vngodlinesse made me afraid. Deceit vsually couereth with a mask (better then the face) that euill which it desireth should kill vnseene and vnpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented: but errour cannot more easily fall, then when it is built vpon such a foundation; nor weaker opinions sooner vanish, then when they are bred, nourished, &amp; supported, onely with the strength of fancie. It is of small vse in the church (though a thing practised in al ages) for men ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiously to labour to remoue those staines, which like an impure breath, darken the glasse of steele, whilest it is warme, but slide off through their owne weakenesse, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no power to make any deeper impression, then onely aire. Any cloth in a hand of no skill, or <hi>strength,</hi> is able to wipe off, with ease, those blots, or marks, that are stained
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21624:5"/>
with no greater force, or vertue, but a hote breath. But seeing the reputation that vertue challengeth, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious labour seasoned with discretion doth merit, seeketh rather to gaine an approbation, from the iudgement of the wise, then recompence or reward, from the mightie hand of the rich; men of vertuous desert in all ages (euen from the lowest step of humilitie &amp; obedience) haue with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and truth, taught the world a far better iudgment, by their wise apologies; and haue gained as much honour in remouing euill, as they haue gotten vertue vnto their names, in doing wel. The malice of enuie out of impatient ignorance, doing vertue this benefit, that that which was cleare before, by a few, light, trifling spots, gaineth a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, to make it clearer. <hi>desert</hi> and <hi>goodnesse,</hi> being effects of a first motion; <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>excellencie</hi> the worke of a second maker. It must needs seeme strange to many, and be vnpleasing to all, that are of any sober, indifferent, or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous disposition, that the iust defence of a present, religious, <hi>Ecclesiasticall policie,</hi> vndertaken without bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of spirit, in a graue moderation to reforme presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and informe ignorance, should so farre taste, of the eagernesse of some vnlearned pennes; that iudgement, should be thought too weake, to answer idle wordes; or vertue not strong enough to withstand malice; or lastly, that he could want a defence, whose endeuour (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe professeth) was not so much to ouerthrow them, with whom he contended, as to yeeld them iust, and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble causes, of those things, which for want of due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, heretofore they haue misconceiued; sometimes accusing lawes, for mens ouersights; sometimes imputing euils growne, through personall defects, to that which is not euill; framing to some sores vnwholsome plaisters; and applying remedies sometimes where no sores were. It is much easier to answer those shadowes of reason, wherein these <hi>Admonishers</hi> do please themselues; then by their silence to make them confesse, that they are fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. For as they know not (for the most part) well how
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21624:6"/>
to speake, sauing only tinkers musick, like sounding brasse, because they want charitie; so do they lesse know how to hold their peace, like clamorous Frogs, because they want humilitie. Holy pretences haue euer beene the strongest motiues that pride hath; and Zeale, how preposterous and ignorant so euer, hath beene deemed reason sufficient to some men, in the opinion of their followers, to warrant &amp; defend whatsoeuer they haue done. Vpon this ground, was published, some few Articles in manner of a letter, in the yeare 1599. requiring resolution in matters of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, concerning some points, which either they miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, or list not to vnderstand, vttered by M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> in those fiue learned, and graue books of <hi>Ecclesiasticall policie</hi>; wherin, it must needs appeare, that their ignorant malice, hath done him great honour; who in an argument so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasted by them, and comming with a proud confidence to reprehend, haue only carped sillily, at some few things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of moment, nor importance, whereof humilitie, and charitie, would haue craued no answer. But these being willing, and desirous, to find somewhat to oppose, haue onely discouered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his great, mature, and graue iudgement, and their owne small, vndigested, and shallow learning. For there is nothing, that can better, both excuse, and commend a workman, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to see enuie desirous to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and reprehension to vanish in his owne smoke. For (saith the Wiseman) <note n="*" place="margin">Wisd. 10.8.</note> all such as regarded not wisedome, had not onely this hurt, that they knew not the things that were good, but also left behind them, vnto men a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of their foolishnesse; so that in the things wherein they sinned, they could not lie hid; yet the people see and vnderstand it not, and consider no such things, in their hearts, <note n="*" place="margin">Wis. 4.15.</note> how that grace and mercie is vpon his Saints, and his prouidence ouer the elect. For as he himselfe well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as to the best, and wisest (while they liue) the world is continually a froward opposite, a curious obseruer of their defects, and imperfections; so their vertues, it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as much admireth. Those, whom we must make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21624:6"/>
in this cause, are men, not knowne either by name, religion or learning; yet such as would seem, in zeale to the present state, to desire a resolution in some points that might otherwise giue offence. It may be peraduenture the worke of some one, who desirous to gaine an opinion amongst his followers, vndertaketh to speake as from the minds of many, hoping those demaunds (how idle soeuer) will gaine answer, being to satisfie a multitude, which no doubt M. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his wisdome, patience, and grauity, would easily haue contemned, if they had but beene the priuate cauils, and obiections of some one. For there is no man but thinketh, <hi>manie,</hi> how light so euer, in themselues, being vnited, may haue that weight, to chalenge euen by a ciuill right, a direct answer, from one euerie way farre better then had beene fitting, for their modestie, &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to prouoke. Well; whosoeuer they are, as I cannot easily coniecture, so I am not curious to knowe; this age hath affoorded an infinite number, whom superstitious feare, for want of true vnderstanding, and an ignorant zeale, not directed with discretion, haue made violent in matters of Religion, vsing the razor in steed of a knife, and for hatred of tares oftentimes pulling vp good corne. But with these we will deale, with that temperate moderation, as may serue, to giue true worthinesse, a iust defence; and impatient and furious spirits (vnlesse desperately violent) no iust cause to find themselues to be grieued with vs.</p>
            <p>This which wee are to answer, is tearmed by them, <hi>A Christian letter of certaine English Protestants,</hi>

thing that I know; that is, men outwardly of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion; who liue and professe a doctrine, for the most part opposite to the Church of Rome; but I can hardly be perswaded, that the Letter being wholy an vnciuill Ironie, is either <hi>Christian,</hi> or that themselues, are vnfained fauourers of the present state of religion; or that they thinke <hi>M.

               </note> there are few errours more dangerous, or that haue stirred vp greater tragedies in the church of God.

Out of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, together with the rash presumption of ignorant men, haue proceeded those dangerous errours, that so long, and so hotly haue troubled the church; thus the <hi>Manichies</hi> haue denied the vnitie of Essence; the <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians</hi> (or <hi>Gnostici</hi>) from <hi>Carpocrates,</hi>

Those that haue in their erronious doctrine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned the Trinitie, are of two sorts; they haue either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the distinction of persons, or else the samenesse of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; thus the Arrians (for we will not stand to incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or confute all other heresies) held that Christ was a person before his incarnation, but that he was true, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall God, equall, and of the same essence, with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they denied; for they hold that the Sonne is not eternally begotten, of the substance of his Father, and so that there is an inequalitie, and indeed a distinction, and prioritie of essence. Into this dangerous, and ignorant blind heresie, confuted long since with powerfull and strong reasons, it seemes you are of opinion that Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> is fallen, both against the truth, and against the true assertions, of the Reuerend Fathers of our church. The ground of this so great and so vncharitable accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is because he saith, that the Father alone, is originally that Deitie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Pag.</hi> 113.</note> which <hi>Christ originally</hi> is not. Where you seem to inferre, against the distinction of the Trinitie, that the Godhead of the Father, and the Sonne cannot bee all one, if the Sonne be not originally that Deitie. It seemes then in your opinions, that this speech vttered verie learnedly, and with great wisedome, and truth; <hi>The Father alone is originally that Deitie which Christ originally is not,</hi> is both vnusuall, new, and dangerous. First, because it weakeneth the eternitie of the Sonne, in the opinion of the simple, or maketh the Sonne inferiour to the Father in respect of the Godhead, or else teacheth the ignorant that there may be many Gods. I know your owne Christian iudgements,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21624:12"/>
could easily haue freed him from all suspicion of error in this point; if your charity had bin equall to your vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: for he himselfe hath confessed in the very same place, from whence you haue taken this, wherof you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him; that by the gift of eternall generation, <hi>Christ</hi> hath receiued of the father, one and in number the selfe same substance; which the father hath of himselfe vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from any other.

               </note> and Son, shew not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities of natures, but the relation of persons; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son is not of another nature and of a diuers sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, because the father is God, not from another God, but the Son is God from God his father: heere is not declared the substance but the originall;<note place="margin">

               </note> that is, not what he is, but from whence he is, or is not; for in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in God the Son, if we inquire the nature of them both, both are God, and but one God, neither grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or lesse in essence of Godhead, one then the other. But if we speake of the originall, saith Saint <hi>Austin</hi> (which you see Master <hi>Hooker</hi> did) the Father is God originally, from whom the Son is God; but there is not from whom the Father hath originally his deity; so that to mislike this kinde of speech, is contrary to all truth, to affirme, that the Son is not eternally begotten of the father, &amp; that the Father is not eternally a deity begetting. But heere you must take heede of the errour of <hi>Arrius,</hi> who against the truth reasoned thus; If the Sonne be coeternall with his Father, tell vs, we beseech you, whether he were begotten when he was, or when he was not; if when he was, then there was before two vnbegotten, and afterwards one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the other; if when he was not, then he must needes be later, and after his Father. But saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> as we haue knowne onely the Father, alwayes and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be vnbegotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; so we confesse, the Son alwaies, and without beginning to bee begotten of his Father: therefore because the Father, is originally that Deitie, from whence the Sonne is the Sonne; though hee be the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21624:13"/>
same Deity, yet the Father alone, is originally that Deitie, which the Sonne originally is not: The want of Identitie being not in the Deitie (whereof we must needes with the Church of God acknowledge an Vnitie) but in that it is not originally the same. For euery thing that is a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is a father vnto that which commeth of it, and euery ofspring is a sonne vnto that out of which it groweth. <hi>Christ</hi> then being God, by being of God, light by issuing out of light, though he be the same deity (for in the Trinitie there is but one deity) yet the Father is originally that dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alone, which <hi>Christ</hi> originally is not. Here if you note but the difference betwixt that <hi>Deity,</hi> and <hi>originally that Deity,</hi> you must needs confesse that M. <hi>Hooker</hi> speaketh, with the consent of reformed antiquitie, and hath said nothing to diminish the eternitie of the Sonne, or to make him infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, in respect of his Father; or to teach the ignorant, that there be manie Gods.</p>

What then hath Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> said; which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> said not long since? neither of them disprouing the thing, but both denying the expresse literall mention of the word; which I persuade my self your selues are neuer able to find.</p>
            <p>Now for the proceeding of the holy Ghost, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage, as you say, expresse words: <hi>When the Comforter shall come, whom I will send vnto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the Father, euen the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh 15.26.</note> 
               <hi>which proceedeth of the Father</hi>: Out of this place (as you thinke) you haue sufficiently proued, the expresse literal mention of this point; we conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not with you, nor with any, whether the truth of this point may directly be warranted by holy scripture, but whether there be, as you say, expresse literal mention. First then we call that expresse literal mention, which is set down in plaine tearmes, &amp; not inferred by way of consequence: that it is so in this point we haue some reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doubt, vntil out of your great obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, you confirme it by more plaine and apparant Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For against this place (which is but one) which you haue alleaged, we take this twofold exception; as thereby accounting it insufficient, to proue as you would haue it, that there is expresse literall mention of the proceeding, of the Spirit from the Father and the Son. For first, in that place alleaged out of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> there is no mention at all of proceeding from the Sonne. Secondly, as Maister <hi>Beza</hi> (whose authority you will not denie) doth expound the place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In comment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Iohan.</hi> 15 26</note> Christ speaketh not of the essence of the holy Ghost in himselfe, but of the vertue and power of the holy Ghost in vs: neither doth his interpretation (which wee
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21624:14"/>
will not examine at this time) any way preiudice the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that truth, which our Church doth hold. For the Deitie of the holie Ghost proceeding from the Father, and the Sonne, though not by any expresse literall mention, yet may easily be proued by infinite places of Scripture, and other infallible demonstrations besides this. In the dayes of <hi>Liberius</hi> the Pope, and of <hi>Constantius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, certaine fantasticall spirits held, that the holy Ghost was not God; but onely the ministeriall instrument of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine working: This began vnder <hi>Arrius,</hi> and increased by <hi>Eunomius,</hi> a leprous heretike, but a subtill Logitian; whom the Church hath strongly confuted, with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments impossible to be answered.<note place="margin">Psal. 126. 1. Corinth. 2 Iam. 1. Matt. 28.</note> As first, that the holy Ghost is euerie where; to giue all things: to know and search all things; that we are commanded to baptise in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost: besides the greatnesse of the sinne against the holy Ghost:<note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> So <hi>Ananias</hi> that lyed, as <hi>Peter</hi> said, to the holy Ghost, lyed not to man, but to God. These and many such places, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted those ancient Councels, to conclude the Deitie of the holy Ghost, equall to the Father and the Sonne; and equally proceeding from both. As first the Councell of Constantinople,<note place="margin">About the yeare 381.</note> consisting of an hundreth and fiftie Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, vnder <hi>Theodosius</hi> the elder, and <hi>Damasus</hi> the Pope, which condemned the heresie of the Macedonians. The same faith was confirmed by the Councell of Ephesus; the Councell of Chalcedon;<note place="margin">430.451.</note> the Councell of Lateran, vnder <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, and diuers others. And <hi>Athanasius</hi> himselfe maketh it most plaine, that the Father is of none, either made, created, or begotten: the Sonne is of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone, not made, nor created, but begotten: the holy Ghost is from the Father, and the Sonne, not made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding. In this, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first, or last, greater, or lesse; but all the three persons, coeternall and coequall. The proceeding of the holy Ghost (as the Schoolemen obserue) is threefold; one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable and eternal, whereby the holy Ghost eternally;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21624:15"/>
and without time, proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne; the other temporall, when he is sent from the Father, and the Son, to sanctifie the elect. Of this latter proceeding, saith <hi>Beza,</hi> is that place vnderstood which you peremptorily alleage, for to proue the first. So then we say, for our answer to this cauill, that as yet we see not expresse literall mention of these points; but that they are truly and soundly collected, by the Church, we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe, can, or dare deny; secondly, that the deniall of expresse literall mention, ought not to make any scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the minds of weake Christians, concerning these articles, the substance wherof are plaine scripture; though for the words we finde not as yet any expresse literall mention: nor last of all (as you seeme to feare) it can be no vnderpropping to the traditions of the Church of Rome, which if they can proue with the like necessary collection, out of the holy scripture, we are readie to imbrace them with all our hearts. In the meane time we account it a wrong, to haue an article of our faith, for want of expresse literall mention out of scripture, to be compared to traditions, of that kinde, for which in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there is no warrant at all. To conclude then this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, we say that in the Trinitie there is that Identity of essence,<note place="margin">

               </note> but not another thing. For that thing that they all are, is this one thing, that they are one God. So that Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith, I and my Father are one; heere both the words of the sentence, <hi>one,</hi> &amp; <hi>are</hi>; in that he saith <hi>one,</hi>

Now that we may truly vnderstand, (the ignorance or mistaking wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hath bin the ground of your exception in this third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle) what good things man of himselfe may do or know without the grace of God; we are taught, first that all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> actions are of three sorts; naturall, which are common to man with the brute beasts; as to eate, sleepe, and such like, which appertaine to his naturall life. Secondly, ciuill, which we call politicall, or morall, humane actions; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as to buie, sel, to learne anie art, and to conclude any other action, which concerneth the politick, or priuate society of man. Thirdly, those which belong to the kingdome of God, to a perfect, happy, and true Christian life; as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vs of our sinnes, to beleeue in God, to call vppon him, to obeie his voice, to liue after his precepts, and such like: now the question is, what grace and power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to man, to performe any, or all these. Where we must obserue, that some men (how properlie I know not) make the grace of God to be threefold. First that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall motion and action diuine, of which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> saith, in him we liue,<note place="margin">Acts. 17.</note> we moue, and haue our beeing. This the Schoolemen call a <note n="c" place="margin">

               </note> generall ouerflowing; and of the late writers, especially of Luther, it is called the action
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21624:17"/>
of the omnipotency; and this grace is common to all, that are within that compas to be called creatures. Secondly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there is a grace of God, which is a special fauor of God, by the which he bestoweth, and deuideth his gifts, and morall vertues, both to the faithfull and vnfaithfull, as pleaseth him.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> To the faithfull, that hauing the helpe afterward of a better light, they may serue to be meanes of their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to the vnfaithfull, for speciall vses, and manifold, in the society of man, and to make themselues, in the end without excuse. Such were those gifts in the Romans, and others of the heathen, of iustice, fortitude, temperance, prudence, which they thought, were from nature; but we acknowledge to be from the speciall fauour of God; for as being, so truth is but one, and by <note n="d" place="margin">

The two first, induing man with a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue power, (as the schoolemen call it) which though actually it can doe nothing, yet it is fit to performe that, which it hath no repugnancy in his owne nature to resist; as wood can be made fire, which water cannot.

               </note> the possibility to haue faith, is from nature; but to haue it, it is of grace (as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Prosper</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:21624:17"/>
hold) neither of them vnderstanding an actuall hauing of faith without the grace of regeneration: This made the Fathers, in their sermons to the people, to stirre them vp to prayer and good workes; to tell them often, that wee can loue God, and doe good workes; whereunto, they only ment that we had a passiue power, which stocks and brute beasts haue not. Now for the actiue power, wee hold, that man hath not this in naturall things, without the generall helpe of God; and in morall actions, or the learning of artes, not with that generall helpe onely, (which hath bin some mens error) but from a more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and peculiar grace; the weakenes of those common notions of good and euill, iust and vniust, left in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by a newe impression, after sin, is for the most part such, that they can hardly discerne any thing, no not in arts, vnlesse they be inlightned from aboue. And therfore, that Numa amongst the Romans; <hi>Solon</hi> amongst the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians; <hi>Lycurgus</hi> amongst the Lacedemonians; and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other amongst the Gentiles, were wise, and in that kinde vertuous; was not so much from nature, as from a speciall grace:<note place="margin">

               </note> whose morall workes, saith Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> were good, in their office, and action; but not in their end. This argument he very learnedly handleth, against <hi>Iulian</hi> the Pelagian,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tom.</hi> 7. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> where he concludeth two thinges; that there can be no true vertues, or truly chast workes in infidels; and that those works whatsoeuer they are, are not from nature, but from a speciall grace: the hauing whereof, though it serue not of it selfe to saluation, yet we are not afraid to affirme, that the want of these doe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily exclude from saluation: Iustice, fortitude, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp; prudence, being the effects of the same grace, but lesse powerfully working; faith, hope, and charity, only taught by a supernaturall truth. So that though the light of nature, teach a truth necessary to saluation, without the scripture, yet it teacheth no knowledge, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in holy scripture; the difference only being in this, that the light of nature, doth not teach all that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

doth, but that the scripture teacheth all, (&amp; more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly) which is taught by the light of nature: heerein only neither excluded as vnnecessarie, the one being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the other, and both meanes of the same thing.

The first seruing, to teach him that there is a God; the latter, what that God is, and how he will bee worshipped by man. This light wee call the scripture; which God hath not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to all, but to those only, whome he gathereth more neerely and familiarly to him selfe, and vouchsafeth that honor, to be called his Church, that, as men through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity seeing weakely, prouide vnto themselues, the helpe

For as there is no saluation without religion; no religion without faith; so there is no faith without a promise, nor promise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a word: for God desirous to make an vnion betwixt vs and himselfe, hath so linked his word and his Church, that neither can stand, where both are not. The Church for her part, in her choice allowance testifying, as well that it is the scripture; as the scripture, from an absolute authority, doth assure vs that it is the Church. For as those, who are conuerted, haue no reason to beleeue, that to be the Church, where there is no scripture; so those who are not conuerted, haue no great reason, to admit that for scripture, for which they haue not the Churches warrant. So that in my opinion, the contention is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and vnfit, to make a variance by comparison, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those two, who are in reason and nature, to support each other.

For though we dislike of them, by whome too much heeretofore, hath bin attributed to the Church; yet we are loth to grow to an error on the contrary hand, and to derogate too much from the Church of God: by which remoouall of one extremity with another, the worlde seeking to procure a remedy, hath purchased a meere exchang of the euill, which before was felt.

For vndoubtedly out of that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, hath proceeded your suspition of him, whose inward worthines, must now be content to receiue testimony, from a witnes by many thousand degrees, inferiour to himselfe.

If the Fathers of our Church, had had no greater reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to auouch their forsaking of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Synagogue, (as you call it) then this point; wee might iustly haue wished to haue bin reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to the fellowship, &amp; society of their church. For this point, as it seemeth right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly vnderstood, affordeth little difference betwixt them and vs; and therfore there was no mention of it in the last coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell their Church had. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly complaine,<note place="margin">of Trent.</note> that we wrong them in this point; for doubtles it is a tolerable opinion of the Church of Rome, if they go no further (as some of them do not) to affirme that the scriptures, are holy and diuine in themselues, but so esteemed by vs for the authority of the Church; for there is no man doubteth but that it belongeth to the Church (if we vnderstand as we ought those truely who are the Church) to approue the scriptures, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; to receiue; to publish; &amp; to commend vnto hir Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And this witnes ought to be receiued of all, as true, yet wee doe not beleeue the scriptures for this only; for there is the testimony of the Holy-ghost, without which the commendation of the Church were of little value. That the scriptures are true to vs, wee haue it from the Church;<note place="margin">D. Whitaker.</note> but that wee beleeue them as true, we haue it from the Holy-ghost. We confesse, it is an excellent office of the Church, to beare witnes to the scriptures; but we say not, that otherwise we would not beleeue them. We graunt that the scriptures rightly vsed, are the iudge of controuersies; that they are the triall of the Church; that they are in themselues a sufficient witnes for what they are: but yet for all this, wee are not afraid, with Master <hi>Hooker</hi> to confesse,<note place="margin">Book. 2. pag. 102.</note> that it is not the word of God, which doth, or possibly can, assure vs, that we do well to thinke it is the word of God.

assemblies want; to heare, and discerne the voice of her husband; neither can she be thought a chast spouse, who hath not the abilitie to do that. But as the Goldsmith ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his ballance, or with his touchstone, discerneth pure gold from other mettals of lesse value, yet doth not make it; so dealeth the Church, who hath not authoritie to make scripture, that which is not; but maketh a true difference from that which did only seeme. Neither in this respect, is the Church aboue the Scriptures, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth in humilitie, that shee is left in trust, to tell her children which is her husbands voice; and to point our to the world (as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did Christ) a truth of a farre more excellent perfection then her selfe is: As if I doubted of a strange coine, wherein I rest satisfied in the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of a skilfull man; but yet valuing the coine for the matter and the stampe of the coine it selfe.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Praeco.</hi>
               </note> The third office of the Church is to publish, and diuulge, to proclaime as a cryer, the true edict of our Lord himself; not daring (as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith) to adde anie thing of her owne;<note place="margin">

               </note> and in that following the safest rule (to make an vndiuided vnitie of the truth vncapable of contradiction) to be a most faithfull expositor of his owne meaning.

For the thoughts, and the actions of man, wee know are of three kindes; naturall, morall, supernaturall; nowe there are manie truths theoricall, and mechanicall, contained in naturall and humane arts, which by man may bee comprehended, onely by the light of nature: for though some diuines are of opinion, that no morall truth can be knowne of the vnderstanding of man, in the state of nature corrupt, without the special help of God; others contrary (as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus, Bonauenture, Scotus, Aqumas</hi> and diuers others) yet all agree in this, that man can know a morall truth in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, without any speciall grace; but that good that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly belongeth to eternall life, he cannot.

And therefore in mine opinion, the accusation is directly false, whereby you would make him to say contrary to his words; that reason by diligence is able to find out anie good concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs. For hee that saith that there is vertue enough in the poole to heale,<note place="margin">Ioh 5.</note> if a man had power enough to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in; doth not affirme that man hath strength enough to doe it; but that the poole had vertue, if hee were able to do it.<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.5. 2.

The most of the learned in Germany held a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of good works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not a necessitie of effecting, but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of presence for we are saued doubtlesse by grace, but (hauing yeers) we cannot ordinarily be saued vnles we haue good works.

But doubtlesse there being a morall goodnes, euen where there is want of supernatural light; and the most certaine token of that goodnes being, if the general perswasion of all men do so account it; it can not chuse, but seeme strange, that the approbation of these, should in your opinion be applied to those works that are done out of faith, after man is iustified; seeing there is a good (as M. <hi>Hooker</hi> saith) that doth follow vnto all things by obseruing the course of their nature; yet naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents cannot obtaine either reward, or punishment: for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst creatures in this world, only mans obseruation of the law of his nature (because he hath wil) is righteousnes; only mans transgression sin.

should not therfore need in this, much to defend him but briefly resolue you, what our Church holdeth, (and fitly) in this point. The <note n="a" place="margin">Art. 12</note> articles of our Church which ye thinke are oppugned, are two; first that the fruits of faith, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide the seuerity of Gods iustice; that man out of faith, doth good workes, which though they make vs not iust, yet are both acceptable, and rewardable: I doubt not but it is a truth, wherof if yee had not bin perswaded, this letter of yours (profitable (as you think) to the Church and pleasing to God) as all the rest of your writings in that kinde, had lien buried, vnborne in those rotten sepulchers, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into the world they did first come, whilest we are by that intermediat iustice of <hi>Christ,</hi> made righteous, and haue obtained a free remission of our sins, that we are tearmed iust; there is with this mercy ioyned the Holy-ghost; which dwelling in vs maketh vs fruitfull to good workes; this reuiuing all parts from our naturall corruption, reformeth vs to a pure, and willing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto that reuealed will, which is the rule of all that we ought to doe; yet seeing we are clothed with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there are euen in our best actions, those remainders of imperfection, which serue, to teach vs thankefulnes, and humility, both arising, from the consideration of our own weakenes. And I doubt not, but euen in this poynt, many of the Church of Rome, (whose humiliation in their penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of heart, seemeth far to exceed ours) are of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that euen the best action performed in their whole life (as there are yet some few monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts spared from the couetous hand) if all points of it were considered with a streight view, sifting euen the least circumstances, which closely insinuate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, out of our corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, into our actions, they would (I say) confesse, that there is something which tasteth of the flesh; which corruption, if either for want of a strict consideration we see not, or through a selfeloue could pardon, yet it is not able, in the feeblenes of his owne nature, to abide the exact triall, &amp; seuerity of Gods iudgement. That law, the least transgression wherof
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21624:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is sin, is sayd to be fulfilled three waies; first in Christ; and so all the faithfull are said to fulfill the lawe, hauing his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience imputed to them.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1. Cor. 1.</note> Secondly, it is fulfilled by a diuine acceptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for God accepteth our obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce begun, as if it were perfect; seeing what imperfections are in it, are not imputed to vs. For it is al one, not to be, &amp; not to be im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>puted; blessednes being the reward of both: And we know that there is no condemnation to those that are in Christ Iesus.<note place="margin">Psal. 32.1.

               <hi>Austen</hi>) that our loue can be perfect. And therfore we conclude the first point, according to the article of our Church, from which there is no sillable in Master <hi>Hooker</hi> that is different; that our workes though they be good, and so esteemed, and rewarded, yet they cannot abide the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the lawe, and the seuerity of Gods iudgement. The second point is, whether the workes which are done before the grace of Christ, are not only not acceptable to God, but also haue the nature of sinne. In this we must vse some care; for whilest men iustly disagreeing, haue equally laboured to be differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t one from another, both in the end, haue bin equally distant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth. That there are excellent graces in the heathen, no man doubteth; and he must needs be far from reason, and sense, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no difference betwixt the iustice, moderation, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Traian,</hi> and the fury, violence, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of <hi>Caligula, Nero,</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi>; betwixt the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane lusts of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and the continency in this respect of <hi>Vespasian</hi>; in one word, betwixt the obseruation, and the breach of lawes. For there is that difference betwixt iust, and vniust, that euen the frame of nature (where sense wanteth) acknowledge a well being, by the obseruation
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21624:29"/>
of what it ought: and therfore, much more in those good works, which because they missed of the right scope, wee dare not call by the name of true, perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians vertues; yet for their very action, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, (so long as they swarue not from the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the lawe of nature) to giue them leaue to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a better name, then only sinnes; and yet for all this, no man taketh them, to be much better in the true seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of a hard construction; for those that are not regenerate, although they sin in their best obseruation of the morall lawe, yet it is much better to performe those offices, then to performe them not; seeing <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Zanch. de relig. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note> a part of that indeuour, though it be not meere righteousnesse, yet it is lesse sinne. We must therefore remember, that a worke is considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either in respect of the substance; or in regard of the manner of doing. In respect of the worke, all the actions of infidels are not sin; seeing they performe those things, which are commanded, by the law of nature, of nations, of God; nay they are so far, in this respect, from beeing sins, that as (Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith) God doth plenteously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them. But concerning the manner of working, all their actions are sin; as proceeding from a corrupt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, a hart that wanteth true faith; and directed to an ende of lesse value, then he is, whose glory ought to be the end of all we doe. This is confessed euen by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries themselues, with whom seeing we doe agree, there can be no suspition that we should dissent, from that which our Church holdeth; and this may serue rather to tell you what in these points, is the iudgement of our Church, then to defend him, whose words you haue wrested, to a far different sense.</p>

From hence commeth it, that those men (who haue no other iudgement but zeale) (which is the best excuse I can make for your accusation in this article) haue run so far, with a desire of safety, from those opinions that were thought dangerous; that they haue come at length, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those that were much more daungerous in truth. Which practise, though it argue a good care, yet it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from a timorous nature, wanting the ability, to put a difference in the causes of true feare; so that this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, is but cowardlinesse; as he that were loth to be taken amongst his enimies trenches, would get himselfe so far distant, that he would outrun, euen the vtmost li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of his owne armie. Thus haue you dealt in this article; fearing to approue any thing that might tend to supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, you haue misliked euen the allowance of those works, which are good, and yet not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for (say you) to hold, as Master <hi>Hooker</hi> doth, that God approueth more then he commandeth, what is it else, but to scatter euen the graines of Popery, and to lead men, to those arrogant works of supererogation. Herein your feare, if it would haue giuen you leaue, to haue loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked behinde you, it may be peraduenture, you would not haue run away in such haste; especially in cases of no great daunger. And therfore giue me leaue, to tell you, that there is no treachery, no danger, no cause of flying, from this opinion. All the vnforced actions of men, are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie; and all voluntarie actions, tending to their end, haue choice; and all choice presupposeth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

of some cause, wherefore we make it; and therfore it is no absurditie to thinke that all actions of men, indued with the vse of reason, are generally either good, or euill. And although whatsoeuer is good,<note place="margin">

Some things in such sort are allowable, that they be also required as necessary to saluation, by way of direct, immediate, and proper necessitie finall; so that without performance of such, wee cannot by ordinarie course be saued; nor yet by any meanes be excluded from life, if we obserue those. As nature gaue light, vnto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; so the Scripture is a guide to teach these: wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all faile, it is the obedience, and merit onely of one, that must make all righteous, that must be saued. Some things there are, although not so required of necessitie, that to leaue them vndone, excludeth from saluation; yet notwithstanding are of so great dignitie and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, that most ample reward in heauen is laid vp for them. Of these we haue no commandement, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Scripture, that doth exact them, in particular at our hands; yet those motiues there are in both, which may serue to draw our minds, most effectually to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them. In this kind there is not the least action, but it doth somwhat make to the accessorie augmentation of our blisse; which men haue as much reason to desire, as to desire that they may be blessed; no measure of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse hauing power to content, sauing onely where the blessed wanteth capacitie to receiue greater.

It was as necessary that he should be without sin, as it is certaine that (except him) in many things we offend all.

This assertion, seemeth in your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be vntrue, and for proofe you alledge, that we which are baptized, and regenerated, in many things do offend all; did euer Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> denie this?

First, no man doubteth but that all men are sinners; for <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note> all the imaginations of the thoughts of mans hart, are only euill continually. In <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 51.5.</note> iniquity are we borne and in sin are we conceaued; who <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 19.12</note> can vnderstand his faults?

               </note> cloud of witnesses of the auncient Fathers against <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Pelagian.</hi> Nay euen they of the Church of Rome, shew by their exorcising before baptisme, that they thinke none to be without sin; where we doe not now dispute of the lawfulnes of that vse, but by that conclude that in this point, they hold a truth. So that the maine thing which you so seeme to mislike, is a thing not holden or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (sauing in some particular case, as the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi>) by any that I know; for euen that streame of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall sin, hath ouerflowed all mankinde, out of which dayly proceede those great and innumerable multitudes

of actuall sins. Your three false conclusions, seeme to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish a threefold error, contrary to the doctrine of all Churches, that are accounted Christian. First, that all sin is but one sin. Secondly, that all sins are equall. Thirdly, that all sins, are vnited. The first, making no diuision, of the kinds of sin; the second, no distinction of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of sin; and the third no difference, in committing sin.

Others, make a distinction of the seauen Capital, or deadly sins; which as we haue no great reason to admit, so we haue as little reason to disallowe; knowing that euen those are the heads and fountaines of all sins, of the second table. The second assertion which we hold, is; that all sins are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall; this was an opinion of the Stoicks, who desirous to seeme vnwilling, to commit the least, held an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they were equall to the greatest; a good care, grounded vpon an euill reason. If a pilote (say they) ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a ship full of gold, he sinned no more, then if he ouerturned a ship full of strawe; for although there be a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21624:33"/>
difference in the losse, yet the vnskilfulnes, or negligence is all one. Or if two erre, from the scope, euen he that misseth a little, as well erreth, as he that misseth a great deale. But as in the former of shipwrack, the fault was greater, because he had greater reason, to make him cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect; reason telling vs that where we haue mo, and stronger motiues to doe any thing, there we haue lesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and the sin greater if we doe it not: for the latter, he erreth as well, but not asmuch; seeing both, shooting at one marke, it is not al one to be a foote, &amp; a rod wide. And therfore that lawe, that forbad but one thing (thou shalt not kil) forbad three things, as Christ expoundeth it; anger to thy brother; to call him foole; to offer him violence; these hauing euery one as their seueral degrees, so their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall punishment. For who will say that the first is as great a fault, as the second; or the third as small as the first; for doubtles, things that are all forbidden, doe in their owne nature admit more or lesse. And howsoeuer in some sort, vertues are called equall; yet vices are not: for all vertues, from the vanity of the world, tend but to one perfection, (either to reason, as the Philosophers thought) (or to say better, to the reueiled will of God) which is the rule of good, and euill; but sinnes departing from this lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto diuers vanities, in diuers kinds. Neither are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues all equall simply, but by a kinde of proportion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they all proceede from the loue of God; and all tend vnto his glory: otherwise in it selfe, faith is better then te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perance, &amp; one vertue may in the same man, be far more excellent, then in many others.

So that in respect of the departure, it is true that S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, he departeth as well, from God, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth but one sin, as he that committeth many, but not so farre. Therefore to impose this vpon vs, were to adde euen to those that are oppressed already, a burthen farre greater, then the law doth; for by obedience of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine lawe; wee tend from manie to one; but by disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, from one to many; and those diuers: and therfore though vertues, haue amongst themselues, their vnion, and consent; yet vices, haue their dissent, nay their oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that this, then, is the conclusion; that though no man bee without all sin, yet many are without many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous sinnes: which because through prayers, and good meanes they auoid; it followeth not an vtter exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all sinne; nor because they commit the least, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that they offend equally, as if they committed all.</p>

That there is no man, how excellent soeuer, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humilitie may easily erre; I can as willingly confesse it, as I commend such, whom I see carefull to giue aduise vnto those, that haue gone astray. The one being the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of pride, to teach sobrietie; the other the power of their learning, to shew humility; but that either he hath done the one, or you the other, in this Article, it is more then (as yet) I see any iust inducements to beleeue. And I am sorie, that things of principall excellencie, should bee thus bitten at, by men, whom it is like, God hath indued with graces both of wit and learning, to better vses. For if all men had that indifferencie of mind, that the greatest part of their forces were imployed, for the inlarging of that kingdome, whereof all of vs desire to bee subiects; we should easily discerne, that a curious searching into that will, which is not reuealed, serueth but to breed a contempt, of that which is reuealed vnto vs. Man desireth rather to know, then to doe; nay to know, euen those things which do not concerne him, rather then to do that, for the neglect whereof, he must giue an account. From hence commeth it to passe, that what the Schooles haue curiously sought out, concerning the nature of Gods wil; the Pulpits, nay the stalles of Artificers haue vndertaken to decide them all. So that those things, which once were but the deep amazeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of some few, are now become the vsuall doctrine, and the vulgar consideration of many: where, that is not so much to be lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted which we search, &amp; cannot comprehend; as that which we might compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, but do not search: Following, euen that first euil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, for eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill,<note place="margin">

Yet for all this to bee absolutely either ignorant, or carelesse, of those things that concerne vs; are no warrants for humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; but euidences of our slouth: The world at this day hath two sorts of men; whom though we need not to respect much, yet we are willing euen to giue them a reason of what wee do; which though peraduenture they challenge at our hands, yet wee demaund not of them, a reason of what they surmise. The first sort are sensuall and carelesse; neither respecting the will of God, of vs, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs: these for the most part, vnderstand nothing but earthly things; whom if you remoue to matters of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reach, you onely arme them against yourselfe, &amp; awake
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21624:35"/>
them, to shew an vnsufferable contempt of all vertue. For that which they thinke painefull to themselues, being idolaters to the bellie, that they suppose partly impossible to others; and that which for their owne dulnesse, they cannot easily learne, that they imagine (but falsly) that others can as hardly teach. The second sort, wiser then these, thinke that we ought to search, what God will haue vs to do; but what he will do with vs, or what he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, or determined of vs, that they thinke, ought who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be neglected by vs. In these two errours, there is this difference; that the dangers being equall, the reasons are not equall, that do moue both; seeing man hath mo reasons, to perswade him to know too little, then to know too much. Therefore the Church of England, calleth Predestination vnto life,<note place="margin">Art. 17.</note> the eternall purpose of God, whereby before the foundations of the world were laid, he constantly decreed, by his counsel vnto vs vnknown, to deliuer from the curse and destruction, them, whom he chose in Christ out of mankind, and as vessels made vnto honour, through Christ to bring them to eternall saluation; whereupon, they who are indowed with so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a benefit of God, are called according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and that by his Spirit, working in a fit time: wherein if any thing, in his generall wil be opposite to that which secretly he hath determined of vs, it is neither a contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in that essence which is but one; neither anie war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for vs, to bee defectiue in our charitie, which must imitate his general inclination to saue all. And howsoeuer he graunt not those prayers, which we make, for those who are not predestinate, because there is a more secret will that hath determined the contrarie; yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, euen these prayers conformable to his general incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, are in themselues without sin; they are our duties; &amp; acceptable to God. For in God there is a wil reueiled, which not to do is sin; &amp; not reueiled, which we may do &amp; yet sin. And therfore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it must needs seeme strange, that it is made a question by any, how God eternally prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinateth

But how is it then (say you) that God willeth all men to be saued? Is it a constant decree,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.4</note> or only an inclination? That he thus willeth, there is no man doubteth; and although some with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of the word (all) vnderstand it, of his eternall, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, secret decree; yet we affirme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21624:36"/>
that they are not, it is not his decree, but their own fault. And although we say, as Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> doth, that God willeth many thinges conditionally, yet if wee speake properly, all things that God willeth, hee willeth sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; and therefore all things that God willeth, must bee: the condition being, not in respect of the wil, but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of it. For it is no more possible, that there should be a wil in God conditional, then that his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and his wisedome should not be eternall: and yet in respect of vs, who must be ruled by his law, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional. God sometimes commandeth what hee will not haue done; not that he is contrary in his wil, but that his wil as yet is not, wholy reueiled: The matter of predestination was neuer fully handled before the time of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> whose heresies gaue occasion to Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> and others to confirme vs in this point; wherein though I confesse I vnwillingly labour at this time, yet I doubt not to affirme (which may serue in steed of answere to content you) that the predestination of God, is eternall, not conditional; immutable; not for works foreseen, and that those,<note place="margin">

For in the first great contention (of what persons the Church consisteth) in my opinion wee dispute of one Church, namely, the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, all which must be saued; they dispute of the visible, wherein are hypocrites also. So that the reasons that are brought on both sides, are smally to the purpose,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21624:40"/>
seeing both sides directly mistake the question. Thus in the iudgment of those of the Church of Rome, persons excommunicate (though vniustly) are cut off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, but not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the catholike; excommunication being only, the censure of a particular Church: Therfore (saith our Sauior Christ) many are called (with an externall calling to the society of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>icke. For though both be a folde, yet of the visible Church (saith Saint <hi>Austin</hi>) In the Church there are many wolues, and out of the Church there are many sheepe; but in the Catholicke, without any other mixture are sheepe only. Now visible and inuisible maketh, not two Churches; but the diuers estate &amp; condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one, &amp; the same Church. Hence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it to passe, that in this question of the visibility of the Church, there is the like mistaking as in the former; for they of Rome say, we haue made this distinction, because our Church hath not bin alwaies visible; but we say, if our Church had bin as glorious, and as famous, as any Church in the world, we would haue accounted, the Catholicke Church inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Which (no doubt of it) they of Rome doe, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (Catholick and visible) as we meane. For the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> which we properly tearme his mystical body, can be but one; neither can that one, be sensibly discerned, by any man; in as much as the parts therof, are some in heauen already with Christ, and the rest that are on earth, (albeit their natural persons be visible) yet we cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne vnder this property,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hook. lib.</hi> 5.</note> wherby they are truly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly of that body; only our minds by internal conceit, are able to apprehend, that such a real body there is, a body collectiue, (because it conteyneth a huge multitude) a body mystical, (because the mystery of their coniunction is remoued altogether from sense.) Whatsoeuer we reade in scripture concerning the endles loue, and the sauing mercy, which God shewed towards his Church, the only proper subiect therof is this Church. They who are of this society haue such markes, and notes, of distinction
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21624:40"/>
from al others, as are not subiect vnto our sense; only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God who seeth their harts, and vnderstandeth al their secret cogitations, vnto him, they are cleere, and manifest. In the eie of God, they are against Christ, that are not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sincerely with him; in our eies, they must be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as with Christ, that are not to outward shew, against him; to him they seeme such as they are, but of vs they must be taken for such as they seeme. Al men knew <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> to be an Israelite, but our Sauiour pearsing deeper, gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now as those euerlasting promises of loue, mercy, and blessednes, belong to the mystical Church, euen so on the other side, when wee reade of any duty, which the Church of God is bounde vnto; the Church whom this doth concerne, is a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knowne company; and this visible Church in like sort is but one, continued from the first beginning of the world to the last end: which company, beeing deuided into two parts, the one before, the other since the comming of Christ; that part which since the comming, partly hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and partly shal hereafter imbrace the Christian Religion, we tearme as by a proper name, the Church of Christ.<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.16.</note> For all make but one body, the vnity of which visible body, and the Church of Christ, consisteth in that vniformity, which al seueral persons thereunto belonging haue by reason of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one Lord, whose seruants they all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be, that one faith, which they al acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; that one baptisme, wherwith they are al receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the church.

Church, whose Children are signed with this marke; One Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme. In whomsoeuer these things are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Church doth acknowledge them for her children; them only she holdeth for aliens and strangers, in whom these things are not found. For want of these, it is that Saracens, Iewes, and infidels are excluded out of the bounds of the Church; others we may not (though you doe) denie to be of the visible Church, as long as these things are not wanting in them. For apparant it is, that al men are of necessity, either Christians, or not Christians; if by externall profession, they be Christians, then are they of the visible Church of Christ; and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians by externall profession they are all, whose marke of recognisance hath in it those things which we haue mentioned: Yea although they be impious Idolaters, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hereticks, persons excommunicable, such as we deny not to be euen the lims of Satan, as long as they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue such. Is it then possible, say you, that the selfesame men should belong both to the Synagogue of Satan, and to the Church of Christ? Vnto that Church, which is his mystical bodie, not possible; because that bodie consisteth of none, but only true Israelits; true sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> true seruants, and Saints of God. Howbeit of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body and Church of Christ, those may be, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are, in respect of the maine parts of their outward profession, who in regard of their inward disposition of minde, yea of externall conuersation, yea euen of some parts of their very profession, are most worthily both hatefull in the sight of God himselfe, and in the eies of the sounder parts of the visible Church, most execrable. From hence haue proceeded those bitter speeches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with many of our reuerend Fathers haue censured the Church of Rome: as also those violent courses, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely, which they haue hitherto vsed against vs.<note place="margin">Matth. 13.47</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sauiour compareth the kingdome of heauen, to a net, whereunto al that commeth neither is nor seemeth fishe; his Church he compareth to afield, where tares

God hath had euer, and euer shall haue, some Church visible vpon earth. But for lack of diligent obseruing, the difference, first betwixt the church of God, mystical and visible; then betweene the visible, sound, and corrupted, sometimes more, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lesse, the ouersights are neither few, nor light, that haue bin committed: This deceiueth them, and nothing else, who thinke that in the time of the first world, the family of <hi>Noah,</hi> did containe al that were of the visible church of God. From hence it grew, and from no other cause in the world, that the Affrican Bishops, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Carthage, knowing how the administration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme belongeth only to the church of Christ, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that hereticks, which were apparantly seuered from the sound beleeuing church, could not possiblie be of the church of Iesus <hi>Christ,</hi> thought it vtterly against reason, that baptisme administred by men of corrupt beleefe, should be accounted as a Sacrament. Some of the Fathers were earnest, especially Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in this point: but I hope you haue not yet proceeded so farre. This opinion was afterwards both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by a better aduised coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and also reuoked by the chiefest of the Authors therof themselues:<note place="margin">

better state, then Thiatyra and Pergamus were; and yet all of them, no doubt, parts of the visible church; so standeth the cause, betwixt Rome and vs; so farre as lawfully we may, we haue held, and do hold fellowship with them; we acknowledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be of the family of Iesus Christ; and our heartie prayer vnto God Almightie is, that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, so farre forth with them, they may at length, if it be his will, so yeeld to frame, and reforme themselues, that no distraction remaine in anie thing, but that we all, may with one heart, and one mouth glorifie God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord, and Sauiour, whose church we are. As there are, which make the church of Rome no church at all, vtterly: so we haue them amongst vs, who vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of imagined corruptions in our discipline, do giue, euen as hard a iudgement of the church of England it selfe. But whatsoeuer either the one sort, or the other teach, we must acknowledge, euen heretikes themselues, to bee (though a maimed part) yet a part of the visible church. For as to baptize is a proper action, belonging vnto none but the church of Christ, which is true in the church of Rome (howsoeuer some Anabaptists account it but a mockerie) so if an infidell, should pursue to death an heretike, professing christianitie, onely for christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession sake, could the church denie him the honour of Martyrdome? Yet this honour all men know to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto the church; and therefore where the Fathers make opposition betwixt the visible church, and hereticall companies (as often times they doe) they are to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, as separating heretikes, not altogether from the companie of beleeuers, but from the fellowship of sound beleeuers: for where profest <hi>vnbeleefe</hi> is, there can be no visible church of Christ; there may be where sound beleefe wanteth. Infidels being cleane without the church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie directly, and vtterly reiect, the very principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity; which heretikes imbrace, and erre onely, in mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construction. And therefore it is strange that you dare affirme; the Turke to hold any part of the christian faith,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21624:42"/>
or to bee in that respect comparable to the church of Rome: For that which separateth vtterly, that which cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth off cleane, from the visible church of Christ, is, as Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Booke. 5. pag. 186.</note> plaine Apostasie; direct deniall; vtter reiection of the whole christian faith; as farre as the same is professedly different, from infidelitie. Heretikes, as touching those points of doctrine wherein they faile; Schismatikes, as touching the quarrels, for which, or the duties wherein they diuide themselues from their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; loose, licentious, and wicked persons, as touching their seuerall offences, or crimes; haue all forsaken the true church of God, the church which is sound and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, in the doctrine; that they corrupt: The church that keepeth the bond of vnitie, which they violate: the church that walketh in the lawes of righteousnesse, which they transgresse: This verie true church of Christ, they haue left; howbeit not altogether left, nor forsaken simply the Church, vpon the maine foundations whereof, they continue built, notwithstanding these breaches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are rent at the top asunder. But peraduenture you will say, why then doe wee refuse to communicate with the church of Rome, more then <hi>Zacharie, Elizabeth, Anna,</hi> and others, did with the high priests? corruptions being in both, and both remaining parts of the church of God? I answer, that in the time of our Sauiour Christ, the synagogue of the Iewes, although it was not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the high Priests, and chiefe Doctors in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, the true visible church; yet in some sort, it was; because the remainders of religion, were left, &amp; the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship instituted of God himselfe, was not wholy taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: so with the Papists we would not be affraid to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, in our liturgie, if it were not in respect of their superstitious order, &amp; some prayers which are idolatrous, for which we haue some reasons, as yet to doubt, that they haue no warrant. We must all of vs be ioined to the true church, else we cannot be saued, that is to the catholicke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the visible: for doubtles a man may bee saued, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21624:43"/>
liueth not in any particular Church; or that is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from all: yet we say, thus much; That we must ioyne ourselues to some particular Church, if wee will be saued; with this twofold caution, If such a Church be knowne vnto vs; or if it be possible to ioyne vnto it. Wherein, because euerie particular may erre, yet none absolutely exclude from saluation, all men haue reason to ioyne with that, that is most sound. This then were the fittest point, to bee discust with moderation, and learning: That seeing all Churches haue some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound parts in them, which Church is to be reputed at this day the soundest of all the rest.

For euen, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of greatest vse vnto Gods church (the dispensation of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21624:44"/>
the word of life) a vehement dislike of those things, which they cannot attaine, hath wrought too viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the ouerthrow of that course, which learning and truth haue held not to be the weakest meanes, to support the same. Hence commeth it to passe, that whilest al grant the word to be powerful and effectual; some thinke, this is only true, of the word preached; which otherwise, hath smal vertue, except it be in sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; &amp; those sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s only, to haue this power, which are of their own making. Causing the holy ghost, whose stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth is perfected in weakenes, to be necessarily tied, to a defect of al outward ornaments; as though that almighty power,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12</note> vpon whom euer excellency depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the weakest meanes, were of lesse authority, or lesse power, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meanes which he vseth, were more excellent: thus depriuing the church of variety of guifts, who out of obedience and humility, hath learned how to profit by all. But, as to tie the power of conuerting sinners, to that which is eloquently strong in humaine wisdome, were a thing not safe, &amp; iniurious to the church; so to bee too earnest, against al outward ornaments, through an affectation of pure simplicity, is an error no lesse dangerous then the former was. For seeing those that teach are not all, either capeable, or furnisht, with the same guifts, and that continually, there is no lesse vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in those that heare; it is the wisdome, and discretion of the church, for a better attainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a more perfect estate, to learne with thankfulnes and reuerence how to profit by all. For as it is impossible, that anie one forme of teaching should please or perswade all men,<note place="margin">Acts. 3.</note> (a prerogatiue which was not graunted to the first and best sermons) whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie was that they conuerted many, but not all; so the rest, who yet are not, but must be conuerted, are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect (though not with curiosity to affect) a variety for the manner, euen of that which in substance and end, is but meerely one. For the mysticall body, as it is ful of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and diuersity in his parts, yet in it selfe but one; so the working is manifold, &amp; different, though the beginning
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21624:44"/>
and the end, Gods power, and his glory be in truth, to, and for all men, but one. For sometimes the word, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read proposeth, and preacheth it selfe to the hearer; sometimes they deliuer it, whom priuately zeale and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety moueth to be instructors of others, by conference; sometimes, of them it is taught, whom the church hath called to the publick, either reading thereof, or interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; &amp; by them after a most diuers manner; but all tending to one ende, for which God hath made his visible church to be that congregation of faithfull people, wherein the pure word of God is preached: so that in this respect we refuse not, to make the preaching of the word (taking the word preaching for all manner of teaching) to be an essentiall note, of the church. For doubtles in that parable of the sower,<note place="margin">Matt. 13.3</note> by you alledged, we mislike not much the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of that Reuerend Bishop which you bring forth, as opposite to Maister <hi>Hooker</hi>; saying, God is the husbandman,<note place="margin">Bishops of Lincol. 1. Ser. vpon.

               </note> what am I but the seedmans basket? Which euen the meanest Christian no doubt is, though neuer called to the office of preaching, if he can by priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, exhort and instruct out of holy Scripture: which as it is an acte of lesse honor, and profit, then the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of those, that are worthily called to that office; so euen, in their sermons that are called, there is no man but must acknowledge, a manifold, and apparant difference. For seeing speech (as Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> saith) (which you mislike) is the very image, whereby the mind, and soule of the speaker, conueyeth itselfe into the bosome of him that heareth; we cannot chuse, but see great reason, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word, that proceedeth from God (who is in him selfe very truth and life) should be (as the Apostle to the Hebrues noteth) liuely,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12</note> and mighty in operation, shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then any two edged sword. Now, to make our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21624:45"/>
that strong, &amp; forcible word, is to impart the most peculiar glory of the word of God, vnto that which is not his word. For touching our sermons, that which giueth them their very being, is the will of man; and therefore, they oftentimes, accordingly tast too much of that ouer-corrupt fountaine, from which they come. For euen the best of our Sermons, (and in Sermons there is an infinite difference) howsoeuer they oftentimes, haue a singular blessing, and that the scripture, the pure word of God, is the text and the ground of the speech; yet the rest of the discourse, which is sometimes two, or three houres long, (a time too long for most preachers to speake pertinently) is but the paraphrasticall inlarging of the same text, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with those fit exhortations and applications, which the learning of the preacher, is able to furnish himselfe withall, and his discretion shall thinke fit for that auditory to which he speaketh. And therfore, as to equalize euery declamation, or oration in schooles, to them, is to wrong sermons; so to make, euen the best sermons, equall to the scripture, must be in apparant reason a great wrong, to that which is immediately Gods own word; wherunto, though the best preach agreeably, yet the sermons of none, since the Apostles time, are or ought to be esteemed of equall authority with the holy scripture: and yet, we are not afraide, to ascribe vnto them, that blessing from aboue, to conuert, reforme, and strengthen, which no eloquence, Wisedome, Learning, Policie, and Power of the world, is able to match. Neither is there contrariety in this, that we that are the Preachers are sent as the Apostles were, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of our calling from God; and yet, that the learning, and wit of man, giueth the very beeing vnto that wee teach. Vnlesse (which some ouerboldly doe) you thinke it vnlawfull to vse either learning or wit, in making of sermons: As though all other helpes, purchased with great cost, and infinite labour, together with a naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, all perfected in those excellent fountaines of all learning, the Vniuersities, were to be reiected, as wholy
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21624:45"/>
vnprofitable in this busines. Neither doth Master <hi>Hooker,</hi> or any other of iudgement say (which you seeme to infer) that a man by natural witte, without a supernaturall light, from the scripture, is able to vtter those mysteries as he ought; which doubtlesse being a great fault, is rather the error of those who preach most, and yet vse least helps of learning or wit, for that they vtter. Wherein it must needs seeme strange, that they euer vnderstanding by the word, the worde preached; whereunto they ascribe vitall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; yet they performe this with such negligence, that they come rashly, vnfurnished, to so great a businesse; and scarce attentiuely weigh the dangerous sequell, of this construction. Doubtlesse, our sermons, euen the best, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for sound knowledge, or pure zeale, are not Gods word in the same manner that the sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Prophets were; no, they are but ambiguously tearmed his word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his word, is commonly the subiect, wherof they treate, and must be the rule whereby they are framed. Yet sermons haue sundrie, peculiar, and proper vertues, such as no other way of teaching besides hath: aptnesse to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low particular occasions presently growing; to put life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to words, by countenance, voice and gesture; to preuaile mightily in the sodaine affections of men; these and such like, are those excellent prerogatiues, which some few may challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, who worthily deserue the name to be called prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. We reiect not (as of no vse at all in the Church) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the vertuous labours of meaner men, who come far short of the perfection of these few; but earnestly wish the gouernours of our Church, for fitte imployment and maintenance, to respect both: And they laying aside all comparisons, equally to labour to further that worke, which by a blessing from aboue, knoweth how to profit by the labours of all.<note place="margin">

The first, a particular vniust censure, of the Fathers, whether you meane, the holy Fathers of the Church, as Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> and the rest; or those reuerend Fathers which doe liue at this day; all which, whilest you seeke to commend, directly you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise; accounting them, to auoid all humane learning, and that their sermons, haue not their being from the wit of man: which doubtlesse is false, seeing they excell by infinite degrees, the sermons of manie others which are framed, by neither. The second fault, is a generall taxation of all those, who anie way furnish their sermons with humane learning. You may peraduenture be able, to giue good direction in other points, but surely in framing of a Preacher, or making of a sermon, you are much deceiued: for I can neuer perswade my selfe, that the exactest indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie that man can vse, is vnlawfull or vnnecessarie in this worke; for sometimes, we are to deale with those, whose opinions are not easily confuted without humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; nor their attention gained without wit; nor their affections perswaded without eloquence; where to come vnfurnisht, and leaue the workings without meanes, to him who giueth a power, and a blessing to the meanes we vse, is all one to appoint him what meanes are fittest, or to inioyne him to worke without meanes at all: which, though that Almightie power can do, yet then to refuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they are prouided, or not to furnish vs, with as much as we can of the best that he hath prouided, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth our vnthankfulnesse, and our want of choise.

               </note> as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> wrote of the eloquence of <hi>Nouatus</hi>; I know there is much amisse, both in matter, and in the vse of prophane learning; but this we are sure, if we bring it to the Scripture, if it bee faultie, it is condemned; if wholsome, it is there confirmed. And I see no reason, that any man should be bold, to offer his owne inuentions, and conceits to the world, when hee findeth such, in the Fathers, and others, as cannot be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. I am sorie that the learned of any sort (as my Author saith) that hath but born a book, should dispraise learning; she hath enemies enough abroad, though she bee iustified by her children. It is fitter that wisedome, bee beaten by fooles, then by those who ought to be esteemed wise; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other places, a blow giuen in the pulpit against learning (a fault too common) leaueth a scarre in the face of knowledge, which cannot easily be cured. It calleth in question, the reaching of others, as if they fed the people with acorns &amp; husks, not bread; or because they gather the truth out of humane Authours, they contemned the authority of the holy Scriptures. Doubtlesse, it is somtime vanity in those that preach, &amp; itching in those that heare, &amp; a thing not tolerable, or allowable in either; but where it is otherwise, let not a ras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

neither let them be iudged: for those, that are wise, and humble in the Church, know how with discretion to make vse of all; and yet, not all of the like authoritie. For doctrines deriued, exhortations deducted, interpretations agreeable, are not the verie word of God, but that onely, which is in the originall text, or truly translated; and yet we call those sermons, though improperly, the word of God. To conclude this point, as our Church hath manie excellent Preachers, which we wish by good incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may increase; so it is too presumptuous a labour for any, to prescribe one forme necessarie to all.

And therefore, the same things from diuers parties, are not of the same, nor of like value: nay, that which is from sinceritie, a worship; is from hypocrisie, a sin: and the defects, which outwardly the maner of doing disproueth, the sinceritie oftentimes in the mind of the doer, acquiteth. In the eye of man, it is sometimes a fault which is no sin; &amp; in the eye of God, a sin, which in the eye of man, was no fault.

For as it is Gods infinite mercie, when he could either saue vs without the ministry of any, or by the ministry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; yet then to honor man, with this dignity to make him a coadiutor, dispenser, and cohelper in so great a worke; so it is his wisdome to appoint both for the auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of confusion, and vnfitnesse, such persons as are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allotted to so honorable an office; which neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vnder, or after the law, was euer lawfull, without any calling to vndertake. The enemies to this religious

order of the Church, haue bin certaine louers of confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which vnder pretence of the calling of the spirit, haue ouerboldly intruded themselues, into those holy functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for which lawfully they had neuer warrant. Such were the <hi>Enthusiasts, Anabaptists, Schwenkfeldians,</hi> who being enemies to all order, vnder pretence of a calling from the Holy-ghost, which others wanted, haue made a passage contrary to that restraint of the Apostle,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.4.</note> (Let no man take vpon him that honor to himselfe, but he that is called of God) without expectation of lawfull warrant, to those duties, that in the Church are greatest: for in the time before the law, it was not permitted to take the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of priesthood, vnlesse he either were or had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of the eldest brother. This was for the sinne of <hi>Ruben</hi> deriued to the tribe of <hi>Louie</hi>; first for their zeale, in that great idolatry; and was after confirmed vnto him, in the sedition of <hi>Corah</hi>: and yet not to all of that family, either to serue in that tabernacle,<note place="margin">Leuit, 21.22 Num. 8.</note> or to teach through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Israel. Neither were all ages equally fit vnto this calling; it being neither lawfull before fiue and twenty, nor after fifty to be admitted to it: As also those, that were admitted, had a speciall consecration, for a personall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, from the rest of that family,<note place="margin">Exo. 29 Leuit. 8 Num. 8</note> to let them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that although they, and only they of that tribe, were to be imployed in those functions, yet it was not lawfull to vndertake it, without a calling: this afterward, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter notes of eminencie gaue that allowance which before birth did, was with greater reuerence to be expected, and to be obserued with a greater care, by those whom the Church had inuested, with authority to call vnto that charge. To these persons, because God imparted power ouer his mysticall bodie, which is the society of soules, and ouer that naturall, which is himselfe, for the knitting of both in one (a worke which antiquity doth call the making of Christs body) the same power is in such, not amisse both tearmed a kind of marke, or Character, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be indeleble. For ministeriall power, is a marke
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21624:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of separation, because it seuereth them that haue it from other men, and maketh them a speciall order, consecrated vnto the seruice of the most high, in things wherewith others may not meddle. Their difference therfore from other men is, in that they are a distinct order: and I call it indeleble,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hook. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>pag</hi> 228.</note> because they which haue once receiued this power, as Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> saith, may not thinke to put it off and on like a cloake, as the weather serueth, to take it, reiect and resume it, as oft as themselues liste: of which prophane and impious contempt, these latter times haue yeelded (as of all other kinds of iniquity and apostasie) strange examples. But let them know, which put their hands to this plough, that once consecrated vnto God, they are made his peculiar inheritance for euer. Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions may stoppe, and degradations vtterly cutte off, the vse or exercise of power giuen; but voluntarily it is not in the power of man, to separate and pull asunder, what God by his authority coupleth: Neither neede there a reordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for such as were consecrated by the Church, in corrupter times; for out of men indued with gifts of the spirit, the Church chose her ministers, vnto whom was giuen ecclesiasticall power by ordination, which they could neither assume, or reiect at their owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Of these, without doubt the Apostolick Churches, did acknowledge but three degrees at the first; Apostles (in stead whereof are now Bishops) Presbyters, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons; for there is an error (as Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> saith) which beguileth many, who much entangle both themselues and others, by not distinguishing, seruices, offices, and orders Ecclesiasticall; the first of which three, and in part the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, may be executed by the laity, whereas none haue, or can haue the third,<note place="margin">

I say properly, for Clergie is a general name for all those,<note place="margin">All Christians.</note> whose lot, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Lord: More specially for those, who are stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in diuinity, &amp; after are to enter into holy orders. Of these, there were Colledges after the Apostles; as before, Colledges of the Prophets. And out of these, were taken such, as the Church (without Ecclesiasticall ordination) vsed in those seruices, which before are mentioned. Out of all which, it is most apparant, that from the Clergie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of ministeriall power, these are iustly seuered. This is that which you mislike, esteeming it a thing vnfit for any man to preach, that hath not a ministerial calling. Neither doth Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> determine how fit it is, that this should be performed, by men who are not entred into orders; but that this hath sometimes beene the practise of the Church, howsoeuer now performed by men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calling; there is no man of anie reading can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doubt: Neither is the practise in some Colledges of diuines at this day, altogether vnlike; where men are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, euen for exercise, or triall, to interpret &amp; expound the Scriptures, which are not as yet (but hereafter may be) consecrated to an Ecclesiasticall function.

Of the last of which, we only contend at this time: For any thing that I reade, Saint <hi>Austin</hi> was the first that vsed the word in this sense; and no doubt of it, in Baptisme there is that mark stamped vpon vs, in that we are baptized, that there is a passiue power, as the Schoolemen call it, which maketh a man in time fit to receiue the rest, which they cal Sacraments, and without which, they are truly accounted void. This forme, figure, impession, or character, is called indeleble, because that is not to be reiterated, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it commeth. The character of Order, is an actiue power, as the Schoolemen speake, which giueth an abilitie publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to administer the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, vnto those, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church hath esteemed fit. From whence proceedeth the second great exception, which you haue taken in this Article, namely, that Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> seemeth to grant a libertie, as for Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whitgift. pag. 516.</note> contrary, say you, both to that most Reuerend Archbishop, and others, who constantly affirme, that God, &amp; wel ordred Churches forbid women all dispensation of holy mysteries. Wee are not to dispute, what lawes giue allowance to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this office, nor what care ought to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint from too vsuall a libertie of doing it without great necessitie; seeing weaknesse is commonly bold, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse a presumptuous intruder, where it hath least cause. But this we say, which M. <hi>Hooker</hi> hath pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed already, that Baptisme by women is truly Baptisme, good, and effectual to those that haue it: neither doe all those exceptions of sexe, qualitie, insufficiencie, or whatsoeuer, serue to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, such as the Church of her indulgence, is willing to admit, from being partakers of so great a benefit. To make
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21624:51"/>
women teachers in the house of God, were a grosse absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12.</note> seeing the Apostle hath said, <hi>I permit not a woman to teach</hi>: and if any from the same ground, exclude them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other publike offices in the Church, wee are not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. But to womens Baptisme in priuate, by occasion of vrgent necessitie, the reasons that concerne ordinarie Baptisme in publike, are no iust preiudice; neither can we by force thereof, disproue the practise of those Churches, which (necessity requiring) allow Baptisme, in priuate to be administred by women. We may not from lawes that prohibite any thing with restraint, conclude absolute, and vnlimitted prohibitions. For euen things lawfull, are well prohibited, when there is feare, least they make the way to vnlawful more easie; &amp; it may be, the libertie of Baptisme by women, at such times, doth sometimes embolden the rasher sort to do it, where no such necessity is. But whether of permission besides law, or in presumption against law, they do it (which now is no part of the question in hand) it is not hereby altogether frustrate, void, and as if it were neuer giuen. True it is, that seeing God, from whom mens seuerall degrees, &amp; preheminences proceed, hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in his Church, at whose hands his pleasure is that we should receiue Baptisme; and all other publike helpes medicinable to the soule; perhaps thereby the more to settle our hearts, in the loue of our ghostly superiors; they haue small cause to hope that with him, their voluntarie seruices will be accepted, who thrust themselues into fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, either aboue their capacitie, or besides their place, and ouerboldly intermeddle with duties, whereof no charge was euer giuen vnto them. In which respect, if lawes forbid it to be done, yet therefore it is not necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void when it is done. For many things are firme being done, which in part are done, otherwise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> positiue rigor, and strictnes did require. Actions vsurped haue often the same nature, which they haue in others, although they yeeld not him that doth them the same comfort. What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects then are in this kind, they redound with restraint to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21624:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the offender only; the grace of Baptisme commeth by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from God onely. That God hath committed the mysterie of Baptisme vnto speciall men, it is for orders sake in his Church, and not to the intent that their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie might giue being, or adde force to the Sacrament it selfe. Infants haue right to Baptisme, we all know; that they haue it not by lawfull ministers, it is not their fault; Mens owne faults are their owne harmes. So then wee conclude this point, with Maister <hi>Hooker,</hi> that it is one thing to defend the fact for lawfulnesse in the doer (which few do) and another thing the fact being done, which no man hath reason to disallow; for though it is not lawfull for women to vndertake that office to baptize, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture belongs not vnto them; yet the Baptisme being done, we hold it lawfull.</p>

Wherein, the safest, and most charitable direction, will bee absolutely in that violent opposition to beleeue neither; but euen from both, to deriue a truth much sounder then that which either holdeth: From hence hath it come to passe, that whilest they of the Church of Rome, haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ascribed too much to works, some of vs too little, others haue set downe an equality, dissenting from both. Thus in the matter of the sacraments, (things of greatest and most hidden vertue left vnto the Church, (for they are called Mysteries) some haue bin thought to deriue that power to them, which belongeth to God only; which, whilest others sought to auoide, they haue euen depriued them, of that grace, which God doubtles in truth hath bestowed vpon them.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21624:52"/>
God doth impart his vitall or sauing grace of Christ, vnto all that are capable therof: and secondly, as meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, which God requireth in them, vnto whom he imparteth grace. For doubtles, it must needes be a great vnthankfulnesse, and easily breed contempt, to ascribe only that power to them to be but as seales; and that they teach but the minde, by other sense, as the worde doth by hearing: which if it were all, what reason hath the Church, to bestow any Sacrament vpon Infants, who as yet for their yeares, are nor capable of any instruction; there is therefore of Sacraments, vndoubtedly some more excellent and heauenly vse. Sacraments, by reason of their mixt nature, are more diuersly interpreted, and disputed of, then any other part of Religion besides; for that in so great store of properties belonging to the selfe same thing, as euery mans wit, hath taken hold of some especiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, aboue the rest; so they haue accordingly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen their censure of the vse and necessity of them. For if respect bee had to the dutie, which euery communicant doth vndertake, we may cal them truly bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God; strict obligations to the mutuall exercise of Christian charity; prouocations to godlines; preseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin; memorials of the principal benefits of Christ. If we respect the time, of their institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they are annexed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, vnto the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; as other rites were before with the old. If we regard the weakenesse, that is in vs, they are warrants for the more security of our beleefe. If we compare the receiuers, with those that receiue them not, they are works of distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to separate Gods owne from strangers; and in those that receiue them as they ought, they are tokens of Gods gratious presence, whereby men are taught, to know what they cannot see. For Christ and his holy spirit, with all their blessed effects, though en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the soule of man, we are not able to apprehend or expresse how, doe notwithstanding giue notice, of the times when they vse to make their accesse, because it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Almighty God, to communicate by sensible meanes,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21624:53"/>

Seeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that grace is a consequent of Sacraments; a thing which accompanieth them as their end; a benefit, which he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath, receiueth from God himselfe, the author of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; not from any other natural or supernatural quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them; it may be heereby both vnderstood, that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are necessary; and that the manner of their necessity to life supernaturall, is not in al respects, as foode, vnto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life. Because they containe in themselues, no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall force or efficacie, but they are duties of seruice and worship; which vnlesse we performe, as the author of grace requireth, they are vnprofitable: For all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not the grace of God, which receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his grace. Neither is it ordinarily his will, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe the grace of Sacraments vpon any, but by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. Which grace also they that receiue by Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or with Sacraments, receiue it from him, and not from them. That sauing grace, which Christ origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, is, or hath, for the general good of his whole Church, by Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts he seuerally deriueth into euery me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. They serue, as instruments, the vse is in our hands, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is his.

without our obedience to the one, there is of the other no apparant assurance; as contrariwise, where the signes, and Sacraments of his grace are not, either through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt vnreceiued, or receiued with contempt, we are not to doubte, but that they really giue what they promise; and are what they signifie. For we take not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as it seemeth you doe) for bare resemblances, or memorials of things absent, neither for naked signes, and testimonies assuring vs of grace receiued before, but (as they are indeede and in truth) for meanes effectual, whereby God, when we take the Sacraments, deliuereth into our hands that grace, auaileable vnto eternall life; which grace, the Sacraments represent or signifie: And yet we acknowledge as <hi>Hugo</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

For doubtles, the Church hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to vse the word, and the Sacraments, as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, of regeneration, both hauing by a diuine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, a force, and vertue to beget faith: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iustly amongst all the treasures, that God hath left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church, we honor and admire most, the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; not respecting so much the seruice, which we do vnto God in receiuing them, as the dignity of that sacred and secret guift, which we thereby receiue from God.

For they are signes, not only signifying,<note place="margin">

For God directly affirmeth, that he giueth that with the signe, which by the signe he representeth. In the Sacraments, wee acknowledge three things: The Word, the Element, the thing signified by the word; and represented by the element; and all these vnited, yet not by any reall, or physicall vnion, that one cannot bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without the other; but in these the vnion is sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and the order mysticall, betwixt the signes, and the things signified, by an institution from God: Whereby it commeth to passe, that heauenly and spirituall things by signes bodily, and earthly are signified, offered, and by the vertue of the holy Ghost, really exhibited, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto the elect. Thus if either the signes, or the thing signified be wanting, it ceaseth truly to bee a sacrament. Neither is grace, necessarily tied euer, to the externall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: for we giue the one, and God giueth the other; and when both are giuen, then is the sacrament faithfully receiued.<note place="margin">Tit 3.5.</note> Thus God iustifieth by the washing of the new birth, and the renewing of the holy Ghost: for this being the effect of his promise; the sacraments apply it vnto vs, by thus giuing it, faith by thus receiuing, both being as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments. For God doth iustifie, by the sacraments, man by faith; but God one, and the same, maketh righteous, by both; he being the author from whence they both come. Therefore it is a branch of beleefe (howsoeuer you scoffe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21624:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at it as omitted in our Creed) that sacraments are in their place,<note place="margin">

For we are not in anie doubt to affirme, that the Sacraments by the worke done actiuely, doe not affoord grace, though rightly vnderstood, passiuely they may, by the worke done: for in that iustification, and meanes of righteousnesse, whereof man is made partaker by the Sacraments, manie things concurre. First in Gods behalfe, a will that we should vse those sensible elements; in Christs behalfe, his passion, from which the sacraments haue their vertue; in the Ministers behalfe, his power, his will; in the receiuers behalfe, will, faith, repentance; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Sacrament it selfe, the externall action, which ariseth out of the fit application of the matter, &amp; the form of the Sacraments. Now that which in all this, actiuely, and instrumentally bringeth grace, is the externall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is commonly called the Sacrament: This ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his vertue from his institution, and not from anie merit, either in the Minister, or in him that receiueth. For the wil of God, which vseth the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as that meanes of grace, which it hath ordained, concurreth actiuely, but as a principall cause; the passion of Christ concurreth, as a cause meritorious; the power and the will of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, necessarily concurre, but as causes further remoued; hauing their vse only in effecting the sacramentall action; in whose due circumstances, of administring, he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing

to faile. Will, faith, and repentance, are necessarily required in the receiuer, that is of yeares; not as actiue causes, but as fit dispositions, for the subiect; for faith, and repentance, make not the sacramentall grace, nor giue power to the Sacrament, but onely remoue those lets, which are hindrances, that the Sacraments exercise not that vertue, that is annexed to them. So that in infants, in whom no such disposition is required, the sacrament of Baptisme is auaileable without these.

To make the Sacraments, depend for their grace, vpon the integritie of men, were to denie the benefit to a great number without cause, and to punish men, for a fault that were none of theirs.

For it is one thing, to intend what the Church intendeth, and another thing, to intend what the Church doth: For those that intend by baptisme, an vtter acquittance from originall sinne, and those that doe not, there is a diuersitie in the end, but the action is all one; and therefore not reiterated, though the end be diuers. Now to do the externall action, and yet in iest, is no more to doe, what the Church intendeth to doe, then their speech, and action (<hi>Haile King</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi>) was any honor, or true reuerence to our Sauiour Christ. The necessity of this intention, (not for grace, but to make it a Sacramentall action) will more euidently appeare, if wee consider what kinde of instrument the Minister is. Man may be the instrument of another agent many waies: First in respect only of his bodily members, his hand, his backe or such like; without any, vse of the will. Secondly, in respect of his outward parts, with the vse of sense; as to reade, to watch, to tell what he seeth; and to this also, the will is no further required, but to the outward action. Thirdly, in respect of the bodily members, together with sense and reason, as in Iudges appointed by Princes to determine causes, wherein wisdome and the will are to be instruments. Now the Ministers of the Sacrament,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21624:58"/>
must be of this third kinde: And therefore saith <hi>Hugo,</hi> if a father should take his sonne to a bathe, and should say, Sonne,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Alexander</hi> the Bishop held the Baptisme that <hi>Athanafius</hi> ministred to other boyes in play, to be true Baptisme, because he did it with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of true Baptisme. In those that are but instruments (as the minister is no more) the vertues of faith, hope, and charitie, are not requisite; and yet because they are reasonable instruments, their actions must proceede from election, and intention. Therefore we conclude, that this intention of the Church, is no ground of vncertaintie, seeing she tendeth but one thing; that is, to performe them as Sacraments; nor giueth any power to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sacrament; and that the Church cannot make a Sacrament; but to distinguish betwixt actions religious, and the same not religious, there is required the intention of the Church.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here many things are doubted of without reason, it is neither easie, nor vsually expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to answer all. Wisdome esteemeth it much fitter, to passe by without yeelding satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to some apparant truths called in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather then by answering, to let the simple vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that men haue doubted of those points. For the first calling in question of vnfallible truths, gaue strength to euill minds, to find out all shewes of reason, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of those things, which their owne weaknesse at first made them simply to mistake. So that, whosoeuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euerie doubt to bee a contention, or laboureth to confute errours of long continuance, in the first, kindleth but that sparke, which without some breath would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily die; and in the latter, must arme himselfe to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an obstinate resolution. The consideration of this, made me not willing, either to dispute the newe borne doubts of your owne in this Article, which being discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in time, might grow to be old errours, or to bestowe labour, for the assisting of that truth, which out of great iudgement, and learning, hath often beene defended by other mens paines. But seeing it is an vsuall false conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to argue a lawfulnesse from what we doe, so a want of abilitie from what we doe not; I thought it fitter, euen following their steps that haue gone before me, rather to resolue others what you haue doubted of in this point, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that any should conclude out of silence, an impossibilitie that you could be answered. For the willingnes that some men haue, to do more then they are able, maketh others suspected, to want abilitie, in whom there appeareth not the same willingnesse. If al men rightly considered in those actions that concerne mans saluation, how farre we are

tied not onely in obedience, but for vse, to those things that are meanes to effect the same; few would haue beene so carelesly resolute, to contemne good works, through an opinion of an eternall election, or so negligently haue despised the onely doore of entrance into the Church (Baptisme) through an opinion that God doth saue, euen where this is wanting.<note place="margin">Roman. Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis.</note> We do all confesse, that Baptisme is a sacrament of regeneration, or new birth, by water in the word of life; that it is a signe, nay a meanes of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, whereby we are coopted into the societie of the Church:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cal. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Inst.</hi>
               </note> Thus, by this being ingraffed into Christ, we may be taken for the sonnes of God; and so receiue newe names to bee called Christians: And therefore learned men, haue thought it to bee the doore of our actuall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Gods house; the first apparant being of life, as Saint <hi>Basil</hi> calleth it;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hook. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>pag</hi> 132.</note> the first step of our sanctification, as Master <hi>Hooker</hi> saith. For as we are not naturally men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out birth, so neither are we Christian men, in the eye of the Church, without new birth; we say in the eye of the Church: for we take not vpon vs, to see as God doth, who knoweth without all meanes, both to make, and without visible tokens, is able to discerne who belong vnto him: And yet in our eye, Baptisme is that, which both declareth, and maketh vs to be Christians.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>T.C. lib.</hi> 3 <hi>pag.</hi> 134.</note> Therefore it is a strange opinion of them, who say, that he which is not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian before baptisme, cannot be made a Christian by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme; which is onely the seale of the grace of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receiued. These, as it seemeth you doe, eleuate too much the ordinarie and immediate meanes of life, relying wholy vpon the bare conceit, of that eternall election, which notwithstanding includeth a subordination of meanes; without which, we are not actually brought to inioy what God secretly did intend: And therefore to build vpon Gods election, if we keepe not our selues to the wayes which he hath appointed for men to walke in, is but a selfe deceiuing vanitie: for all men notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their preordination vnto life (which none can know

And howsoeuer the children of the faithfull, are borne holy, as you alleage out of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reuerend Bishop; &amp; the Elect, are adopted to be the sons of God in their predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> afterwards whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they beleeue, then they are said more properly to be the sons of God indeed: for although it be true as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> that your sonnes are holy, namely, when they are borne, by reason of the promise, yet he saith, that we are sanctified by faith, meaning actually and indeed. For as kings (in those kingdomes that are by election) are first chosen, then designed, then crowned, which last action is that which maketh them ful,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zanch. in decal. pag.</hi> 400.</note> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate kings; so whatsoeuer we were, in that secret ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to vs vnknowne,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> yet then, when we are baptized, and not before, we are properly, publikely, solemnly ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto God, and admitted into his Church: Yet we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not (neither doth any that I know) these benefits thus bestowed, ordinarily, in, and with Baptisme, but that extraordinarily (sometimes before, as in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>; sometimes after, as in many baptized by heretikes; sometimes without, as in those who preuent their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme by martyrdome, and some others) these benefits may be bestowed. For it were a fearefull doctrine, iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to many thousands soules, and blasphemous against the bottomles mercie of a most louing father, to exclude all those from eternall life, whom not negligence, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, but some other occasion hath hindred to be baptized. And therefore it is strange, that you would make M. <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> to speake for so absolute a necessitie (which indeed he doth not) but maketh it limited; or that yourself would dislike a necessity,<note place="margin">In the Letter pag. 31. lin. 16.</note> wheras you confesse, this to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of baptisme, if it cannot be had as it ought. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then principally called in question in this Article, is what kind of necessity there is of baptisme; a thing already fully ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled by M. <hi>Hooker</hi>;<note place="margin">

And therefore water, &amp; the spirit both concurring in that sacrament, why should there not be, though not an equall, yet a necessity of both. For as the spirit is necessary to regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to eternal life, which so far dependeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that God wil haue it imbraced not only as a signe or token what we receiue, as you affirme, but also as an instrument, or meane, whereby we receiue it; and this without any inthralling, as you seeme to feare, of Gods mercifull grace: Neither, as <hi>Hugo</hi> saith, doe these giue, (speaking of the Sacraments) that which is giuen by these,<note place="margin">

Therefore if Christ himselfe, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth saluation, require Baptisme, it is not for vs to dispute or examine, whether those that are vnbaptized, may be saued, but seriously to doe that, which is required, and religiously to feare the danger, which may grow by the want thereof.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing the Church, hath nothing left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, either more powerful, or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently to be esteemed, then the holy Sacraments; it hath bin the policie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, from the beginning, to darken the cleere light of these, with infinit clouds of vnnecessary questions, wholy impertinent, and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to that cause. So that out of due consideration of this great euill, wisemen haue thought it more fit, by application, to make vse of that, which concernes them in this kinde, rather then by curious inquisition to desire, to finde out, what concerneth them not. The whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, which the Church hath, is from Christ; and this by no other meanes but by participation: For Christ to be what he is, is not to be what he is to the Church, but only by a participation of all that he is, (as a mediator) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and vs. This we cal the mutuall, inward hold, which Christ hath of vs and we of him, in such sort that each possesseth other, by way of speciall interest, properly, and inherent copulation: for what soeuer we are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21624:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
according to his election, wee are actually no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in God, then onely from the time of our actuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption into the body of his true Church, into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of his children:<note place="margin">Col. 2.10.</note> wee are therefore adopted sonnes of God to eternall life by participation of the onely Sonne of God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.19.</note> whose life is the welspring &amp; cause of ours. This participation, besides the presence of Christs person, and besides the mysticall copulation thereof, with the parts and members of his whole Church, importeth a true actuall influence of grace,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20,</note> whereby the life which we liue, according to godlinesse, is his, and from him wee receiue those perfections, wherein our eternal happinesse consisteth. This is partly by imputation of his merit, partly by habituall, and reall infusion of his grace; the first whereof, as the ground of all the rest, being the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, maketh a blessed vnion of all those, howsoeuer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisht, by place, or time, who mystically belong vnto that body; and this being the common vnion of all Saints, we fitly terme, the communion of Saints. That of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, maketh vs al sonnes, in which number, how farre so euer one may seeme to excel another; yet touching this, that all are sons, they are all equals; some happily better sonnes then the rest are, but none anie more a sonne, then another. Neither doth this participation, include anie grosse surmise, of any mixture of the substance of his flesh with ours, but is actually deriued vnto his Church, by the vse of his holy Sacraments: Wherein Baptisme doth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge vnto it self, the inchoation of those graces, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation whereof dependeth vpon other mysteries. For the grace which we haue, by the holy Eucharist, doth not begin, but continue life; and therefore no man receiueth it before Baptisme, because nothing is capable of nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that doth not liue. Now life being propounded to all men as their end; those which by Baptisme haue laid the foundation, and attained the first beginning of a new life, haue in the Eucharist, foode prescribed and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for the continuance of life in them. In both the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21624:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
same thing being affoorded (which is a participation of Christ) in our infancie we are incorporated into Christ, and by Baptisme receiue the grace of his Spirit, without any sense or feeling of the gift, which God bestoweth. In the Eucharist we so receiue the gift of God, that we know by grace, what the grace is, which God giueth vs. The degrees of our increase in holinesse, and vertue, we see, and can iudge of them; we vnderstand that the strength of our life begun in Christ is Christ; that his flesh is meat, and his bloud drinke, not by surmised imagination, but truly; euen so truly, that through faith we perceiue in the body and bloud sacramentally presented, the verie taste of eternall life: the grace of the Sacrament is heere as the food which wee eate and drinke. And howsoeuer it was to bee feared, that by the meanes of some, men should be brought to account of this Sacrament, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as of a shadow, destitute, emptie, and voide of Christ; yet now at length, for any thing that I can see, all sides are growne, as it is fit, to a generall agreement concerning that which alone is materiall, namely, the reall partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Christ, and of life, in his body and bloud, by meanes of this Sacrament. The maner how, which ought to be the least part of our consideration, is in this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the greatest difference: So that, considering the small successe, that bitter contentions haue had in this cause, it were to be wished, that men would giue themselues, more to meditate with silence, what they haue by the sacrament; and in humilitie, lesse to dispute, of the maner how: This being the true difference betwixt Christes disciples, and others; that the one, because they enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, disputed: the other disputed not, because they inioyed. For doubtlesse this heauenly food, is giuen for the satisfying of our emptie soules, and not for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising of our curious, and subtill wits. It is sufficient that the sacraments reallie exhibit, what they promise; though they are not really, or doe not really containe in themselues, that grace, which with them, or by them,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21624:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it pleaseth God to bestow. Now the first by all sides being granted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 176.</note> why doe we vainly (saith Maister <hi>Hooker</hi>) trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selues with so fierce contentions, whether by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, or els by Transubstantiation, the sacrament it selfe, be first possest with Christ or no? a thing which no way can either further, or hinder vs, howsoeuer it stand, because our participation of Christ in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, dependeth vpon the cooperation of his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent power, which maketh it his body and bloud to vs, whether with change, or without alteration of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, such as they imagine; we need not greatly to care or enquire for: That being admitted, wherein all agree, (which is a reall presence) why should not the rest in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, rather be left as superfluous, then vrged as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. This is that, which being vttered by Maister <hi>Hooker,</hi> out of great wisdome, argueth as you surmise, that hee maketh light of the doctrin of Transubstantiation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the reuerend Fathers of our Church, doe so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test it; and that so many blessed Martyrs, haue suffered death for denial thereof. Whether the doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation be true, or false (howsoeuer it is plaine what Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> thought) yet, that is no part of the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this time. The matter in question betwixt you and him, is only this: Whether it be not curiosity, to contend for the manner, how, seeing all sides are agreed, that the thing is. For as in those who were to bee cured, by our Sauiour Christ, we ought not curiously to enquire howe the hem of his garment had such vertue, but faithfully to beleeue that it was able to affoord health; so neither in this need the church to be inquisitiue after what maner, Christ presenteth himselfe, but truely to beleeue that he is there present. Which because some irreligious men, at the first doubted; men haue beene driuen to find out these reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable satisfactions, or rather satisfactions to humane reason, from his omnipotencie, <hi>Transubstantiation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> or such like; whereas indeed we know, that in many mysteries of our faith, it is sufficient to beleeue

Neither is this to make Transubstantiation (for deniall whereof so many, as you say, haue died) any light matter, but rather to shew, the great depth of the mystery, and the small profit, that is reaped by the searching of it: for seeing it is on all sides plainely confest; first, that this Sacrament is a true, and reall participation of Christ, who thereby imparteth himselfe, euen his whole entire person, as a mysticall head, vnto euery soule that receiueth him, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery such receiuer, doth thereby incorporate, or vnite himselfe vnto Christ as a mysticall member of him, yea of them also, whom he acknowledgeth to be his owne. Secondly, that to whom the person of Christ is thus communicated, to them he giueth by the same Sacrament his holy Spirit, to sanctify them, as it sanctifieth him which is their head. Thirdly, that what merit, force or vertue
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21624:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
soeuer, there is in this sacrificed body and bloud, we free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fully, and wholy haue it by this sacrament. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the effect thereof in vs, is a reall transmutation of our soules and bodies, from sinne, to righteousnesse; from death and corruption, to immortalitie and life. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that because the Sacrament, being of it selfe but a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and earthlie creature, must needes be thought an vnlikely instrument, to worke so admirable effects in man; we are therfore to rest our selues, altogether vpon the strength of his glorious power, who is able and will bring to passe, that the bread and cup, which he giueth vs, shal be truly the thing he promiseth. Now seeing there are but three differing opinions, for the manner of it; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, Transubstantiation, and Consubstantiation; &amp; al do pleade Gods omnipotencie; the first to that alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which the rest coufesse he accomplisheth; the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of transubstantiation, ouer and besides that, to the chang of one substance into another; the followers of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, to the kneading vp of both substances as it were in one lumpe: and that in this variety the mind which loueth truth &amp; seeketh comfort out of holy mysteries, hath not perhaps the leasure, perhaps not the wit, nor capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, to tread out so endlesse mazes, as the intricate disputes of this cause, haue led men into, how should a vertuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposed minde, better resolue with it selfe then thus? Variety of iudgements, and opinions argueth obscurity in those things where about they differ; but that which all parts receiue for certaine; that which euery one hauing sifted, is by no one denyed or doubted of, must needes be matter of infallible truth: whereas therefore there are but three expositions made of, This is my body; the first, this is in it selfe before participation, really, and truly the natural substance of my body, by reason of the coexistence which my omnipotent body hath with the sanctified ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of breade, which is the Lutherans interpretation. The second, this is in it selfe, and before participation, the very true &amp; natural substance of my body, by force of that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21624:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deity, which by the words of consecration, abolisheth the substance of bread, and substituteth in the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of my body: which is the construction of the Church of Rome. The last, this hallowed food, through concurrence of diuine power, is in verity and truth, vnto faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, instrumentally a cause of that mysticall partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; whereby as I make my selfe wholy theirs, so I giue them in hand, an actuall possession of all such sauing grace, as my sacrificed body can yeeld, and all their soules do presently need; this is to them, and in them, my bodie. Of these three rehearsed interpretations, the last hath in it nothing, but what the rest do all approue, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to be most true; nothing but that which the words of Christ, are on all sides confest to inforce: nothing but that which the Church of God hath alwayes thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: nothing but that which alone is sufficient, for euerie Christian man to beleeue, concerning the vse and force of this Sacrament: finally, nothing but that, wherewith the writings of all antiquity are consonant, and all Christian confessions agreeable: And as truth in what kinde soeuer, is by no kind of truth gainsaid; so the mind which resteth it selfe, on this, is neuer troubled with those perplexities, which the other doe both finde, by meanes of so great contradiction, betweene their opinions, &amp; the true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of reason, grounded vpon experience, nature, and sense. What moueth vs to argue how life should be bread, our duty being but to take, what is offred, and most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly to rest perswaded of this, that if we can but eate, we are safe? Such as loue piety will as much as in them lyeth, know all things, that God commandeth, but especially the duties of seruice which they owe vnto him: as for his darke and hidden workes, they preferre (as becommeth them in such cases) simplicity of faith, before that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which curiously sifting what it should adore, and disputing too boldly of that which the wit of man can not search, chilleth for the most parte, all warmth of zeale, and bringeth soundnes of beleefe, many times into great

hazard. Let it therefore be sufficient for me, presenting my selfe at the Lords table, to know what there I receiue from him, without searching, or inquiring of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how, Christ performeth his promise; let disputes and questions, enemies to piety, abatements of true deuotion, and hitherto in this case but ouer patiently heard, let them take their rest: Let curious and sharpe witted men beate their heads about what questions themselues will, the very letter of the word of Christ giueth plaine securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that these mysteries doe, as nailes, fasten vs to his Crosse, that by them we draw out (as touching effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, force, and vertue) euen the blood of his wounded side; that this breade hath more in it, then our eies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; that this cup hallowed with solemne benediction, auaileth to the endlesse life, and welfare both of soule and body, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Doth he not disswade from this in zeale, only to draw vs, to a better contemplation? Can this in reason be termed any gentle construction of popishe opinions, or priuily to rob the truth of our English creede of her due estimation? thinke not so vncharitably of one, whose principall care was, in the midst of all his knowledge, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow that truth, soundly, and vncorruptly, which was auaileable and sufficient to saue himselfe.

Which demonstrable conclusion, being presupposed, it followeth necessarily, that besides him, all things be finite: it cannot be but that there are bounds, without the compasse wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their substance doth not extend; if in continuance also limited, they all haue it, cannot bee denied their set and their certaine tearmes, before which they had no being at al. This is the reason why first we do most admire those things which are greatest; &amp; secondly, those things which are ancientest, because the one, are lesse distant from the infinite substance; the other, from the infinite continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God. Out of this we gather, that onely God hath true immortality or eternity, that is to say, continuance; wherin there groweth no difference by addition of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after vnto now, whereas the noblest, and perfectest things besides, haue continually through continuance, the time of former continuance lengthened: so that they could not heretofore be said to haue continued so long as now; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now so long, as hereafter. Gods owne eternitie is the hand which leadeth Angels in the course of their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, the hand that draweth out celestiall motion, the line of which motion, and the threed of time, are spun toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What could haue beene more excellently spoken, to haue set downe the frame, and dependance of things, euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> lineally deriued from the first motor? The third thing is this; Church attire (meaning Surplesses) with vs liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth, the glory of Saints in heauen; for it suteth fitly, saith M. <hi>Hooker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Booke 5. pag. 61.

Now whosoeuer considereth that the Angels are said to come out of the Temple, clothed in pure &amp; bright linne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Reuel. 15.6.</note> &amp; that the Angel at Christs sepulchre,

The fourth thing is this: Dayly bruises spirituall promotions vse to take, by often falling.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Here you aske very sillily,<note place="margin">Io the Letter. pag. 37, lin. 2.</note> what be the bruises &amp; falles that spirituall promotions ordained by Christ do or can take?

And I hartily wish, for the good of the Church, that you were able to proue, that he had spoken false in this; to the intent that our reuerend Fathers, the Bishops might bee more beneficiall to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Clergie; more bountiful in hospitality; more honourable in their attendance; more able in their pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their prince; more forward in the memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble works of deuotion; building of hospitals, colledges, and such like: which no doubt, some yet do out of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty: And last of all, more conueniently prouided for the auoyding of such base meanes, as are a hindrance of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:21624:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
religion, a wrong to the Church and a dishonor to their profession. The next thing is this; multiplied petitions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of worldly things, a kind of heauenly fraud, to take the soules of men, as with certaine baites. Where M. <hi>Hooker</hi> answering those, who dislike in our prayers the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed petitions, for earthly things saith; it must be considered, that the greatest part of the world,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 5 <hi>Pag.</hi> 71</note> are they, which be furthest off from perfection; such being better able by sense to discerne the wants of this present life, then by spirituall capacity to apprehend things aboue sense, which tend to their happines in the world to come, are in that respect more apt to apply their minds, euen with harty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and zeale, at the least, vnto those branches of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayer, wherein their own particular is moued; and by this meanes, there stealeth vpon them a double benefit. First, because that good affection, which things of smaller account haue once set on worke, is by so much the more easily raised higher: &amp; Secondly, in that the very custome of seeking so particular aide, and releefe, at the hands of God, doth by a se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These multiplied petitions of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things in prayer, haue therfore besides their direct vse, a seruice whereby the Church vnder hand, through a kind of heauenly fraud, taketh therewith, the soules of men, as with certaine baites. I know not in this point what could haue bin spoken, either more soundly, more plainly, or more agreeable to this purpose. And therefore it must needes be in you, either delicacie, or ignorance to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this a <hi>Theorem</hi> of speculatiue doctrine; the very metaphor of baytes, being not vnfitly applyed, euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> by orators, to the best things: The next is these words: In Baptisme God doth bestow presently remission of sins,<note place="margin">

It seemes, that this speech hath made you to forget that ciuill respect, which had bin fit to one whome worthily you ought to esteeme, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend; for very rudely you say, when, where, or how, did Christ tell thee, that the signe of the Crosse (as we vse it) is the marke of Christ, and preserueth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reproch? Be not caried more violently then the cause requireth: for Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> doth not affirme, but saith, shall I say? and addeth, surely the minde which as yet hath not hardned it selfe in sinne, is seldome prouoked thereunto, in any grosse and greeuous manner, but natures secret suggestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obiecteth against it, ignominy as a bar; which conceit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred into that pallace of mans fancy, the gates wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of haue imprinted in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that holy signe, which bringeth forthwith to mind whatsoeuer Christ hath wrought, and we vowed against sinne; it commeth hereby to passe, that Christian men, neuer want a most effectuall, though a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent teacher, to auoid whatsoeuer may deseruedly procure shame. Let vs not thinke it superfluous, that Christ hath his marke applied vnto that part, where bashfulnes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; in token, that they which are Christians, should at no time be ashamed of his ignominie. The last words misliked by you, in this article are these. Assuredly who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> doth wel obserue how much al inferiour things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the orderly courses and motions of these grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter orbs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hook. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 261</note> wil hardly iudge it meet, or good, that the Angels assisting them, should be driuen to betake themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other stations, although by nature they were not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where now they are, but had change also else where,

as long as their absence from beneath, might but tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably be supplyed, and by descending, their roomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, should become vacant. Heere wholy mistaking Maister <hi>Hooker,</hi> you run into a strange discourse of Angels, of their attendance vpon the elect, and aske where it is reuealed that they attend vpon celestiall orbs, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not sinne, to leaue their naturall charge; and here you aske, whether he meane not the Angels that fel: These, and such like, are those collections which your iudgement thath gathered, wholy mistaking the scope of this excellent speech. For he sheweth here that there may be iust reasons of non-residence, in Vniuersities, in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops houses, and last of all for their imployment in the families of noble men, or in princes courts. For assuredly whosoeuer doth well obserue, how much all inferiour things, depend vpon the orderly courses, and motions of those greater orbs, will hardly iudge it either meete or good, that the Angels assisting them, should be driuen to betake themselues, vnto other stations; although by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they were not tyed, where now they are, but had charge also else where; as long as their absence from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, might but tolerably be supplied, and by descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the roumes aboue, should become vacant. Who vnderstandeth not now, that by orbes are ment those great persons, which by their motion do carrye inferiours with them? And by Angels assisting them, are ment those graue diuines, which are by their wisdome, holinesse, and direction, to moderate their motion? Why then, being but a parable, or an allegorie, run you to examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of orbes, of Angels, of motion; and yet these are things so well knowne, in the Philosophers schooles, as that Maister <hi>Hooker,</hi> had no reason to feare, to take a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude from them, without being called to examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth of the thing it selfe. And this may suffice, for a moderate answere, to those things which in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle are tearmed by you speculatiue doctrine. Only I must ad this, which Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> noteth in a troublesome
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21624:69"/>
aduersary, with whom he had to deale, that in this article, as often<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this letter besides, there are two faults predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, which would tyre out any, which should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare to euery poynt, seuerally; first vnapt speaking of schoole controuersies: &amp; secondly, a very vntoward reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of M. <hi>Hookers</hi> words, that as he which should promise to draw a mans countenance, and did indeed expresse the parts, at least the most of them truly, but peruersely place them, could not represent a more offensiue visage, then a mans owne would be to himselfe; so haue you dealt with M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> where your misplacing of those words, which he hath vttered, hath framed a picture, which as you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect men to looke at it, little differeth from the shape of an vgly monster: for answeare whereunto, this labour is sufficient; wherein I haue set downe, both his words, and meaning, in such sort, that where your accusation doth depraue the one, or that either you misinterpret, or without iust cause, mislike the other; it will appeare so plainly, that to the indifferent reader, I shall not neede to ad any further answeare: for any man may see, that you haue iudged his words, as they doe colours, which looke vpon them with greene spectacles, and thinke that which they see is greene, when indeede that is greene whereby they see.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21624:70"/>
by wounding of some particular men. And howsoeuer that cause must needs be weake, which either hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or his greatest strength, from one priuate man; yet doubtles in common reason it is no small policie, to blemish a truth, by detracting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sincerity and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such, as are the principal defenders of it. How much this part of the world hath cause to esteeme of <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Caluin,</hi> there is no man of any learning that can be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; in which respect, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, by some me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a threefold wrong is don vnto our Church. First, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authors of that religion amongst vs, which by many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth yeers, was far more ancient then they both were: Secondly, to lay the infirmities that were in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as being me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it were too great ignorance &amp; flattery, to acquite them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in that kind) euen vpon the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it self, which had no more affinity with the faults that were in them, then they had, with the framing of that religion, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded first from no weaker author then God himselfe. The last, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrong, which our church hath euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those, who vndoubtedly would seem in their zealous affection, exceedingly to fauour both. The ground of which wrong proceedeth only from hence, that those persons, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, which place, time and other necessities, caused them to frame, ought without exception, to be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute patterne to al the Churches that were round about them: In so much, that that gouerment, which was at the first so weake, that without the staffe of their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, who were not subiect vnto it themselues, it had not brought others vnder subiection, began now to challenge an vniuersal obedience, and enter into open conflict, with the most Churches of <hi>Europe</hi>; but especially with those, which in desperate extremity had bin releiuers of it. Thus, because some few, who neither in quality nor place were much distant from <hi>Geneua,</hi> in opinion of Maister <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> were content to follow their forme of gouernment, others not weighing the riches of that mercy which had made their own Church too great and honorable, to be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:21624:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
framed to so narrow &amp; poore ascantling, began storming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repine, that presently al things were not so bared to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> patterne of those Churches, which in their opinions were most reformed. So that whatsoeuer any man spake or wrote, in disallowance of that, to be our modell to befra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by, or truly to the laying open of those conflictes, (conquered with great policy) which Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> had in the first establishing of that gouernment, all sounded harshly in the eares of these men, and was plainly constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a direct disgracing of Maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> which could be nothing else (as you say) but a discouery of a popish and vnsound affection. Where before I answere to this, I must first tell them, that if they should with the like importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity seek to frame vs to the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the primitiue church, in respect of gouernment, we should tell them that Israel are not bound to the same things in Canaan, that they were in the desert; nor that those reuerend Fathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Bishops, who succeed in that apostolick charg, are not for their maintenance and state, (though the authority be all one) to be framed to that pouerty which was the portion of those, who planted, and gouerned the first Churches. This being then no such necessity, but that the Church may lawfully vse, euen those benefits wherwith God hath blessed her, setting her feete in a large roume, why should men without cause recall her back againe, to her daies of mourning, or feeding her, with the bread of teares, coupe her vp in those narrow limites of subiection, and want, seeing God in his mercy hath prouided for her now, the same gouerment to be administred, in a richer manner? Now how far all men are bounde to speake of those, whom they reuerence and loue, and yet in some cases do thinke not safe to follow, this is that error that hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many. For from hence, the priuate ouersights of those (who, how famous and excellent soeuer, were but men) haue growne, by the violence of some of their followers, to be stifly maintained, as vndoubted truthes, as though there were no difference betwixt being a man not alwaies

This serueth to teach vs, that for those things which we doe and beleeue, wee haue better warrant then mans inuention; and that no man, how excellent so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, (except Christ) may, or ought precisely, to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in all that he doth. For thus while we ad vnto men that honor, a great part whereof peraduenture they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, we detract fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that truth, which we make no where to be found, but in those, who inseparably are followers of their steps. That Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> (who is made by you, the vnpleasing subiect of this article) was, (as Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> termeth him) the wisest man incomparably, that euer the French Church did inioy, since the hower it inioyed him; I thinke there is no man of any reading, that much doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: and surely for learning, and vnwearied paines in his calling, men of best iudgement and vnderstanding, would be ready enough, to giue him that which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto him, if some priuate men out of their loue and zeale, did not too greatly ouerlode him with it: For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, we should be iniurious to vertue it selfe, if we did derogate from them, whom their industry hath made great. Two things there are of principall moment, which haue deseruedly procured him honor throughout all the world;<note place="margin">He preached yearly 286. ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he read 186. lectures euery yeare.</note> the one his exceeding paines in composing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Christian religion, from which most haue glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that haue written since; the other his no lesse indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious trauailes, in the exposition of holy scripture; in which two things, whosoeuer they were, that after him bestowed their labour, he gained the aduantage of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice against them, if they gainsaide; and of glory aboue them, if they consented. Now out of this (so hardly are we taught to keepe a meane) proceeded this intollerable fault, that many were desirous, in an opinion of his worth, that all Churches together with his learning, shoulde swallow vp, without making choice, whatsoeuer other
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21624:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
imperfections remained in him. So that of what account <hi>Peter Lumbard</hi> was in the church of Rome (whom for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular reuerence they called the Maister of the Sentences) of the same, and more, amongst the Preachers of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> was: And they onely were iudged the perfectest diuines, which were skilfullest in <hi>Caluins</hi> writings. His bookes almost were reputed the very Canon for controuersies to be iudged by. To this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and far greater, the partiall affection of loue cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a number of wise men, who from approbation grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to strong praises; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praises, to admiration; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to a tyrannous opinion; that it was wholy vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in any thing to dissent from him. So that now, it was almost as necessarie to dispraise him, as to commend him; because what with discretion, the Church before might haue vsed with much profit, she scarce now could admit, without a generall suspition, thorough all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that we durst not in any thing dissent from him. And doubtlesse, in some weake minds, that which at first was but praise, in the end was not many steps short of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie. So that the practise of <hi>Ezechias,</hi>

For in kingdomes it is high time, either to cut off, or disgrace those, whom the multitude are willing to puffe vp; when (neglecting their owne ruine) they are content to burie the happinesse of their countrey, in the ashes of anothers greatnesse. Thus God both in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and iudgement (in mercie to them that die, and in iudgement to those that are left behind) doth before the fulnesse of yeares, cut off those men, whom other mens erring affections haue aduaunced too high, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueying that from the presence of vnstable mindes, whereunto desert and weakenesse, whilest it was in our sight, gaue strength that it could bewitch.

Giue me leaue to answer you for him, who vndoubtedly would haue giuen a farre better answer for himselfe, if he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; There is not one word that soundeth in that whole discourse, to any other end, towards Maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> but to shew how his great wisedome, wrought vpon their weakenesse; his knowledge vpon their ignorance; his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie vpon their inconstancy; his zeale vpon their disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; only to establish that gouernement, which howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer not necessary for other places, was fit enough perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture for that town.

forth laid open, seeing he saith no more, then their owne learned guides, and pastors haue thought necessarie to discouer vnto the world. But what, say you, hath Master <hi>Caluin</hi> done against our Church, that he should be singled out, as an aduersarie? Surely that harme (though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will) which neuer will bee soundly cured, so long as our Church hath any in it to spurne at the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend authority of Bishops. For howsoeuer those Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall lawes,<note place="margin">12. of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. 1557 13. Nouemb. 1561. 19.

And therefore hee cannot bee free, as an occasion, though no cause of all those troubles, which haue disquieted our Church for these many yeares. But it may bee M. <hi>Hooker</hi> spake not thus against M. <hi>Caluin</hi> of himselfe, but perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded either by our aduersaries, in whose mouth, he is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible champion, or incited vnto it, by some of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Fathers of our Church; and therefore you desire him to resolue you in that point. Can it possibly be, that you should thinke him a man of so great simplicitie, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be moued to attempt it, by the perswasion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or hauing attempted it, that he must needs disclose it? are all those flatterings of the Bishops; that alleaging of their authorities, ended in this, to accuse them as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of doing that, which your conscience maketh you accuse to be euill done? Could you perswade yourselfe, that those reuerend Fathers, whose authorities you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage in the praise of <hi>Caluin,</hi> would be drawne to substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stute another, to dispraise him whom themselues com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended? Is it not a thing differing from sense? void of reason? contrary to religion? And if that be a fault that M. <hi>Hooker</hi> is commended by our aduersaries, in no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, it can be concluded to bee his fault.

The termes of hostility are too violent, and vnreasonable, which denie vs thus far to communicate with our verie enemies. But, you say, this was pride in M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne all those of our owne Church, as too weake to encounter with him; and therefore he must raise Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> out of his sweet bed of rest, to contend against him. And here you vncharitably make a comparison betwixt <hi>Golias</hi> and Maister <hi>Hooker</hi>; only you say vnlike in this, that <hi>Golias</hi> was content to chalenge one liuing and present in the army, demanded, but chose not; sought for one, that was aliue, and vaunted not ouer the dead; in all which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects by your censure, Maister <hi>Hooker</hi> is more presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. To speake the least which is fit to be answered in this place, surely, hee which will take vpon him to defend that there is no ouersight in this accusation, must beware left by such defences, he leaue not an opinion dwelling in the minds of men, that he is more stiffe to maintaine what he hath spoken, then carefull to speake nothing, but that which iustly may be maintained; that he hath not shunned to encounter those, euen the best of that faction in our land, your selues can witnesse: that he nameth M. <hi>Caluin,</hi> onely to this end, to shew the authour of that Discipline,

For those schoole imployments, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by graue and wise men, not vnprofitablie to haue bin inuented; the most approued for learning and iudgment doe vse them without blame; the vse of them, hath bin well liked, by those that haue written in this kind; the quality of the readers of his bookes, though not of the most, yet of those whom the matter concerned most, was such, as he could not but thinke them of capacity very sufficient, to conceiue harder learning then he hath vsed any; the cause he had in hand, did in my opinion necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily require those schoolemen and philosophers that he hath vsed: for where a cause is strangely mistaken, for want of distinctions, what other way was there for him, but by distinctions to lay it open?

no Canons for Maister <hi>Hooker</hi>: And although you being troubled in minde, doe thinke that his writings, seeme like fetters, and manacles; yet no doubt he hath met both with readers and hearers, more calmely affected; which haue iudged otherwise. But it is a strange presumption in my opinion,<note place="margin">In your letter pag. 35. lin. 29.</note> for priuate men, such as professe themselues to be but common Christians, (which your writings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides your owne confession, doe make manifest) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a forme, either of writing or teaching, so plaine and familiar, or rather indeed so empty, and shallow, that no man may doubte, how vnlearned soeuer, to giue his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is an honour to performe that which is excellent; so it is a vertue to approue that which is excellently performed; where to be wanting in the first, may be slouth, or ignorance, but to be wanting in the latter, must needes be malice. Fewe there are, or haue beene in any age, which reaping the due recompence of their labour, haue done that good, which they ought, and haue not receiued that reward which they ought not. Wise men haue thought no otherwise, but that this common lot, might be their portion; yet the feare thereof, could not haue that power ouerall, to make them in that respect, wholy &amp; vnprofitably silent: Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that euen that which they suffred for well doing, was their honour; and that which they did well, and suffred for it, was others shame. This vice, in my opinion, is not more vsuall with anie, then with vs, who by reason of the corrupt quality thereof, haue imposed a silence to a great number, who by their writings, doubtlesse, would haue bin verie singular ornaments vnto Gods Church: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as strangers of lesse merit, haue a twofold aduantage. The one, that we read their writings without preiudice of their persons; the other, that with a desire of nouelty, we gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily deuoure (as we do fashions) whatsoeuer we think to be done by strangers; this onely in all things (how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent soeuer) being cause enough of dislike, that it is home borne; but more iustly of silence, that it is disliked. So that when we haue sifted, whatsoeuer is likely to be reproued, euen the last thing to be examined, is the stile itselfe. Thus haue you dealt with Maister <hi>Hooker,</hi> whom as in all other things, you haue set vpon the racke; so in this you haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon you far more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beseemeth either the modesty,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21624:78"/>
or the small learning that is vsually found in such, as professe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, to be but common Christians. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely to iudge of a stile, is not the least point of learning, though it be the least known: but peremptorily, to dislike, which you do, is more then only to iudge. For this, is but to deliuer a speciall verdict, as we thinke our selues; but the other is to take vpon vs, exactly to tell what the law is. Some I haue seene, excellently writing vpon the variety of stiles; and the best, in my opinion, is one <hi>Pascalius,</hi> who was like enough to iudge well, because he himselfe wrote an excellent stile; yet surely there is in no point of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, greater varietie of tastes, then there is in this: some preferre <hi>Salust,</hi> others <hi>Caesar,</hi> a third <hi>Seneca,</hi> a fourth <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>; in one word, euery man according to his owne fancy. This, as it is in stiles, so it is in the seuerall actions of men; where they are no sooner borne into the world, but Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as a gossip names them. A thing I confesse needfull, and vnfit to be prohibited, seeing we reape oftentimes, more benefit by our enemies, then our friends; yet this sheweth, that the world is vnhappy, where the best offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are performed by our worst acquaintance. If we come to Authours, some dislike <hi>Plato,</hi> as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> did, calling him confused; others say, I only esteem <hi>Plato,</hi> who doth so cunningly weaue knowledge, and vertue together, as if he said, he were content to giue you knowledge, vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you should be honest. Some compared <hi>Aristotle</hi> to that fish,<note place="margin">

Where it seemes you are desirous to reprehend, if you could but resolue of the maner how. I dare not take vpon mee to censure those, whom you say he is vnlike; <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Iewel, Whitgift, Foxe, Fulke</hi>: but I perswade my selfe, that whatsoeuer their other vertues were, wherein peraduenture they were more eminent, yet doubtlesse the best of them that now liueth, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge M. <hi>Hookers</hi> stile to be very excellent. And although it is vnmeet I should compare him with others, whose labours haue beene profitable in another kind, yet I hope I may say without offence, that as profoundly to iudge, with sound variety of al learning, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to him with diuers others; so to expresse what he conceiued, in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence of a most pure stile, was the felicitie almost of himself alone. That honorable Knight S. <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> gaue a taste in an argument of recreation, how well that stile would befit an argument of a grauer subiect; which it may be is more vnpleasing in the taste of some, because the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is learned, &amp; the subiect is not agreeing to their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Doubtlesse the perfecting of a stile, and especially of our English stile (which in my opinion, refuseth not the purest ornaments of any language) hath many mo helps,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21624:79"/>
then those honorable places of learning, the Vniuersities, can affoord. And therfore in those things, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue (and some of them conceiue much) there are found in the Princes court, diuers most purely eloquent, whom euen the best in the Vniuersities may despaire to imitate. And (if I may speake without offence) I am fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that M. <hi>Hookers</hi> stile (if he had had lesse learning) (a strange fault) (for the weight of his learning made it too heauy) had bin incomparably the best that euer was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our Church. If our English story had been borne to that happinesse, euer to haue beene attired in such rich or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, she might worthily haue beene entertained in the best courts that the world hath; but all Countries know our actions haue beene better done then they haue beene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>old. Of things affected we may giue a reason, but to aske, as you do, a reason of M. <hi>Hooker</hi> for his stile, it is all one, as if you asked him why he knew so much. For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse out of iudgement he made this choise (in my weake opinion, or strong fancie) simply the best, and (without comparison) imitable to few. Therefore your comparison of the bramble was vnfit, which by a shew deceiued you a farre off; for there is much more by a narrow view to bee discerned in him, then hee seemeth to promise at the first sight. Three things you desire with all instancie. First, to shew what arguments he hath alleaged, which are not to be found in the answer of that reuerend Father vnto M. <hi>Cartwright.</hi> To satisfie you in this demaund, if there were no difference, yet the consent of their arguments were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son enough, for you to allow M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> seeing you haue giuen your approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the works of that most reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Father,<note place="margin">

Secondly, you desire, that if he set forth his other books, which are promised, that he would be more plaine, and sensible. Concerning those three bookes of his, which
