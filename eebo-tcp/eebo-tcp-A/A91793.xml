         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

and to be abhorred by all, and is the onely way to bring
in and defend all errors, on the other ſide, if wee affirme that the
minde of God is ſo expreſſed in the letter, in ſo many words as he that
can reade may ſee it, is to deny any Interpretation of Scripture, and
to deny them to be a Myſtery: But without controverſie, great is the
Myſterie of godlineſſe, and he that obſerves the variety of expreſſions
in Scripture concerning one thing, may well confeſſe; that unleſſe the
holy Spirit reveale to us the deepe things of God, wee cannot knowe

for the ſubſtance of it, it clearly appeare in the Scripture: which is
to be our Rule, both for Doctrine, and manners. Some place juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
to be onely in the Conſcience, but wee place it onely in Chriſt
where it is, and to whome it belongs: Juſtification conſiſts in take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of ſinne, and none but Chriſt can doe that; juſtification &amp;
acceptation are one: For without juſtification there is no acceptation,
and ſeeing wee are accepted in Chriſt wee are juſtified in him; If our
juſtification be a ſpirituall bleſſing (as it is) then it is in Chriſt
where all ſpirituall bleſſings are, Bleſſed be God, who hath bleſſed us
with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 13. Where our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption

faith? There is a light in faith, and as our blind eyes and da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſeeking to be juſtified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 17. Becauſe this knowledge is that
which juſtifieth our Conſciences.</p>
            <p>Alſo wee confeſſe that he that beleives not hath no knowledge of
any juſtification, all that are without faith they are viſiblely in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
ſtate, there is not the leaſt appearance to the contrary, no
man may apply ſalvation to ſuch as beleive not, nor may they apply any
to themſelves, ſuch as beleive not have no injoyment of God, no true
peace, no evidence of life, no right to Baptiſme, or the Supper, they
cannot ſee the myſtery of the Truth; He cannot honour God nor love
the truth, nor ſuffer for it. Yet faith cannot ſatisfie juſtice, nor merit
the pardon of the leaſt ſinne, only Chriſt can doe that. And that expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
that gives moſt glory to Chriſt and leaſt to man, I beleive is
the truth, and that which occaſioned me to write at this time. For
ſince my Booke intitled the <hi>Saints Deſire</hi> hath been publiſhed, I
<pb facs="tcp:114234:4"/>
have received ſeverall Objections againſt what I have write in <hi>Page</hi>
147. Namely, That wee are juſtified by Chriſt alone, and not by
our beleiving. Some affirme the contrary, their Reaſons with an
anſwer I here preſent to your conſiderations: Becauſe I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
I have written the truth, &amp; that the contrary opinion is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in that they aſcribe not their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
to him alone; but to ſomething elſe, namely, their beleeving.
You know this Doctrine I contend for, is the Doctrine of free Grace,
in the knowledge whereof you finde ſweetneſſe, becauſe the works of
your ſalvation is finiſhed by Chriſt; Whoſe workes are all perfect,
This glads your hearts and keeps your ſoules from fainting, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
all objections, that otherwiſe would diſcourage us, this is the
Fountaine that cannot be drawn dry, that ever flowes with ſweet &amp;
ſtrong conſolation, full of Spirit and life: where our ſoules may
drinke freely at all times, and be refreſhed with this marrow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
That all is finiſhed. My deſire is that they into whoſe hands
this ſhall come, would conſider ſeriouſly what I have written, and
know that no man is to be beleived upon his bare word; therefore ſearch
the Scriptures whether theſe things be ſo or no, &amp; if any thing I have
written be not according to them, that they let that goe. My whole
ſcope and aime in theſe few lines, is to prove that we are juſtified by
Chriſt alone, who is our juſtification, and that wee are not juſtified
by any thing that is in us. 2. That faith or any thing in us is not a
cauſe, meanes, or condition, required (to pertake of the Covenant of
Grace, juſtification or ſalvation) but onely fruits and effects of the
Covenant, Thirdly, That the elect were ever in the love of God, &amp;
did ever ſo appeare to him juſt and righteous, in and by Chriſt. We
have known and beleived the love that God hath to us, God is love,
and he that dwells in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. The
God of love ſo unite all the hearts of his people to his truth, and one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, that ſo we may walke in the truth, and live and die in love.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is nothing that fraile man is more lyable
to, then in the things of God to miſtake; and
call darkneſſe light, and light darkneſſe, ſo by
how much the more ſpirituall any Truth is, by
ſo much the more men are apt to fall ſhort of
the knowledge of the glory of it; and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingle
with it ſomething of their owne, as that which may make
it commendable and beautifull in their eyes: And above all
others that which this ſmale inſueing Treatiſe ſpeakes of,
Namely, <hi>Juſtification by Chriſt alone;</hi> Without having reſpect
either to any thing in the creature, or done by the creature.
This favouring ſo much of pure grace in reſpect of the love of
God, and that Covenant which lies between Chriſt and God;
as that the poore creature, man, knowes not how to owne or
receive it. And truely it muſt be no leſſe nor no other power
put forth by God to cauſe the ſoule to be beleive this, then was
put forth in raiſing up Chriſt from the dead, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
            <p>And truly amongſt thoſe who are the beloved ones of our
Lord Jeſus, who have a like ſhare &amp; intreſt in him as their life &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:114234:5"/>
peace: There is an aptneſſe in men to miſcarry in the knowledge
of this rich grace of God; Some being apt to conceive that there
is no Juſtification of a creature in no ſenſe before and without
faith, and ſo make Faith a joynt-partner with Chriſt in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
of Juſtification: For indeed this is to me a certaine truth,
that whatſoever gives a being to a thing muſt needs be a part of
that thing which it gives being to, and therefore if there be no
Juſtification in no ſenſe conſidered, but as it hath reſpect to
faith. It is much to be feared, That that opinion claimes a great
ſhare of that glory which is peculiar to Chriſt Jeſus alone. That
the Scripture holds forth juſtification by faith in a ſenſe is very
cleare: but yet under no other conſideration, but by way of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1, 2. And as it reſpects the taking away of ſin from
off the Conſcience: For indeed the debt is paid by the bloud of
Chriſt alone, and wee are therefore ſaid to be juſtified by his
bloud, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. For indeed as Chriſt Jeſus our Lord hath
paid the debt, <hi>The Lord having laid upon him the iniquities of us all.</hi>
So doth he declare this (ſatisfaction and acceptation of us in
Chriſt) by faith; That being the eye of the underſtanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the ſoule comes to ſee the great things which God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

wherein it behooves you to beg with much earneſtneſſe ſtrength

their ſinnes away: Was his love which was in himſelfe, nothing

            <p>The Summe of all is, That Jeſus Chriſt by once offering

away, put to an end, blotted out and utterly deſtroyed all the
ſinnes of his people for ever; and preſented them juſt, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and holy, without ſpot before God.</p>
            <p>This will appeare, to be true if yee conſider theſe ſeverall
Reaſons, which are proved by plaine Scriptures.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Becauſe that was the time which Chriſt was to doe this

when Chriſt died, therefore it is ſaid,</hi> The yeare of my Redeemed is
come,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 1.</note> Iſa. 63. 4. <hi>Yea,</hi> the houre is come ſaith Chriſt, Joh. 17. 1.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Becauſe, Chriſt was ordained of God to take away ſinnes,
and to preſent us holy,</hi> Who verily was fore ordained to redeeme us
with his precious blood, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. 20. For he hath made him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114234:6"/>

            <p>3. <hi>Becauſe Chriſt was mighty to ſave. Therefore he did
do this work himſelf alone:</hi>

travelling in the greatneſſe of his ſtrength? I that ſpeak in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
mighty to ſave. I have troden the wine-preſſe alone, and of the
people there was none with me. I looked, and there was none to help;
therefore my own arm brought ſalvation unto me. <hi>Iſa. 63. So that
Chriſt did all this work alone, for none elſe could help. Then</hi>
thou ſpakest in a viſion to thy holy One,<note place="margin">Pſal 89. 19.</note> and ſaid, I have layed help
upon one that is mighty. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 19.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Becauſe Chriſt took fleſh on purpoſe to effect this work:</hi>
Wherefore when he came into the world,<note place="margin">Hebr 10.</note> he ſaid; Sacrifices and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

all the puniſhment due to us for ſin:</hi>

Hebr. 9. 28. Thus we are now, as we are in Chriſt in reſpect
of his righteouſneſſe, which is ours though it be in him; I
ſay this our perfection and happineſſe is in reſpect of our
juſtification, and as we are in Chriſt: for as we are in our

Chriſt) in our bodies, in the fleſh, we are not capable of ſo

But theſe Scriptures are all true: therefore we are all <hi>fair,</hi>
without <hi>fault</hi> and <hi>ſpot,</hi> and we are ſo as we are in Chriſt, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114234:7"/>
ſo we were made all this by Chriſt when he dyed. And ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

upon his croſſe made us ſo, and ſo preſented us to God. <hi>Col.</hi>
1. 20. 22.</p>
            <p>18. Becauſe Chriſt did all that was needfull to be done to
make us perfect, and preſent us holy. For what can be more
required to the juſtification of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

So that his bearing their iniquity was that which did juſtifie
them; and by his knowledge he knew whoſe ſins he bore, <hi>viz.</hi>
whom he juſtified. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11.</p>
            <p>19. Chriſt upon the croſſe did this work for us, becauſe
the Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">Rev. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſay that they are not done away,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 5.</note> is to contradict God in his

be <hi>manifeſted to take away our ſins,</hi>

it, he did not do it: for he did it not, if it be ſtill to do.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>Becauſe Chriſt ſaith this work is finiſhed, therefore it
is ſo: for he is the</hi> faithfull and true witneſſe; <hi>therefore we may

might be fulfilled) ſaith, I thirſt. When Jeſus therefore had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114234:8"/>
gave Chriſt to do was the work of our ſalvation, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in taking and deſtroying our ſins, and preſenting us
holy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 19. 28 30.</note>

            <p>Therefore if when Chriſt dyed that was the time this was
to be done, and if Chriſt was ordained to do it, if Chriſt was
mighty to ſave, if Chriſt took fleſh to do this work, if it was
the will of God that he ſhould do it, if Chriſt came on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to do it, if our ſins were layed upon Chriſt, and he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the puniſhment the curſe of them, if he hath redeemed
us; if it was propheſied of him that he ſhold juſtifie many, and
that his work ſhould proſper; if Chriſt did anſwer his types;
if he hath exceeded all the Prieſts and ſacrifices under the
Law; if there needs no more offerings for ſin; if Chriſt hath
done all the Law required, if Chriſt hath done what he
came to do, if we are juſtified by his blood, if he hath made
us holy, and preſented us without ſpot, if we are free from
all ſin, if Chriſt hath done all that can be done to make us
juſt and righteous, if Chriſt did waſh away our ſins in his
own blood, if Chriſt hath ſaid, It is finiſhed; then it's done,
it's done, it's done, perfectly and compleatly done: and then
what I have ſaid is fully proved, namely, that Jeſus Chriſt

            <p>The queſtion then is,<note place="margin">1 Cor 6. 11.</note> by which of theſe we are juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God:<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.</note> we conceive that is onely by Jeſus Chriſt. Our
Reaſon why we aſcribe it to Chriſt alone, is:</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Iſa. 45. 25. &amp; 53. 11.</note> Becauſe it was promiſed of Chriſt, that <hi>he ſhould justifie
many.</hi> Iſa. 45. 25. and 53. 11.</p>
            <p>2. Reaſon: Becauſe when the Scriptures expreſſions ſeem
to contradict one another, thoſe expreſſions that aſcribe
moſt to Chriſt are the cleareſt and neareſt the center, the reſt
are to follow that, and be interpreted by them; for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
are to be interpreted for Chriſt, and not againſt him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the whole voice of the Scripture being
layed together, doth wholly drive to ſet up, and exalt Jeſus
Chriſt alone,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 11.</note> to acknowledge him to be as he is <hi>all in all:</hi> Col.
3.<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 9.</note> 11. therefore he is called, <hi>The Author of ſalvation:</hi> Heb. 5. 9.

Col.<note place="margin">Col. 1. 14.</note> 1. 14. and <hi>Salvation it ſelf:</hi> Iſa. 49. 6. And if we ſhould not

            <p>4. Becauſe all things elſe beſides God are but means of
our knowing and injoying him that is the ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>5.<note place="margin">Act. 26. 18.</note> Becauſe all that faith can do, is onely to <hi>receive remiſſion

ſatisfie juſtice, nor merit pardon for the leaſt ſin, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 9.</note> Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>We a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e justified by his blood:</hi>
Rom. 5. 9, &amp;c. Theſe and the like Reaſons cauſe us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that we are juſtified onely by Chriſt alone.</p>
            <p>And therefore when the Scripture ſaith we are juſtified by
faith, by faith, we are to underſtand Chriſt: or elſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it not properly, but in a large ſenſe, not as if faith did
juſtifie us, but onely Chriſt. For 1. it is the language of the
Scripture to give</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:114234:18"/>
The names of things to that which is not the thng,
but the ſimilitude of it;<note place="margin">1 Sam 28. 14, 15.</note> thus the ſimilitude of <hi>Samuel</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Samuel: 1 Sam.</hi> 28. 14, 15. And an Image is called a God:
So the Prieſts offerings are ſaid to cleanſe men from ſin, <hi>Levit.</hi>
20.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 11.</note> 30. and yet they nor their offering did not take away ſin.</p>
            <p>2. So we may be ſaid to be juſtified by faith, as well as we
are ſaid to be juſtified by our works:<note place="margin">Iam 2. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 24. becauſe by it
we are juſtified to men, and cannot be juſtified before men
without faith and works. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe faith hath a relation and dependance on
Chriſt, the one implyes the other as a father implyes a ſon;
and an husband a wife, they are relatives. Faith looks onely
to Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 20, 21.</note> and fixed in God: <hi>That your faith and hope may be in

                  </gap>d.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 20, 21. Faith and Chriſt go together, where one
is preſent, the other is preſent alſo. And,</p>
            <p>4. Inaſmuch as faith moſt honours God, and is all for
God,<note place="margin">Phi. 3 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and we enjoy the comfort of our juſtification through
faith,<note place="margin">Rom 5. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Phil. 3. 9. Rom</hi> 5. 1. it may have the name, in as much as
faith is an effect of juſtification; Now it is the manner of
Scripture to put the effect for the cauſe:<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 33.</note> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 33. with
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 16. for making haſte in <hi>Iſa. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſhall not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi>
Shame and confuſion being an effect that follows haſte.
So <hi>ſinners are ſaid to love death,</hi> becauſe they love ſin which is
the cauſe, and death the effect. Some affirm faith doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
becauſe by faith we receive our juſtification: by the ſame
reaſon the hand that receives a pardon from the Prince, it
may be ſaid his hand pardoned him; and why may he not
as well ſay he pardoned himſelf, becauſe his hand did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it? I thought giving and receiving had bin two things.
And if faith may be ſaid to juſtifie, becauſe it receives juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
ſure it is in a very large ſence. And ſeeing we by the
act of faith receive juſtification, &amp;c. then it's the acts of faith
that juſtifieth. Which yet ſome evade.</p>
            <p>Secondly, our faith, that is to ſay, our beleeving cannot
juſtifie us, becauſe it is not our righteouſneſſe. For not any
thing can be our righteouſneſſe or juſtification unto us, but
that which is made ſin and curſe for us, onely Chriſt is both

theſe to his:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note>

               </gap>t appears, that faith is none of the three witneſſes in

            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:114234:20"/>
If faith did juſtifie us, would it not follow that faith were
greater,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13 13.</note> and more to be prized then love? yet love is greater:
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13.</p>
            <p>We may more properly be ſaid to be juſtified by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
the Word of God, then by our beleeving, for that is
that which evidenceth to us our juſtification by Chriſt, and
happineſſe by him; for how could we know the ſafetie and
happineſſe of a beleever without the Word? or that the
<hi>world was made of things that did not appear but by the Word.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 2, 3.</note> Heb.

               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 42. 89.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, we are not juſtified by our beleeving, becauſe all
that are juſtified are juſtified before they beleeve: which will
appear, if ye conſider,</p>
            <p>1. The titles given to ſuch perſons whom Chriſt juſtified,
they are termed <hi>ſinners,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 4. 5. &amp; 5 8. 10.</note> 
               <hi>enemies, ungodly:</hi> Rom. 4. 5. &amp; 5. 8. 10.
The Scripture doth not call any that are beleevers, ungodly;
they have their name from their better part: therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
are called <hi>holy, Saints, living ſtones, babes in Chriſt.</hi> And
therefore ſeeing they were juſtified when ungodly, they were
juſtified before they beleeved; and therefore their beleeving
did not juſtifie them. <hi>Chriſt juſtified many,</hi> by bearing their
iniqnity;<note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 5. 6. 11.</note> he in taking away our ſins, made us righteous, and
this was our juſtification:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Iſa. 53. 5. 6. 11. Rom.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
            <p>2. If I am to beleeve I am juſtified, and that all my ſins are
forgiven me, is it true or falſe? If it be true, that I am to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve:
<hi>Iſa</hi> 40.<note place="margin">Iſa. 40 1, 2.</note> 1, 2. then I was a juſtified man, and free from all
ſin before I beleeved it;<note place="margin">Rom 8 16.</note> and therefore I am to beleeve it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it's true. If it be not true, and ſo is falſe, then it ſeems
I am to beleeve a lye; and for me to beleeve I am juſtified
when I am not, is to deceive my ſelf in beleeving that which
is falſe. Alſo if I am to beleeve I am juſtified, when I am not
juſtified, that ſo I may be juſtified, is to beleeve that which is
falſe that it may be true; which is unreaſonable: becauſe
neither faith nor unbeleef can make any thing true or falſe,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114234:21"/>
nor cauſe the being of that which had no being before.</p>
            <p>Therefore when Chriſt by his Spirit and Word of truth
declares and reveals to a ſoul that all his ſins are forgiven,
and waſhed away in the blood of Chriſt, &amp;c. it is a certain
truth,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 6.</note> and it is <hi>the holy Spirit that bears witneſſe, becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is truth.</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 6. Therefore ſeeing we are juſtified by
Chriſt before we beleeved it, we may not beleeve, that faith
in us was either a cauſe or a means, or any inſtrument of it,
but onely a means of our receiving the knowledge of it, and
of our injoying the comfort of it.</p>
            <p>And as for ſuch as are troubled becauſe they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
as they think; all that I can ſay to them is, Uſe the
means to know where life is: wait upon God, he cals one at
the third houre, and another at the eleventh, thou knoweſt
not but there may be life in the Son for thee, it is there for
thee if thou belong to the election of grace, elſe not. Alſo if
if thou hungereſt and thirſteſt after righteouſneſſe, <hi>viz:</hi>
Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. thou art bleſſed, and ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, they that ſay they are juſtified by their belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
know not what to ſtand to; ſometimes it is the act of
faith juſtifieth them: ſometimes it is not the act, but as it is a
grace, then not for the excellency of it, but becauſe God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
it for righteouſneſſe, then that there is a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in faith it ſelf. We place juſtification in Chriſt alone, by
which means we are at a certainty.</p>
            <p>And they that think otherwiſe, if they pleaſe, let them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
me in theſe few queſtions. 1. Whether faith in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and power of it unacted do juſtifie, or no: if yea, I deſire
to know how the power to beleeve apart from the exerciſe
of it, can be known to us. 2. How it may fitly be called faith,
when there is no beleeving, as there is not without the act,
ſeeing faith and to beleeve is one thing: and whether the
ſame light and power, &amp;c. be not the ſame power by which
we obey the reſt of Gods commands: and if it be, how you
can diſtinguiſh it apart from it's act; and if it juſtifie as it is
a grace unacted, can you tell how, and when you were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114234:21"/>
and if it may abide in the ſoul one houre, and not act,
why not two, and ſo two ſeven yeers? and whether then this
opinion doth not imply that a man may have faith in him,
and be juſtified by it, and yet he never beleeve, nor know it.
And if Faith juſtifie in reſpect of the righteouſneſſe or meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſneſſe
of it; whether it will not follow, that we are
righteous in our ſelves, and ſo ſtand in no need of any righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
in another; and ſo need not live by faith in the
Son of God, ſeeing we have our righteouſneſſe in us.</p>
            <p>If there be no merit, no righteouſneſſe in the act of our
beleeving, but onely God is pleaſed to accept it for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
and reckon it ſo; whether it will not follow, that
God eſteemes, and accepts of that for righteouſneſſe, and
imputes it for righteouſneſſe which is not ſo in it ſelf? and
whether this is for his honour or no? and whether it tends
not to the diſhonour of Chriſt, that his righteouſneſſe in him
is not ſufficient, and may not be that which juſtified thoſe he
dyed for?</p>
            <p>Alſo whether one act of faith juſtifieth, or many? if but
one, how we ſhall know and diſtinguiſh it, that we may know
we are juſtified, that we may not after that act, act it ſo again
in like manner needleſly: for what need more then one, if
one be enough?</p>
            <p>If many acts of faith be required to juſtifie a ſinner, then
it's neceſſarie to know how many, that ſo we may know
when we are juſtified: if we are continually to act our faith,
becauſe we ſin continually, then it will follow, that we are
not fully and compleatly juſtified, and that we may deſpair
of ever having one quarter of an houres ſweet injoyment of
juſtification, becauſe in leſſe time then that, yea in the 40.
part of an houre, no man can ſay he hath not ſinned in that
time. And if ſo, then he is to be juſtified again, becauſe he is
unjuſt, and appears ſo to God: ſo a man cannot ſay three
minutes together he is a juſtified man, till by faith we be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
again. And whether this be not for a man to juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

            <p>That God accepts of faith, and ſo of us for it; that for

            <p>That faith is a means eſſential to ſalvation, and ſo a cauſe,

and that he is not the means, but a part of the means of our

3. If faith be a condition required to partake of the
covenant of grace, then there is a condition required, and ſo
the covenant of grace is not abſolute, nor free. If it be ſaid,
God gives what he requires. I anſwer. That makes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
eaſie to be performed; but ſtill if faith be as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
required, there is a condition: but the covenant of grace
is abſolute and free, and unconditionall on our part. And
that this appears,</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Pſal 89. 19. 24. 27, 28.</note> Becauſe the covenant of grace is not made with man,
but is onely between God and Chriſt: <hi>Thou ſpakest in a viſion
to thy holy One, thou ſaidst, I have layed help upon one that is mighty,
I have exalted one choſen out of the people. My faithfulneſſe and my
mercy ſhall be with him: I will make him my firſt-born, higher then
the Kings of the earth. My mercy will I keep for him,</hi> ☜ <hi>my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
ſhall ſtand faſt with him.</hi> Pſal. 89. 19. 24. 27, 28. So that
all the conditions of the covenant did onely belong to
Chriſt to perform; ſeeing Chriſt had undertaken it, and he
onely was ingaged to it, and he did it to the utmoſt, which
was,<note place="margin">Pſal. 53. 10, 11</note> that Chriſt <hi>ſhould be made a ſacrifice for ſin, and be ſhould ſee
his ſeed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 35, 36, 37.</note> 
               <hi>and prolong his dayes: and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhould

            <p>2. And ſeeing no covenant is made with the elect, there
is nothing required from them as any cauſe or conditions
without which they cannot be ſaved: as appears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10,
11,<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 10, 11, 12.</note> 12. For our ſalvation depends not upon our beleeving,
but upon Chriſt: <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> Joh. 14. 19. And
that there is not the leaſt condition required from man to
partake of the covenant of life and ſalvation, appears by
theſe words:<note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>His ſeed will I make to endure for ever. If his children

As, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 15. &amp; 24. 24.</p>
            <p>Now to declare one to be juſt, cannot make one juſt for
theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. If to declare one to be juſt doth make a man juſt, then
he was not juſt before.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">Rom 3 3, 4.</note> God and wiſdom are ſaid to be juſtified by men; <hi>Rom.</hi>
3.<note place="margin">Matt. 11 19.</note> 3, 4. <hi>Matth. 11. 19. Luk.</hi> 7. 35. But if to declare him to be ſo,
makes him ſo,<note place="margin">Luk. 7. 35.</note> then he was not ſo before. Which to affirm, is
blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>3. If to declare one to be juſt, doth make him ſo; is it not
good to juſtifie the wicked, and their actions? becauſe it muſt
needs be good to make the unjuſt juſt. But all the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of juſtification the wicked and their actions can have,
they remain wicked, and their actions ſinfull ſtill.</p>
            <p>4. We grant, God by his Spirit declares to the ſoul that
he is juſt and righteous; but if they were not made juſt (by
Chriſt upon his Croſſe) before, will it not follow, that he <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth
the wicked?</hi> which, he ſaith, <hi>is abomination to him.</hi> Prov.
17. 15. for they muſt either be juſt or wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if juſt, then the
declaring them to be ſo by ſentence did not make them juſt.
And if they were not juſt, what were they but wicked? is
there a third ſtate?<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 7.</note> God hath ſaid, <hi>He will by no means clear the
guilty.</hi> Exod. 34. 7.</p>
            <p>5. Becauſe men are not juſt and righteous; becauſe they
are declared to be ſo; But they are declared to be ſo, becauſe
they were ſo before. Therefore ſuch as God declares to be
juſt, they were made juſt, juſtified in and by Chriſt; and he
looked upon them to be juſt (as they were) before he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them to be ſo. And no man may declare another to be
juſt and innocent, before he appear to be ſo.</p>

and juſtification it ſelf; ſo he is the author of our ſalvation,
and the means, and ſalvation it ſelf; as is above proved. So
that Chriſt is all in all.</p>
            <p>Juſtification is firſt to be conſidered in the will of God,
ſometimes called purpoſe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 45. 10.</note> counſell, choice, election, prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination,

ſurely it had no beginning.<note place="margin">2 Tim 3. 9, 10.</note> And thus the elect are ſaid

how could he bear the ſins of many, if he bore not the ſins of

                  </gap> holy to

               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 21.</note> as he did, <hi>Rev. 1. 5. Col. 1. Eph.</hi> 1. 5. If he did not preſent
our perſons? Alſo if Chriſt took onely our nature, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all men being one and the ſame, it will follow he did
as much for all men as for one; and that he bore not the ſins
of any man: for the nature of man may be conſidered apart
from the perſon of a man, or elſe they know not what they
ſay, who affirm, Chriſt took our nature, but not the perſon
of any.</p>
            <p>Juſtification being accompliſhed by Chriſt, it is his good
pleaſure to reveal the ſame to thoſe to whom it belongs, by
his Spirit and Word, and his people and ordinances; all
which hold forth and declare this his infinite love, and free
grace to their ſouls, that ſo they may enjoy the comfort of it.</p>
            <p>The effect of this revelation of love, &amp;c. begets love in the
ſoul to God,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 11.</note> and carries the ſoul out of it ſelf, it's own life,
it's righteouſneſſe, to Chriſt; and his righteouſneſſe looking
to him as all in all, and ſo to ſet him above all. Now the ſoul
falls into admiration of free love, free grace, highly pricing
it, is ſatisfied in it, and thankfull for it: and now the ſoul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the revelation of this love, &amp;c. ſo it's filled with
love to God, peace and joy in God, &amp;c. So he ſubmits to
Chriſts yoke, obeys him, and ſuffers for him; now he follows
God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:114234:29"/>
So then the cauſe of our ſalvation, or juſtification, it:</p>
            <p>1. The love of God, the good pleaſure of his will, this is
called the efficient cauſe of our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>2. The materiall and inſtrumentall cauſe is Jeſus Chriſt

the time of our union; a thing may be in us, when the

to be in us by faith: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17. becauſe by faith we enjoy the

<hi>Faith is the ſubstance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things
not ſeen.</hi>
               </p>

As for <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 36. that declares who hath everlaſting life, <hi>viz.</hi>
he that beleeves hath it, but what is this to union with

And whereas you ask what converſion that is, that is

we are made partakers of the Divine Nature by

               <p>So you ask, if God ſaves us without our being in Chriſt, and

degrees in love in God, and ſometimes more, and ſometimes
leſſe; and that ſometimes God was without any love at all: for
you ſay, it was but a purpoſe of love, not actuall love; and that
purpoſe and an act of love are immediately contraries. It ſeems
I was miſtaken, I thought a purpoſe of love could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> I wonder why you contend ſo for this expreſſion, that
God loved the elect from all eternity; ſeeing the Scripture for
once calling it love, cals it purpoſe, choice, counſell, election,
predeſtination, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's no wonder we contend for it, ſeeing there be many
that deny it to be love: <hi>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</hi>
Gal. 5. 9. And when men will confeſſe it is love, as the Scriptures
declare, we will ceaſe contending. We beleeve alſo that all thoſe
expreſſions do hold forth love, and are one with it.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing you confeſſe it's called love, we earneſtly intreat
that you, nor no other do deny it to belove: for as Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and will is eternall, and unchangeable, ſo is his love; <hi>God
is love.</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
               <p>So you ask where is life, and where is peace till faith comes?
I anſwer. It is where it ſhould be, it's in Chriſt: <hi>Col. 3. 3, 4. Who is
our peace.</hi> Epheſ. 2. 14. And when we beleeve, we enjoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of our life, and not till then.</p>
               <p>So you object againſt this doctrine (of juſtification by Chriſt
alone) what need we take care what we do, if we beleeve he will
not love us the better; if we beleeve not, he will not love us the
worſe: then a man may dye without faith, and yet be ſaved.
Anſ. If this be all, the Papiſts ſay as much againſt you for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
that men are loved, juſtified, or ſaved for their good
works. Say the Papiſts, if our good works cannot make us to
beloved, or juſtified, &amp;c. what need we take care to do good
works, if we do them God will not love us the better; if we do
them not, he will not love us the worſe: if we dye without good
works, yet we may be ſaved. Conſider what anſwer you will
give them, and take it to your ſelf, for we ſay the ſame of faith.
So you tell us a ſtory of a Mayd led away with this doctrine,
ſaid boldly to you, that ſhe knew not how ſhe could offend Jeſus
Chriſt by any thing ſhe did: unleſſe we did know what ſhe
meant by the word offend, we can ſay little to it, ſeeing it may
bear a good or a bad conſtruction. If ſhe had ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever was
