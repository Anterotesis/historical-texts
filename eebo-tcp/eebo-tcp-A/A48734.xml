            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my Honoured Friend, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Parishioner, <hi>Joseph Alston,</hi> the elder, <abbr>Esq</abbr> at <hi>Bradwell</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Bucks.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN compliance with your <hi>Desires,</hi> which, where there is Friendship, have the weight of <hi>Commands</hi> in them, (though there wanted not Those neither from Mr. <hi>High-Sheriff</hi> your Son,) I have at last ventured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world that <hi>Discourse,</hi> at which, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of it, your domestick Grief having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed you for the Publick, you could not be present. It comes forth with this Advantage, if this be one; that 'tis somewhat larger by the Accession of many things, which time would not give leave then to Inlarge upon. If there be any further benefit or satisfaction may redound to the <hi>Reader</hi> from it, as it now appears, (which
<pb facs="tcp:61394:3"/>
I dare not hope for) you have a particular Right to challenge the Acknowledgment: this <hi>Sermon</hi> having bin begotten under your roof, conceived and born within your walls, and so of Due be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to you; the Old <hi>Law</hi> both Sacred and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil having ordered, that <hi>Children born in the House should</hi> be reckoned into the <hi>Master</hi>'s Possession; and it being the Vsual Course, which the <hi>Municipal Law</hi> it self prescribes, that poor Children and Wanderers be sent back to the place of their Birth to be provided for.</p>
            <p>Sir, Having given you some small account of my <hi>Obedience,</hi> I cannot but think my self obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to acquit my self also in some measure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the score of <hi>Gratitude. Thanks</hi> is the least Return can be made: there will be more; the <hi>Prayers</hi> of our poor drooping <hi>Parish-Church,</hi> which you by your late seasonable Kindness have put Life into. For I need not assure you (as one that are so well acquainted with the purport of Holy Writ, and studied in Gods promises, which are to None more Ample, then to the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and <hi>cheerful Giver</hi>) that as <hi>Charity</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is the surest way of putting our Wealth out of the reach of Fortune: so particularly Bounties to <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Publick Uses</hi> have in several regards
<pb facs="tcp:61394:3"/>
peculiar and large <hi>Retributions</hi> ascertained to them, both in our Temporal and Eternal concerns. If this Freedom of Mentioning, what you perhaps wish might have been Concealed, offend; I must mind you, that such Actions as these, where the very <hi>Example</hi> many times is as useful as the <hi>Benefacture,</hi> though they are not to be done to that <hi>End,</hi> yet our Saviour says they must be done in that <hi>Manner,</hi> that men may see our good works and glorifie God.</p>
            <p>Sir, this sorry <hi>Inscription,</hi> whatever It is, begs your Acceptance, as a hearty, though a mean <hi>Testimony</hi> of those Respects, that are Due to you from Him, who is</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>1 SAM. VII. 15.16.</bibl>
                  <p>And <hi>Samuel</hi> judged <hi>Israel</hi> all the days of his life.</p>
                  <p>And he went from year to year in Circuit to <hi>Beth-el,</hi> and <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> and judged <hi>Israel</hi> in all those places.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE very Notion of <hi>Judging</hi> implies a Law: there being such a mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and relation betwixt the <hi>Judge</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> that they infer one another, and the denyal of one takes away the other also. No <hi>Law,</hi> no <hi>Judge</hi>: No <hi>Judge</hi> no <hi>Law.</hi> For how shall <hi>Samuel</hi> judge, if he have not a <hi>Rule</hi> laid before him, according to which judgment is to be made? and that <hi>Rule</hi> is the <hi>Law.</hi> And on the other side, to what purpose serves the <hi>Law,</hi> if there be not some <hi>Person</hi> authorized, who may interpret that Law, and apply it to particular cases, and see it put in due and orderly execution? and that <hi>Person</hi> is the <hi>Judge.</hi> If then there be a <hi>Judge,</hi> it follows that there is a <hi>Law</hi> also, by which as he is <hi>impowered,</hi> so he is to be <hi>directed.</hi> We have a <hi>Reverend Judge</hi> before us in the <hi>Text,</hi> on the <hi>Seat.</hi> It will be necessary then, in order to their acting, to open their <hi>Commission</hi> first (as is usual) and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61394:5"/>
to shew the <hi>Law,</hi> by authority whereof <hi>Samuel</hi> and all his fellow-Judges are to <hi>Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Law</hi> is as connatural to Man, as his <hi>Reason</hi> is. For what is <hi>Reason</hi> it self, but a <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? This is that, which constitutes and denominates us <hi>Men.</hi> For he that doth not govern himself accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the prescript of right <hi>Reason,</hi> lives not the life of <hi>Man</hi>; and consequently doth both transgress the <hi>Law,</hi> and forfeit the <hi>Priviledge,</hi> of his <hi>Creation</hi>; either by sensuality and lust degrading himself into <hi>Beast,</hi> or by envy and malice and spiritual wickedness trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himself into <hi>Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence out of the source of <hi>Reason</hi> flows the Law of Nature, <hi>jus non scriptum,</hi> the unwritten Law, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> terms it, <hi>the Law written in every Mans heart:</hi> his conscience accusing, or excusing him, in every thing he does, according as he in his actions thwarts or complies with this Law. This is that the great <hi>Orator</hi> speaks of, <hi>Lex non posita, sed insita; non imperata, sed innata:</hi> a Law not speaking to us from without; but implanted in the mind of Man, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven in his very constitution. To this <hi>Law</hi> belong all those <hi>Common Notions,</hi> by which we are taught to acknowledge the <hi>Existence of God,</hi> and to distinguish what is <hi>Honest,</hi> and <hi>Just,</hi> and <hi>Becoming</hi> the Nature of Man (whether Alone or in Society) and what is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. And by this very <hi>Law</hi> we are instructed to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our behaviour, as Men, in a fair <hi>decorum,</hi> piously towards God, soberly towards our selves, and justly, and modestly, and charitably too towards other men; for even <hi>charity</hi> it self is an act of <hi>justice</hi> (so the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew terms it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) at least the doing that to others, as the <hi>Royal Law</hi> bids us do, which were we in their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61394:5"/>
condition, we would have done to our selves.</p>
            <p>To these Heads of <hi>Piety</hi> to God and <hi>Justice</hi> to Men, a learned <hi>Rubbin,</hi> in his discourse with the King of <hi>Cozar,</hi> reduces all the <hi>Laws of Nature</hi>; grounding them upon those two places of Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. <hi>What does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear him, and to love him, and to serve him?</hi> and <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8. <hi>What doth the Lord require of thee, O man, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> And the same <hi>Author</hi> further tells us, that these <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Statuta Intellectualia</hi>; (so he calls them, as things which natural Reason, and humane Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of it self, without any prompting, judges fit to be observed) I say these laws of Nature are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily pre-required, as preparatory exercises, to the knowledge and performance of the <hi>Divine Law</hi>; as things, without which no Society can subsist; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Thieves,</hi> though they be unjust to others, yet are forced upon this principle to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice a kind of justice amongst themselves, that they may keep their party together upon fair and equitable terms.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> then; and truly would we live up to the direction of That, we should not need any other Law. But upon the fall of man <hi>Nature</hi> it self being universally (as it was) <hi>corrupted</hi> as well as <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and the Notions of <hi>Original Righteousness,</hi> through prevailing wickedness, which has increased all along proportionably with mankind it self, being in a manner wholly defaced and obliterated; it was necessary, that Law should be recovered, and re-imprinted upon the memory of men, that even vulgar understandings should have their duties plainly laid out before them:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61394:6"/>
and this to be done by <hi>Positive Laws</hi>; which being founded, as near as might be, upon those of <hi>Nature,</hi> as being the productions of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>convenience</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, might accommodate general <hi>Rules</hi> to particular <hi>Instances,</hi> according to circumstances of time and place, and the exigencies of the state of things for the security of government, and the safety of the people to be governed. This God himself provided for in the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Common-wealth; by prescribing them Rules not only for their <hi>Moral</hi> behaviour; (for these were of perpetual universal obligation to all mankind, and this was that <hi>Law</hi> written in the heart, before it was engraven upon stone) but for their <hi>Civil</hi> affairs also, and even to the very <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in his publick worship. The first of these, namely, the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as I said, obligeth all men whatsoever; and no less, if not more, now, since <hi>Christ</hi> is come, then before: but as to the two latter, the <hi>Judicial</hi> and the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Laws, God has left particular <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> to the liberty of their own determinations, so to order both <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> jurisdiction, as may be most expedient; provided they command nothing contrary to that law, which he himself hath given us; I mean, the <hi>Moral Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To give two or three <hi>Instances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theft</hi> is forbidden in the <hi>eighth precept,</hi> and by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Law was to be punished (amongst the Jews) only with a <hi>fourfold restitution</hi> of the thing stoln, in kind, or of the value of it. But in most <hi>Christian States,</hi> upon tryal or possibly mistrust, that that punishment would not prove a sufficient restraint; the penalty is altered, and the Thief dies for it: nor is any allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to claim the benefit of the <hi>Judicial Law,</hi> when he

breaks the <hi>Moral,</hi> but is justly sentenced by the Law of his own <hi>Country</hi>; that Law having been made only for the Jews, and every Nation now being to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Laws of its own.</p>
            <p>Again, for the <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>seventh day</hi> from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which is commanded in the <hi>fourth precept</hi> to be kept holy, was a thing <hi>ceremonial</hi>; but the keeping of <hi>one day in seven</hi> or some such proportion of time, was perhaps a <hi>Moral</hi> duty. The <hi>Christian Church</hi> therefore has both laid aside the <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and preserved the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi> by changing the day.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the <hi>Worship</hi> of God is a duty the very Law of Nature requires of men in Society: Now for <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Habits,</hi> and the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, (since God cannot be woshipt otherwise, I mean, without some Form and Ceremony or other) these are to be ordered by the <hi>Churches</hi> appointment; and every Member of that Church (I speak of a <hi>National Church</hi>) is obliged, unless he can be sure such appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are against Gods Law, to obey and comply with her Orders.</p>
            <p>But, what some say, that in <hi>Civil</hi> concerns indeed we are tied up to the Laws; but in <hi>Church</hi> affairs we are left to our own choice and liberty; is no more vain and frivolous, than 'tis absurd and irrational. For a man may upon as good reason demand to fashion the <hi>Laws</hi> to his own mind, by which he means to Live; as to shape his <hi>Religion</hi> to his own fancy and Interest: since he is alike accountable to the Government for both, and <hi>separations</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> may prove of as dangerous a consequence to the Publick, as <hi>divisions</hi> in <hi>State.</hi> For he that has made himself his own <hi>God,</hi> ('tis an expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a late <hi>Author</hi> against <hi>Atheism</hi>) will by his good
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61394:7"/>
will be his own <hi>King</hi> too. And it may very well be suspected, that those who grumble at <hi>Church-Orders,</hi> would not, if they could help it, be very well satisfied with the <hi>Civil Laws</hi> neither, they both having their Rise from the same Authority. At this pass were things in <hi>Israel,</hi> when every man did <hi>that which was right in his own eyes,</hi> and then 'tis said they did <hi>that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</hi> And so it was always, when there was <hi>no King in Israel</hi>; Wherefore to prevent such <hi>disorders,</hi> and to deliver them from those <hi>distresses,</hi> their disorders brought upon them, God often raised them up <hi>Judges,</hi> the last whereof was <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> here, <hi>a Priest</hi> and <hi>a Judge. And Samuel judged Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which words consider we him,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his <hi>station</hi> or <hi>Residence,</hi> as a <hi>Judge</hi> upon the <hi>Bench</hi>: he <hi>judged</hi> Israel <hi>all the days of his life</hi>; and that at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> where his house was, as it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In his <hi>Journey</hi> and <hi>Circuit,</hi> as a <hi>Justice</hi> in <hi>Eyre</hi>: he <hi>went from year to year in Circuit to</hi> Bethel <hi>and</hi> Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus like the standing and moving foot of a pair of <hi>Compasses</hi>; his <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>setled</hi> judicature was at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> and the <hi>occasional</hi> exercise of it <hi>from year to year</hi> at other places also.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to his constant <hi>Residence,</hi> wherein four things are to be taken notice of:
<list>
                  <item>1. His Person; <hi>Samuel.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. His Office; <hi>to judge Israel.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. His Patent; <hi>all the days of his Life.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. His Seat, out of the next verse, <hi>Ramah.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61394:7"/>I. First for the <hi>character</hi> and qualification of the <hi>Person. Samuel</hi> was <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Priest</hi> as well as <hi>Judge, Right Reverend</hi> in all his <hi>capacities,</hi> in all his <hi>functions:</hi> Nor was it any objection against him from the people, that he was a <hi>Church-man,</hi> and so unfit to serve his Country in a secular charge. Nor was it to him any scruple of Conscience within his own breast, that he intangled himself with <hi>civil</hi> affairs, or took upon him more imployments, than one man could well go thorough. 'Tis true, he was devoted by his Mother in his long coats to the Churches service; <hi>I have lent him,</hi> says she, <hi>to the Lord, as long as he lives, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 28. and accordingly he after <hi>Eli</hi>'s death succeeded him in the Priesthood. Again <hi>all Israel</hi> (the Text tells us) <hi>from Dan even to Bersheba knew, that Samuel was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished to be a Prophet of the Lord, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. And not only so; a <hi>Prophet</hi> himself, but a trainer up of young Prophets, the <hi>President</hi> of a Colledge at <hi>Nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth</hi> in <hi>Ramah. Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. And here 'tis said <hi>he judged Israel all the days of his life.</hi> These were three such imploys, as for the <hi>attendance</hi> they requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not well be managed by one Person; as for the <hi>consequence</hi> and high concernment of them, ought not in prudence, one would think, be intrusted with any one. Yet this consideration was so far, from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disadvantaging the publick, or disparaging any of those places, or discouraging the person that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them, that his Government brought great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings to the People, and honour to himself, and glory to God. For such was his <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> such his Ability of <hi>Judgment</hi> and Integrity of <hi>Life,</hi> such his <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Conduct,</hi> such his constant <hi>Piety</hi> to God, and affectionate <hi>Zeal</hi> for publick good, such his <hi>Favour</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61394:8"/>
with God and his <hi>Reputation</hi> with the People; that in all <hi>Israel</hi> no three men could have been met with, singly qualified for any one of those three Trusts, as he alone was for all three. Nor did it make a little for the Peace and Unity and good order of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> that the same Person was <hi>Supreme Governour,</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi>; which else in some cases might clash, and give advantage to a factious people, one against the other. Nor it seems was this the first time, that both <hi>Powers</hi> thus met in one <hi>Person</hi>: For <hi>Eli,</hi> who was his immediate Predecessor in the Priesthood, had been <hi>Judge</hi> forty years before; nor is it unlikely, that this <hi>civil Office</hi> might together with the <hi>sacred function</hi> be devolved upon him by succession, as he was <hi>Priest</hi>; the <hi>Jewish</hi> Writers telling us, it was not unusual, that in later times the <hi>High Priest,</hi> if he were reputed a Wise and a Good man, was chosen into the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and made the <hi>Nasi,</hi> which is as much as with us the <hi>Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident</hi> of the <hi>Supreme Court</hi>; and in former times we find in Scriptural Language that <hi>Cohen</hi> signified both <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Prince.</hi> Nor was it for nothing that at first, before <hi>Aarons</hi> Family was settled, the <hi>Priesthood</hi> went constantly along with the <hi>Primogeniture</hi>; whereupon <hi>Esau</hi> is branded for <hi>profane,</hi> because he so slightly part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Birthright. Afterwards indeed <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> being Brothers, did by Divine appointment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Powers, the one managing the <hi>Sword,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Keys.</hi> Nor do we meet with any Instance, where they were joined again, till <hi>Eli</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> who were <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> too: But as these, being <hi>Priests,</hi> had the <hi>Supremacy</hi> in <hi>State</hi> also; so from <hi>David</hi> downwards, the <hi>Kings</hi> were <hi>Supreme-Moderators</hi> in the Church; as appears by <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61394:8"/>
and by the Reformations of <hi>Josiah, Hezekiah,</hi> and the like. And this, though it may not look altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so pertinent to this time and place, has howsoever this useful <hi>remark,</hi> that the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> ought not to think himself unconcerned in the Interests of the <hi>Church,</hi> and that since <hi>Priests</hi> have formerly done the office of Judges, <hi>Judges</hi> on the other hand may think it to be some obligation upon them to take care, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity shall offer, of the Priest: that so <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> whose Interests have sometimes so fairly met and kindly imbraced one the other, being lodged in one and the same bosome, may ever, though asunder and intrusted into different hands, yet lovingly agree, and be friendly and helpful one to the other.</p>
            <p n="2">II. From the <hi>Person</hi> we come to treat of the <hi>Office,</hi> that he was <hi>the Judge of Israel:</hi> and of that
<list>
                  <item>1. In its <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. In its <hi>Power.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. In its <hi>Extent.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. And lastly in its <hi>Rule.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. First for the <hi>nature</hi> of it; as there can be no Judge without a Law, to authorize and direct him; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that it might be said to him, as it was to <hi>Moses,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had his Commission; <hi>Who made thee a Prince and a Judge over us</hi>? and our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, when addressed to for dividing the Inheritance, asks the same question, though otherwise in all points qualified for the office, <hi>Who made me a Judge?</hi> so on the other hand, without a Judge, Law it self would be of no use: For how would Laws be executed, or publick order be preserved? Wherefore as the God of nature has provided Laws, whereby men are to be governed,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61394:9"/>
so he has not been wanting to invest some men, in all places and at all times, with <hi>authority,</hi> to secure those Laws, and to punish the violations of them. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is the <hi>supreme</hi> Judge. Next under him, in every mans own breast, his own <hi>Conscience,</hi> as Gods depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, exercises soveraign <hi>Rule,</hi> calling him to the <hi>Bar,</hi> and arraigning him, and either acquitting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him; to which end that <hi>Faculty</hi> is furnished with a kind of <hi>Omniscience</hi> (which no Judge from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out has, that can but Judge <hi>Secundum allegata &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata)</hi> she, I say, is conscious to all a mans thoughts as well as actions, alledges and proves all he has done or said, or so much as design'd; and, as God himself will, not only sits upon a man as his <hi>Judge,</hi> but Stands out against him too, as a <hi>witness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this inward <hi>Reflexive Judgment</hi> of the Soul of Man upon it self, this <hi>Home-Circuit</hi> is not enough to do the business of <hi>Society.</hi> In this our corrupt State, wicked men have partly found out ways to bribe, to corrupt and debauch, this <hi>Judge</hi> within them, partly have arrived to that impudence and insensibility in sinning, that they have hardned themselves against the <hi>sentence,</hi> as well as against the <hi>dictates</hi> of <hi>conscience,</hi> and in the pursuit of what pleaseth a vitious <hi>appetite,</hi> and a depraved <hi>will,</hi> neither regard the one nor the other, having by bold and frequent attempts upon conscience worn out all that <hi>Awe,</hi> which naturaly eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ows to himself. The case of the generality of men standing thus, it was necessary, that for external <hi>polity,</hi> whereby men are joyned together in <hi>society,</hi> God should depute other <hi>Judges,</hi> besides <hi>conscience,</hi> (since it would have been so dangerous to have left men barely to that) who might take care, <hi>nè quid
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61394:9"/>
Resp. detrimenti capiat,</hi> to prevent mischiefs that might befal community from disorderly persons, by restraining at least the outward actions of men, and bringing them to account for them. And this he has ever done. Let us a little trace it to the <hi>Original.</hi> This <hi>Judiciary power</hi> then was at the first founded by God in <hi>paternal authority</hi>; the Father of the family having then <hi>jus vitae &amp; necis,</hi> power of life and death, and of dispensing other punishments upon those of his own family, according to their demerits: as the examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> turning out his son <hi>Ishmael</hi>; of <hi>Noah</hi> cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Cham</hi>; and of <hi>Judah</hi> sentencing his Daughter-in-law to be burnt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do shew. One evident footstep of this <hi>parental power</hi> appears, even in the <hi>Judicial</hi> Law, in the Case of the <hi>Rebellious Son,</hi> who was to dye with his Father's hand upon him first: so that, even upon this account, every man, that comes into the world, is born under a <hi>natural subjection.</hi> Now when mankind was multiplyed, and men were to be united into larger <hi>societies</hi> and greater <hi>bodies</hi>; then all the <hi>Families</hi> of the kindred were to be gathered and consolidated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some onè head, the <hi>Patriarch</hi> or chief Father of all the several Families. And this power by lineal descent fell to the <hi>Eldest</hi> Sons; so that the <hi>first-born</hi> were, by prerogative of their birth, Kings and Priests; unless there happen'd a forfeiture, as it was with <hi>Esau,</hi> and <hi>Reuben,</hi> who were therefore justly put by. Afterward when <hi>kindreds</hi> themselves, what with the propagation of their own Families, what with the commixtion of strangers, were so inlarged, that they became <hi>Nations</hi>; then the government was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with <hi>Kings,</hi> as Gods Vicegerents. For, though there be other <hi>Forms,</hi> which I shall not now dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61394:10"/>
yet the <hi>Monarchical</hi> has this advantage at least over them all, that it was the first, and far the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of them all; as the Historian <hi>Justin</hi> has observed, that <hi>principio rerum,</hi> at the beginning of the world, <hi>that is,</hi> when the world was first divided into <hi>Nations,</hi> it was governed by <hi>Kings.</hi> This among all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but then God having a special care of his own people, did not at first set up Kingly Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, (though afterwards upon their desire he did) but to maintain the <hi>Theocracy,</hi> his own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among them, did, upon occasion of great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or imminent dangers, raise them up <hi>Judges,</hi> who were tantamount to <hi>Kings.</hi> Nay <hi>Moses</hi> himself gives himself the very Title too; <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.5. where he says, that <hi>Moses was King in Jeshurum, when the heads of the People and the Tribes of Israel were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And thus <hi>Sufetes,</hi> which is the word for <hi>Judge</hi> with the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> their descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as well as with the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> is used by <hi>Seneca</hi> and others, that speak of those people, for the <hi>Supreme Magistrate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And such was <hi>Samuels power,</hi> here, as that of all the other <hi>Judges</hi> before him, differing from the <hi>Kingly</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>name</hi> then <hi>substance,</hi> as to the exercise of it. Some tell us, it was much-what like that of the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in that they were raised only upon <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occasions,</hi> and intrusted with an <hi>arbitrary power.</hi> 'Tis true, as the <hi>occasion</hi> was <hi>extraordinary,</hi> so 'twas fit their <hi>power</hi> too in some measure should be. But then these Judges of ours differed from them in this, that these had extraordinary assistances from God; not to say, that these having taken upon them once the Government, some of them, as <hi>Eli, Samuel,</hi> &amp;c. ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61394:10"/>
laid it down again, nor returned back to their private condition, as they all did, but <hi>JulJus Caesar.</hi> By this <hi>power</hi> then they were instated in a <hi>supremaecy,</hi> and were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> unlimited, <hi>unaccountable</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appealable. They had the universal dispensation of <hi>Justice,</hi> an absolute right to make War and Peace, command of mens <hi>persons</hi> and <hi>fortunes,</hi> and power of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> And all other <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> derived their authority from them. It is the opinion of some, and those learned, that the great <hi>Council of Seventy,</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> for his assistance set up by the advice of his Father-in-law <hi>Jethro,</hi> to help him in the tryal of lesser causes, usually called the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Jewish Parliament,</hi> continued down from <hi>Moses</hi> without any interruption till <hi>Herods</hi> time; if so, then the <hi>Judge</hi> was <hi>chief</hi> over them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides there were <hi>lesser Courts</hi> too in each City, much like our <hi>Hundred-Court's,</hi> and <hi>Courts-Leet</hi>; to judge of smaller matters; who, as they received their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the <hi>Supreme Court,</hi> so might be appealed from to it. And all these inferiour <hi>Courts</hi> subordinate to the great <hi>Consistory,</hi> and that it self to the <hi>Judge.</hi> But I rather incline to <hi>GrotJus,</hi> who thinks that in these times all the bands of Government were losened amidst the popular licentiousness, when every one did what they list, and that there were no <hi>Courts</hi> at all kept to call them to account; but that God raised these <hi>Judges</hi> on purpose, as well to recal the people to good order, as to deliver them from the oppression of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: since the History makes it clearly out, that, at every vacancy or <hi>interval</hi> of Government, the people fell off a fresh into their former <hi>disorders,</hi> and those disorders brought new <hi>troubles</hi> upon them, which both
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61394:11"/>
occasioned the raising of a new <hi>Judge,</hi> to rescue them from one and t'other, from their sins, and from their foes. For so we find Judge <hi>Samuel</hi> in this very <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> first call them together to <hi>Mizpeh</hi> for a Fast and Humiliation, before he venture them to Battel against the <hi>Philistines.</hi> However it were, these <hi>Judges</hi> had not their power from the people, though sometimes the peoples consent and desire too was not wanting; but immediately from God himself. And so is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably with all supreme <hi>Magistrates.</hi> For that <hi>Ascham</hi>'s position is not true, that they receive their power by compact and agreement of the people; this one argument amongst many, is enough to evince; that no man in the world has power over his own Life; and consequently cannot transfer that power to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he has not himself. Nor has the whole <hi>Community</hi> together that power, since the particular persons, which make up the Community, have no such power, and the <hi>whole</hi> cannot have more in it, then the <hi>parts</hi> had to contribute to it. The <hi>Judicatory power</hi> then is not derived from the <hi>people,</hi> but from <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self transmitted to the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>supreme,</hi> and from him to the <hi>Judges,</hi> as <hi>Ministers</hi> of Justice sent by him: the <hi>King</hi> being the <hi>fountain</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And this to the whole body and every part of it, in all its concerns; which is the <hi>extent</hi> of this power. First over all <hi>persons</hi>: for so 'tis said of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that he gathered all <hi>Israel</hi> to <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> and there judged them. The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> indeed priviledgeth her <hi>Priests</hi> from the <hi>civil judicature</hi>; and there are <hi>Others,</hi> though seemingly of far different perswasion, that would fain
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61394:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have it believed, they are not concerned in Law, or consequently in government, upon that assertion of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that <hi>the Law is not made for</hi> the righteous; and in another place, where he speaks of <hi>meekness, temperance,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>against such there is no Law</hi>: and I agree to them, that <hi>if they do well,</hi> as the same <hi>Apostle</hi> says, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>they need not fear</hi>; but that upon this condition then, <hi>eâ Lege,</hi> if they observe the Law. For what says the Apostle elsewhere? <hi>Do we then by faith,</hi> (and I may say, do we then by our good works) <hi>make void the Law? yea rather we establish it,</hi> by performing what it commands. Further, <hi>Innocence</hi> it self may be impleaded, and so fall under the inquisition of the Law; and 'tis the evidence must fetch her off. The <hi>Law</hi> then is for clearing, and acquitting the <hi>guiltless,</hi> no less then for condemning <hi>criminals.</hi> As at a <hi>Goal-delivery,</hi> the <hi>Billa vera</hi> casts the <hi>Prisoner,</hi> the no-evidence of the fact sets him free.</p>
            <p>Again, as this judicial power is over all <hi>Persons,</hi> so 'tis in all <hi>Causes,</hi> Temporal by the <hi>Judge,</hi> Spiritual by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> by each as the Kings Delegate. And <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> acted in both these capacities here; so that he had the people upon a double account obliged to him, for the punishment of <hi>crimes,</hi> and the decision of <hi>contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies</hi> in both <hi>Courts, Civil,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the sentence in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12. where having sent them to the <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>Judge,</hi> he tells them, that <hi>He that will do presumptuously, and will not harken to the Priest, or unto the Judge</hi>; that does not stand to their award and submit to their judgment, <hi>even that man should dye.</hi> Of those who pretend submission to the <hi>Judge,</hi> but have not the same obedience for the <hi>Priest,</hi> and so would own but half a <hi>Samuel,</hi> we have

            <p n="4">4. As, also we have at large in the very <hi>entrance</hi> of the discourse treated of the <hi>Rule,</hi> to wit, the Law; according to which judgment is to be made; so that we need not have much more to say. The <hi>Law</hi> then, by which the <hi>Judge</hi> is to be regulated, is in the first place, the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which indeed is no other then the <hi>Moral Law</hi>; and to this all mankind stands obliged and accountable. Whence the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, that very Heathens, by the light of Nature, <hi>know the judgment of God, that they who do such things, i. e.</hi> such as are forbidden by the Law of Nature, <hi>are worthy of death.</hi> Let me only take notice by the way, that there are some, who acknowledge no such thing as a <hi>Law of Nature</hi>; but that these things we call <hi>Laws,</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented upon emergent necessities or politick designs, and so are only <hi>ex instituto &amp;</hi>

               </gap>, by institution and compact; and so are <hi>impositions</hi> rather of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or but <hi>compositions</hi> at best, of the Subjects, with the government, then Laws. The <hi>Poets</hi> and some Ancient <hi>Philosophers</hi> too, who knew not the original of mankind, make a pleasant <hi>story</hi> of it, that men were used at first to fall out and quarrel about their Acorns, and other such provisions, Nature could furnish them with before the invention of Tillage; and with fists first, and then with clubs, disputed their rights; till at last the strongest, to be sure, got the better: but then he, that was strongest today, by ill hap, many times, meeting with one stronger then he the next, was forced to resign the booty of his last conquest. By this means being tired with these daily Frays, and grown weary

of their <hi>Club-Law</hi>; one wiser then the rest perswades them to quietness, and tells them, if they would agree and live civilly together, there would be enough for them all. Whereupon the <hi>major</hi> part of the weak ones out-voting the strong, who were but few, and would have been apt to fall out among themselves, and could not, if they had held together, made good their smaller party against a multitude in league; they were all content; and presently <hi>Articles</hi> were drawn up, and <hi>Laws</hi> made, and <hi>Rules of society</hi> consented to; by which all mankind has, ever since, time out of mind been governed. Nor has a late (I am sorry I cannot call him <hi>Christian Philosopher</hi>) mended the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but made it much worse: who in his <hi>Leviathan</hi> sets down that for <hi>doctrine</hi>; which with them past only for <hi>fancy,</hi> or at best but <hi>conjecture.</hi> According to this great <hi>Master of</hi> corrupt <hi>reason,</hi> every man is <hi>free,</hi> and has a <hi>natural right</hi> to every thing, he can make himself master of: only men for <hi>fear</hi> of distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, and out of care of <hi>self-preservation,</hi> combin'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Societies,</hi> or else over-powerd by <hi>force,</hi> (for here lies the Argument with him, that the longest sword creates the best <hi>Title)</hi> gave up their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that <hi>right,</hi> they had by <hi>Nature</hi> to all things, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to unequal terms for <hi>peace</hi> sake; chusing rather to sit down by the loss, and enjoy a <hi>little</hi> with quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then hazard their security by venturing at <hi>all.</hi> Hence sprang <hi>Propriety</hi>; hence <hi>Rules of Government</hi> and <hi>Politick Constitutions,</hi> which are no longer valid, says that <hi>Author,</hi> then they have <hi>power</hi> to back and justifie them. But if it be so, that <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> are the principles of <hi>Society,</hi> and the grounds of <hi>Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; then what hinders, but, when a man can shake

off that <hi>Force,</hi> or be rid of his own <hi>apprehension,</hi> he may return to his natural <hi>Freedom,</hi> and re-assume his antient <hi>Rights?</hi> At this rate <hi>Wives, Monies, Estates,</hi> all <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> are exposed as a prey to the bold; and the <hi>Thief,</hi> if his design hit, has a better claim then the <hi>Owner</hi>; and <hi>Rebellion, Murder, Rapes</hi> and <hi>Rapines,</hi> if attended with success, prove <hi>lawful</hi> actions; and 'tis miscarriage only makes them <hi>Crimes.</hi> And the main reason, that <hi>Author</hi> offers against these practices, is not because they are in themselves <hi>unlawful,</hi> but because they are to the designers <hi>unsafe.</hi> These are impious and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>Tenets.</hi> Alas! if we hold together upon no better terms then these, where are we? we lye hourly at the mercy of those, that dare be wicked: and what incouragement would this be to wickedness, if men were perswaded once, that, as they grow <hi>prosperous</hi> in villany, they cease to be <hi>wicked?</hi> But I have shewed before, that there is no such natural <hi>Freedom,</hi> he talks of; and that we are born <hi>Subjects</hi>; and consequently, that natural <hi>Right</hi> he speaks of, is under <hi>restraints</hi> and <hi>limitations.</hi> 'Tis true, God made <hi>Man</hi> a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature, and <hi>Lord</hi> of the rest of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But how? not so, as that any one man should ingross the whole to himself, and exclude all others, his fellow-men, from a share in that <hi>dominion.</hi> That were not <hi>reasonable</hi> (that where there is an equal <hi>right,</hi> there should not be an equal <hi>share</hi>) and by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nsequence not sutable to the nature of <hi>Man.</hi> For he that made Man <hi>reasonable,</hi> made him <hi>sociable</hi> too. He was to Marry, to beget Children, to maintain and govern a Family, to provide for those that belonged to him. His <hi>Children</hi> were to be obedient to him, to accept of his provisions, to use their own industry; and, when
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61394:13"/>
they came to be Masters of Families themselves, to take the like care of them. Hence came <hi>Proprieties,</hi> hence <hi>Inheritances,</hi> hence <hi>Purchases,</hi> hence <hi>Trades, Callings, Professions,</hi> and other honest courses for getting a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood: Thus, we see, our first <hi>Parent</hi> bred up his Children, the one to be a <hi>Husbandman,</hi> the other to be a <hi>Shepherd</hi>; Intimating, that every one is by Nature to live by his own <hi>labour,</hi> and not by invading anothers <hi>right.</hi> These are the great purposes of <hi>Society</hi>; and all this agreeable to <hi>Nature,</hi> whose grand maxim 'tis, <hi>To do as we would be done by.</hi> There is then a <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum</hi> founded in <hi>Nature.</hi> There are such things, as <hi>Vertue, Honesty, Equity, Industry, Justice,</hi> and the like to be practised amongst men, even by the <hi>Law of Nature</hi>: and they are to be looked upon as <hi>Hostes Humani generis,</hi> Enemies to <hi>Society,</hi> Enemies to <hi>Nature,</hi> that would perswade the world to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But there are, I said, besides This of <hi>Nature,</hi> other <hi>Positive</hi> Laws, which oblige the <hi>external actions</hi> of men, and by which men are to be judged; and those both <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> in the making of which, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Common-wealths</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> are left by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom to their own <hi>Liberty:</hi> God himself hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provided nothing in that kind for us; only left us a <hi>Model</hi> of his own Government amongst his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the <hi>Jewish State</hi> and <hi>Church</hi>; to wit, the <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law. As to <hi>Church</hi> affairs, though those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> being only <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> had their end and completion at his coming, and so we are obliged against them; yet, seeing God cannot be worshiped without some <hi>ceremony,</hi> 'tis not to be imagined, that publick <hi>Authority</hi> should want <hi>power</hi> for the ordering of <hi>Externals</hi> in the <hi>worship</hi> of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61394:14"/>
God. But as to matters of <hi>Politie,</hi> that frame of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which God with his own hand set up, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves our <hi>veneration</hi> sure; and <hi>Calvin</hi> further acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that many of those <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> may by any <hi>Christian State</hi> be safely <hi>imitated,</hi> and fairly <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed</hi> into practice.</p>
            <p>I shall not here start that <hi>question,</hi> which Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> once <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the ornament of his <hi>country,</hi> in his <hi>Vtopia</hi> doth, why we punish <hi>Theft</hi> with death, and not as the <hi>Judicial Law</hi> prescribes; because I have already answered it, and the late suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess has justified the severity.</p>
            <p>Only having spoken so much of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> let me add one word (I beg the <hi>Lawyers</hi> pardon, if I speak <hi>in alieno foro</hi>) concerning our <hi>Municipal</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law</hi>; (neither <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Prayer</hi> is ere a whit the worse, for being <hi>Common</hi>) that there is not any <hi>Law</hi> extant, either in <hi>Books</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> which comes so near the <hi>Jus Naturale,</hi> as <hi>Ours</hi> does; being a kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written <hi>Law,</hi> grounded upon <hi>Custom,</hi> and built up by long <hi>experience</hi> of its <hi>Vsefulness</hi> and <hi>Convenience,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been long before the <hi>Conquerours</hi> time, (who only put it into a <hi>French</hi> dress and livery, as a <hi>cognizance</hi> of his conquest) practised here, among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and, as 'tis more then probable, among the antient <hi>Britans</hi> too, whose <hi>Druids,</hi> as they were learned men, so were able <hi>Lawyers,</hi> yet would never commit any thing to writing.</p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>Office</hi>: a word or two of his <hi>Patent</hi> and <hi>Residence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. His <hi>Patent</hi> was signed for him <hi>durante vitâ,</hi> he was a Judge <hi>all the days of his life</hi>: nor was his <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary</hi> power extinguished or superseded by the super-induction
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61394:14"/>
of the <hi>Regal,</hi> as may appear by his giving Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to <hi>Saul,</hi> and his calling him to account for his neglect, and his hewing <hi>Agag</hi> in <hi>Gilgal</hi>; so that <hi>Saul</hi> one might think were till <hi>Samuels</hi> death only the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, administer belli,</hi> to execute the orders of War. Yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having said, that God had given the Jews <hi>Judges</hi> for about the space of 450 years, till <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> the Prophet; adds that then he gave them King <hi>Saul</hi> 40 years; in which account he includes <hi>Samuels</hi> time too. Wherefore some thus explain it, <hi>all the days of his Life,</hi> from <hi>Eli</hi>'s death, till <hi>Saul</hi>'s being made King. One of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> asks how this could be, how he could be Judge <hi>all the days of his life</hi>; and answers himself (as that sort of people are full of fancy and confidence) that <hi>Samuel</hi> while he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>in his mothers belly,</hi> was made a <hi>Judge,</hi> and chosen into the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> However he was the last of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Judges,</hi> and the power expired with him; <hi>his</hi> Sons having been as faulty in <hi>State,</hi> as <hi>Eli</hi>'s had been in the <hi>Church,</hi> as corrupt <hi>Judges,</hi> as they were scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Priests</hi>: wherefore as the lewdness of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> turned old <hi>Eli's</hi> Family out of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> so <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Sons by their misdemeanours, outed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of the <hi>Civil Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Lastly,</hi> His constant <hi>Residence</hi> was <hi>Ramah,</hi> a City of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> where his house was, and where his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother had dwelt before. Here he built an <hi>Altar</hi> for publick worship, which the <hi>Jewish Masters</hi> tell us, was lawful even for any private man to do at that time, when the Tabernacle at <hi>Shiloh</hi> was pulled down, and destroyed after the taking of the Ark. Once we read, that, when <hi>David</hi> came to him from Court, they went and dwelt together at <hi>Naioth,</hi> which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61394:15"/>
was hard by; I suppose, for more privacy in his College there. And here at last he laid his bones. <hi>Ramah</hi> was his Dwelling, his Retirement, his Seat of Justice, his Sepulchre. Hither, as long as he liv'd, all the people of <hi>Israel</hi> came up for Justice; for it was a place of <hi>high</hi> situation, the name imports. For though there might be <hi>Inferiour Courts</hi> in other Cities, at least deputations elsewhere: yet here was the <hi>supreme Court</hi> of <hi>Appeals,</hi> which afterwards in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s time was translated to <hi>Jerusalem, Psal.</hi> 122. <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Tribes go up; for there are the seats of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, seats of the house of</hi> David.</p>
            <p>And now 'tis time for me to leave <hi>Ramah,</hi> and set my face towards <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> where I must, having so little time left me, make but a short <hi>Circuit</hi>; where <hi>first</hi> we shall take a vJew of the <hi>Places,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> consider the necessity and reasons of this <hi>Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>Places,</hi> where <hi>Samuel</hi> kept his <hi>Assizes,</hi> were eminent and remarkable in story; large <hi>Shire-Towns,</hi> yet at no great distance neither from one another, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in as narrow a compass perhaps as this <hi>County,</hi> we are now in. Indeed whole <hi>Jewry</hi> was no large piece of ground, being, (as I am told by one that undertakes to correct <hi>AdrichomJus</hi>) no more then seventy miles long, where 'tis longest, and but eighteen over in breadth; yet very populous it was, because very fruitful.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Beth-el</hi> a City of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> Here <hi>Jacob</hi> saw the vision of the Ladder, gave it its name, <hi>the House of God,</hi> and set up a Pillar; at his return was himself here named <hi>Israel,</hi> and built an Altar. Here the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> was, before it was removed to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and <hi>Phineas, Eleazar</hi>'s son, stood before it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61394:15"/>2. <hi>Gilgal</hi> a City in the plains of <hi>Jericho,</hi> belonging to <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Here the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, having neglected that Sacrament ever since their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi>; and therefore 'twas called <hi>Gilgal,</hi> because the Lord that day <hi>rolled away</hi> the reproach of <hi>Egypt</hi> from off them. Here the twelve Stones after their passage over <hi>Jordan</hi> were pitched. Here <hi>Samuel</hi> hewed <hi>Agag</hi> in pieces before the Lord, because <hi>Saul</hi> had forborn the execution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Mizpeh</hi> a City of <hi>Judah,</hi> in the valley, as we read <hi>Josh.</hi> 15. but in the 18. 'tis reckoned among the Cities of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> with <hi>Ramah,</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> 'Tis likely it might stand in the confines of both Tribes. It was, I take it, <hi>Laban</hi>'s heap of stones, which he and <hi>Jacob</hi> had raised, and called <hi>Mizpah</hi>; that is, a <hi>Beacon</hi> or <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi> saying, <hi>the Lord watch between thee and me.</hi> Here was the <hi>Israelites</hi> constant <hi>Rendezvous.</hi> Here they encamped against the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> when <hi>Jephtha</hi> was their Leader. Here they all gathered together unto the Lord against the <hi>Benjamites.</hi> Here lastly at the 6 <hi>verse</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> all <hi>Israel</hi> was by <hi>Samuel</hi>'s or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der summoned to appear, and kept a <hi>Fast,</hi> and powr'd out <hi>water</hi> before the Lord, <hi>that is,</hi> tears of repentance, as <hi>GrotJus</hi> understands it; and <hi>Samuel</hi> Judged them here, that is, punished them for their iniquities, and offered up a burnt-offering: and then miraculously the <hi>Philistines</hi> were discomfited.</p>
            <p>There were reasons then sufficient, both <hi>Politick</hi> and <hi>Religious,</hi> for <hi>Samuel</hi> to make, choice of these places, that were thus <hi>Innobled</hi> and <hi>Consecrated</hi> by such <hi>Famous</hi> and <hi>Sacred</hi> actions, for his <hi>seat of Justice</hi>; whence the Lxx render it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in all these</hi> holy <hi>sanctified</hi> places. And that we may not pass them without
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61394:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some Observation, Our <hi>Reverend Judges,</hi> though they go not the same <hi>Stages</hi> with <hi>Samuel,</hi> they go upon the same <hi>Designs.</hi> They begin at <hi>Bethel,</hi> the Church, <hi>the house of God,</hi> where judgment uses, and ought to begin, there to enquire of the Lord. They proceed to <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> to <hi>roll away</hi> the reproach of the Countries by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing malefactors; and to <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> to inquire into misdemeanours, and see what condition the Publick is in. For so they are styled in Law, <hi>Justitiarii deam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulantes &amp; perlustrantes,</hi> Justices that take a walk, and make a vJew of the Countries. And at this time I may say we are most properly met in <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> upon a day appointed by the <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>Humiliation,</hi> to pour out our <hi>water</hi> before the Lord, and to bewail our own sins, and the sins of the Nation, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did first, and then <hi>Samuel</hi> judged them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As to the necessity of this <hi>Justice in Circuit,</hi> (though <hi>Samuel</hi>'s may be called an <hi>Episcopal Visitation</hi> too, he being the <hi>High-Priest</hi>) It is, that Justice may like the <hi>Sun,</hi> the great Minister of Nature, Visit all places, and Influence all parts of the Nation with light, and heat, and vigour: it being as impossible the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth should subsist one day without <hi>Justice,</hi> as the lower world be maintained without the <hi>Sun.</hi> 'Tis so here; he rode Circuit <hi>from year to year</hi>; but <hi>Josephus</hi> tells us, (and I know not, whether the <hi>Hebrew</hi> may not well bear that interpretation) that he did it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>twice a year,</hi> as Ours do.</p>
            <p>The Causes of this <hi>perambulation</hi> I take to be four; <hi>two</hi> in respect of the <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>two</hi> in respect of the <hi>Tryals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61394:16"/>1. For the <hi>People.</hi> 'Tis for their <hi>Ease</hi>; that they are not put to the trouble and charge of bringing up their causes to <hi>Ramah,</hi> to the higher Tribunal, the <hi>Kings Bench</hi>; but have them tryed <hi>in propriis comitatibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It throws an <hi>Awe</hi> upon the Community, when they see justice brought home to their own doors. <hi>DarJus</hi> was wont to complain, his Empire was like a raw Bull-hide; tread it down in one place, it would rise up in another: but where <hi>Justice</hi> is sent into all parts of the Land at the same time, and <hi>judgment</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like administred in every district, all is easily kept in order.</p>
            <p>Again as to the <hi>Causes</hi> to be <hi>tryed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Some are such, as cannot handsomly be judged, but <hi>upon the place</hi>; for the convenience of <hi>Witnesses,</hi> the circumstances of the <hi>Thing,</hi> and the judgment of the <hi>Voisinage</hi>: as 'tis in the Court of <hi>Nisipriu</hi>'s for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Others admit not of delay; as great and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offences, to be inquired into and punished, <hi>flagrante Crimine</hi> out of hand. Thus God himself came down to <hi>Babel,</hi> to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> as it were upon a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Oyer and Terminer.</hi> And this expedition of Justice, and <hi>ousting</hi> of delays, is given as the main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Itinerant</hi> Justice; <hi>ad celerem justitiam in eâ parte exhibendam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to <hi>Application,</hi> and let not <hi>Me</hi> do't nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but let <hi>Samuel</hi> himself: yet not as a <hi>Judge</hi> to give the <hi>Charge</hi> here, but as a <hi>Prophet</hi> and a <hi>Priest,</hi> in humble manner to address himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> to <hi>my Lord</hi> the <hi>Judge.</hi> You are now at <hi>Bethel,</hi> in the <hi>house of God</hi>; may <hi>God</hi> direct you. The <hi>Judgment</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61394:17"/>
is <hi>His.</hi> Your <hi>Persons,</hi> your <hi>Functions</hi> are sacred: You your selves in Scripture Language are stiled Gods, <hi>Elohim. God standeth in the Congregation of the Gods.</hi> The <hi>Confidence,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> reposes in you, is as great, as the <hi>Trust,</hi> she hath disposed to you: and That's no less then the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> of all her <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

               <hi>Next</hi> to you, the Worshipful, the <hi>Justices</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> of the Country; who are intrusted with the <hi>Peace,</hi> and one way or other, what by Authority, what by Example, with the Concerns of the <hi>Government,</hi> that you would make it your business to encourage and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish <hi>Moral Honesty</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> in dealings among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and to discover and defeat all knavish and false <hi>practices,</hi> which pervert the purposes of <hi>government,</hi> and cut the very Sinews and Ligaments of <hi>Society,</hi> (which consists in a mutual confidence) by bringing men into a general <hi>distrust</hi> and <hi>jealousie</hi> of one another. The Learned <hi>Jew,</hi> I spoke of before, in his Book, called <hi>Cozri,</hi> ingenuously confesses, that it was upon this, that God was so highly displeased with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that they rested themselves upon their <hi>Religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi> their <hi>Oblations</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and other parts and acts of Gods Worship; whereas in the mean time they wholly neglected the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Society</hi>: the neglect whereof does by inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consequence tend to the dissolution of the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi> of Men; it being a vain pretence, any man makes to <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Worship</hi> of God, who wilfully
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61394:17"/>
breaks those <hi>Obligations</hi> and <hi>Ties,</hi> by which he stands bound to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> upon the very account of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> I wish this were well considered by Those, who make a great pudder about <hi>Religion</hi>; and yet are not at all scrupulous of <hi>publick danger</hi>; and I heartily pray, that common <hi>Honesty,</hi> and good <hi>Morality,</hi> that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and a due <hi>Obedience</hi> to Authority, which are the best and only preservatives of <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> both, may more vigorously and constantly, more Conscientiously and Universally be practised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us. Till this be done, we have but small hopes of seeing either <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi> in a flourishing condition.</p>
            <p>To you the Worthy <hi>Counsellors</hi> and other <hi>Practis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of <hi>Law.</hi> You are all in your Spheres under our Reverend <hi>Samuels,</hi> Ministers of <hi>State</hi> too. Your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is Publick, your Profession Noble. Shall I tell you the end of the <hi>Law</hi>? I need not. I cannot do it better, then in the words of a Worthy <hi>Author</hi> of your own in a most excellent <hi>Preface</hi> he has to Chancellor <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesmere</hi> before his Book of <hi>Reports.</hi> It is, he tells you, to <hi>Comfort such as are Grieved, to Counsel such as are Perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to Relieve such as are Circumvented, to Prevent the Ruin of the Improvident, to Save the Innocent, to Support the Impotent, to Take the Prey out of the mouth of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor, to Protect the Orphan, the Widow and the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> 'Tis sad, when any <hi>Noble Faculty</hi> (as yours is) designed for the Good of Mankind, is made to serve the <hi>Practicioners</hi> private Advantage, more then the Benefit of <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To you, the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> and <hi>Parties</hi> concerned; that you would study to be quiet, not to trouble <hi>Law</hi> with every trifle. I know the Apostle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. speaks of <hi>Heathen</hi> Judicatures, that he would not have <hi>Christians</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61394:18"/>
repair to for Justice. I know the Law in it self and its own purposes is good, and was appointed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>controversies,</hi> and to put an end to <hi>differences</hi>: But 'tis such <hi>Differences,</hi> as cannot be otherwise ended. To bring every small matter before the <hi>Judge,</hi> that might have been taken up at home, is to abuse <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> both, as being a great disturbance to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and as great a breach of <hi>Christian Charity.</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> reproof, I am afraid, may be applyed to too too many, in the 7th <hi>ver.</hi> of that <hi>Chap. There is utterly a fault among you, because you go to Law with one another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer your selves to be defrauded? Nay you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</hi> There are some, it seems, who, as we use to say, will neither do right, nor take wrong.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>last</hi> place, to you, <hi>Witnesses,</hi> that you set the God of <hi>Truth</hi> before you, and assure your selves, that your souls will go along with your <hi>depositions.</hi> He that attests a falshood knowingly, wounds God in his dearest <hi>Attribute</hi>; and where he does not <hi>know,</hi> he ought not to <hi>say.</hi> Especially you <hi>Jurors,</hi> remember you are <hi>sworn</hi> men. It must be a <hi>Verdict,</hi> a true saying upon your Oaths, you are to give in. It is a shame to consider, how cheap <hi>Oaths</hi> are grown amongst us; how the reputation of <hi>English Faith</hi> and honesty is lost in this point. <hi>An Oath,</hi> the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> says, <hi>is the end of all controversie.</hi> Justice cannot be effected, nor Government secured without it. There are <hi>two</hi> sorts of men peccant upon this account. Let me beg the favour of your patience, to speak a word with both of them.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61394:18"/>
               <item>1. Those that <hi>refuse</hi> to take <hi>Oaths</hi> at all.</item>
               <item>2. Those that will <hi>take</hi> them hand overhead, and not care how nor what they <hi>swear.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. There is a sort of men, that will not take <hi>Oaths.</hi> I have a charity for them, but I wish it be not upon this ground, because they have formerly <hi>broken</hi> their <hi>Oaths,</hi> or because they are resolved afore-hand not to <hi>keep</hi> them, that they will not take them now. Let me tell them, this stubborn <hi>refusal,</hi> if so, is in it self <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative perjury</hi>; for they are <hi>born-subjects,</hi> whether they <hi>swear</hi> or no. But we will suppose it is out of <hi>Conscience</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> as 'tis an <hi>Oath.</hi> They <hi>object</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostle <hi>James</hi> have expresly forbidden it; <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> say they. Right: but examine the <hi>Context</hi>; it stands thus. <hi>It hath been said by them of old time; Thou shalt not forswear thy self. But I say unto you; swear not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then from the <hi>opposition,</hi> I ask them, whether <hi>Christ</hi> in this place has cancelled that <hi>Prohibition</hi> of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing</hi> ones self, or no: for so the <hi>opposition</hi> stands; <hi>It has been said, thou shalt not forswear thy self. But I say, swear not at all.</hi> If they say he has; there will follow this absurdity, that <hi>Christ,</hi> though he bids us <hi>not swear at all,</hi> yet he allows us to <hi>forswear</hi> our selves. But this <hi>prohibition</hi> without doubt stands good still; for 'tis brought in with the same form of words, as the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Commandments</hi> are, <hi>Ye have heard, that it was said by them of old time; Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit Adultery</hi>: and I hope, they will not say, <hi>Christ</hi> has repeal'd those commandments. If the <hi>prohibition</hi> then stand good, it follows that if a man must not forswear himself, he may lawfully <hi>swear</hi>; for else how can he possibly <hi>forswear</hi> himself? And it were a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61394:19"/>
foolish, idle impertinent <hi>precept,</hi> which forbids a sin that 'tis impossible for a man to commit; to forbid <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,</hi> and not allow an <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From the particular instances, <hi>Swear not at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Heaven, nor by the Earth, nor by</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>nor by thy Head.</hi> It is evident, our <hi>Saviour</hi> meant only frivolous <hi>Oaths,</hi> by any of the Creatures, or by any other thing then God: and so Saint <hi>James</hi> enlarges it; for leaving out <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and ones <hi>head,</hi> he adds <hi>nor any other Oath,</hi> that is, as it must be understood, any other such <hi>Oath</hi>; and this is further confirm'd by the <hi>reason</hi> given to each <hi>instance,</hi> which refers not to the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>swearing,</hi> as it should have done, had <hi>Christ</hi> intended, as they say: but to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> sworn by. Not by <hi>Heaven,</hi> for it is <hi>Gods Throne</hi>; not by the <hi>Earth,</hi> for it is his <hi>Foot-stool</hi>; not by <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for it is <hi>the City of the great King</hi>; not by thy <hi>head,</hi> because <hi>thou canst not make one hair white or black.</hi> And so as Saint <hi>James,</hi> not by <hi>any other thing. <abbr>qd</abbr>.</hi> These, and the like, are all Gods Creatures, and therefore <hi>swearing</hi> being a <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> act, they are not to be <hi>sworn</hi> by. Now in that he forbids <hi>swearing by Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> &amp;c. because Creatures; can we therefore infer we may not upon just cause <hi>swear by God</hi> himself, the Creator? Rather it follows that, seeing we are forbidden to <hi>swear</hi> by these things, because <hi>Creatures</hi>; therefore we may, and must, when there is occasion, <hi>swear by God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. From our <hi>Saviours</hi> design. We must observe Christ's scope and purpose in all that 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> of Saint <hi>Mat.</hi> It was to clear and vindicate the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> from those abuses and corruptions, which the Pharisees false <hi>Glosses</hi> had put upon it. This appears by those other <hi>two.</hi> They held, so a man did not <hi>kill</hi> his brother, it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61394:19"/>
was well enough; he might be <hi>angry</hi> with him, he might call him <hi>Fool,</hi> and not be guilty of the breach of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; so he did not actually <hi>lye with</hi> a woman, he might <hi>look on</hi> her, and <hi>lust after</hi> her, without any offence. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> contrariwise condemns <hi>Murther</hi> in the <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> in the <hi>Eye.</hi> So here the <hi>Pharisees</hi> Tenet was, that so a man did not <hi>forswear</hi> himself, did not swear <hi>falsely,</hi> he might swear, as he pleased, and by what he pleased; as <hi>idly</hi> as he would. Wherefore 'tis only such <hi>idle,</hi> impertinent, unnecessary <hi>swearing</hi> that is here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as well as swearing <hi>false.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. From the <hi>close</hi> or latter opposition; <hi>Swear not at all; But let your Communication be yea, yea; nay, nay.</hi> 'Tis plain that swearing is here forbidden, only in ordinary discourse, in our <hi>Communication,</hi> not upon extraordinary occasion before the <hi>Magistrate</hi>; or in a place of <hi>Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> where an <hi>Oath</hi> is to be the end of strife.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Lastly,</hi> (and I will leave it with them) from Saint <hi>James</hi> himself; <hi>Yea, Yea; Nay, Nay.</hi> Where will they find that <hi>Christ</hi> himself and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> or any of the New Testament <hi>Saints</hi> used these forms of speech, so as they do even to a ridiculous superstition. What do you think of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in his <hi>Epistles,</hi> which are reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed familiar discourses, where he is to vouch any weighty <hi>Truth,</hi> fears not to use such <hi>forms</hi> as these, <hi>Before God I lye not; I protest by your rejoycing,</hi> and the like. Would he, do you think, had he been called into a Christian <hi>Court,</hi> solemnly to bear witness to the <hi>Truth,</hi> have scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled an <hi>Oath</hi>? would he have answered to an Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay</hi>? No; that was not the meaning. Saint <hi>James</hi> will tell them, what <hi>Christ</hi> meant. <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> says he, <hi>but let your Yea, be Yea, and your Nay, Nay. i. e.</hi> in your conversation be honest men, and stand to your word,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61394:20"/>
in your dealings, in your assertions, in your promises; let your word be your word, your <hi>yea, yea</hi>; and your <hi>nay, nay</hi>; and then you need not <hi>swear</hi>: your <hi>word</hi> will be taken without an <hi>Oath.</hi> For 'tis commonly seen, that those find least <hi>credit,</hi> who bind all they say with <hi>Oaths</hi>; and that those, who <hi>swear</hi> most, are least believed.</p>
            <p>And this brings us to Those, who make light of <hi>Oaths</hi>; are very ready to <hi>take</hi> them, and more ready to <hi>break</hi> them. But such must know, that the violation of an <hi>Oath,</hi> is the highest violation of <hi>Conscience</hi> that can be; and that God is <hi>Witness</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> both; and that 'tis dangerous to call him to be <hi>Witness</hi> of a lye, who will be sure to be an <hi>Avenger</hi> of it; and that though <hi>Perjury</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is got into that practice, that it has lost the <hi>Infamy,</hi> which does of right belong to it amongst men, yet it will not miss of divine <hi>Vengeance</hi> even in this life; that 'tis the boldest affront can be offered to Gods <hi>Omniscience,</hi> to his <hi>Veracity,</hi> to his <hi>Justice,</hi> to his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> to his <hi>Power,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him to falshood, and cover it with his holy and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Name; and that though they may elude a <hi>Humane Judicature,</hi> and escape in <hi>this</hi> life, yet in the <hi>next,</hi> when they appear, as we all must before the <hi>judgment seat of God,</hi> their injured <hi>consciences</hi> will stand out, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and draw uplarge declarations against them to their eternal confusion, and condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now may God the righteous</hi> Judge <hi>of all the Earth, so direct you all, in what you go about, that</hi> you <hi>may have the</hi> Blessing, <hi>that the</hi> Country <hi>may have the</hi> Benefit, <hi>and that</hi> God <hi>himself may have the</hi> Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>
