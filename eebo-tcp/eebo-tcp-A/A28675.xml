            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO <hi>PETER WESTON,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> OF THE Honourable Society OF THE INNER-TEMPLE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen I had ended this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle unlaboured Piece, the <hi>Watch,</hi> Iresolv'd to dedicate it to some One, whom I cou'd fancy, the nearest approacht the charming <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93505:4"/>
Many fine Gentlemen I had in view, of Wit and Beauty; but still, through their Education, or a natural Propensity to Debauchery, I found those Vertues wanting, that shou'd compleat that delicate Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, <hi>Iris</hi> gives her Lover; and which, at first Thought of You, I found center'd there to Perfection.</p>
            <p>Yes Sir, I found You had all the Youth of <hi>Damon;</hi> without the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward noisy Confidence, which usually attends your Sex. You have all the attracting Beauty of my young He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro; all that can charm the Fair; without the Affectation of those, that set out for Conquests (though You make a Thousand, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or the Vanity of believing it.) You have our <hi>Damon</hi>'s Wit,
<pb facs="tcp:93505:4"/>
with all his agreeable Modesty: Two Vertues that rarely shine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And the last makes You conceal the noble Sallies of the first, with that Industry and Care, You wou'd an Amour: And You wou'd no more boast of either of these, than of your undoubted Bravery.</p>
            <p>You are (like our Lover too) so discreet, that the bashful Maid may, without Fear or Blushing, venture the soft Confession of her Soul with You; reposing the dear Secret in Yours, with more Safety, than with her own Thoughts. You have all the Sweetness of Youth, with the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and Prudence of Age. You have all the Power of the gay Vices of Man; but the Angel in your Mind, has subdu'd you to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb facs="tcp:93505:5"/>
of a God! And all the vicious, and industrious Examples of the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Wits of the mad Town, have only serv'd to give you the greater Abborrence to Lewdness. And You look down with Contempt and Pity on that wretched unthinking Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who pride themselves in their mean Victories over little Hearts; and boast their common Prizes with that Vanity, that declares 'em capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of no higher Joy, than that of the Ruin of some credulous Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate: And no Glory like that, of the Discovery of the brave Atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, over the next Bottle, to the Fool that shall applaud 'em.</p>
            <p>How does the Generosity, and Sweetness of your Disposition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise these false Entertainments,
<pb facs="tcp:93505:5"/>
that turns the noble Passion of Love into Ridicule, and Man into Brute.</p>
            <p>Methinks I cou'd form another <hi>Watch</hi> (that shou'd remain a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to succeeding Ages) how divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you pass your more sacred Hours, how nobly and usefully you divide your Time; in which, no precious Minute is lost, not one glides idly by; but all turns to wondrous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. And all Your Life is one continu'd Course of Vertue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Happy the Parents, that have the Glory to own You! Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the Man, that has the Honour of your Friendship! But, Oh! How much more happy the fair She, for whom you shall sigh! Which sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, can never be in vain. There will be such a Purity in Your Flame:
<pb facs="tcp:93505:6"/>
All You ask, will be so chaste and noble, and utler'd with a Voice so modest, and a Look so charming, as must, by a gentle Force, compel that Heart to yield, that knows the true Value of VVit, Beauty, and Vertue.</p>
            <p>Since then, in all the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Mind and Body (where no one Grace is wanting) you so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the All-perfect <hi>Damon,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to dedicate this Watch to You. It brings You nothing but Rules for Love; delicate as Your Thoughts, and innocent as Your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. And possibly, 'tis the only Vertue of the Mind, You are not perfectly Master of; the only noble Mystery of the Soul, You have not yet studied. And though they
<pb facs="tcp:93505:6"/>
are Rules for every Hour, You will find, they will neither rob Heaven, nor Your Friends of their Due; those so valuable Devoirs of Your Life: They will teach You Love; but Love, so pure, and so devout, that You may mix it, even with Your Religion; and I know, Your fine Mind can admit of no other. VVhen ever the God enters there (fond and wanton as he is, full of Arts and Guiles) he will be reduc'd to that Native Innocency, that made him so ador'd, before inconstant Man cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his Divinity, and made him wild and wandring. How happy will <hi>Iris's</hi> VVatch be, to inspire such a Heart! How honour'd under the Patronage of so excellent a Man! VVhose VVit will credit, whose
<pb facs="tcp:93505:7"/>
Goodness will defend it; and whose noble and vertuous Qualities so justly merit the Character, <hi>Iris</hi> has given <hi>Damon:</hi> And which is believed so very much your Due, by</p>

               <l>Soft, as your Sex; and smooth, as Beauty's Face.</l>

               <p>'TIs in the most Happy and August Court of the best and greatest Monarch of the World, that <hi>Damon,</hi> a young Noble-man, whom we will <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ender under that Name, languishes <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or a Maid of Quality, who will give us leave to call her <hi>Iris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Births are equally Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: They are both Rich, and both Young: Their Beauty such, as I dare not too nicely particularize, lest I should discover (which I am not permitted to do) who these charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lovers are. Let it suffice, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93505:12"/>
                  <hi>Iris</hi> is the most fair and accomplisht Person that ever adorn'd a Court; and that <hi>Damon</hi> is only worthy of the Glory of her Favour; for he has all that can render him Lovely, in the fair Eyes of the Amiable <hi>Iris.</hi> Nor is he Master of those Superficial Beauties alone, that please at first Sight: He can charm the Soul with a thousand Arts of Wit and Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And, in a word, I may say, without flattering either, that there is no one Beauty, no one Grace, no Perfection of Mind and Body, that wants to compleat a Victory on both sides.</p>
               <p>The Agreement of Age, Fortunes; Quality and Humours in the two fair Lovers, made the impatient <hi>Damon</hi> hope, that nothing would oppose his Passion; and if he saw himself every Hour, languishing for the Adorable Maid, he did not however despair: And if <hi>Iris</hi> sigh'd, it was not for fear of being one day more happy.</p>
               <p>In the midst of the Tranquility of these two Lovers, <hi>Iris</hi> was obliged
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93505:12"/>
to go into the Country for some Months, whither 'twas impossible for <hi>Damon</hi> to wait on her, he being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to attend the King, his Master; and being the most Amorous of his Sex, suffer'd with extream Impatienco the Absence of his Mistress. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, he fail'd not to send to her every day, and gave up all his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Hours to Thinking, Sighing, and Writing to her the softest Letters that Love could inspire. So that <hi>Iris</hi> even blessed that Absence, that gave her so tender and convincing Proofs of his Passion; and found this dear way of Conversing, even recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all her Sighs for his Absence.</p>
               <p>After a little Intercourse of this kind, <hi>Damon</hi> bethought himself to ask <hi>Iris</hi> a <hi>Discretion,</hi> which he had won of her, before she lest the Town; and in a <hi>Billet-doux</hi> to that purpose, prest her very earnestly for it. <hi>Iris</hi> being infinitely pleas'd with his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, suffer'd him to ask it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and he never fail'd of doing so.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93505:13"/>
But as I do not here design to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Adventures of these two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable Persons, nor give you all the <hi>Billet-douxes</hi> that past between them: You shall here find nothing but the <hi>Watch,</hi> this charming Maid sent her impatient Lover.</p>

               <head>Iris <hi>to</hi> Damon.</head>
               <p>IT must be confest, <hi>Damon,</hi> that you are the most importuning Man in the World. Your Billets have an hundred times demanded a <hi>Discretion,</hi> which you won of me; and tell me, you will not wait my Return, to be paid. You are either a very faithless Creditor, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me very unjust, that you dun with such Impatience. But, to let you see I am a Maid of Honour, and value my Word, I will acquit my self of this Obligation I have to you, and send you a <hi>Watch</hi> of my fashion; perhaps you never saw any so good. It is not one of those, that have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways something to be mended in it; but one that is without Fault, very just and good, and will remain so, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93505:14"/>
long as you continue to love me. But <hi>Damon,</hi> know, that the very Minute you cease to do so, the String will break, and it will go no more. 'Tis only useful in my Absence, and when I return, 'twill change its Motion: And though I have set it but for the Spring-time, 'twill serve you the whole Year round; and 'twill be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary only, that you alter the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Hours (which my <hi>Cupid,</hi> in the middle of my <hi>Watch,</hi> points you out) according to the length of the Days and Nights. Nor is the Dart of that little God directed to those Hours, so much to inform you how they pass, as how you ought to pass them, how you ought to employ those of your Absence from <hi>Iris.</hi> 'Tis there you shall find the whole Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Lover, from his Mistress; sor I have design'd it a Rule to all your Actions. The Consideration of the Work-man, ought to make you set a Value upon the Work: And though it be not an accomplisht, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Piece; yet <hi>Damon,</hi> you ought
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93505:14"/>
to be grateful, and esteem it, since I have made it for you alone. But however I may boast of the Design, I know, as well as I believe, you love me; that you will not suffer me to have the Glory of it wholly, but will say in your heart,
<q>
                     <l>That <hi>Love,</hi> the great Instructor of the Mind,</l>
                     <l>That forms anew, and fashions every Soul,</l>
                     <l>Refines the gross Defects of Humane kind;</l>
                     <l>Humbles the Proud and Vain, inspires the Dull:</l>

                     <l>And teaches feeble Woman how to write.</l>

               <p>The naked <hi>Love</hi> which you will find in the middle of it, with his Wings clip'd, to shew you, he is fix'd and constant, and will not fly away, points you out, with his Arrow, the four and twenty Hours, that compose the Day and the Night: Over every Hour, you will find written, what you ought to do, during its Course; and every Half-hour is marked with a Sigh, since the quality of a Lover is, to sigh day and night: Sighs are the Children of Lovers, that are born every hour. And that my <hi>Watch</hi> may always be just, <hi>Love</hi> himself ought to conduct it; and your Heart should keep Time with the Movement.</p>

               <p>Every hour is tedious to a Lover, separated from his Mistress; and, to shew you how good I am, I will have my <hi>Watch</hi> instruct you, to pass some of them without Inquietude; that the force of your Imagination, may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times charm the Trouble you have for my Absence.</p>

the Discovery, though I am pleas'd at the same time, with the Satisfaction I take in doing so; and ever disorder'd at the remembrance of such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of too much Love.

However you find 'em, <hi>Damon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue 'em all to my Advantage: Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, some of 'em have an Air of Coldness, something different from that Softness they are usually too amply fill'd with; but where you find they have, believe there, that Sense of Honour, and my Sexes Modesty, guided my Hand a little, against the Inclinations of my Heart; and that it was a kind of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, I believed, I ought to make, for something I feared, I had said too kind, and too obliging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But where-ever you find that, stop that Check in my Carriere of Love; you will be sure to find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that follows it to favour you, and deny that unwilling Imposition upon my Heart; which, lest you should mistake, <hi>Love</hi> shews himself in Smiles again, and flatters more agreeably, disdaining the Tyranny of Honour, and Rigid Custom, that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position on our Sex; and will, in spight of me, let you see, he Reigns absolutely in my Soul.</p>

The Reading my <hi>Billet-doux</hi> may detain you an Hour; I have had Goodness enough to write you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to entertain you so long, at least, and sometimes reproach my self for it; but, contrary to all my Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I find my self dispos'd to give you those frequent Marks of my Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness. If yours be so great as you express it, you ought to kiss my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a Thousand times, you ought to read them with Attention, and weigh every Word, and value every Line. A Lover may receive a Thousand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Words from a Mistress, more easily than a Billet. One says a great many kind Things of Course to a Lover, which one is not willing to write, or to give testify'd under one's Hand, Sign'd and Seal'd. But when once a Lover has brought his Mistress to that degree of Love, he ought to assure himself, she loves not at the common Rate.</p>

you will say, an Hour is too much, and that 'tis not the Mode to write long Letters. I grant you, <hi>Damon,</hi> when we write those indifferent ones, of Gallantry in Course, or necessary Compliment; the handsom Compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of which, in the fewest Words, renders 'em the most agreeable: But in Love, we have a Thousand foolish things to say, that, of themselves, bear no great Sound, but have a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sense in Love; for there is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Eloquence, natural alone to a Lover, and to be understood by no other Creature: To those, Words have a thousand Graces, and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; which, to the Unconcerned, appears Meanness, and Easie Sense, at the best. But, <hi>Damon,</hi> you and I are none of those ill Judges of the Beauties of Love; we can penetrate beyond the Vulgar, and perceive the fine Soul in every Line, through all the humble Dress of Phrase; when possibly, they who think they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it best in Florid Language, do not see it at all. <hi>Love</hi> was not born, or

bred in Courts, but Cottages; and nurs'd in Groves and Shades, smiles on the Plains, and wantons in the Streams; all Unador'd, and Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. Therefore, <hi>Damon,</hi> do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult your Wit in this Affair, but <hi>Love</hi> alone; and speak all that He and Nature taught you, and let the fine Things you learn in Schools alone: Make use of those Flowers you have gather'd there, when you converse with States-men, and the Gown. Let <hi>Iris</hi> possess your Heart in all its sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Innocence, that's the best Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to her that loves; and this is my Instruction to a Lover, that would succeed in his Amours; for I have a Heart very difficult to please, and this is the nearest Way to it.</p>

                  <p>It is an Art too ingenious, to have been found out by Man; and too ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Lovers, not to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the God of Love himself. But, <hi>Damon,</hi> I do not pretend to exact from you those Letters of Gallantry, which, I have told you, are fill'd with nothing but fine Thoughts, and writ with all the Arts of Wit and Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I wou'd have yours still, all Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93505:29"/>
unaffected Love, Words unchosen, Thoughts unstudied, and Love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned. I had rather find more Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than Wit, in your Passion; more of Nature, than of Art; more of the Lover, than the Poet. Nor wou'd I have you write any of those little short Letters, that are read over in a Minute: In Love, long Letters bring a long Pleasure. Do not trouble your self to make 'em fine, or writea great deal of Wit and Sense in a few Lines; that is the Notion of a witty Billet, in any Affair, but that of Love: And have a Care, rather to avoid these Graces to a Mistress; and assure your self, dear <hi>Damon,</hi> that what pleases the Soul, pleases the Eye; and the Largeness, or Bulk of your Letter, shall never offend me; and that I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly am displeased, when I find them small. A Letter is ever the best, and most powerful Agent to a Mistress: It almost always perswades; 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways renewing little Impressions, that possibly, otherwise, Absence would deface. Make use then, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93505:29"/>
of your Time, while 'tis given you; and thank me, that I permit you to write to me: Perhaps, I shall not always continue in the Humour of suffering you to do so; and it may so happen, by some Turn of Chance and Fortune, that you may be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, at the same time, both of my Presence, and of the Means of Send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me. I will believe, that such an Accident wou'd be a great Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to you; for I have often heard you say, that, <q>To make the most happy Lover suffer Martyrdom, one need only forbid him Seeing, Speaking, and Writing to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he loves.</q> Take all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages then you can, you cannot give me too often, Marks too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of your Passion: Write therefore, during this Hour, every Day. I give you leave to believe, that while you do so, you are Serving me the most Obligingly, and Agreeably you can, while Absent; and that you are giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me a Remedy against all Grief, Uneasiness, Melancholy, and Despair.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93505:30"/>
Nay, if you exceed your Hour, you need not be asham'd: The Time you employ in this kind Devoir, is the Time that I shall be grateful for, and, no doubt, will recompence it. You ought not, however, to neglect Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for me; I will give you time for your Devotion, for my <hi>Watch</hi> tells you, 'tis time to go to the Temple.</p>

                  <p>This sort of Creature, <hi>Damon,</hi> is very dangerous; not that I fear, you will squander away a Heart upon her, but your Hours; for, in spight of you, she'll detain you with a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Impertinencies, and Eternal Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. She passes for a Judging Wit;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93505:34"/>
and there is nothing so troublesome, as such a Pretender. She, perhaps, may get some Knowledge of our Correspondence; and then, no doubt, will improve it, to my Disadvantage. P<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ssibly, she may rail at me; that is her fashion, by the way of Friendly Speaking; and an Aukward Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, the most effectual Way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saming, and Traducing. Perhaps she tells you, in a cold Tone, that you are a Happy Man, to be Belov'd by me: That <hi>Iris,</hi> indeed, is handsom; and she wonders, she has no more Lovers; but the Men are not of her Mind; if they were, you should have more Rivals. She commends my Face, but that I have Blue Eyes, and 'tis pity my Complexion is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: My Shape, but too much incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Fat. Cries—She would charm infinitely with her Wit, but that she knows too well, she is Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of it. And concludes,—But All together, she is well enough.—Thus she runs on, without giving you leave to edge in a Word, in my
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93505:34"/>
Defence; and ever, and anon, Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up her own Conduct, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement: Tell you, how she is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest with Lovers, and fatigu'd with Addresses; and recommending her self, at every Turn, with a perceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cunning: And all the while, is Jilting you of your good Opinion; which she would buy, at the Price of any Body's Repose, or her own Fame, though but for the Vanity of Adding to the number of her Lovers. When she sees a new Spark, the first thing she does, she enquires into his Estate: If she find it such, as may (if the Coxcomb be well manag'd) supply her Vanity, she makes Advances to him, and applies her self to all those little Arts, she usually makes use of, to gain her Fools; and, according to his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, dresses and affects her own. But, <hi>Damon,</hi> since I point to no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Person, in this Character, I will not name, who you shall avoid; but all of this sort, I conjure you, wheresoever you find 'em. But if unlucky Chance throw you in their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93505:35"/>
Way, hear all they say, without Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, or Regard, as far as Decency will suffer you: Hear 'em, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their Foppery; and hear 'em, without giving 'em Cause to censure you. But 'tis so much Time lost, to listen to all the Novels, this sort of People will perplex you with; whose Business is, to be idle; and who, even tire themselves with their own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies. And be assur'd, after all, there is nothing they can tell you, that is worth your Knowing. And, <hi>Damon,</hi> A perfect Lover never asks any News, but of the Maid he loves.</p>

                  <p>LEave all those fond Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or you will dis-oblige me, and make Dinner wait for you; for my <hi>Cupid</hi> tells you, 'tis that Hour. <hi>Love</hi> does not pretend to make you lose that; nor is it my Province, to order you your Dyet. Here I give you a perfect Liberty, to do what you please: And possibly, 'tis the only Hour in the whole Four and twenty, that I will absolutely resign you, or dispence with your, even so much as Thinking on me. 'Tis true, in Seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your self at Table, I wou'd not have you plac'd over against a very Beautiful Object; for in such an one, there are a Thousand little Graces, in Speaking, Looking, and Laughing, that fail not to Charm, if one gives way to the Eyes, to gaze and wander that Way; in which, perhaps, in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93505:36"/>
spight of you, you will find a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: And while you do so, though without Design, or Concern, you give the fair Charmer a sort of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in believing, you have plac'd your self there, only for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Looking on her; and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes a Hundred little Graces, and Affectations, which are not Natural to her, to compleat a Conquest, which she believes so well begun al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. She softens her Eyes, and sweetens her Mouth; and, in fine, puts on another Air, than when she had no Design; and when you did not, by your continual Looking on her, rouze her Vanity, and increase her easie Opinion of her own Charms. Perhaps she knows, I have some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in your Heart; and Prides her self, at least, with believing, she has attracted the Eyes of my Lover, if not his Heart; and thinks it easie to vanquish the Whole, if she pleases; and triumphs over me in her secret Imaginations. Remember, <hi>Damon,</hi> that while you act thus in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93505:37"/>
and Conversation of other Beauties, that every Look, or Word, you give, in favour of 'em, is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity to my Reputation; and, which you cannot suffer, if you love me truly, and with Honour: And, assure your self, so much Vanity as you inspire in her, so much Fame you rob me of; for whatever Praises you give another Beauty, so much you take away from mine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you dine in Company, do as others do: Be generally Civil, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying your self, by Words, or Looks, to any particular Person: Be as gay as you please: Talk and laugh with all, for this is not the Hour for Chagrin.</p>

I must confess, I wou'd not, that you shou'd have so much Concern for them, as you have for me; for I have heard a sort of a Proverb, that says, <q>He cannot be very fervent in Love, who is not a little cold in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</q> You are not ignorant, that when <hi>Love</hi> establishes himself in a Heart, he Reigns a Tyrant there; and will not suffer, even Friendship,

                  <p>I shou'd be very angry, if you had any of those Friendships, which one ought to desire in a Mistress only; for many times it happens, that you have Sentiments a little too tender
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93505:39"/>
for those Amiable Persons; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, Love and Friendship are so confounded together, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not easily discern one from t'other. I have seen a Man flatter himself with an Opinion, that he had but an Esteem for a Woman, when, by some Turn of Fortune in her Life, as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, or Receiving the Addresses of Men, he has found, by Spight and Jealousies within, that that was Love, which he before took for Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, or Friendship. Therefore have a Care; for such Amities are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Not but that a Lover may have Fair and Generous Female Friends, whom he ought to visit; and perhaps, I shou'd esteem you less, if I did not believe, you were valued by such, if I were perfectly assured, they were Friends, and not Lovers. But have a care, you hide not a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress under this Veil, or that you gain not a Lover by this Pretence; for you may begin with Friendship, and end with Love; and I shou'd be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted, shou'd you give it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93505:40"/>
it. And though you charge our Sex with all the Vanity; yet I often find Nature to have given you as large a Portion of that common Crime, which you wou'd shuffle off, as asham'd to own; and are as fond and vain of the Imagination of a Conquest, as any <hi>Coquet</hi> of us all; though, at the same time, you despise the Victim, you think it adds a Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy to your Fame. And I have seen a Man dress, and trick, and adjust his Looks and Meen, to make a Visit to a Woman he lov'd not, nor ever cou'd love, as for those he made to his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress; and only for the Vanity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Conquest upon a Heart, even unworthy of the little Pains he has taken about it. And what is this, but buying Vanity at the Expence of Sense and Ease; and with Fatigue, purchase the Name of a Conceited Fop, besides that of a dishonest Man? For he who takes pains to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Belov'd, only to please his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Humour, though he should say nothing that tends to it, more
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93505:40"/>
than by his Looks, his Sighs, and now and then breaking into Praises and Commendations of the Object, by the Care he takes, to appear well drest before her, and in good Order; he lies in his Looks, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives with his Meen and Fashion, and cheats with every Motion, and every Grace he puts on: He cozens when he sings, or dances, he dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles when he sighs; and every thing he does, that wilfully gains upon her, is Malice propense, Baseness, and Art below a Man of Sense, or Vertue: And yet these Arts, these Coz'nages, are the common Practices of the Town. What's this, but that Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Vice, of which they so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach our Sex; that of Jilting for Hearts? And 'tis in vain, that my Lover, after such foul Play, shall think to appease me, with saying, <q>He did it, to try how easily he cou'd conquer, and of how great Force his Charms were: And why shou'd I be angry, if all the Town lov'd him, since he lov'd none but <hi>Iris?</hi>
                     </q> Oh
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93505:41"/>
Foolish Pleasure! How little Sense goes to the making of such a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? And how little Love must he have for one particular Person, who wou'd wish to inspire it into all the World, and yet himself pretend to be insensible? But this, <hi>Damon,</hi> is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what is but too much practised by your Sex, than any Guilt I charge on you; though Vanity be an Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that Nature very seldom omits, in the Composition of either Sex; and you may be allow'd a Tincture of it, at least. And perhaps, I am not wholly exempt from this Leaven in my Nature, but accuse my self sometimes, of finding a secret Joy of being Ador'd, though I even hate my Worshipper. But if any such Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure touch my Heart, I find it, at the same time, blushing in my Cheeks, with a guilty Shame; which soon checks the petty Triumph, and I have a Vertue at soberer Thoughts, that I find surmounts my Weakness, and Indiscretion; and I hope, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> finds the same; for, should he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93505:41"/>

                  <p>IN this Visiting Hour, many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will happen to meet, at one and the same time together, in a Place: And, as you make not Visits to Friends, to be silent, you ought to enter into Conversation with 'em; but those Conversations ought to be General, and of General Things; for there is no necessity of making your Friend the Confident of your Amours: 'Twould infinitely displease me, to hear, you have reveal'd to them, all that I have repos'd in you: Though Secrets never so trivial, yet, since utter'd between Lovers, they deserve to be priz'd at a higher Rate. For what can shew a Heart more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and indiscreet, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, in any Fashion, or with Mirth, or Joy, the Tender Things a Mistress says to a Lover; and which possibly,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93505:43"/>
related at Second Hand, bear not the same Sense, because they have not the same Sound and Air, they had Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, when they came from the soft Heart of her, who sigh'd 'em first, to her lavish Lover. Perhaps they are told again with Mirth, or Joy, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their Character, and Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and then they lose their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; (for Love is the most Solemn Thing in Nature, and the most unsui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with Gayety.) Perhaps the soft Expressions sute not so well the harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Voice of the Masculine Lover, whose Accents were not form'd for so much Tenderness; at least, not of that sort; for Words that have the same Meaning, are alter'd from their Sense, by the least Tone, or Accent of the Voice; and those proper, and fitted to my Soul, are not, possibly, so to yours, though both have the same Efficacy upon us; yours upon my Heart, as mine upon yours; and both will be mis-understood by the unjudging World. Besides this, there is a Holiness in Love, that's true, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93505:43"/>
ought not to be prophan'd: And as the Poet truly says, at the latter End of an <hi>Ode;</hi> of which, I will recite the Whole.</p>

There is nothing more true, than those two last Lines; and that Love ceases to be a Pleasure, when it ceases to be a Secret, and one you ought to keep Sacred. For the World, who never makes a right Judgment of Things, will mis-interpret Love, as they do Religion; every one judging it, according to the Notion he has of if, or the Talent of his Sense. <hi>Love,</hi> as a great Duke said, is like Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; every one talks of 'em, but few have seen 'em: Every body thinks himself capable of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love, and that he is a Master in the Art of it; when there is nothing so nice, or difficult to be rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; and indeed, cannot be, but to a Soul very delicate. Nor will he make himself known to the Vulgar: There must be an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fineness in the Mind, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains him; the rest, he only visits in as many Disguises, as there are Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Natures; where he makes but a short Stay, and is gone. He can fit himself to all Hearts, being the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93505:45"/>
greatest Flatterer in the World: And he possesses every one with a Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they are in the Number of his Elect; and they think, they know him perfectly, when nothing but the Spirits refin'd, possess him in his Excellency. From this Difference of Love in different Souls, proceeds those odd Fantastick Maxims, which so many hold of so different Kinds: And this makes the most innocent Pleasures pass oftentimes for Crimes, with the unjudging Crowd, who call themselves Lovers: And you will have your Passion censur'd, by as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as you shall discover it to, and as many several Ways. I advise you therefore, <hi>Damon,</hi> to make no Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents of your Amours; and believe, that Silence has, with me, the most powerful Charm.</p>
                  <p>'Tis also in these Conversations, that those indiscreetly civil Persons often are, who think to oblige a good Man, by letting him know, he is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by some one, or other; and making him understand, how many
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93505:46"/>
good Qualities he is Master of, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him agreeable to the fair Sex, if he wou'd but advance, where Love and good Fortune calls; and that a too constant Lover loses a great part of his Time, which might be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd to more Advantage, since Youth hath so short a Race to run: By this, and a Thousand the like indecent Complaisances, give him a Vanity, that sutes not with that Discretion, which has hitherto acquir'd him so good a Reputation. I wou'd not have you, <hi>Damon,</hi> act on these Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, as many of the Easie Sparks have done before you, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such Weakness and Flattery for Truth; and passing it off with a Smile, suffer 'em to advance in Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'till they have gain'd a Credit with 'em, and they believe all they hear; telling 'em they do so, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Gestures, Silence, or open Approbation. For my part, I shou'd not condemn a Lover, that shou'd answer such a sort of civil Brokers for Love somewhat briskly, and by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93505:46"/>
'em to understand, they are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy engaged; or directing 'em to Fools, that will possibly hearken to 'em, and credit such Stuff, shame 'em out of a Folly so insamous, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenious. In such a Case only, I am willing you shou'd own your Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; not that you need tell the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which has charm'd you: And you may say, you are already a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, without saying, you are Belov'd. For so long as you appear to have a Heart unengag'd, you are expos'd to all the little Arts and Addresses of this sort of obliging Procurers of Love, and give way to the Hope they have, of making you their Proselyte. For your own Reputation then, and my Ease and Honour, shun such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations; for they are neither cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to you, nor pleasing to me: And believe me, <hi>Damon,</hi> a true Lover has no Curiosity, but what concerns his Mistress.</p>

                  <p>I Fore-see, or fear, that these busie, impertinent Friends will oblige you, to visit some Ladies of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, or yours: My <hi>Watch</hi> does not forbid you. Yet I must tell you, I apprehend Danger in such Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits; and I fear, you will have need of all your Care and Precaution, in these Encounters. That you may give me no Cause to suspect you, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will argue, that Civility ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges you to't: If I were assur'd, there wou'd no other Design be carried on, I shou'd believe, it were to advance an Amorous Prudence too far, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid you. Only keep your self upon your Guard; for the Business of most part of the fair Sex is, to seek only the Conquest of Hearts: All their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities, are but so many Interests; and they do nothing without Design.

And in such Conversations, there is always a <hi>Je ne scay quoy,</hi> that is to be fear'd; especially, when Beauty is accompanied with Youth and Gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and which they assume, upon all Occasions that may serve their Turn. And I consess, 'tis not an easie matter to be just in these Hours and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations: The most certain Way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, is to imagine, I read all your Thoughts, observe all your Looks, and hear all your Words.</p>

That 'tis not Flattery to say, an Unbeautiful Woman is Beautiful, if he that says so, believes she is so. I shou'd be content to acquit you of the first, provided you allow me the last: And if I appear Charming in <hi>Damon</hi>'s Eyes, I am not fond of the Approbation of any other. 'Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the World thinks me not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together disagreeable, to justifie his Choice; but let your good Opinion give what Increase it pleases, to my Beauty; though your Approbation give me a Pleasure, it shall not a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and I am contented, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> should think me a Beauty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my believing I am one. 'Tis not to draw new Assurances, and new Vows from you, that I speak this; though Tales of Love are the only ones we desire to hear often told, and which never tire the Hearers, if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest to themselves: But 'tis not to this End, I now seem to doubt what you say to my Advantage: No, my Heart knows no Disguise, nor can dissemble one Thought of it to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi>

'tis all Sincere, and Honest, as his Wish: 'Tis therefore it tells you, it does not credit every Thing you say; though I believe, you say abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Truths, in a great Part of my Character. But when you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to that, which my own Sense, my Judgment, or my Glass cannot perswade me to believe; you must give me leave, either to believe, you think me vain enough to credit you, or pleas'd, that your Sentiments and mine are differing in this Point. But I doubt, I may rather reply in some Verses, a Friend of yours and mine, sent to a Person, she thought, had but indifferent Sentiments for her; yet, who, nevertheless, flatter'd her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he imagin'd, she had a very great Esteem for him. She is a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that, you know, naturally hates Flattery: On the other side, she was extreamly dis-satisfy'd, and uneasie, at his Opinion, of his being more in her Favour, than she desir'd he shou'd believe. So that, one Night, having left her full of Pride and Anger, she,

next Morning, sent him these Verses, instead of a <hi>Billet-doux.</hi>

Possibly, the angry <hi>Aminta,</hi> when she writ these Verses, was more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that he believ'd himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd, than that he flatter'd; though she wou'd seem to make that a great Part of the Quarrel, and Cause of her Resentment: For we are often in an Humour, to seem more Modest in that Point, than naturally we are; being too apt to have a favourable Opinion of our selves: And 'tis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Effects of a Fear that we are flatter'd, than our own ill O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Beauty flatter'd; and that the Praiser does not think so well of it, as we do our selves, or as, at least, we wish he shou'd. Not but there are Grains of Allowance, for the Temper of him that speaks: One Man's Humour is, to talk much; and he may be permitted to enlarge upon the Praise he gives the Person he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to, without being accus'd of much Guilt.

And as I shou'd be very Ridiculous, if I took all you said, for Absolute Truth; so I shou'd be very Unjust, not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you very Sincere, in almost all you said besides; and those Things, the most Material to Love, Honour, and Friendship. And for the rest, <hi>Damon,</hi> be it true, or false, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; You speak with such a Grace, that I cannot chuse but Credit you; and find an infinite Pleasure in that Faith, because I love you: And if I cannot find the Cheat, I am conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you shou'd deceive me on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you do it so agreeably.</p>

                  <p>'TIs Time to be weary; 'tis Night: Take Leave of your Friends, and retire Home. 'Tis in this Retreat, that you ought to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, in your Thoughts, all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Day; and all those Things, that you ought to give me an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, in your Letter: You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hide the least Secret from me, without Treason against Sacred Love. For all the World agrees, that Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is one of the greatest Proofs of the Passion of Love; and that Lover, who refuses this Confidence to the Person he loves, is to be suspected, to love but very indifferently, and to think very poorly of the Sense and Generosity of his Mistress. But, that you may acquit your self like a Man, and a Lover of Honour, and leave me no Doubt upon my Soul; think of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93505:56"/>
all you have done this Day, that I may have all the Story of it, in your next Letter to me: But deal faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and neither add, nor diminish, in your Relation; the Truth and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your Confession will attone, even for little Faults, that you shall commit against me, in some of those Things you shall tell me. For if you have fail'd in any Point, or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Love, I had much rather hear it from you, than another: For 'tis a sort of Repentance, to accuse your self; and wou'd be a Crime un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, if you suffer me to hear it from any other: And be assur'd, while you confess it, I shall be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enough to forgive you. The noblest Quality of Man, is Sincerity; and, <hi>Damon,</hi> one ought to have as much of it in Love, as in any other Business of one's Life, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most Part of Men make no Account of it there; but will believe, there ought to be double Dealing, and an Art, practis'd in Love, as well as in War.

Ask him, How I did? How I receiv'd his Letter? And if he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the Air of my Face, when I took it? If I Blusht, or lookt Pale? If my Hand trembl'd, or I spoke to him, with short, interrupting Sighs? If I askt him any Questions about you, while I was opening the Seal? or if I cou'd not well speak, and was silent? If I read it Attentively, and with Joy? And all this, before you open the Answer, I have sent you by him: Which, because you are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to read, you, with the more Haste and Earnestness, demand all you expect from him; and that you may the better know, what Humour I was in, when I writ that to you.

                  <p>YOu will not have much trouble to explain what my <hi>Watch</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs here. There can be no Thought more afficting, than that of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a Mistress; and which, the Sighings of the Heart will soon make you find. Ten Thousand Fears op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press him; he is jealous of every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and envies those Eyes and Ears, that are charm'd, by being near the Object ador'd. He grows impatient, and makes a Thousand Resolutions, and as soon abandons 'em all. He gives himself wholly up to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Incertainty; and by degrees, from one cruel Thought, to another, winds himself up to insupportable Chagrin. Take this Hour then, to think on your Misfortunes; which cannot be small, to a Soul that is wholly sensible of Love. And every
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93505:61"/>
one knows, that a Lover, depriv'd of the Object of his Heart, is depriv'd of all the World, and Inconsolable. For though one wishes, without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, for the dear Charmer one loves, and though you speak of her every Minute; though you are writing to her every Day, and though you are infinitely pleas'd with the dear, and tender Answers; yet, to speak sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, it must be confest, that the Felicity of a true Lover, is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways near his Mistress. And you may tell me, O <hi>Damon!</hi> what you please; and say, that Absence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires the Flame, which perpetual Presence wou'd satiate; I love too well, to be of that Mind; and when I am, I shall believe, my Passion is declining. I know not whether it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances your Love; but surely, it must ruin your Repose: And is it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be, at once, an absent Lover, and Happy too? For my part, I can meet with nothing, that can please, in the Absence of <hi>Damon;</hi> but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I see all Things with Disgust.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93505:61"/>
I will flatter my self, that 'tis so with you; and that the least Evils appear great Misfortunes; and that all thòse, who speak to you of any thing, but of what you love, increase your Pain, by a new Remembrance of her Absence. I will believe, that these are your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, you are assur'd, not to see me in some Weeks; and, if your Heart do not betray your Words, all those Days will be tedious to you. I wou'd not, however, have your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy too extream; and to lessen it, you may perswade your self, that I partake it with you; for, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in your Last, you told me, you wou'd wish, we shou'd be both griev'd at the same Time, and both, at the same Time, pleas'd; and I believe, I love too well, not to obey you.</p>

                  <p>After the afflicting Thoughts of my Absence, make some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on your Happiness. Think it a Blessing, to be permitted to love me: Think it so, because I permit it to you alone; and never cou'd be drawn, to allow it any other. The first Thing you ought to consider is, that, at length, I have suffer'd my self to be overcome, to quit that Nicety, that is natural to me, and receive your Addresses; nay, thought 'em agreeable; and that I have, at last, confest, the Present of your Heart is very dear to me. 'Tis true, I did not accept of it the first Time it was offer'd me, nor before you had told me a Thousand times, that you cou'd not escape Expiring, if I did not give you leave to sigh for me, and gaze upon me; and that there was an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93505:63"/>
Necessity for me, either to give you leave to love, or dye. And all those Rigours, my Severity has made you suffer, ought now to be re-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your Memory, as Subjects of Pleasure; and you ought to esteem, and judge of the Price of my Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the Difficulties you found, in being able to touch my Heart: Not but you have Charms, that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer at first Sight; and you ought not to have valu'd me less, if I had been more easily gain'd: But 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to please you, to think, and know, I am gain'd; no matter when, or how. When, after a Thousand Cares and Inquietudes, that which we wish for, succeeds to our Desires, the Remembrance of those Pains and Pleasures we encounter'd, in arriving at it, gives us a new Joy.</p>
                  <p>Remember also, <hi>Damon,</hi> that I have prefer'd you, before all those, that have been thought worthy of my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem; and that I have shut my Eyes to all their pleading Merits, and cou'd survey none, but yours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:93505:64"/>
Consider then, that you had, not only the Happiness to please me; but that you only found out the Way of doing it; and I had the Goodness, at last, to tell you so, contrary to all the Delicacy, and Niceness of my Soul; contrary to my Prudence, and all those Scruples, you know, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to my Humour.</p>
                  <p>My Tenderness proceeded further, and I gave you innocent Marks of my new-born Passion, on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that presented themselves: For after that, from my Eyes and Tongue, you knew the Sentiments of my Heart, I confirm'd that Truth to you, by my Letters. Confess, <hi>Damon,</hi> that if you make these Reflections, you will not pass this Hour very disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</p>

Choice: And when once one is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd of this, we find not much Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in owning that Passion, which will so well commend one's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and there is no Obstacle, that Love does not surmount.

do not abandon your Heant to too much Joy, though you have so much Reason to be contented: But the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Pleasures are always imperfect. If the Object be lov'd, do not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it: For this Reason, be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and merry, with Reserve. Do not talk too much; I know, you do not love it; and if you do it, 'twill be the Effect of too much Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, or with some Design of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing too well; for you know your own charming Power, and how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable your Wit and Conversation is to all the World.

                  <p>I believe you are so good a Lover, as to be of my Opinion; and that you will neither force your self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Nature, nor find much Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to lavish out those excellent Things, that must proceed from you, when-ever you speak. If all Women were like me, I shou'd have more Reason to fear your Silence, than your Talk; for you have a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Ways to charm, without Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and those which, to me, shew a great deal more Concern. But, <hi>Damon,</hi> you know, the greatest Part of my Sex, judge the fine Gentleman, by the Volubility of his Tongue, by his Dexterity in Repartee; and cry—"Oh! He never wants fine Things to say: He's eternally Talking the most surprising Things." But, <hi>Damon,</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:93505:69"/>
you are well assur'd, I hope, that <hi>Iris</hi> is none of these <hi>Coquets;</hi> at least, if she had any Spark of it once in her Nature, she is, by the Excellency of your contrary Temper, taught to know, and scorn the Folly: And take heed, your Conduct never give me Cause to suspect, you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd me in your Temper.</p>

                  <p>NEvertheless, <hi>Damon,</hi> Civility re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a little Complaisance, after Supper; and I am assur'd, you can never want that, though, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, you are not accus'd of too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a Complaisance; and do not often make use of it, to those Persons, you have an Indifference for; though one is not the less Esteemable, for having more of this, than one ought; and though an Excess of it be a Fault, 'tis
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93505:69"/>
a very excusable one: Have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some for those, with whom you are: You may laugh with 'em, drink with 'em, dance or sing with 'em; yet think of me. You may discourse of a Thousand indifferent Things with 'em, and at the same time, still think of me. If the Subject be any beautiful Lady, whom they praise, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for her Person, Wit, or Vertue; you may apply it to me: And if you dare not say it aloud, at least, let your Heart answer in this Language:
<q>
                        <l>Yes, the fair Object, whom you praise,</l>
                        <l>Can give us Love a Thousand Ways.</l>
                        <l>Her Wit and Beauty charming are;</l>
                        <l>But still, my <hi>Iris</hi> is more fair.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No Body ever spoke before me, of a faithful Lover, but I still sigh'd, and thought of <hi>Damon:</hi> And ever, when they tell me Tales of Love, any soft pleasing Intercourses of an Amour;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93505:70"/>
Oh! with what Pleasure do I listen; and with Pleasure answer 'em, either with my Eyes, or Tongue—
<q>
                        <l>That Lover may his <hi>Silvia</hi> warm;</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>If I have not all those excellent Qualities, you meet with in those beautiful People, I am, however, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad, that Love prepossesses your Heart to my Advantage: And I need not tell you, <hi>Damon,</hi> that a true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ought to perswade himself, that all other Objects ought to give place to her, for whom his Heart sighs—But see, my <hi>Cupid</hi> tells you, 'tis One a-clock, and that you ought not to be longer from your Apartment: Where, while you are Undressing, I will give you leave to say to your self—

                  <p>YOu have been up long enough; and <hi>Cupid,</hi> who takes Care of your Health, tells you, 'tis time for you to go to Bed. Perhaps you may not sleep as soon as you are laid; and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93505:71"/>
possibly, you may pass an Hour in Bed, before you shut your Eyes. In this Impossibility of Sleeping, I think it very proper for you to imagine, what I am doing; where I am. Let your Fancy take a little Journey then, invisible, to observe my Actions, and my Conduct. You will find me, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alone in my Cabinet (for I am one that do not love to go to Bed early) and will find me very unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and pensive; pleas'd with none of those Things, that so well enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain others. I shun all Conversation, as far as Civility will allow; and find no Satisfaction, like being alone; where my Soul may, without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, converse with <hi>Damon.</hi> I sigh; and sometimes, you will see my Cheeks wet with Tears, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly glide down, at a Thousand Thoughts, that present themselves soft, and afflicting. I partake of all your Inquietude. On other Things, I think with Indifference, if ever my Thoughts do stray from the more agreeable Object. I find, however, a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93505:72"/>
little Sweetness in this Thought, that, during my Absence, your Heart thinks of me, when mine sighs for you. Perhaps, I am mistaken; and that, at the same Time, that you are the Entertainment of all my Thoughts, I am no more in yours: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, you are thinking of those Things, that immortalize the Young, and Brave; either by those Glories, the Muses flatter you with; or that of <hi>Belloua,</hi> and the God of War; and Serving now a Monarch, whose Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Acts in Arms, has out-gone all the seign'd, and real Heroes of any Age; who has, himself, out-done what-ever History can produce, of Greatand Brave; and set so Illustrious an Example to the Under-World, that it is not impossible, as much a Lover as you are, but you are thinking now, how to render your self worthy the Glory of such a God-like Master, by projecting a Thousand Things of projecting, and Danger. And though, I confess, such Thoughts are proper for your Youth, your Quality, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93505:72"/>
the Place you have the Honour to hold, under our Soveraign; yet, let me tell you, <hi>Damon,</hi> you will not be without Inquietude, if you think of either being a delicate Poet, or a brave Warrior; for <hi>Love</hi> will still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt your Glory, however you may think to divert him; either by Writing, or Fighting.

Some such Complaint as this, I know you will make; but, <hi>Damon,</hi> if the little Quarrels of Lovers ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reconciling Moments so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Charming, you must needs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that these little Chagrins in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious Dreams, must awaken you to more Joy, to find 'em but Dreams, than if you had met with no Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there. 'Tis for this Reason, that I wou'd have you suffer a little Pain, for a coming Pleasure; nor, indeed, is it possible for you to escape the Dreams, my <hi>Cupid</hi> points you out. You shall dream, that I have a Thousand <hi>Foiblesses,</hi> something of the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my Sex; that my Soul is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in a Thousand Vanities; that, (proud and fond of Lovers) I make Advances for the Glory of a Slave, without any other Interest, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, than that of being ador'd.

All this I give you leave to think, and to offend me; but 'tis in Sleep only, that I permit it; for I wou'd never pardon you the least Offence of this Nature, if in any other Kind, than in a Dream. Nor is it enough Affliction to you, to imagin me thus idly vain; but you are to pass on, to a Hundred more capricious Humours; as that I exact of you a Hundred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Things; that I pretend, you shou'd break off with all your Friends, and, for the future, have none at all; that I will, my self, do those Things, which I violently condemn in you; and that I will have for others, as well as you, that tender Friendship that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles Love; or rather, that Love, which People call Friendship; and that I will not, after all, have you dare complain on me.</p>
                  <p>In fine, be as ingenious as you please, to torment your self; and believe, that I am become unjust, ungrateful, and insensible: But were I so indeed, O <hi>Damon!</hi> consider your awaking Heart, and tell me; Wou'd your Love

                  <p>THough the angry Lovers force themselves, all they can, to chace away the troublesome Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Heart, in the height of their Quarrels, Love sees all their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, pities and redresses 'em: And when we begin to cool, and a soft Repentance follows the Chagrin of the Love-Quarrel, 'tis then, that Love
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93505:85"/>
takes the Advantage of both Hearts, and renews the charming Friendship more forcibly than ever, puts a stop to all our Feuds, and renders the Peace-making Minutes, the most dear and tender part of our Life. How pleasing 'tis to see your Rage dissolve! How sweet, how soft is every Word, that pleads for Pardon at my Feet! 'Tis there, that you tell me, your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sufferings are over-paid, when I but assure you from my Eyes, that I will forget your Crime: And your Imagination shall here present me, the most sensible of your past Pain, that you can wish; and that, all my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger being vanisht, I give you a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Marks of my Faith and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and lastly, to crown all, that we again make new Vows to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of inviolable Peace.</p>

                     <l>After these Debates of Love,</l>

                     <l>Which they ever think to taste,</l>

                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:93505:86"/>
Enjoy then all the Pleasures, that a Heart that is very amorous, and very tender, can enjoy. Think no more on those Inquietudes that you have suffer'd, bless <hi>Love</hi> for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and thank me for my Graces; and resolve to endure any thing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than enter upon any new Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels. And however dear the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Moments are, there proceeds a great deal of Evil from these little frequent Quarrels; and I think, the best counsel we can follow, is to avoid 'em, as near as we can: And if we cannot, but that, in spight of Love, and good Understanding, they shou'd break out, we ought to make as spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a Peace as possible; for 'tis not good to grate the Heart too long, lest it grow harden'd insensibly, and lose its native Temper. A few Quarrels there must be in Love; Love cannot support it self without 'em; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Joy of an Accommodation, Love becomes by it more strongly united, and more charming. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the Lover receive this, as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93505:86"/>
a certain Receipt against declining Love.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Damon,</hi> awake: My <hi>Watch's</hi> Course is done. After this, you cannot be ignorant of what you ought to do, during my Absence. I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it necessary to caution you about Balls and Comedies: You know, a Lover, depriv'd of his Mistress, goes seldom there. But if you cannot hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly avoid these Diversions, I am not so unjust a Mistress, to be angry with you for it.

World may have Reason to say, you do not seek 'em; you do not make a Business, or a Pleasure of 'em; and that 'tis Complaisance, and not Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that carries you thither. Seem rather negligent, than concern'd at any Thing there; and let every Part of you say, Iris <hi>is not here.</hi>

                  <p>I say nothing to you neither, of your Duty elsewhere; I am satisfy'd, you know it too well, and have too great a Veneration for your Glorious Master, to neglect any part of that, for even Love it self! And I very well know, how much you love to be eternally near his Illustrious Person; and that you scarce prefer your Mistress before him, in point of Love: In all things else, I give him leave to take place of <hi>Iris,</hi> in the noble Heart of <hi>Damon.</hi>

                  <p>I am satisfy'd, you pass your Time well now at <hi>Windsor,</hi> for you adore that Place; and 'tis not, indeed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Reason; for 'tis, most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, now render'd, the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Palace in the Christian World. And had our late Gracious Soveraign

of blessed Memory had no other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Wonders of his Life and Reign, to have immortaliz'd his Fame, (of which there shall remain a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to Posterity:) This noble Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture alone, this Building (almost Divine) wou'd have Eterniz'd the great Name of Glorious <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, till the World moulder again to its old Confusion, its first <hi>Chaos.</hi> And the Paintings of the famous <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> and noble Carvings of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable <hi>Gibon,</hi> shall never dye; but remain, to tell succeeding Ages, that all Arts and Learning were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Greece;</hi> but that <hi>England</hi> too cou'd boast its mightiest Share. Nor is the In-side of this magnificent Structure, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortaliz'd with so many eternal Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Illustrious <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> more to be admir'd, than the wondrous Prospects without. The stupendious Heighth, on which the famous Pile is built, renders the Fields, and Flowery Meads below, the Woods, the Thickets, and the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93505:89"/>
Streams, the most delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Object, that ever Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. Beyond all these, and far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in an inviting Vale, the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Colledge, an old, but noble Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, raises it self, in the midst of all the Beauties of Nature; high-grown Trees, fruitful Plains, purling Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and spacious Gardens; adorn'd with all Variety of Sweets, that can delight the Senses.</p>
                  <p>At farther distance yet, on an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, almost as high as that to the Royal Structure, you may behold that famous and noble <hi>Clifdon</hi> rise; a Palace erected by the Illustrious Duke of <hi>Buckingham:</hi> Who will leave this wondrous Piece of Architecture, to inform the future World, of the Greatness and Delicacy of his Mind; it being, for its Situation, its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, and its marvellous Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, one of the finest <hi>Villa</hi>'s of the World; at least, were it finished, as begun; and wou'd sufficiently declare the Magnifick Soul of the Hero, that caus'd it to be built, and contriv'd all
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93505:89"/>
its Fineness. And this makes up not the least Part of the beautiful Prospect from the Palace-Royal, while on the other side, lies spread a fruitful, and delightful Park and Forest, well stor'd with Deer, and all that make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect charming; fine Walks, Groves, distant Vallies, Downs, and Hills, and all that Nature cou'd invent, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish out a quiet, soft Retreat, for the most Fair, and most Charming of Queens, and the most Heroick, Good, and Just of Kings: And these Groves alone, are fit and worthy to divert such Earthly Gods.</p>
                  <p>Nor can Heaven, Nature, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Art contrive an Addition to this Earthly Paradise, unless those great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of the Age, Sir <hi>Samuel Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or Sir <hi>Robert Gorden,</hi> cou'd, by the power of Engines, convey the Water so into the Park and Castle, as to furnish it with delightful Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, both useful and beautiful. These are only wanting, to render the Place All Perfection, without Exception.</p>

This, <hi>Damon,</hi> is a long Digression from the Business of my Heart; but you know, I am so in Love with that charming Court, that when you gave me an Occasion, by your being there now, but to name the Place, I cou'd not forbear transgressing a little, in favour of its wond'rous Beauty; and the rather, because I wou'd, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it, give you to understand, how many fine Objects there are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Ladies that adorn it, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your vacant Moments in; and hope you will, without my Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pass a great part of your idle Time, in surveying these Prospects; and give that Admiration you shou'd pay to living Beauty, to those more venerable Monuments of everlasting Fame.</p>
                  <p>Neither need I, <hi>Damon,</hi> assign you your waiting Times; your Honour, Duty, Love, and Obedience will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct you, when to be near the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the King; and I believe, you will omit no part of that Devoir. You ought to establish your Fortune,

and your Glory: For I am not of the Mind of those Critical Lovers, who believe it a very hard Matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile Love and Interest; to adore a Mistress, and serve a Master at the same time. And I have heard those, who, on this Subject, say, <q>Let a Man be never so careful in these double Duties, 'tis Ten to One, but he loses his Fortune, or his Mistress.</q> These are Errors that I condemn: And I know, that Love and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not incompatible; but that a brave Man may preserve all his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to his Soveraign, and his Passion, and his Respect for his Mistress. And this is my Notion of it.</p>

I consess the Present too rich, too gay, and too magnificent for my Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and though my Love and Faith deserve it, yet my humbler Hope ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver durst carry me to a Wish of so great a Bliss, so great an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Maid I adore!

               <p>You tell me, sair <hi>Iris,</hi> that I ought to preserve it tenderly, and yet you have sent it me without a Case. But that I may obey you justly, and keep it dear to me, as long as I live, I will

give it a Case of my Fashion: It shall be delicate, and sutable to the fine Present; of such Materials too. But because I wou'd have it perfect, I will consult your admirable Wit, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, in an Affair of so curious a Consequence.</p>

                  <head>The Figure of the Case.</head>
                  <p>I Design to give it the Figure of a Heart. Does not your <hi>Watch, Iris,</hi> rule the Heart? It was your Heart that contriv'd it, and 'twas your Heart you consulted, in all the Management of it; and 'twas your Heart that brought it to so fine a Conclusion. The Heart never acts without Reason, and all the Heart projects, it performs with Pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Watch,</hi> my lovely Maid, has explain'd to me a World of rich Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Love: And where shou'd Thoughts so sacred be stor'd, but in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93505:95"/>
the Heart, where all the Secrets of the Soul are treasur'd up; and of which, only <hi>Love</hi> alone can take a View? 'Tis thence he takes his Sighs and Tears, and all his little Flatteries, and Arts to please. All his fine Thoughts, and all his mighty Raptures, nothing is so proper as the Heart, to preserve it; nothing so worthy as the Heart, to contain it; and it concerns my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest too much, not to be infinitely careful of so dear a Treasure: And, believe me, charming <hi>Iris,</hi> I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver part with it.</p>

                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:93505:97"/>
And this dear <hi>Cypher,</hi> is to let you see,</l>
                     <l>Love unites Names, as well as Hearts.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Without this charming Union, our Souls cou'd not communicate those invisible Sweetnesses, which compleat the Felicity of Lovers; and which, the most tender, and passionate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions are too feeble to make us comprehend. But, my adorable <hi>Iris,</hi> I am contented with the vast Pleasure I feel, in Loving well, without the Care of Expressing it well; if you will imagine my Pleasure, without expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it. For I confess, 'twou'd be no Joy to me, to adore you, if you did not perfectly believe, I did adore you. Nay, though you lov'd me, if you had no Faith in me, I shou'd languish, and love in as much Pain, as if you scorn'd, and at the same time believ'd I dy'd for you. For surely, <hi>Iris,</hi> 'tis a greater Pleasure to please, than to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93505:98"/>
be pleas'd; and the Glorious Power of Giving, is infinitely a greater Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, than that of Receiving; there is so great and God-like a Quality in it. I wou'd have your Belief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, equal to my Passion, extream; as indeed, all Love shou'd be, or it cannot bear that Divine Name: It can pass but for an indifferent Asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And these <hi>Cyphers</hi> ought to make the World find all the noble Force of delicate Passion. For, O my <hi>Iris!</hi> what wou'd Love signifie, if we did not love fervently. Sisters and Brothers love; Friends and Relations have Affections; but where the Souls are joyn'd, which are fill'd with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal soft Wishes, Oh there is some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Pleasure, which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest!</p>
                  <p>Your Looks, your dear obliging Words, and your charming Letters have sufficiently perswaded me of your Tenderness; and you might surely see the Excess of my Passion, by my Cares, my Sighs, and entire Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your Will. I never think of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93505:98"/>
                     <hi>Iris,</hi> but my Heart feels double Flames, and pants and heaves with double Sighs; and whose Force makes its Ardours known, by a Thousand Transports: And they are very much too blame, to give the Name of Love to feeble, easie Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: Such Transitory Tranquil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are, at best, but Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wishers to Love; and a Heart that has such Heats as those, ought not to put it self into the Rank of those nobler Victims, that are offer'd at the Shrine of Love. But our Souls, <hi>Iris,</hi> burn with a more glorious Flame, that lights and conducts us beyond a Possibility of losing one another. 'Tis this that flatters all my Hopes: 'Tis this alone makes me believe my self worthy of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris:</hi> And let her judge of its Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, by the Greatness of its Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</p>
                  <p>Does not a Passion of this Nature, so true, so ardent, deserve to be crown'd? And will you wonder to see, over this <hi>Cypher,</hi> a Wreath of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93505:99"/>
                     <hi>Mirtles,</hi> those Boughs, so sacred to the Queen of Love, and so worshipt by Lovers? 'Tis with these soft Wreaths, that those are crown'd, who understand how to love well, and faithfully.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>The Smiles, the Graces, and the Sports,</l>
                     <l>That in the sacred Groves maintain their Courts,</l>
                     <l>Are with these Myrtles crown'd.</l>
                     <l>Thither the Nymphs, their Garlands bring;</l>
                     <l>Their Beauties, and their Praises sing,</l>
                     <l>While Ecchoes do the Songs resound.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Love,</hi> tho' a God, with Mirtle Wreaths,</l>

More valu'd are those consecrated Leaves,</l>

                     <l>And Crowns of Glory less Ambition move,</l>

I dare therefore say,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93505:100"/>
that being honour'd with the Glory of your Tenderness and Care, Iought, as a Trophy of my illustrious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, to adorn the <hi>Watch</hi> with a <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> that is so advantageous to me. Ought I not to esteem my self the most fortunate and happy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to have exchang'd my Heart with so charming and admirable a Person as <hi>Iris?</hi> Ah! how sweet, how precious is the Change; and how vast a Glory arrives to me from it! Oh! you must not wonder, if my Soul abandon it self to a Thousand Extasies! In the Merchandize of Hearts, Oh! how dear it is, to receive as much as one gives; and barter Heart for Heart! Oh! I wou'd not receive mine again, for all the Crowns the Universe contains! Nor ought you, my Adorable, make any Vows, or Wishes, ever to retrieve yours; or shew the least Repentance for the Blessing you have given me. The Exchange we made, was confirm'd by a noble Faith; and you ought to believe, you have bestow'd it well,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93505:100"/>
since you are paid for it, a Heart that is so conformable to yours, so true, so just, and so full of Adoration: And nothing can be the just Recompence of Love, but Love; and to enjoy the true Felicity of it, our Hearts ought to keep an equal Motion; and, like the Scales of Justice, always hang even.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the Property of Reciprocal Love, to make the Heart feel the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of Love, and to give the Lover all the Ease and Softness he can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably hope. Such a Love renders all Things advantageous and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: Such a Love triumphs over all other Pleasures. And I put a Crown of <hi>Olives</hi> over the <hi>Cypher</hi> of <hi>Recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Love,</hi> to make known, that two Hearts, where Love is justly equal, enjoy a Peace, that nothing can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb.</p>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93505:101"/>
things that may arrive, and which we wish for, than to things that Time has rob'd us of: And in those agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Thoughts of Joys to come, the Heart takes more delight to wander, than in all those that are past; though the Remembrance of 'em are very dear, and very charming. We shou'd be both unjust, if we were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded we are possest with a Vertue, the Use of which is so admirable; as that of Constancy. Our Loves are not of that sort, that can finish, or have End; but such a Passion, so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and so constant, that it will be a President for future Ages, to love per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; and when they wou'd express an extream Passion, they will say, <q>They lov'd, as <hi>Damon</hi> did the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Iris.</hi>
                     </q> And he that knows the Glory of Constant Love, will despise those fading Passions, those little A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musements, that serve for a Day. What Pleasure, or Dependance can one have in a Love of that sort? What Concern, What Raptures can such an Amour produce in a Soul? And what
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93505:102"/>
Satisfaction can one promise one's self, in playing with a false Gamester; who, though you are aware of him, in spight of all your Precaution, puts the false Dice upon you, and wins all.</p>

Who is't will celebrate that Flame,</l>

                     <l>While constant Love, the Nymphs and Swains</l>
                     <l>Still sacred make, in lasting Strains,</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>Constant Love finds it self impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be shaken; it resists the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of Envy, and a Thousand Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93505:103"/>
that endeavour to change it: Nothing can disoblige it, but a known Falseness, or Contempt: Nothing can remove it, though for a short Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it may lye sullen and resenting, it recovers, and returns with greater Force and Joy. I therefore, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Reason, crown this <hi>Cypher</hi> of <hi>Constant Love</hi> with a Wreath of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel;</hi> since such Love always triumphs over Time and Fortune, though it be not her Property to besiege; for she cannot overcome, but in defending her self; but the Victories she gains, are never the less glorious.</p>

                  <head>The fourth <hi>Cypher.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>PErhaps, my lovely Maid, you will not find out what I mean by the <hi>S,</hi> and the <hi>L,</hi> in this last <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> that is crown'd with <hi>Roses.</hi> I will therefore tell you, I mean <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Love.</hi> There are very few Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who know the Nature of that Pleasure, which so divine a Love cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates: And let me say what I will of it, they must feel it themselves, who wou'd rightly understand it, and all its ravishing Sweets. But this there is a great deal of Reason to believe, the Secrecy in Love doubles the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of it. And I am so absolutely perswaded of this, that I believe all those Favours that are not kept secret, are dull and paul'd, very insipid and tasteless Pleasures: And let the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours be never so innocent, that a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receives from a Mistress, she ought to value 'em, set a Price upon 'em, and make the Lover pay dear; while
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93505:104"/>
he receives 'em with Difficulty, and sometimes with Hazard. A Lover that is not secret, but suffers every one to count his Sighs, has, at most, but a feeble Passion, such as produces sudden and transitory Desires, which dye as soon as born: A true Love has not this Character; for whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis made publick, it ceases to be a Pleasure, and is only the Result of Vanity. Not that I expect, our Loves shou'd always remain a Secret: No, I shou'd never, at that Rate, arrive to a Blessing, which, above all the Glories of the Earth, I aspire to; but even then, there are a Thousand Joys, a Thousand Pleasures, that I shall be as careful to conceal from the foolish World, as if the whole Preservation of that Pleasure depended on my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; as indeed it does in a great Measure.</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Cypher</hi> I put a Crown of <hi>Roses,</hi> which are not Flowers of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lasting Date. And 'tis to let you see, that 'tis impossible Love can be long hid. We see every Day, with
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93505:104"/>
what fine Dissimulation and Pains, People conceal a Thousand Hates and Malices, Disgusts, Disobligations, and Resentments, without being able to conceal the least part of their Love; but Reputation has an Ardour, as well as <hi>Roses;</hi> and a Lover ought to esteem that, as the dearest, and tenderest Thing; not only that of his own, which is, indeed, the least part; but that of his Mistress, more valuable to him than Life. He ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give People no Occasion to make false Judgments of his Actions, or to give their Censures; which, most certainly, are never in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the fair Person; for likely, those false Censures are of the busie Female Sex, the <hi>Coquets</hi> of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; whose little Spights and Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, joyn'd to that fancy'd Wit they boast of, sets 'em at Odds with all the Beautiful, and Innocent: And how very little of that kind serves, to give the World a Faith, when a Thousand Vertues, told of the same Persons, by more credible Witnesses and Judges,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93505:105"/>
shall pass unregarded; so willing and inclin'd is all the World to credit the Ill, and condemn the Good. And yet, Oh! what pity 'tis, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to live in Pain, to oblige this foolish scandalous World! And though we know each others Vertue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, we are oblig'd to observe that Caution (to humour the Talking Town) which takes away so great a part of the Pleasure of Life! 'Tis therefore that, among these Roses, you will find some Thorns; by which you may imagine, that in Love, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution is necessary to its Secrecy: And we must restrain our selves, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Thousand Occasions, with so much Care, that, O <hi>Iris!</hi> 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be discreet, without Pain; but 'tis a Pain, that creates a Thousand Pleasures.</p>

                     <l>In the Foundation, firm and true:</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:93505:107"/>
In Points of Faith, shou'd still agree:</l>
                     <l>Tho' Innovations vain and new</l>
                     <l>(Love's little Quarrels) may arise;</l>
                     <l>In Fundamentals still they're just and wise.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Then, charming Maid, be sure of this:</l>
                     <l>Allow me Faith as well as Love;</l>
                     <l>Since that alone affords no Bliss,</l>
                     <l>Vnless your Faith your Love im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</l>
                     <l>Either resolve to let me dye</l>
                     <l>By fairer Play, your Cruelty;</l>
                     <l>Than not your Love, with Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</l>
                     <l>And with your Vows, to give your Heart.</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:93505:107"/>
In mad Despair I'd rather fall,</l>
                     <l>Than lose my glorious Hopes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu'ring all.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>So certain it is, that Love, without Faith, is of no value.</p>
                  <p>In fine, my adorable <hi>Iris,</hi> this <hi>Case</hi> shall be, as near as I can, like those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Ones of <hi>Filligrin-Work,</hi> which do not hinder the Sight from taking a View of all within: You may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore see, through this Heart, all your <hi>Watch.</hi> Nor is my Desire of Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this inestimable Piece more, than to make it the whole Rule of my Life and Actions. And my chiefest Design in these <hi>Cyphers,</hi> is, to comprehend in 'em, the principal Vertues that are most necessary to Love. Do not we know, that <hi>Reciprocal Love is Justice; Constant Love, Fortitude; Secret Love, Prudence?</hi> Though 'tis true, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Love, that is, Excess of Love, in one Sense, appears not to be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; yet you must know, my <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> that in Matters of Love, Excess
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93505:108"/>
is a Vertue, and that all other Degrees of Love are worthy Scorn alone. 'Tis this alone, that can make good the glorious Title: 'Tis this alone, that can bear the true Name of Love; and this alone, that renders the Lovers truly happy, in spight of all the Storms of Fate, and Shocks of Fortune. This is an Antidote against all other Griefs: This bears up the Soul in all Calamity; and is the very Heaven of Life, the last Refuge of all Worldly Pain and Care, and may well bear the Title of <hi>Divine.</hi>

               <p>HOw long, O charming <hi>Iris!</hi> shall I speak in vain of your adorable Beauty? You have been just, and believe I love you with a Passion perfectly tender and extream; and yet you will not allow your Charms to be infinite. You must either accuse my Flames to be unreasonable, and that my Eyes and Heart are false Judges of Wit and Beauty; or allow, that you are the most perfect of your Sex. But instead of that, you always accuse me of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, when I speak of your infinite
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93505:111"/>
Merit; and when I refer you to your Glass, you tell me, that flatters, as well as <hi>Damon;</hi> though one wou'd imagine, that shou'd be a good Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for the Truth of what I say, and undeceive you of the Opinion of my Injustice. Look—and confirm your self, that nothing can equal your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. All the World says it, and you must doubt it no longer. O <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris!</hi> Will you dispute against the whole World?</p>
               <p>But since you have so long distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your own Glass, I have here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented you with One, which I know is very true; and having been made for you only, can serve only you. All other <hi>Glasses</hi> present all Objects, but this reflects only <hi>Iris;</hi> whenever you consult it, it will convince you; and tell you, how much Right I have done you, when I told you, you were the fairest Person that ever Nature made. When other Beauties look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, it will speak to all the fair Ones; but let 'em do what they will, 'twill say nothing to their Advantage.</p>

that Truth from him offends you; and because he loves too much, you think his Judgment too little; and since this is so perfect, that must be defective.

It is not of those sorts of Hair, whose Harshness discovers ill Nature; nor of those, whose Softness shews us the Weakness of the Mind:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93505:117"/>
Not that either of these are Arguments without Exception; but 'tis such as bears the Character of a perfect Mind, and a delicate Wit; and for its Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the most faithful, discreet, and beautiful in the World; such as shews a Complexion and Constitution, neither so cold, to be insensible; nor so hot, to have too much Fire; that is, neither too white, nor too black; but such a Mixture of the two Colours, as makes it the most agreeable in the World.</p>

and Proportion of your Arm is unimitable, and your Hand is dazling fine, small, and plump; long-pointed Fingers, delicately turn'd; dimpl'd on the Snowy Out-side, but adorn'd within with Rose, all over the soft Palm. O <hi>Iris!</hi> Nothing equals your fair Hand; that Hand, of which <hi>Love</hi> so often makes such use, to draw his Bow, when he wou'd send the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row home, with more Success; and which irresistibly wounds those, who possibly, have not yet seen your Eyes: And when you have been veil'd, that lovely Hand has gain'd you a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Adorers.

And <hi>Iris,</hi> you may live assur'd, that your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is eternally establisht, by your Beauty, and your Goodness: Your Power is confirm'd, and you grow in Strength every Minute: Your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness gets you Friends, and your Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lovers.</p>
                  <p>This Goodness is not one of those, whose Folly renders it easie to every Desirer; but a pure Effect of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity of your Soul: such as Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence alone manages, according to

And though sometimes you can be a little disturb'd, yet, through your Anger, your Goodness shines; and you are but too much afraid, that that may bear a false Interpretation: For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, Scandal makes that pass for an Effect of Love, which is purely, that of Complaisance.</p>

Your Modesty, that so commendable a Vertue in the Fair, and so peculiar to you, is here a little too severe: Did I flatter you, you shou'd blush: Did I seek, by praising you, to shew an Art of Speaking finely, you might chide.

Abate, O <hi>Iris,</hi> a little of this Vertue, since you have so many other, to defend your self against the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of your Adorers.</p>
                  <p>You your self have the least Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of your own Charms: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only Person in the World, that is not in love with 'em, you hate to pass whole Hours before your <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glass;</hi> and to pass your Time,

like most of the idle Fair, in dressing, and setting off those Beauties, which need so little Art. You, more wise, disdain to give those Hours to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of Dressing, which you know so well how to employ a Thousand Ways. The Muses have blest you, above your Sex; and you know how to gain a Conquest with your Pen, more absolutely, than all the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Fair, who trust to Dress and Equipage.</p>
                  <p>I have a Thousand things to tell you more, but willingly resign my Place to <hi>Damon,</hi> that faithful Lover; he will speak more ardently than I: For, let a <hi>Glass</hi> use all its Force, yet, when it speaks its Best, it speaks but coldly.</p>
                  <p>If my <hi>Glass,</hi> O charming <hi>Iris!</hi> have the good Fortune (which I cou'd never entirely boast) to be believ'd, 'twill serve, at least, to convince you, I have not been so guilty of Flattery, as I have a Thousand times been charg'd. Since then my Passion is

equal to your Beauty (without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, or End) believe, O lovely Maid! how I sigh in your Absence: And be perswaded to lessen my Pain, and restore me to my Joys; for there is no Torment so great, as the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a Lover from his Mistress; of which, this is the <hi>Idea.</hi>
