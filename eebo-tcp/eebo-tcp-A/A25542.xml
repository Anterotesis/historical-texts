            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Answer to a Paper
Set forth by the
COFFEE-MEN;
Directed to the HONOURABLE,
The Commons in Parliament Assembled. BEING
Reflections upon some Propositions that were Exhibited to the Parliament, for the
Changing the Excise of Coffee, Tea, and Chocolate, into a Custom, upon the Commodities.</head>
            <p>THey acknowledge the said <hi>Paper</hi> seems to be in Favour of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etailers of <hi>Coffee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in Reality it is so: Because, as the Tax before was up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the Liquor, many paid
more than they Ought, and many Less:</p>
            <p>And therefore, they themselves Petitioned the Parliament, that there mig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t be an Impost laid after
this manner: And do not complain of the manner of the Tax, but tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Rates are too high;
when in truth, the Tax is not half so high, as it is by the Statute, if eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y man paid his just due:
And therefore, unjustly Complain of the <hi>Paper,</hi> as going about to ruine th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, and their Families.</p>
            <p>They accuse the <hi>Paper</hi> of great Falsities in the Proportions of the <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e, Tea,</hi> and <hi>Chocolate,</hi> to
make the several Quantities of Liquors, though the Proportions are the same as are used in most
<hi>Coffee-Houses</hi> in and about <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And have set out a Calculation of their own, which is much further from Truth.</p>
            <p>But suppose their own Calculation about the Proportions of the Quantities to be true.</p>
            <p>By the Act, every <hi>Coffee-Seller</hi> is to pay <hi>Eight Pence per</hi> Gallon for <hi>Coffee; Sixteen Pence per</hi> Gallon for
<hi>Tea;</hi> and <hi>Sixteen Pence per</hi> Gallon for <hi>Chocolate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, by their own Calculation, a Pound of <hi>Coffee</hi> makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wo Gallons and an half of <hi>Coffee</hi> Liquor,
which is to pay <hi>Twenty Pence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by the <hi>Paper,</hi> a Pound of <hi>Coffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> is to pay but <hi>Ten Pence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Pound of <hi>Tea,</hi> by their Calculation, makes Nine Galons of Liquor, which by the Act, at <hi>Sixteen
Pence per</hi> Gallon, amounts to <hi>Twelv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Shillings per</hi> Pound.</p>
            <p>But by the <hi>Paper,</hi> a Pound of <hi>Tea</hi> is proposed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at <hi>Five Shillings per</hi> Pound.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chocolate,</hi> by the Act, is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pay <hi>Sixteen Pence per</hi> Galon, and <hi>One</hi> Pound makes but <hi>One</hi> Gallon by
their Calculation.</p>
            <p>But this must be a False Calculation: For if a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> which commonly is sold for <hi>Four
Shillings pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Pound, will make but <hi>One</hi> Gallon, and the Gallon containeth, by their Estimation, but
<hi>Twenty</hi> Dishes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which at <hi>Three Pence per</hi> Dish, comes to but <hi>Five Shillings per</hi> Gallon: Now the Duty
being <hi>Sixteen Pence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the <hi>Chocolate Four Shillings,</hi> amounts to <hi>Five Shillings</hi> and <hi>Four Pence per</hi> Gallon; So
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at they lose in every Gallon <hi>Four Pence</hi> by the Retailing of it, if their Calculation were true.</p>
            <p>But if the Calculation of the proportions in the <hi>Paper,</hi> which was for <hi>Milk-chocolate,</hi> and to be sold
at <hi>Two Pence</hi> the Dish; or if one third part of <hi>Chocolate</hi> be allow'd more to the same proportion of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
to make it with Water, and sold at <hi>Three Pence</hi> the Dish, there would appear some Profit to the
Retailer, which ought to be more believ'd than their Calculation, which produceth Loss.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Cocao-Nut,</hi> they make no Objections; so it's taken for Granted, that may pay <hi>One Shilling per</hi> Pound.</p>
            <p>So it plainly appears, by their own acknowledgment, that the Rules set down in the <hi>Paper,</hi> are not
half so great as those already appointed by the Act, if every man paid his full due.</p>
            <p>And it is not to be supposed, that the <hi>Coffee</hi>-men designed, by their Petition, to lessen the Duty of the
<hi>Excise;</hi> but to make it more Equal, by changing it into an <hi>Impost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if they pay no more than they ought to do by the Act, they have no reason to complain: And
therefore they must acknowledge, that the <hi>Paper</hi> was Written with a design of Ease and Friendship to
them, as well as out of Service to the Crown; to Improve the Revenue to the <hi>KING,</hi> and render
the <hi>Tax</hi> more Easy to the Subject.</p>
            <list>
               <item>The Consumption of <hi>Coffee</hi> as appears by the <hi>Coffee</hi>-mens Calculation delivered with their Petition,
