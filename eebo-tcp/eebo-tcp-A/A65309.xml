            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>That the Profaneness of the times should not <hi>slacken</hi> but <hi>highthen</hi> our zeal.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102654:10"/>
others spake against God, these spake for God.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Noah</hi>'s dayes all Flesh had corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it self, (the old World was drowned in sin before it was drowned in water:) now at this time, <hi>Noah was perfect in his Generation, and Noah walked with God,</hi> Gen. 6.9.

Infection. As Gods Word is our Rule, so his Will is our Warrant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be holiest in evil times is an Indication of the truth of Grace. To profess Religion when the times favour it, is no Great matter. Who almost will not court the Queen of the Gospel when she is hung with Jewels? but to own the wayes of God when they are decried and maligned, to love a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted truth, this evidenceth a vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Goodness. Dead Fish swim down the stream, living Fish swim against it. To swim against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon stream of evil shews Grace to be alive. The Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> continuing zealous for the Lord of Hosts, when they had digged down Gods Altars, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.10. shewed his heart and lips had been touched with a Coal from the Altar.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Vse.</hi> See hence how unworthy they are of the Name of Christians who use sinful complyance, and cut the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Religion according to the Mode and fashion of the times. They consult not what is <hi>best,</hi> but what is <hi>safest</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Non qu√¢ eundum sed qua itur.</hi> Sen.</note>. Complying spirits can truckle to the humours of others; they can
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102654:11"/>
bow either to the <hi>East</hi> or to the <hi>Host</hi>; they prefer a whole Skin before a pure Conscience. They can with the Planet <hi>Mercury</hi> vary their motion; they can as the Mariner shift their Sail with every wind: and as the Mungril <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> speak the Language of <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Ashdod.</hi> These are like the <hi>Samaritans</hi> of whom <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, when the Jews flourished they pretended to be a-kin to them, and come of the tribe of <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> and <hi>Manasseh,</hi> but when the Jews were persecuted, they disclaimed Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with them. The <hi>old Serpent</hi> hath taught men crooked windings, and to be for that Religion not which hath <hi>truth</hi> on its side, but <hi>power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Vse.</hi> Let us keep up the vigour of our zeal in times of degeneracy. We should by an holy <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> burn hotter in a frozen age. We live in the dregs of time; Sin is grown com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and impudent: 'Tis excellent to walk Antipodes to the World. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. Let us be as Lillies and Roses among the Briars. Sin is never the better because it is in fashion, nor will this plea hold at the last day, that we did as the most. God will say, Seeing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102654:11"/>
you sinned with the Multitude, you shall go to Hell with the Multitude. O let us keep pure among dregs; let us be like Fish that retain their freshness in salt waters; and as that <hi>Lamp</hi> which shined <hi>in the smoaking Furnace,</hi> Gen. 15.17.</p>
               <p>Consider, 1. To be holy in times of General defection is that which God is Greatly pleased with. The Lord was much taken with the holy conferences and dialogues of these Saints in the Text. When others were inveighing against the Deity, that there should be a parcel of holy Souls speaking of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the Life to come, their words were Musick in Gods ears.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To keep up a spirit of Holiness in an adulterous Generation, is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians honour. This was the glory of the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> that she held fast Christs Name, even <hi>where Satans seat was,</hi> Rev. 2.13. The Impiety of the times is a Foyl to set off Grace the more, and make it cast a greater lustre. Then a Christian is most lovely, when he is (as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith) like the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, which keeps its Viridity and freshness in the Winter season. <hi>Psalm</hi> 37.37. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102654:12"/>
the Vpright</hi>: An upright man is always worth beholding, but then he is most to be admired when like a bright Star he Shines in the dark, and having lost all, holds fast his integrity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To be Good in a prosligate Age, doth much animate weak beginners; it <hi>Strengthens feeble knees,</hi> Isa. 35.3. And shores up those <hi>Temples of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost</hi> which are ready to fall. One mans Zeal is a Torch for others to light at. How did the Constancy of the Martyrs inflame the love of many to the Truth! Though only Christs blood doth Save, yet the blood of Martyrs may strengthen. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Prison Chain, made Converts in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Court, two of which were afterwards Martyrs as History relates. Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi>'s holy advice and example so confirmed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Farrar</hi> that he would not touch with the Roman Pollution. <note n="*" place="margin">Fox <hi>Acts &amp; Mon.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. How sad will it be for Christians to fall off from their former Profession, and espouse a novel Religion. <hi>Iulian</hi> Bathed himself in the blood of Beasts Offered in Sacrifice to the Heathen Gods, and so as much as in him lay wash'd off his former Baptism. In the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102654:12"/>
time of <hi>Iulius Cesar</hi> this Prodigy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, after a plentiful Vintage there were wild Grapes appeared upon their Vines, which was looked upon as Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. When men seemed to bring forth the Fruits of Righteousness, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards bring forth the Wild Grapes of Impiety, it is a sad Omen and Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostick of their Ruine, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>For it had been better for them not to have known the way of Righteousness, than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have known it to turn from the Holy Commandment.</hi> Let all this make us maintain the power of Holiness in the worst Times: Though others won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der we do not sin after the rate that they do, yet, remember, it is better to go to Heaven with a few, than to Hell in the Crowd.</p>
               <p>How may we keep up the briskness and fervour of Grace in times of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us beware of having our hearts too much linked to the World.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> The World damps zeal, as Earth chokes the fire. We are bid to <hi>love our Enemies</hi>; but the World is such an Enemy as we must not love, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.15. <hi>Love not the World.</hi> The World bewitcheth with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102654:13"/>
her Blandishments, and kills with her silver Darts. He who is a <hi>Demas,</hi> will be a <hi>Iudas</hi>; a lover of the World, will for a piece of Money betray a good Cause, and make Shipwrack of a good Conscience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us be Voluntiers in Religion; that is, <hi>Choose</hi> God's service, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.30. <hi>I have chosen the way of truth.</hi> It is one thing to be good out of <hi>Design,</hi> and another thing to be good out of <hi>Choice.</hi> Hypocrites are good only out of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly design, they embrace the Gospel for secular advantage, and these will in time fall away. The <hi>Chelidonian</hi> Stone keeps its Vertue no longer than it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in Gold, take it out of the Gold, and it loseth its vertue. False Hearts are good no longer than they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in golden Prosperity, take them out of the Gold, and they lose all their seeming Goodness: But if we would retain our Sanctity in Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding times we must serve God pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of Choice. He who is good out of Choice loves holiness for its beauty, and adheres to the Gospel, when all the Jewels of preferment are pulled off.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:102654:13"/>3. Let us be inlaid with sincerity. If a piece of Timber begin to bend, it is because it is not sound. Why do any bend and comply against their Conscience, but because their hearts are not sound, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.37. <hi>Their hearts were not right with him, neither were they sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast.</hi> Sincerity causeth stability. When the Apostle exhorts to <hi>stand fast</hi> in the evil day, among the rest of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian armour, he bids them <hi>put on the Girdle of truth,</hi> Ephes. 6.19. <hi>Stand fast therefore, having your loins Girt about with truth.</hi> The Girdle of Truth is nothing else but sincerity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us get love to Christ. Love is an holy transport, it fires the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, steels the Courage, carries a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian above the love of life, and the fear of death, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot quench Love:</hi> Love made Christ suffer for us. If any one ask what Christ died off; it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, he died of Love. If we love Christ, we will own him in the worst times, and be like that Virgin <hi>Basil</hi> speaks of, who not accepting deliverance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sinful terms, cried out, <hi>Let Life and Money go, welcome Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:102654:14"/>5. If we would keep up the sprightly Vigour of Grace in evil times, let us harden our Hearts against the taunts and reproaches of the wicked. <hi>David</hi> was <hi>the Song of the Drunkards,</hi> Psal. 69.12. A Christian is never the worse for reproach. The Stars are not the less Glorious though they have ugly names given them, the <hi>Bear,</hi> the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> &amp;c.

One can no more act as a Christian without Fear, than he can act as a man without reason. This Holy Fear is the fixed temper and Complexion of the Soul; This Fear is not <hi>Servile</hi> but <hi>Filial</hi>; there is difference between <hi>Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God,</hi> and <hi>being afraid of God</hi>; the Godly fear God as a Child doth his Father, the wicked are afraid of God as the Prisoner is of the Judge. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Fear will appear admirable, if you consider how it is mixed and interwoven with several of the Graces.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Fear of God is mixed with Love, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.19, 20. The Chast Spouse fears to displease her Husband because she loves him: There's a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that fear and love should be in conjunction. Love is as the Sails to swiften the Souls motion, and Fear as the Ballast to keep it steady in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Love will be apt to grow wanton unless it be poised with fear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Fear of God is mixed with Faith, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.7. <hi>By Faith Noah

moved with fear,</hi> &amp;c. When the Soul looks either to Gods Holiness, or it's own sinfulness, it fears, but it is a fear mixed with faith in Christs merits; the Soul doth <hi>tremble</hi> yet <hi>trust.</hi> Like a Ship which lies at Anchor, though it shakes with the wind, yet it is fixed at Anchor. God in Great wisdom coupleth these two graces of Faith and Fear. Fear preserves serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, faith preserves chearfulness. Fear is as Lead to the Net to keep a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian from floating in presumption, and Faith is as Cork to the Net to keep him from sinking in despair.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Fear of God is mixed with Prudence: he who fears God hath the Serpents eye in the Doves head. He foresees and avoids those Rocks which others run upon. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3. Though divine Fear doth not make a Person <hi>Cowardly,</hi> it makes him <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fear of God is mixed with Hope. <hi>Psalm</hi> 33.18. <hi>The eye of the Lord is on them that fear him, that hope in his mercy.</hi> One would think Fear should destroy Hope, but it cherisheth it. Fear is to Hope as the

               <p n="5">5. The Fear of God is mixed with Industry, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Noah moved with fear prepared an ark.</hi> There is 1. A fear of <hi>diffidence,</hi> which represents God as a severe Judge, this takes the Soul off from duty <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 25.25.</note>. 2. A fear of <hi>diligence</hi>; a Christian fears and prayes, fears and repents. Fear quickens Industry. The Spouse fearing lest the Bridegroom should come before she is dressed, hastens and puts on her Jewels, that she may be ready to meet him. Fear causeth a watchful eye, and a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand. Fear banisheth sloth out of it's Diocese. The Greatest labour in Religion (saith Holy Fear) is far less than the least pain the damned feel in Hell: no Greater Spur in the Heavenly race than fear.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Cogent Reasons enforcing the Fear of God.</head>
               <p>THe Reasons enforcing this Holy Fear are, 1. Because Gods eye is alwayes upon us. He who is under the eye of his earthly Prince, will be carefull of doing any thing that should offend him. <hi>Iob</hi> 31.4. <hi>Doth not he see my wayes, and count all my Steps?</hi> God sees in the dark. Psalm 139.12. <hi>The darkness hideth not from thee.</hi> The night is no Curtain, the clouds are no Canopy to hinder or intercept Gods sight. He sees the Heart. A Judge can judge of the <hi>fact,</hi> but God judgeth of the <hi>Heart. Ier.</hi> 17.10. He is like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wheels, <hi>full of eyes, Ezek.</hi> 10.12. and as <hi>Cyril</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. God interprets our not fearing him a slighting of him. As not to praise
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102654:18"/>
God, is to wrong him; so not to fear God, is to sleight him. Of all things a person can least endure to be sleighted. Psalm 10.13. <hi>Wherefore doth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked contemn God</hi>

O my Soul how is it with thee? dost thou gain or lose? is thy Faith in it's Infancy, being but newly laid to the breast of a Promise? or is it Grown to some stature? how is it? doth Grace prevail or Sin?

He who Fears God dares not do that which is of <hi>evil report,</hi> though possibly the thing in it self may be no sin. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Dare any of you having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust?</hi> Yes, might some say, what sin is it to have a just cause brought before unbelievers, that it may be decided? O but, might the Apostle reply, though the thing in it self be lawful, yet because it sounds ill, and exposeth your Religion to the Scorn and insult of unbelievers,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102654:34"/>
you that Fear God should not dare to do it. It were better to decide it by a prudent arbitration. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. <hi>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. He who Fears God is not only afraid of evil <hi>actions,</hi> but to offend God in his <hi>Thoughts.</hi> Deut. 19.6. <hi>Beware that there be not a thought in thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heart,</hi> &amp;c. To think of sin with delight is to act it over in the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, this is Culpable. A man may think himself into Hell. What were the Apostate Angels damned for, was it for any more than Proud thoughts? This is the first note of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, He who reverenceth a Deity flies from Sin. It is a saying of <hi>Anselm,</hi> If Sin were on one side and Hell on the other, I would rather leap into Hell than willingly sin against God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He who Fears God, walks by <hi>Rule</hi> rather than <hi>Example:</hi> Example is for the most part corrupt. Examples of great men are influential <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102654:35"/>
of God steers the <hi>Rudder</hi> of his Life according to the <hi>Compass</hi> of the Word. He looks to the sacred Canon as the Mariner to the Load-Star, or <hi>Israel</hi> to the <hi>Pillar of Fire,</hi> to direct him. <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the Law, to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He who Fears God keeps his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Fear God, and keep his commandments. Luther</hi> said, He had rather obey God than work miracles. A Gracious Soul cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his own will to fulfil Gods: if the Lord bid him Crucifie his bosom-sin, forgive his enemies, he instantly obeys. An Heathen exercising much cruelty to a Christian, asked him in scorn, What Great Miracle his Master <hi>Christ</hi> ever did? The Christian replyed, This Miracle, that though you use me thus Cruelly, <hi>I can forgive you.</hi> An Holy Heart Knows there is nothing lost by obedience. <hi>David sware unto the Lord, that he would not rest till he found a place for God,</hi> Psalm 132.4, 5. And God <hi>Sware again to David, that of the fruit of his body he would set upon his throne,</hi> Psalm 132.11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He who Fears God is alike
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102654:35"/>
Good in all Companies: He diffuseth the sweet savour of Godliness where ever he comes. Hypocrites can change themselves into all shapes, and be as their company is; Serious in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company, and Vain in another: He who reverenceth a Deity, is <hi>semper idem,</hi> alike Good in all places. An even Pulse shows Health: an even walking shows Grace. If a Good man be providentially cast among the wicked, he will not coalesce with them, but in his deportment shows forth a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of Holiness.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He who Fears God is good in the Station where God hath set him. Take an instance in <hi>Ioseph,</hi> Gen. 42.18. <hi>I fear God.</hi> And see a pattern of <hi>Relative</hi> sanctitie: He showed towards his Master fidelity, towards his Mistress chastity, towards his Father duty, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Brethren bounty. A good man makes his family <hi>Palaestra Pieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> a Nursery of Piety <note n="*" place="margin">Psalm 102.1.</note>, as it was said of <hi>Cranmer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. He who Fears God, dares not neglect Family or Closet-prayer, <hi>Psalm</hi> 109.4. <hi>I Give my self to Prayer.</hi> Prayer whispers in Gods ears. <hi>Clemens
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102654:36"/>
Alexandrinus</hi> calls it <hi>private conference</hi> with God. Why was <hi>Nymphas</hi>'s house call'd a <hi>Church,</hi> Col. 4.15. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was consecrated by Prayer? A Gracious Soul puts forth <hi>fervent sighs</hi> in Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. And sure that prayer doth soonest pierce Heaven which pierceth ones own Heart.</p>
               <p>If Prayer be made the Touch-stone, then the number of those who Fear God is but small. Are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayerless Families in this City and Nation? <hi>Iob</hi> 15.4. <hi>Thou casteth off fear, thou restrainest prayer.</hi> When men restrain prayer, they cast off the Fear of God. It is the brand set upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, <hi>Psalm</hi> 14.4. <hi>He calls not upon God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. He who Fears God will not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his Neighbour. <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.17. <hi>Ye shall not oppress one another, but thou shalt fear thy God.</hi> How can he be Holy who is not just? A Saint, yet an Extortioner is a Soloecism. A cruel op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor is like <hi>Iudas,</hi> his bowels are fallen out. The Fear of God would cure this. <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Will ye sell your brethren?</hi> v. 9. <hi>Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God?</hi> As if <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had said, If ye
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102654:36"/>
had the Fear of God ye would not be so wicked, ye would not rise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ruines of others, and to wrong them, damn your selves.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He who Fears God is given to works of Mercy. The Fear of God is alwaies joyned with love to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Grace may have a <hi>Trembling hand,</hi> but it hath not a <hi>Withered hand,</hi> it stretcheth out its self to relieve the indigent. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Pure Religion before God and the Father is this, to Visit the Fatherless and the Widdows in their Affliction.</hi> To Visit them is not only to go to see them in Affliction: our Saviour expounds what Visiting is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.36. <hi>Ye visited me</hi>; how was that? <hi>vers.</hi> 35. <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat.</hi> Good works are not the <hi>Cause</hi> of our Justification, but they are the <hi>Evidence.</hi> How far are they from the Fear of God, who are hard-hearted to Christs Poor! You may as well extract Oil out of a Flint, as the Golden Oil of Charity out of their hearts. <hi>Dives</hi> denied <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> a Crumb of Bread, and <hi>Dives</hi> was denied a drop of Water.</p>
               <p n="9">9. He who Fears God had rather
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102654:37"/>
displease man than God. <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The Midwives Feared God, and did not as the King commanded, but saved the Men-children alive.</hi> What, not obey the Kings Command! How could this stand with their Allegiance? Very well, because it was an unlawful command. The King bad them put to death the Males of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which they durst not doe, for Fear of incurring Gods displeasure. King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Golden Image to be worshipped, but the three Children (or rather <hi>Champions</hi>) said, <hi>Be it known unto thee O King, we will not serve thy Gods, or worship thy Golden Image,</hi> Dan. 3.18. They would rather <hi>burn</hi> than <hi>bow</hi>: He who Fears God, knows it is best to keep in with God; he is the surest Friend, but the sorest Enemy.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Fear of God will make a man Fear these six things.</p>
               <list>

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:102654:37"/>1. The Fear of God will make a man afraid of <hi>Satans snares.</hi> He hath the eye of Faith to see these snares, and the wing of Fear to fly from them‚Äî<hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus Timor addidit alas</hi>‚Äî2 Cor. 2.11. <hi>We are not ignorant of his devices.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, subtile Stratagems. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is called the <hi>Old Serpent,</hi> Rev. 12.9. Though he hath lost his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he hath not lost his Policy: his snares are so Cunningly laid, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Guidance of Gods Fear we cannot escape them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One subtil Artifice of Satan is, he baits his Hook with Religion: he can change his Flag, and hang out Christs Colours; here <hi>he Transforms himself into an Angel of light.</hi> The Devil tempts men to Evil, <hi>that Good may come of it,</hi> Rom. 3.8. He whistles them into the snare of preferment, that hereby they may be in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing God more service. The white Devil is worst. Who would su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect Satan when he comes as a <hi>Divine,</hi> and if need be, can quote Scripture?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another snare of Satan is, to tempt to sin under a plea of Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Lot</hi> offered to expose his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102654:38"/>
to the lusts of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> that he might preserve his Angel-guests who were come into his house, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.8. Did not Satan instigate him to this? Necessity will not excuse impiety.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Snare is to Colour over sin with the Pretence of Vertue. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> hung a Curtain curiously embroidered over a foul Picture full of Owls and Satyrs. Satan puts Good names on sin, as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians call that Film in the eye which hinders the sight, <hi>a Pearl in the eye.</hi> Satan Colour'd over <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Ambition with the Name of Zeal, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 10.16. He makes men believe Revenge is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Covetousness Frugality: as if one should write <hi>balm-water</hi> upon a glass of Poyson.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Snare of Satan is, to carry on his mischievous designs under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Friendship. He puts off his Lions Skin, and comes in Sheeps Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Antonini blandimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta magis timebantur quam ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundia.</hi>
                  </note>. Thus Satan came to Christ; <hi>Command that these Stones be made bread,</hi> Mat. 4.3. As if he had said, I see thou art Hungry, I therefore out of Pity Counsel thee to get some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat, <hi>turn stones to bread</hi> that thy hunger may be satisfied: but Christ
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102654:38"/>
spied the Serpent in the Temptation and repulsed him. Thus Satan came to <hi>Eve</hi> under the Notion of a Friend. Eat, saith he, of the Tree in the midst of the Garden, <hi>Ye shall not dye, ye shall be as Gods,</hi> Gen. 3.4, 5. As if he had said, I perswade you only to that which will put you into a better condition than now ye are; eat of the <hi>Tree of knowledge</hi> and it will make you Omniscient. What a kind Devil was here! but <hi>Eve</hi> found a Worm in the Apple. <hi>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes</hi>‚Äî<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Virg. AEn.</hi> 2.</note>.</p>
               <p n="5">5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Snare, if Satan cannot take a Christian off from duty, he will put him on too far in duty. Humiliation is a duty, but Satan suggests that the Soul is not humbled enough: and indeed he never thinks it humbled enough till it despairs. Satan comes thus to a man: Thy sins have bin great, and thy Sorrow should be proportionable; But is it so? canst thou say thou hast bin as great a Mourner as thou hast bin a Sinner? what is a drop of Sorrow to a Sea of Sin? This is laid only as a Snare: the subtil enemy would have a Christian weep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102654:39"/>
blind, and in a desperate humour throw away the Anchor of Hope. And if Satan hath such fallacies, and as a <hi>Decoy</hi> draws so many Millions into his snares, is there not cause of jealous fear lest we should be trappan'd? The fear of God will make us Fear Hells stratagems. Satans <hi>snares</hi> are worse than his <hi>darts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Fear of God will make a man afraid of his <hi>own Heart. Luther</hi> used to say, he feared his Heart more than the Pope or Cardinals, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The Heart is deceitful above all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is <hi>deceitful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word signifies, it is a <hi>Jacob</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </note>, or Supplanter. As <hi>Jacob</hi> supplanted his brother, and got away the blessing; so our Hearts would supplant and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Above all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is deceit in Weights, deceit in Friends; but the Heart hath an art of deceiving beyond all <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Multae sunt in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo latebrae,</hi> Cicero.</note>. In the best hearts there is some fallaciousness. <hi>David</hi> was upright in all things, <hi>save only in the matter of Vriah,</hi> 1 King 15.5. A Godly man Knowing there is a spice of this deceit in his Heart,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102654:39"/>
Fears himself. The flesh is a Bosom-Traitor. No man can believe what evil is in his Heart. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Is thy Servant a Dog? Hazael</hi> could not believe his Heart had bin big of such Monsters. If one had come to <hi>Noah</hi> and said<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> thou wilt be drunk shortly; he would have said, <hi>Is thy Servant a Dog?</hi> No man knows what is in his breast, or what scandal he may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to if God leaveth him. Christ warns his own Apostles to <hi>take heed of surfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drunkenness,</hi> Luk. 21.34. A Godly man therefore fears his Heart with a Fear of Caution and jealousie. The Heart is not only <hi>stubborn,</hi> but <hi>subtil.</hi> Let us a little Trace this Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, and see if there be not cause to fear it. The heart shows it's deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness about
<list>
                     <item>1. Things Sinful.</item>
                     <item>2. Things Sacred.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Heart shows it's deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness about things <hi>sinful</hi>; this deceit is 1. In hiding of sin, as <hi>Rahab</hi> hid the <hi>spies in the flax,</hi> Josh. 2.6. So the Heart Hides sin: and how doth it hide it?
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102654:40"/>
Just as <hi>Adam</hi> hid himself under <hi>fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves,</hi> so the Heart hides sin under the figleaves of excuses. It was done against the will, or in a Passion; or it was long of others: <hi>Aaron</hi> laid his sin in making the Golden calf upon the people, <hi>Exo.</hi> 32.22. <hi>The people are set on mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief:</hi> And <hi>Adam</hi> tacitly laid his sin upon God himself, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.12. <hi>The Woman thou gavest me, she gave me of the tree.</hi> As to say, If thou hadst not given me this tempting woman, I had not eat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Hearts deceit is seen in Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of us, it will make us believe we are not so bad as we are. The Physitian deceives the patient, when he tells him his disease is not so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, yet he is falling into the hands of death. The Heart will tell a man he is free from Theft, when yet he robs others of their Good Name; he is free from Drunkenness, when, though he will not be drunk with Wine, he will be drunk with Passion. Thus the Heart is a flattering Glass, to make one look fairer than he is: and is there not cause to suspect this Impostor?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:102654:40"/>2. The Heart shews it's deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness about things <hi>Sacred</hi>; it will be ready to put us off with Counterfeit Grace. Many have bin deceived in taking false Mony, and it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in taking false Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Heart is ready to deceive with a false <hi>repentance.</hi> A Sinner is troubled a little for <hi>Sin,</hi> or rather, the <hi>consequent</hi> of it, and perhaps sheds a few tears, and now his Heart sooths him up that he is a true Penitent. But every legal terrour is not Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>They were pricked in their Heart:</hi> yet after this, <hi>Peter said unto them Repent,</hi> ver. 38. If every slight Trouble for sin were true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> may be listed in the number of penitents. Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Repentance works a change of Heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. It produceth Sanctity. But the false penitentiary, though he hath trouble of Spirit, yet no Metamorphise or change. He hath a weeping Eye, but an adulterous Heart. <hi>Ahab</hi> Fasts and puts on sack-cloth, but after this, he puts the Prophet <hi>Micaiah</hi> in Prison, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22.27.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:102654:41"/>2. The Heart is apt to deceive with a false <hi>Faith,</hi> it would put the <hi>dead child</hi> in the room of the <hi>living.</hi> They in the second of <hi>Iohn</hi> are said to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:</hi> But Christ did not believe their faith, <hi>John</hi> 2.24. True Faith, as it casts it self into Christs arms to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, so it casts it self at Christs feet to serve him: But spurious Faith though it be forward to Receive Christs benefits, yet it plucks the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from his shoulders,</hi> Isa. 9.6. It would have him a <hi>Priest,</hi> but not <hi>upon his throne,</hi> Zach. 6.13. Thus the Heart is full of fallacies; he who Fears God fears his Heart lest it should rob him of the <hi>blessing.</hi> That saying of <hi>Epicharmus</hi> is Good, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3. A Child of God may so far Fear death, as this Fear fits him more for death. <hi>Jacob</hi> feared his brother

               <p>But this Fear of death in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly must be mixed with <hi>hope.</hi> The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of death to a Believer is quite changed: death is in it self a curse, but God hath turned this Curse into a Blessing.

               <p n="4">4. The Fear of God will make a man fear <hi>Iudgment.

               <p n="2">2. There shall be such a day for the Vindication of Gods Justice. Things seem to be carried in the World Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially: the Godly suffer, the Wicked Prosper.

               <p n="1">1. The Godly should so fear Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as every day to renew their Sorrow for Sin. They have sins <hi>quotidiani in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursus,</hi> that creep upon them daily, and they must with <hi>Peter, weep bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly</hi>; they must steep their Souls in the brinish Tears of Repentance: It

would be sad to be found at the last day in any sin unrepented of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Godly should so Fear the day of Judgment as it makes them afraid of Sins of Omission. The not dressing a wound brings death: the not discharging duty may bring d<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

Christ doth not say, Ye took away my meat from me, but, Ye gave me no meat; He saith not, Ye put me in prison, but, Ye visited me not. The sins of Omission condemned them. Not praying in the family, not sanctfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath, not giving Almes, will be the fatal Inditement.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Godly should so far Fear the day of Judgment, as it makes them afraid of dissembling in Religion. For at that day false hearts will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked. Why did <hi>Paul</hi> walk with such integrity? 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.10 <hi>Ye are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and God also, how holily, and just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and unblamably we behaved our

Such is the Witchcraft of Hypocrisie that it is hard in this life to know who is false, and who is sincere; but shortly there will be a full discovery. 'Tis good for Gods people so to Fear Judgment, as it makes them strive against prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Hypocrisie: for then the Hypocrite will be found out.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Fear of God makes a man Fear <hi>Hell.</hi> Hell is called <hi>the place of Torment,</hi> Luke 16.28.

                  </note> A Mariner fears a Storm, but not so as to throw away his Anchor. Such as Fear God should Fear Hell four wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:102654:45"/>1. They should fear Hell <hi>tanquam meritum,</hi> as that which they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. Their sins have merited Hell. Wo to the Holyest man alive if God should weigh him in the ballance of his Justice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They who Fear, God ought so far to Fear Hell, as it is a means to make them shake off Spiritual sloth. This disease is apt to seize upon Gods own people: the <hi>Wise Virgins Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,</hi> Mat. 25.5. Now so far as the fear of Hell is an alarum or Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell to awaken the Godly out of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and make them run faster to Heaven, so far it is a good and blessed Fear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Fear of Hell is so far Good in the Godly, as it makes them afraid of being in the number of those who shall go to Hell. There are certain Persons in danger of Hell. 1. Who have all their Heaven in this Life, <hi>Isa.</hi> 47.8. <hi>Thou that art given to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Epicures</hi> swim in sensual delights; they had rather displease God than deny the flesh: these shall take up their quarters in Hell; <hi>Isa.</hi> 22.12, 13. <hi>In that day did the Lord of Hosts call

to weeping, and behold joy and Gladness, eating Flesh, and drinking Wine: surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till you dye, saith the Lord.</hi> That is, this Sin shall not be done away by any Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are in danger to be cast into Hell who live in the Sin of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Prov. 22.14.</note>; they who burn in lust shall burn in Hell: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>The Lord knows how to reserve the unjust to be punished; <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, but chiefly them that walk after the flesh, in the lust of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness.</hi> See the corruption of mans nature! If God had made all <hi>common,</hi> he would have sought an enclosure; and now God hath made an <hi>enclosure,</hi> he endeavours to lay all common.

               <p n="3">3. They are like to go to Hell, who by giving bad Example cause others to Sin. Bad example like the Plague is catching. Great men are Glasses which the common people dress them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102654:46"/>
have not only their own sins, but the sins of others to answer for: and that doubtless was the reason why <hi>Dives</hi> intreated <hi>Abraham</hi> that one might <hi>go from the Dead</hi> to Preach to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.27.

               <p n="4">4. They are like to go to Hell who live and dye in the contempt of Gods Word.

But Sinners Hearts rend not; these are like to have the Wrath of God flame about their Ears, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.8. <hi>The Lord Iesus shall be

               <p n="5">5. They shall go to Hell, who fall away Finally, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.6. <hi>Because they had no root they withered.</hi> Flowers in a Waterpot will keep Green and fresh a while, but having no root wither. <hi>Demas</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> made a fair show a while, but ended as the Silkworm, which after all her Curious Spinning, at last becomes a Common fly. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. <hi>If we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more Sacrifice for sin.</hi> Thus we see who are like to be thrown into Hell: Now it is good for the Godly so to Fear Hell, as to fear to be in the number of those who shalt go to Hell.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Fear of Hell is so far good in the Godly, as it is a Fear mixed with Rejoycing, <hi>Psalm</hi> 2.11. <hi>Rejoyce with trembling.</hi> A Believers Fear of Hell must be like the Fear of the two <hi>Maries</hi> going from the Sepulcher, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.8. <hi>They departed from the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher with Fear and great Ioy:</hi> Fear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had seen an Angel; and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102654:47"/>
Joy, because Christ was risen. So must the Godly look on Hell, with Fear and Joy; Fear, because of the Fire; Joy, because Christ hath freed them from it. A man that stands upon an high rock, Fears when he looks down into the Sea, yet Rejoyceth that he is not there strugling with the Waves: So a Child of God when he looks down into Hell by Contemplation may fear because of the dreadfulness of the Torment; yet this Fear should be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Joy, to think he shall never come there. <hi>Iesus</hi> hath delivered him <hi>from Wrath to come</hi>

               <p n="6">6. The Fear of God will make a man Fear <hi>Heaven.</hi> You may say, that is strange, rather Hope for Heaven; nay, a Regenerate person is to Fear Heaven lest he fall short of it. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let us Fear lest a promise being lest us of entring into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it</hi>

They are called <hi>Virgins</hi> because they were not tainted with any gross Sin; yet these Virgin-Professors were shut out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10. <hi>Balaam</hi> a Prophet, <hi>Iudas</hi> an Apostle, both cashiered. We have seen some Ships have had glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious names given them, the <hi>Good-speed,</hi> the <hi>Hope,</hi> the <hi>Safe-guard,</hi> yet cast away at Sea.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is possible to come near to Heaven, yet fall short of it, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.34. <hi>Thou art not far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God</hi>; yet he was not near enough.

their Souls, to lose their Hopes! The Millions of Tears shed in Hell are not sufficient to bewail the loss of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Well may such as have Heaven in them Fear their coming short of it. Thus much for the Use of Trial.</p>

                  <hi>They spake often one to another.</hi> When the Wicked said, It is <hi>Vain to serve God,</hi> then they that feared the Lord <hi>spake often one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The meaning of this word, <hi>they spake often,</hi> is, they did discourse Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously together, their Tongues were Divinely tuned by the Holy Ghost.</p>

                  </note>Christians when they meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should use holy Conference. This is not only an <hi>advice,</hi> but a <hi>charge,</hi> Deu. 6.6. <hi>These words shall be in thy Heart, and thou shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy House, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou lyest down, and when thou risest up.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102654:49"/>
where there is <hi>Gratia infusa,</hi> it will be <hi>effusa</hi>; Grace changeth the Language, and makes it Spiritual. When the Holy Ghost came upon the Apostles, <hi>they spake with other Tongues,</hi> Act. 2.4. Grace makes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians speak with Other Tongues. A good Christian hath not only the Law of God in his <hi>Heart,</hi> Psalm 37.31. but in his <hi>Tongue,</hi> vers. 30. The body is the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. The Tongue is the Organ in this Temple, which sounds in Holy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The tongue of the Iust is as Choice Silver.</hi> He drops Silver sentences, enriching others with Knowledge, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.35. <hi>A Good man out of the Good treasure of his Heart bringeth forth good things.</hi> In his heart is a Treasure of Goodness, and this is not like a bag of Mony Sealed, but he brings something out of the Treasure within to the enriching of others. Grace is of the Nature of fire, which will not be pent up: like new Wine it will have Vent <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 4.20.</note>.

                  </note>Here I may draw up a bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment against five sorts of Persons. 1. Such as are silent in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They would be counted Good, but he must have good eyes that can see it, I know not whether it be Ignorance or Bashfulness that makes good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course waved. Many are so mute in Religion as if their Tongues did <hi>cleave to the roof of their Mouth:</hi> had they any love to God, or had they ever tasted how sweet the Lord is,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102654:50"/>
their mouth would <hi>talk of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> Psalm 71.24. Friends, what should we mind but Salvation? what are the things of this world? they are neither <hi>Entia</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 23.5</note>, nor <hi>Manentia</hi> 
                  <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.3.</note>. Do not we see men heap up Riches, and on a sudden, death as Gods Serjeant Arrests them? What should we talk of but the things <hi>Pertaining to the Kingdom of God</hi>? Let this cause blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among Christians, that their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are so unprofitable, they leave God out of their discourse. Why is there no good conference? Have you so much Knowledge that you need not have it encreased? Have you so much Faith that you need not have it Strengthened? Silence in Religion is a loud sin. We read of one who was possessed with a <hi>Dumb Devil,</hi> Mark 9.12. How many are <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> possessed with a Dumb Devil!</p>
               <p>It is a rebuke to such as when they meet together,<note place="margin">2 Branch.</note> instead of speaking of Heaven, they have idle frothy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <note n="*" place="margin">

Just like a Childs scribling, <hi>Psalm</hi> 12.2. <hi>They speak Vanity every one with his Neighbour.</hi> If Christ should ask some as he did the two Disciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> Luk. 24.17. <hi>What manner of Communications have you as you walk,</hi> they could not say as they did, <hi>concerning Jesus of Nazareth</hi>; no, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps about Toyes, or new Fashions.

                  </note>It reproves the Avaritious Person, who instead of speaking of Heaven, talks of nothing but the World: the Farmer speaks of his Plough and Yoak of Oxen, the Tradesman of his Wares and Drugs; but not a word of God. <hi>John</hi> 3.31. <hi>He that is of the Earth speaketh of the Earth.</hi> Many are like the Fish in the Gospel that <hi>had Money in it's Mouth,</hi> Mat. 12.27.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It reproves them who do indeed speak often to one another but in a bad sence. 1. They speak one to another in <hi>hasty</hi> words. Their words should be like the <hi>Waters of Shiloah that go softly,</hi> but too often they are fierce and Pungent. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Magnoque irarum flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuat aestu.</hi> Virgil.</note> Water when it is hot soon boils over; when the Heart is heated with anger it soon boils over in furious speeches, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.6. Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on transports. Many curse in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The Tongue is made in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of a Sword, and it cuts like a Sword: Angry words often prejudice him that utters them: <hi>Rehoboam</hi> with one churlish word lost ten tribes. A fiery Spirit is unsuitable to the Master we serve, the <hi>Prince of Peace</hi>; and to his <hi>Ambassage,</hi> the <hi>Gospel of Peace.</hi> Such whose tongues are set on fire, let them take heed they do not one day in Hell desire a <hi>drop of Water</hi> to Cool their Tongue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They speak one to another in a bad sence who Murmure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain one to another; they do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102654:52"/>
of their <hi>Sins,</hi> but their <hi>Wants.</hi> Murmuring proceeds from unbelief, <hi>Psalm</hi> 106.24. <hi>They believed not his word but murmured.</hi> When men distrust Gods Promises, they murmur at his Providences: this is a Sin God can hardly bear, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.27. <hi>How long shall I bear with this People that murmur against me? Israels</hi> speeches were Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous, and God punished them with Venomous Serpents, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They speak one to another in a bad sence, who vent themselves in filthy scurrilous Language. The Heart is a Vessel full of Wickedness, and the Tongue sets it a-broach. When the Face breaks out in Sores and Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, it shews the Blood is corrupt: when men break forth in unsavoury speeches it shews the Heart is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.35. <hi>Evil communication corrupteth good manners.</hi> We read that the Lips of the Leper were to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.45. It were happy if we had such Magistrates as would by their Authority cover the unclean Lips of these Lepers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They speak one to another in a bad sence, who instead of seasoning
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102654:52"/>
their words with Grace, mix them with Oaths. Swearers rend and tear Gods Name, and like mad Dogs fly in the face of Heaven, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.10. <hi>Because of swearing the Land mourns.</hi> Some think it the <hi>Grace of speech</hi> to interlard every sentence with an Oath; as if they would go to Hell Genteelly. But saith one, it is my Custom to Swear. Is this an <hi>excuse</hi> or an <hi>aggravation</hi> of the sin? If a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor should be arraigned for Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and he should say to the Judge spare me for it is my custom to rob on the High way, the Judge would say, thou shalt the rather dye. For every Oath that a man Swears, God puts a drop of Wrath into his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It reproves them who instead of speaking in an holy manner one to another, speak one of another; 1. <hi>In censuring,</hi> some make it a part of their Religion to Descant and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticize upon others. They do not imitate their graces but reflect upon their failings. God grant professors may wash their hands of this. Were peoples hearts more humble, their Tongues would
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102654:53"/>
be more charitable. 'Tis the sign of an Hypocrite to censure others and commend himself.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They speak one of another <hi>in slandering:</hi> Psalm 50.20. <hi>Thou sittest and slanderest thy own Mothers son.</hi> Slandering is when we speak to the prejudice of another, and speak that which is not true. Worth is blasted by slander. Holiness it self is no shield from this sin. The Lambs Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency will not preserve it from the Wolf. <hi>Iob</hi> calls slandering <hi>the scourge of the Tongue,</hi> Job 5.21. You may smite a man and never touch him. A slanderer wounds anothers fame, and no Physitian can heal these wounds<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Majora sunt linguae Vulnera quam gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii,</hi> Aug.</note>. The <hi>Eye</hi> and the <hi>Name</hi> are two ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things. God takes it ill at our hands to calumniate others, especially to asperse those who help to keep up the credit of Religion. <hi>Num.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Were not ye afraid to speak against my Servant Moses?</hi> what my Servant, who hath wrought so many Miracles, whom I have spoken with in the Mount Face to Face, were not ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to speak against him? The Greek word <hi>slanderer</hi> signifies <hi>Devil</hi>
                  <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.11.</note>. This
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102654:53"/>
is the Devils proper Sin, he is <hi>the accuser of the Brethren,</hi> Rev. 12.10. He doth not commit Adultery, but he <hi>bears false Witness.</hi> The slanderer may be indicted for <hi>Clipping,</hi> he clips his Neighbours credit to make it weigh lighter. This our nature is prone to; but remember, it is as well a sin in Gods account, to break the <hi>Ninth</hi> Commandment, as the <hi>Eighth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Put this Great duty in Practice,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Vse.</hi> Exhortation.</note> imitate these Holy ones in the Text, <hi>They spake often one to another. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> thinks they did speak something in defence of the Providence of God, they vindicated God in his dealings, and exhorted one another not to be discouraged at the Virulent speeches of the Wicked, but still hold on a course of Piety. Thus (Christians) when you meet, give one anothers Souls a visit, drop your Knowledge, impart your experiences each to other, <hi>Psalm</hi> 66.16. <hi>Sampson</hi> having found Hony did not only eat of it himself, but carried it to his Father and Mother, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14.9. Have you Tasted the Hony of the word? let others have a Tast with you. He who hath bin in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102654:54"/>
a Perfumers shop doth not only him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self partake of those sweet smells, but some of the perfume sticks to his cloaths, so that those who come near him partake of those perfumes: so having our selves perceived the sweet Savour of Christs Oyntments, we should let others partake with us, and by our Heavenly discourse, diffuse the perfume of Religion to them, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Let your words be seasoned with Salt:</hi> let Grace be the salt which seasons your Words and makes them Savoury. Christians should take all occasions of Good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course when they walk together, and sit at Table together. This makes their eating and drinking be <hi>to the Glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. What makes it a <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> but Good conference?</p>
               <p>But some may say they are barren of matter, and know not what to speak of?</p>
               <p>No, have you walked so often through the field of Scripture, yet ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered no ears of Corn? have not you matter enough in the Word to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you with discourse? Let me sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest a few things to you. When you
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102654:54"/>
meet speak one to another of the <hi>Promises.</hi> No Hony so sweet, as that which drops from a Promise. The promises are the support of Faith, the springs of joy, the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aints Royal Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Are you Citizens of Heaven, and not speak of your Charter? Speak of the preciousness of Christ: he is <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>; he hath laid down his blood as the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or price of your Redemption. Have you a friend that hath redeemed you, and never speak of him? Speak one to another of Sin, what a deadly evil it is, how it hath infected your Virgin-nature, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into a lesser Hell. Speak of the <hi>Beauty of Holiness,</hi> which is the Souls Embroidery, filling it with such Oriental splendor as makes God and Angels fall in love with it. The Graces are (as <hi>Damascen</hi> saith) the Sacred Characters and Impressions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>. Speak one to another of your Souls: enquire whether they are in health. Speak about Death and Eternity: can you belong to Heaven and not speak of your Country? Speak one to another of the <hi>Times,</hi> wherein God is the Greatest sufferer:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102654:55"/>
let your hearts bleed for his disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. Thus you see here is matter enough for Holy conference.</p>
               <p>Why then do you not set good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on Foot? I perswade my self one main reason of the decay of the Power of Godliness is want of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an conference: people when they meet talk of Impertinencies, but God and Heaven are left out of their discourse. That I may perswade you in your converses to put in a word about your Souls, let me offer these few things to your consideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was the practice of the Saints of old. <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> went on talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good discourse till the Chariot of Heaven came to part them, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Davids</hi> Tongue was Tuned to the <hi>Language of Canaan,</hi> Psalm 71.24. <hi>My Tongue shall talk of thy Righteousness.</hi> The Primitive Christians into what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever company they came, were speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Glorious Kingdom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, insomuch that some thought they were ambitious of worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; which made <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize for them, that the Kingdom they looked for was not of this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102654:55"/>
World, but a Kingdom with Christ in Heaven. <hi>Ierom</hi> saith of some of the Roman Ladies, They did spend much of their time in communing together, and they would not let him alone, for asking him Questions about their Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are bid to <hi>Redeem</hi> the Time, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.16. The Poets painted time with Wings, because it flies so fast‚Äî <hi>Volat ambiguis mobilis alis hora</hi>‚ÄîTime lost had need be redeemed; and is there any better way to redeem time, than to improve it in trading for Heaven, and speaking of God and our Souls?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Jesus Christ hath set us a Pattern: his words were perfumed with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.22. <hi>All bare him witness, and Wondred at the Gracious words which proceeded out of his Mouth.</hi> Christ had <hi>Grace poured into his Lips,</hi> Psalm 45.2. In all companies he set good discourse on foot. When he sate on <hi>Iacobs Well</hi> he falls into an Heavenly discourse with the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> about the Water of Life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.14. And so when <hi>Levi</hi> made him a Feast, <hi>Luke</hi> 5‚ÄîHe feasts him again with Heavenly discourse. And no sooner
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102654:56"/>
was Christ risen from the Grave, but he was <hi>speaking of the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 1.3. The more Spiritual we are in our speeches, the more we resemble Christ: should not the Members be like the Head? Christ will not be our Saviour, unless we make him our Pattern.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Good discourse would prevent sinful discourse. Much sin passeth in ordinary talk, as Gravel and Mud pass along with the Water. How many are Guilty of Tongue-sins! Good discourse would prevent evil, as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour prevents idleness. By inuring our Tongues to the Heavenly Dialect, the Devil would not have so much Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We may guess at mens Hearts by their common discourse. Words are the Looking-glass of the Mind<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Verba sunt speculum mentis.</hi> Bernard.</note>. As you may Judge of a Face by the glass whether it be fair or foul; So by the words we may Judge of the Heart. A lascivious Tongue shews a lustful heart, an earthly Tongue a covetous heart; a Gracious Tongue, a Gracious Heart. The <hi>Ephraimites</hi> were known by their <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> saying <hi>Sibboleth</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:102654:56"/>
for <hi>Shiboleth,</hi> Judg. 12.6. So by the manner of our speech we may be known who we belong to. The Tongue is the Index of the Heart. If you broach a Vessel that which is within will come out; by that which comes out of the Mouth, you may Guess what is within in the Heart, <hi>Luke</hi> 6 45. <hi>Out of the abundance of the Heart the mouth speaketh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Good discourse is beneficial, <hi>Iob</hi> 6.23. <hi>How forcible are rights words</hi>? A word spoken in season may make such a powerful impression upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Heart as may do him Good all his Life. One single coal is apt to dye, but many coals put together keep in the heat. Christians by their Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talk do <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, blow up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Grace into a flame. <hi>Monica Austins</hi> Mother, hearing others dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Heaven, was greatly affected and cryed out, What do I do here? Why is my Soul held any longer with this Earthen fetter of my Flesh? When the Daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed a while with the Spouse, and had heard her describe Christs admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable beauty, their Affections began
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102654:57"/>
to be enflamed, and they would seek him with her, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Whither is thy beloved gone O thou fairest among wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that we may seek him with thee?</hi> A Christian by divine discourse may enlighten another when he is ignorant, warm him when he is Frozen, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him when he is sad, confirm him when he is wavering. <hi>Latimer</hi> was much strengthened by discourse with Mr <hi>Bilny</hi> in Prison, and hearing his confession of Faith <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Mon.</hi>
                  </note>. A good life <hi>adorns</hi> Religion, a good Tongue <hi>Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates</hi> it. When the Apostle would have us edifie one another, what better way could he prescribe than this, to have such Holy speeches proceed out of our Mouths as might <hi>Minister Grace unto the hearers</hi>? Eph. 4.29.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We must be accountable to God for our speeches. Words are judged light, but theyweigh heavy in Gods Balance; by our words we shall be either saved or damned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.37. <hi>For by thy words thou shalt be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and by thy words thou shalt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> If our words have been sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with Grace, then the acquitting sentence is like to go on our side.</p>

When our Tongues are out of tune in murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, then they are not our Glory; but when these Organs sound in Holy discourse, then our Tongues are our Glory.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Good discourse will be a means to bring Christ into our company. While the two Disciples were confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about the death and Sufferings of Christ, Jesus Christ himself came among them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.15. <hi>While they communed together, Iesus himself drew near, and went with them.</hi> When bad discourse is set on Foot, Satan draws near, and makes one of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but when Good discourse is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, Jesus Christ draws near.</p>
               <p>Let all that hath bin said excite good conference: certainly, there is no better way than <hi>this</hi> to <hi>encrease</hi> our Stock of Grace. Others by spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grow Poor; but the more we spend our selves in Holy discourse, the richer we Grow in Grace, as the <hi>Widows Oyl</hi> by Pouring out encreased.</p>

               <p>IF it be asked how may Good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be arrived at? 1. If you would be discursive in Religion, get your minds well furnished with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Hereby, you will have a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to fetch from, <hi>Iob</hi> 38.18. I <hi>am</hi> (saith <hi>Elihu) full of matter.</hi> Some are backward to speak of Good for want of matter: the empty Vessel cannot run. If you would have your Tongues run fluently in Religion, they must be fed with a spring of knowledge, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly.</hi> In one of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that Christ wrought, he first caused the Water-pots to be filled with Water, and then saith he, <hi>Draw out now,</hi> John 2.8. So we must first have our Heads filled with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and then we shall be able to draw out to others in Good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:102654:58"/>2. If you would discourse readily in the things of God, make Religion your delight. What men delight in, they will be speaking of: the <hi>sensualist</hi> speaks of his sports; the worldling of his rich purchase. Delight makes the Tongue as the <hi>Pen of a ready writer.</hi> The Spouse being delighted and inamoured with Christs beauty, could not conceal her self; she makes an elegant and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical Oration in the commendation of Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. <hi>My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.</hi>

Perhaps you pray that you may Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ, but do you pray that you may Confess him, and not be ashamed to speak of him before others? <hi>Psalm</hi> 119.46. <hi>I will speak of thy Testimonies before Kings, and not be ashamed.</hi> To end this, let me briefly insert two Cautions.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. Swasives and Incentives to Holy Thoughts.</head>
               <p>LET me, to inforce the Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, propound some Swasives and Inducements to be frequent in the Thoughts of God. 1. The end why
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102654:65"/>
God hath given us this thinking facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, that we may think on his Name. When our Cogitations run out in Impertinencies (like water running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Mill) we should think with our selves thus: did God give us a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to misimploy? did he give us Thoughts that we should think of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing but him? were these Arrows given us to shoot beside the Mark?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we do not inure our selves to Good thoughts, we cannot be Good Christians. Thinking seriously on Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, makes them stay in our Mind, causeth delight in them, and makes them Nutritive. Musing on Holy Objects is like concocting food, which turns it to Blood and Spirits: so that without Holy Cogitation, no Religion. Can a man be Religious and scarce ever think of it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are deeply obliged to think on God. 1. God is our maker, <hi>Psalm</hi> 100.3. <hi>It is he that hath made us, and not we our selves.</hi> Our bodies are Gods curious needle work, <hi>Psalm</hi> 139.15. And as God hath wrought the Cabinet, so he hath put a Jewel in it, the <hi>Precious</hi> Soul. Hath God made us,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102654:66"/>
and shall not we think of him? 2. God hath sweetned our Lives with Various Mercies. The city of <hi>Syracuse</hi> in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> was so curiously scituated, that the Sun was never out of sight: God hath so placed us by his Providence, that the Sun-shine of Mercy is never out of sight. We are Bemiracled with Mercy; Mercy feeds us with the <hi>Finest of the wheat,</hi> the Bread of Life; Mercy guards us with a Guard of Angels; it makes the <hi>Rock</hi> pour forth <hi>Rivers of Oyl</hi>: and shall not the Stream lead us to the Fountain? shall not we think of the God of our Mercies? this were high Ingratitude.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To have frequent and Devout Thoughts of God witnesseth Sincerity. No truer Touchstone of Sanctity, than the Spirituality of the Thoughts: that a man is, that his Thoughts are, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.7. <hi>For as he thinketh in his Heart so is he.</hi> Thoughts are freer from Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie than words: one may speak well for applause, or to stand right in the Opinion of others; but when we are alone and <hi>think of Gods Name,</hi> and admire his Excellencies, this shews the Heart to be Right. Thoughts are freer
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102654:66"/>
from Hypocrisie than an Unblamable Life. A man may in his outward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be fair, yet have a Covetous, Revengeful mind. The Acts of Sin may be forborn, when the Heart sits brooding upon Sin; but to have the Thoughts Spiritualized and set upon God, is a truer Symptom of sincerity, than a Life free from Vice. Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, what do your Thoughts run upon? where do they make their most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Visits? can you say, Lord, our Hearts are still Mounting up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, our Thoughts are lodg'd in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; though we do not see thy face, yet we <hi>think on thy Name?</hi> this is a good Evidence of Sincerity. We Judge of men by their <hi>Actions;</hi> God Judgeth of them by their <hi>Thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Thinking much on God would Cure the Love of the World. Great things seem little to him that stands high. To such as stand upon the top of the <hi>Alps</hi> the great Cities of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania</hi> seem little Villages: they who are Mounted High in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ and Glory, how do the things of the World disappear, and even shrink into nothing! A Soul ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102654:67"/>
by faith above the Visible Orbs, hath the <hi>Moon under his feet.</hi> A true Saint intermedles with Secular Affairs more out of <hi>Necessity</hi> than <hi>Choice.</hi> St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Thoughts were sublime, he lived in the Altitudes, and how did he scorn the World <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Quae cit√≤ aspecta pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta displi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca.</note>! <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>The world is crucified to me</hi> *.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thinking on God would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive of Sin. Whence is Impiety but from Incogitancy? Did men Ruminate upon Gods Holiness and Justice, durst they sin at that rate as they do? That which check'd <hi>Ioseph,</hi> was the Thoughts of a Sin-revenging God. When the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of sin Tickle, let the Thoughts of God come into mens Minds, that he is both the <hi>Spectatour</hi> and the <hi>Iudge,</hi> and after the <hi>Golden Crowns</hi> and <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Hair</hi> come the <hi>Lions Teeth,</hi> Rev. 9.8. This would put them into a cold Sweat, and be as the Angels <hi>drawn Sword</hi>
                  <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Num. 22.31.</note>, it would scare them from sin.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thinking on God is an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to encrease our love to God. As it was with <hi>Davids</hi> musing on Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, <hi>Psam</hi> 39.3. <hi>As I was Musing the fire burned</hi>; so it is with our Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102654:67"/>
on the Deity: while we are think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God, our Hearts will kindle in love to him. The Reason our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are so chill and cold in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, because we do not warm them with the Thoughts of God. Hold a Burning-glass to the Sun, and the glass burns that which is near to it: So when our Thoughts are lifted up to Christ the Sun of Righteousness, our Affections are set on fire. No soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had the Spouse been thinking on her Saviours Beauty, but she fell <hi>sick of love,</hi> Cant. 5.8. O ye Saints, do but let your Cogitations dwell upon the Love of Christ, who did pass by Angels and think of you; who was wounded, that out of his wounds the <hi>Balm of Gilead</hi> might come to heal you; who leaped into the Sea of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath, to save you from drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: think of this unparallel'd love which sets the Angels a Wondring, and see if it will not affect your Hearts and cause Tears of love to slow forth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thinking on God will by degrees transform us into his Image. As <hi>Jacobs</hi> Flock looking on the Rods that had <hi>White streaks</hi> conceived and <hi>brought forth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102654:68"/>
like them,</hi> Gen. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>, 39. So by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating Gods Holiness, we are in some measure changed into his likeness. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Beholding as in a Glass the Glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same Image.</hi> The contemplative sight of God was <hi>transforming:</hi> they had some Print of Gods Holiness upon them; as <hi>Moses</hi> when he had been on the Mount with God, his face shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.35. What is Godliness but God-likeness? and who are so like him as they that think on his Name?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thinking on God is sweet, it Ushers in a secret delight into the Soul <hi>Psalm</hi> 104.34. <hi>My meditation of him shall be sweet.</hi> He whose Head is got above the Clouds, his Thoughts are sled aloft, and he hath God in his eye, is full of divine Raptures, and cries out as <hi>Peter</hi> in the transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Lord, it is good to be here.</hi> Holy Thoughts are the Dove we send out of the <hi>Ark</hi> of our Souls, and they bring an Olive branch of Peace. Some complain they have no Joy of their lives; and truly no wonder, when they are such strangers to Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102654:68"/>
Would you have God give you Comfort, and never think of him? Indeed <hi>Israel</hi> had Manna drop'd into their Tents, and they never Thought of it; but God will not drop down this Manna of Heavenly Joy on that Soul which seldom or never thinks of him. Would you have your Spirits chearful? let your Thoughts be celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The higher the Lark flies, the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it sings: The higher a Soul ascends in the Thoughts of God, the sweeter Joy it hath.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Thoughts of God will turn to the best account. Thoughts spent on the World are often in Vain. Some spend Thoughts about laying up a Portion for such a Child; and perhaps, either it dies, or lives to be a Cross. Others beat their Brains how to rise at Court; and when Royal Favour hath shined upon them, on a sudden an Eclipse falls out, and the Kings smile is turn'd into a frown, and then their Thoughts are frustrated‚Äî<hi>Et stultus labor est ineptiarum</hi>‚Äî <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Martial.</hi>
                  </note>. How oft do men build Castles in the Air? But the Thoughts of God will turn to a good account, they Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102654:69"/>
Sanctification, and bring Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <hi>Psalm</hi> 63.5. <hi>My Soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, when I remember thee on my bed, and meditate on thee,</hi> &amp;c. The Thoughts we have of God in the time of health, will be a Comfort to us in the time of sickness.</p>
               <p n="11">11. God thinks of us, and shall not we think of him? <hi>Psalm</hi> 40.17. <hi>The Lord thinketh upon me.</hi> God thinks on us every Morning, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.23. <hi>His Mercies are new every Morning.</hi> He gives us Night-Mercies, he Rocks us every Night asleep, <hi>Psalm</hi> 127.2. <hi>So he giveth his beloved Sleep:</hi> and if we chance to wake he gives us <hi>Songs in the Night,</hi> Job 35.10. If God be thinking of us Day and Night, shall not we think of his Name? How can we forget a freind who is ever mindful of us? <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11. <hi>I know the Thoughts that I think towards you (saith the Lord) Thoughts of Peace.</hi> Though God be out of our sight, we are not out of his Thoughts.</p>
               <p n="12">12. God will one Day reckon with us for our Thoughts. He will say I gave you a <hi>Cogitative faculty,</hi> what have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102654:69"/>
you done with it? If God asks a Covetous man, what have been your Sentiments? which way have your Thoughts run? he will Answer, to heap up Riches: if God asks Princes and Emperors, how have you employ'd your Thoughts? they will say, how by our Scepter to beat down the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godliness. What a dreadful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will these Persons have to give at last! Not only mens <hi>Actions,</hi> but their <hi>Thoughts</hi> will accuse them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Our Thoughts of God shall not be lost. God accepts of the Thought for the deed. <hi>David</hi> had a good Thought come into his Mind to build God an House, and God took it as kindly as if he had done it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Forasmuch as it was in thy Heart to build an house to my Name, thou didst well that it was in thy Heart.</hi> When Christians have Thoughts of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gods Glory, they would do such good Acts if it were in their Power, build Hospitals, distribute Justice, cut off offenders from the <hi>City of God,</hi> the Lord looks upon it as if they had done it: so that our Thoughts of God are not lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:102654:70"/>
                  <note place="margin">2 Branch.</note>Let us think of God in a Right manner. A Good Medicine may be spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the making: so may a Good Duty be spoiled in the doing. Thoughts may be Good for the matter of them, yet may be Faulty in the manner.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. How Thoughts of God may fail in the Manner. 1. A man may Think of God, yet not intend his glory. <hi>Jehu</hi> had good Thoughts came into his Mind, to destroy the Baal-worshippers, but his intent was to advance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the Throne. Bad aims Fly-blow good Actions. 2. A man may have Good Thoughts but they are forced,‚Äî<hi>Virtus nolentium nulla est</hi>‚Äî When one bleeds under Gods afflicting hand, he may Think of God, yet have no love to him, <hi>Psalm</hi> 78.34. <hi>When he slew them, then they remembred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer: nevertheless they did flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102654:70"/>
him with their Mouth.</hi> These were good Thoughts, but it was to complement with God, and to get rid of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. 3. A man may have Thoughts of God out of design to stop the Mouth of Conscience. Conscience doth lash the profane Sinner; what art thou so Wicked as never to Think of God, who indulgeth thee with so many favours? Hereupon he may have a few good Thoughts; but they are irksome to him: this is not from a Principle of Conscience, but to quiet Conscience. 4. A man may think of God with Horrour: he thinks of Gods Soveraignty, and dreads the Thoughts of God. You see one may think of God, yet these Thoughts may become sinful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I shall shew you the Right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Thinking upon God: 1. Our Thoughts of God must be Serious. Feathers swim on the top, but Gold sinks into the Water: Feathery Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have some floting Thoughts; but good Hearts sink deep in the Thoughts of a Deity. 2. Our Thoughts of God must be Spiritual. Take heed of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming any gross conceits of God in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102654:71"/>
our Minds, representing him by the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Creature, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Ye<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> saw no Similitude.</hi> Conceive of God in Christ: we cannot see him any other way, as we cannot see the Sun in the Circle but in the Beams, the God-head dwells in Christs Humane nature, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. Think of God as a Spirit full of immense Glory, propitious to us through a Mediatour. 3. Our Thoughts of God must be Delightful. With what Delight doth a Child think of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! A gracious Soul counts them the Sweetest hours which are spent with God. 4. Our Thoughts of God must be Vertual and Efficacious, leaving our Hearts in a a better Tune: The Thoughts of Gods faithfulness must make us confide in him, the Thoughts of Gods Holiness must make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to him. This is the Right think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God when it is influential, it leaves us in a more Heavenly frame.</p>

               <p n="2">2. If you would think of God take heed of hindrances. 1. Turn away your eyes from beholding <hi>Vanity, Psal.</hi> 119.37. Vain Objects Poyson the Imagination, lascivious Pictures, and wanton talk leave bad impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102654:72"/>

               <p n="3">3. Get a love to God and his wayes. One cannot but think of that which he loves, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.32. <hi>Can a Maid forget her Ornaments?</hi> when she hath not her Jewel on her Ear, she will have it in her Thoughts.

               <p n="4">4. If you would think often on God, get an interest in him, <hi>Psalm</hi> 48.14. <hi>This God is our God.</hi> We think most upon that which is our own. If a man ride by brave Houses and Gardens, he casts his Eye slightly upon them, and doth not much Mind them; but let him have an house of his own, and his Thoughts dwell in it. Why do

                  <hi>after the manner of men.</hi> Not that God hath any book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords by him, he needs not write down any thing for the help of his Memory, he is not Subject to oblivion.

               <p n="1">1. The Lord writes down the <hi>Names</hi> of his Saints, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Whose Names are in the Book of Life.</hi> This Book hath no <hi>Errata's,</hi> Rev. 3.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord writes down the good <hi>speeches</hi> of his People. When Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians speak together of the Mysteries of Heaven (which is like Musick in consort) God is much taken with it: When their Tongues are going, Gods pen is going in Heaven. They that <hi>fear'd the Lord spake often one to another,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102654:78"/>
and a Book of Remembrance was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord writes down the <hi>Tears</hi> of his People. Tears drop down to the Earth, but they reach Heaven <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deorsum cadunt, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum volant.</hi>
                  </note>: God hath his <hi>Bottle</hi> and his <hi>Book,</hi> Psalm 56.8. <hi>Put thou my Tears into thy bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, are they not in thy Book?</hi> Tears drop from the Saints, as Water from the Roses: they are fragrant to God, and he puts them in his <hi>Bottle.</hi> And besides this, he hath his <hi>Book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi> where he sets them down; <hi>are they not in thy Book</hi>? Especially God writes down such Tears as are shed for the sins of the times, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.2. <hi>One was clothed with linnen; with a writers Inkhorn by his side:</hi> this was to write down the Tears of the Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to set a <hi>mark upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads of them that sighed for the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations done in the midst of the City,</hi> ver. 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God writes down the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of his People. We can write down mens <hi>Words,</hi> but we cannot write down their <hi>Thoughts.</hi> It would pose the Angels to write mens Thoughts: but be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, never an Holy cogitation comes
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102654:79"/>
into our Mind, but God writes it down. So in the Text, a <hi>Book</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance was written for them that <hi>Thought upon his Name.</hi> Two things are silent, yet have a Voice, <hi>Tears</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 6.8.</note>, and <hi>Thoughts</hi>

               <p n="5">5. God writes down the <hi>desires</hi> of his People, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 38 9. <hi>All my desire is before thee:</hi> That is, it is set down in thy book. Desire is the Spiritual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, or the Souls Anhelation and breathing after God, <hi>Psalm</hi> 84.2. In this Life we do rather <hi>desire</hi> God than <hi>enjoy</hi> him. Can we say we take our Souls <hi>√® Corporis Pharetra</hi> out of the quiver of our Bodies, and shoot them into Heaven? do our Affections sally forth towards Christ? do we desire him superlatively and uncessantly? Every such desire is put down in Gods Register Book: <hi>all my desire is before thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Lord writes down the <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of his People, <hi>Ionah</hi> 2.7. Prayer, though it be not <hi>Vocal,</hi> only <hi>Mental,</hi> is Recorded, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Hannah spake in her Heart.</hi> That prayer God did write down and Answer; God was better to her than her prayer;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102654:79"/>
she prayed for a Son, and God gave her a Prophet. When the heart is so full of grief, that it can only groan in Prayer; yet a Groan is sometimes the best part of a Prayer, and God writes it down, <hi>Psalm</hi> 38.9. <hi>Lord, my Groaning is not hid from thee.</hi> If we cannot speak with elegancy in Prayer, if it be only lisping and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, God puts it in his Book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38.14. <hi>Like a Crane, so did I chatter:</hi> yet that prayer was heard and registred, <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. <hi>I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy Tears.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. God writes down the <hi>Alms</hi> of his People. Works of Mercy must be done out of <hi>Love</hi> to God: as <hi>Mary</hi> out of love brought her Ointments and sweet Spices and anointed Christs dead body: so out of pure love we must bring our Ointments of Charity to anoint the Saints, which are Christs living body, Such Alms are not lost <note n="*" place="margin">

God hath a Book of Records to write down his Peoples injuries. The wicked make wounds in the backs of the Righteous, and then pour in Vinegar: God writes down their Cruelty. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.2. <hi>I Remember what Amalek did to Israel.

               <p n="1">1. Let us be earnest suitors to him, exercise Eyes of Faith, and Knees of prayer. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.9.

               <head>CHAP. XVII. The first Part of the Saints reward, Gods owning them.</head>
               <p n="2">2. I Come now to the <hi>reward</hi> it self, the first part whereof is Gods <hi>owning</hi> them, <hi>they shall be mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Expositors here vary: I take the sence of it to be, <hi>they shall be mine in Covenant,</hi> Ezek. 16.8. <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, and thou becamest mine</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 43.1.</note>. This is no small favour to be in Covenant with God: therefore when God told <hi>Abraham</hi> that he would enter into Covenant with him, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham fell on his face</hi>; Gen. 17.2. as being amazed that the great God should bestow such a signal favour upon him. God never entred into Covenant with the Angels when they fell, but he proclaims himself God in Covenant with Believers, <hi>they shall be mine.</hi> This Covenant enriched with Free-grace, is a better Covenant than that which was
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102654:90"/>
made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The least failing would have made the first Covenant null and void: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny failings do not invalidate the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. I grant the least sin makes a <hi>trespass</hi> upon the Covenant; but doth not rescind it. Every failing in the Conjugal Relation breaks not the Marriage bond.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The first Covenant being viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, allowed the sinner no remedy; all doors of hope were shut: but the new Covenant allows of a Remedy: it provides a surety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. <hi>Jesus the Mediator of the new Covenant.</hi>
               </p>

That ye may see how great
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102654:90"/>
a priviledge this is to be owned by the Lord federally, that he should be our God, and we his people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we are in Covenant with God and he saith to us <hi>Ye are mine,</hi> then all that is in God is ours. A person falling to decay marrying to a King, hath an interest in all the Crown-reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues: God having entred into a near Relation with us, and saying <hi>ye are mine,</hi> we have a share in his Rich revenues. The Lord saith to every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever as the King of <hi>Israel</hi> said to the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> 1 Kin. 20.4. <hi>I am thine and all that I have:</hi> My Wisdom shall be thine to teach thee, my Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall be thine to Sanctifie thee, my Mercy shall be thine to save thee. What richer dowry than Deity? God is a whole Ocean of blessedness. If there is enough in him to fill the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, then sure he hath enough to fill us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God saith to us <hi>ye are mine,</hi> then he will have a tender care of us. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>He careth for you</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">

wings,</hi> Exod. 19.4. The Eagle carries her young ones upon her wing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them; the Arrow must first shoot through the Old Eagle, before it can touch her Young ones. A Mothers care is seen in leading the Child that it may not fall: such is Gods care. <hi>Hos.</hi> 11.3. I <hi>taught Ephraim to go, leading them by their Arms.</hi> We may argue <hi>a minori ad majus,</hi> if God take care of the meanest Infects and Animals that creep upon the earth, much more will he take care of his Covenant-Saints. He is still consulting and projecting for their good; if they wander out of the way, he guides them; if they stumble, he holds them by the hand; if they fall, he raiseth them; if they be dull, he quickens them by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; if they be froward, he draws them with cords of Love; if they be sad, he Comforts them with his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God saith to us, <hi>ye are mine,</hi> then he will intirely love us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. I <hi>have loved thee with an Everlasting love.</hi> The Lord may give a man riches and not love him: his prosperity may be as <hi>Israels Quails</hi> sawced with Gods wrath. <hi>Num.</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:102654:91"/>
11.32, 33. But when God saith, <hi>ye are mine,</hi> he cannot but love; every one loves his own. If God hath any love better than other, his Covenant-People shall have it; he will distil the Spirits of his love for them, he loves them as he loves Christ, <hi>John</hi> 17.24.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If God saith to us <hi>ye are mine,</hi> then he will not suffer us to want. Believers are not only of Gods fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of Christs body; and will the head let the body starve? <hi>Psalm</hi> 37.3. <hi>Verily thou shalt be fed.</hi> God hath not promised <hi>dainties</hi>; he will not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Peoples lusts, but he will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their wants; if the Bill of Fare grows low, what they lack in <hi>chear,</hi> they shall have in <hi>blessing,</hi> Exod. 23.25. <hi>He will bless thy bread and thy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> God will rather work a miracle, than any of his Children shall famish. The Raven that is so unnatural she will hardly feed her young, yet did turn Caterer and brought food to the Prophet <hi>Elijah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If God saith to us, <hi>ye are mine,</hi> then we have great immunites: 1. We are freed from the revenging wrath of God. We are not free from Gods
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102654:92"/>
anger as a <hi>Father,</hi> but as a <hi>Iudge.</hi> God will not pour his vindictive Justice upon us. Christ hath drunk the Red wine of Gods wrath upon the Cross, that Believers may not tast a drop of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are freed from the Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin shall not have dominion,</hi> or as the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, it shall not Lord it over you. Though Believers are not freed from the In-being of sin, nor from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with it, yet they are freed from its Imperious command. As it is said of those beasts in <hi>Daniel,</hi> they had their <hi>Dominion</hi> taken away, yet <hi>their Lives were prolonged for a season,</hi> Dan. 7.12. So sin Lives in the Regenerate, but <hi>its Dominion is taken away.</hi> And to be thus freed from the jurisdictive power and tyranny of sin is no small blessing. A Wicked man is at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of sin, as the Asse is at the command of the driver: the curse of <hi>Cham</hi> is upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.25. <hi>A Servant of Servants shall he be.</hi> He is a slave to his Lusts, and a slave to Satan. O what a priviledge is it to have ones neck out of the Devils Yoak!</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:102654:92"/>3. We are freed from the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Conscience. The worm of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is part of the Torment of Hell <note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tandem flagitia in supplicia Vertuntur,</hi> Tacitus.</note>. But God being our God we are freed from the Clamors of this hellish Fury: Conscience sprinkled with Christs blood speaks Peace; a good Conscience like the <hi>Bee</hi> gives Hony; it is like the <hi>Golden pot</hi> which had Manna in it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If God saith to us <hi>ye are mine,</hi> we shall be his for ever, <hi>Psalm</hi> 48.14. <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever.</hi> You cannot say you have health and you shall have it for ever, you have a Child and you shall have it for ever; but if God be your God, you shall have him for ever.

                  </note>. The interest between God and his people shall never be broken off; How false therefore is the Opinion of falling from Grace!

               <p n="7">7. If God saith to us <hi>ye are mine,</hi> he will take us up to himself at death. Death breaks the union between the Body and the Soul, but perfects the union between God and the Soul. This is the Emphasis of Heavens Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to be with God. What is the Joy of the blessed, but to have a clear transparent sight of God, and to be in the sweet and soft embraces of his love for ever? This hath made the Saints desire death, as the Bride the wedding day, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. Lead me, Lord, to that glory (said an Holy man) a glimpse whereof I have seen as in a glass darkly.</p>

               <p n="2">2. It is Comfort in respect of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty? Believers are match'd into the Crown of Heaven, and all that is in God is theirs.

In this life our love to God is luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, and sometimes Frozen; a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever weeps that he can love God no more: but at the day of death when God makes up his Jewels, then the Saints love shall be Seraphical: the spark of Love shall be blown up into into a pure flame: the Saints shall love God <hi>secundum actum</hi> (as the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> speak) as much as they are able: they shall love him superlative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and indeficiently, they shall be made up of love.

               <p n="2">2. God makes up his Jewels at the day of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> then he makes the Saints <hi>bodyes</hi> perfect: these like sparkling Diamonds shall shine in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102654:104"/>
and is made more illustrious; so God in making up his Jewels will cause a greater resplendency in the Saints bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies than before. When God makes up the Jewels of the Saints Bodies at the Resurrection, they shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect four wayes.</p>

               <p n="2">2. When God at the Resurrection makes up the Jewels of the Saints bodies, they shall have Perfection of parts.

All the Affections of Parents come from God: they are but a drop of his Ocean, a spark of his flame; Gods love is a love that <hi>passeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> Ephes. 3.19. The Saints can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Love their own Souls so intirely as God loves them. In particular,</p>
               <p n="1">1. God loves the <hi>persons</hi> of his Children: they are <hi>the Apple of his Eye,</hi> Zach. 2.8. He <hi>engraves them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Palms of his hands,</hi> Isa. 49.16. It alludes to them who carry about them graven on the Stone of their

               <p n="2">2.

This and that <hi>Believer.</hi> God loves the very ground his Children go upon. Why was <hi>Iudaea</hi> (the Ancient seat of <hi>Israel</hi>) called <hi>a delightsome Land?</hi> Mal. 5.12. Not so much delightful for the fruit growing in it, as for the Saints living in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God so loves his Children that he chargeth the great ones of the World upon pain of death <hi>not to hurt</hi> them: their persons are sacred, <hi>Psalm</hi> 105.14. <hi>He reproved Kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not mine anointed.</hi> By <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> are meant such as have the <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit,</hi> 1 John 2.20.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God delights in his Childrens <hi>company,</hi> he loves to see their faces, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Let me see thy Countenance.</hi> If but two or three of Gods Children meet and pray together, God will be sure to make one of the company; <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. <hi>There am I in the midst of them.</hi>

                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:102654:107"/>5. God so loves his Children, that his <hi>Eye</hi> is never off them; <hi>Psalm</hi> 33.18. <hi>The Eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him.</hi> But is this such a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, to have Gods Eye upon his Children?

                  </gap>, an Eye of Revenge; but his Eye upon his Children is an Eye of Benediction.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God sets a <hi>continual guard</hi> about his Children, to preserve them from danger. He hides them in his <hi>Pavilion, Psalm</hi> 27.5. He covers them with the Golden Feathers of his Protection, <hi>Psalm</hi> 91.4. God preserved <hi>Athanasius</hi> strangely, he put it into his Mind to depart out of the House he was in, the night before the Enemies came to search for him. No Prince goes so well guarded as Gods Child, for he hath a guard of Angels about him.

               <p n="7">7. God puts his Children in <hi>rich ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel:</hi> Psalm. 45.13. <hi>Her cloathing is of wrought Gold. Jacob</hi> loved his Son <hi>Joseph,</hi> and gave him a finer Coat to wear than the rest of his brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.3. <hi>He made him a Coat of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Colours.</hi> God loves his Children and gives them a finer Coat, more curiously Woven, a Coat of <hi>divers Colours:</hi> it is partly made of Christs Righteousness, and partly made of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Holiness <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 19.8.</note>.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Such is Gods love, that he thinks nothing too Good for his Children, he enricheth them with the <hi>upper</hi> and <hi>nether</hi> Springs; he gives them the <hi>Kidneys of the Wheat,</hi> and Hony out of the Rock; he makes them a feast of <hi>fat things,</hi> Isa. 25.6. He gives them the body and blood of his Son, and delights to see his Children spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves as Olive plants round about his Table <note n="*" place="margin">Psalm 128.3.</note>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as are Fearers of God, he will receive their <hi>Petitions</hi> from them as a Father doth from his Son; they

Three things may cause boldness in prayer; the Saints have a Father to pray to, and the Spirit to help them to pray, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ as their Advocate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their Prayers.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="5">5. Such as are Fearers of God, God will <hi>pass by many</hi> infirmities. That is meant by this expression in the Text, <hi>I will spare them as a man spareth his own Son.</hi> What a wonder is this, that God did not spare the Angels! 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>

                  </note>This may inform all wicked men, that (how Blind soever they are now, yet) at last the Vail shall be taken from their Eyes: They now count themselves the only happy men, and look upon the People of God with Derision, they load them with Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, and Curse them with their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102654:114"/>
Well, the time is not far off, when the Wicked shall clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discern who belong to Christ, and who belong to the Devil; as <hi>Moses</hi> said to <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.5. <hi>To morrow the Lord will shew who are his:</hi> So at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Lord will shew who are his, and who are not; nay, sooner than so; at the day of <hi>Death</hi> the Wicked shall guess how it is like to be with them to Eternity.</p>
               <p>O that the Eyes of Sinners may be speedily opened, that they may in time see the difference of things, the Beauty that is in Holiness, and the Prodigy of madness that is in Sin.</p>
               <p>Consolation to the Righteous. Though at present they are slighted,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Vse.</hi>
                  </note> and have the Odium of the World cast upon them, yet shortly God will make a <hi>Visible</hi> difference between them and the Wicked; as it was with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> two Officers, the Butler and the Baker; at first there seemed to be no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, but within a while there was a difference made; the chief Butler was advanced to Honour, but the chief Baker was Executed,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102654:115"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.21. So though now Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are low and despised, and the Wicked Insult over them, yet when the <hi>Critical-day</hi> comes, there shall be a final Separation made between the Righteous and the Wicked: the one shall be Dignified, the other Damned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.46.</p>
               <p>Be encouraged therefore, O ye Saints of God, to persist in a course of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; though now ye seem to be lower-most, yet in the Resurrection ye shall be uppermost, <hi>Psalm</hi> 49.14. <hi>The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous shall have Dominion over them in the Morning</hi>; They shall have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the Wicked in the Morning of the Resurrection. They shall then <hi>Laugh the Wicked to Scorn,</hi> Psalm 52.6. Then shall the difference be seen <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Righteous and the Wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him that Served God and him that Served him not.</hi>

As Gods not afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wicked is in anger: Gods hand is Heaviest when it is lightest, <hi>Hosea</hi> 4.14. <hi>I will not punish your daughters when they commit Whoredom:</hi> A Father gives over correcting a Child whom he intends to disinherit: so Gods

chastizing the Godly is in Love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>As many as I Love I rebuke</hi>; when God hath the Look of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he hath the Heart of a Father. As when <hi>Abraham</hi> lift up his hand to Sacrifice <hi>Isaac,</hi> he loved him; so when God Sacrificeth the Comforts of his Children, he loves them. Was not God severe against Christ: yet it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by a Voice from Heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi> Mat. 3.17. Well then, if God only send love-to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to us, he deals well with us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God deals well with his People when he afflicts them, because he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates his stroke, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.11.<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 46.28.</note> 
                  <hi>I will correct thee in Measure.</hi> 1. God doth not smite his Children so much as he might, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.38. <hi>He did not stir up all his Wrath:</hi> God doth not make the Cup so bitter as he could. He useth <hi>Lenitives</hi> rather than<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 
                  <hi>Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sives:</hi> he layes a lighter burden on, he might lay on an heavier. Doth God take away a Child? he might take away his Spirit; Doth he chastize the Body? he might torment the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God doth not correct his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102654:119"/>
so much as they have deserved, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13. <hi>Thou hast punished us less than our Iniquities deserve.</hi> Doth God make us drink in a Cup of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood? we have deserved to drink in a Cup of Wrath: doth God cut us short? we have deserved he should cut us off, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.3. <hi>The Waters were to the Ankles.</hi> Do the Waters of Affliction come up to our Ankles? we have deserved to be drowned in these Waters.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When God afflicts his Children, he deals well with them, because he keeps them from Sinning in Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.15. <hi>I pray that thou keep them from the evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Godly are kept from <hi>impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi> When the Wicked are under Gods black Rod, they either <hi>faint</hi> or <hi>fret,</hi> Rev. 16.9. <hi>Men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God:</hi> but the Godly are silent under the Rod, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. <hi>And Aaron held his Peace:</hi> 'twas a sore Tryal, both his Sons were consumed with fire, but <hi>Aaron held his Peace.</hi> Gods People open their Ear to hear the <hi>Voice of the Rod,</hi> but shut their
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102654:119"/>
Mouth, they have not one word to say against God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Godly dare not use any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct means to extricate themselves out of Trouble. Wicked men, like Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, care not how they get loose, they will sin themselves out of straits: the People of God had rather lye in the Furnace to have their dross purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than come out too soon: they will not purchase the liberty of their Persons by insnaring their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Doth not God deal well with his Children in keeping them from sinning in Affliction? Affliction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do that mischief as sin doth: the one is like a rent in the Garment, the other is like a rent in the Flesh. Affliction may deprive us of our Estates, but Sin deprives us of our God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. God deals well with his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Affliction, because though he Correct them, he doth not forsake them. Indeed <hi>Sion said, the Lord hath forsaken me,</hi> Isa. 49.14; But that was under a Temptation, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.31. <hi>The Lord will not cast off for Ever.</hi> God may alter his <hi>Providence,</hi> not his <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:</hi> he may change his dispensation,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102654:120"/>
not his disposition, <hi>Hos.</hi> 11.8. <hi>How shall I give thee up O Ephraim?</hi> It al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to a Father who is about to disinherit his Son, but when he is going to set his hand to the deed, his bowels begin to Work; I am his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and though he be a Rebellious Son, yet he is a Son: how shall I disinherit him? Such are the Workings of Gods bowels to his Children; though he may give them a severe rebuke, yet he will not cut off the entail of Mercy.</p>
               <p n="9">9. God deals well with his Children in Affliction, because though their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be sad, yet it is not so bad as others: the Lord puts a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Chastisements of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Punishments of the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: the Godly man hath <hi>Pain</hi> in his sickness, but the Wicked man hath <hi>Wrath</hi> in his sickness, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.17. The Lord shoots a single Arrow at the Godly, but a whole shower of Arrows at the Wicked: he punisheth them in their Body, Estate, Conscience. A good man hath God to Pity him in his Sorrows, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.9. But the Wicked have God to laugh at them
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102654:120"/>
in their Miseries, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. The Godly have Christ to pray for them, in their Afflictions; but the Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent when in Torment, are shut out of Christs prayer, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.9. <hi>I pray not for the World.</hi> Gods People are apt to say, Never did any suffer as they: yes, it is worse with the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; their Sins and Sufferings meet together.</p>
               <p n="10">10. God in Affliction deals well with his Children, because if he take away one Comfort, he leaves more behind. God threatned <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to strip her of all her Jewels and leave her bare, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.39. But you who belong to God, may Sing of <hi>Mercy and Iudgment,</hi> Psal. 101.1. If God hath fleeced your Estate, he hath raised you up Friends: If he hath taken away one of your Jewels, he hath left you more: if he hath pluck'd one dear Relation from you, he hath left other sweet Clusters behind, and can double your Comfort in them: is not all this kindness? But this is our Sin, we grieve more for one Loss, than we are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for an Hundred Mercies. <hi>Jacob</hi> was more troubled for the loss of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102654:121"/>
                  <hi>Joseph,</hi> than he was Comforted with the Lives of all his other Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.35.</p>
               <p n="11">11. When God Afflicts he deals well with his People, because he takes away nothing from them but he gives them that which is better. What dammage can it be to a man to lose his Farthings, and have Gold given him? If God take away Health, he gives Holiness: If he take away a Child, he gives a Christ; is not this better? God takes away a Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and gives a Jewel.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When God Afflicts his Children he deals well with them, because he affords them his Divine presence, <hi>Psalm</hi> 91.15. <hi>I will be with him in trouble.</hi> God never Promised us a Charter of Exemption from trouble, but he hath Promised to be with us in trouble. Better be in a Prison and have Gods presence, than on a Throne and want it. Gods presence gives courage, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.11. When <hi>Polycarp</hi> was near the Theatre and going to Suffer, a Voice came from Heaven, <hi>Be of good chear O Polycarp.</hi> Was not Christ with the Three Children? did not he go with
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102654:121"/>
them into the fire? <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. <hi>I see four men in the fire, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</hi> He who is the Second Person in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, made the Fourth Person in the Furnace.</p>
               <p n="13">13. God in Afflicting deals well with his Children, because he gives them that which makes amends for their Afflictions; he drops in <hi>the Oyl of Gladness</hi>; he makes them gather <hi>Grapes</hi> of <hi>Thorns:</hi> John 16.22. <hi>Your Sorrow shall be turned into Joy.</hi> We see a Godly mans Sufferings, but we know not what Joy he feels: as we hear the roaring of the Sea, but we see not the Gold at the bottom. <hi>Philip Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Hesse</hi> said, that in his trouble he felt the divine Consolations of the Martyrs: Here was Hony out of the Lion. The Saints have been sometimes so sweetly enlarged, that they had rather endure their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than want their Comforts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>As the Sufferings of Christ abound in us: so our Consolation also aboundeth by Christ</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Martyr in catena gaudet,</hi> Tertul.</note>. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-Songs, <hi>Act.</hi> 16 25. This Bird of Paradise could sing in Winter. God
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102654:122"/>
turns the <hi>Waters of Marah</hi> into Wine; He keeps his Cordials for fainting. When the Saints taste most of the Wrath of Men, they shall feel most of the Love of God: thus the Lord can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies his Wormwood with Sugar.</p>
               <p n="14">14. When God Corrects his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren he deals well with them, because these Paroxysms or hot trials do not last long. ‚Äî <hi>Post nubila Phaebus</hi>‚Äî 1 Kin. 11.39. <hi>I will Afflict the Seed of</hi> David, <hi>but not for ever:</hi> God will love for ever, but not afflict for ever; he will ere long give his people a <hi>Writ of ease.</hi> A Sinners <hi>best,</hi> and a Saints <hi>worst</hi> are but short; Affliction is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Cup, Ezek.</hi> 23.32. The Wicked drink a Sea of Wrath; the Godly sip only of the Cup of Affliction, and God will shortly say, <hi>Transeat Calix, Let this Cup pass away from them,</hi> Isa. 35.10. <hi>Sorrow and sighing shall fly away.</hi> As Affliction hath a Sting to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so it hath a Wing to fly.</p>
               <p n="15">15. When God puts his Children to the School of the Cross, he deals well with them, because these Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Manuductions to lead them to Heaven. <hi>Per crucem ad coelum.</hi> 2 Cor.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:102654:122"/>
4.17. <hi>Our light Affliction worketh for us a far more exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory.</hi> Upon the dark Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Affliction God layes the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Colour of Glory. O thou weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saint, what a blessed change shalt thou shortly have! Thou shalt change thy Pilgrimage for Paradise: Thou shalt have thy wish. Are riches desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? thou shalt have <hi>Gates of Pearl</hi>: Is Honour desireable? thou shalt have <hi>white Robes</hi>: Is Pleasure desireable? thou shalt <hi>enter into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi> O think what it will be to be sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immersed in the River of Life, and Bathe in the Hony-streams of Gods Love for ever: think what the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Vision will be: what it will be to wear a Garland made of the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Paradise: think what it will be to have the Soul thicker set with Jewels of Glory, than the Firmament is bespangled with Stars: O what a Compensation will this be for all a Christians Tryals! A sight of this bliss will make him forget his Sufferings. One Sun-beam of Glory will dry up the Water of his Tears.</p>

chastiseth us, then it becomes us to Cherish good Thoughts of God. We are apt in Adversity to think hardly of God; this ariseth from Pride. Such commonly as are of high Spirits are of high Passions; they think themselves better than others, and that they have deserved better at Gods hands, and now Pride vents it self in murmuring. O let us take heed of having hard Thoughts of God. The Patient hath no cause to think ill of the Physician when he prescribes him a bitter Potion, seeing it is in order to a Cure. Gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive Providences are the strokes of a Father, not the Wounds of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. God smites that he may save. Out of the bitterest Drug God distils his Glory, and our Happiness.</p>
               <p>Let us Think well of God; nay, in all adverse Providences let us learn to bless God, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.18. <gap reason="foreign">

A gracious Soul should bless God that he will take so much Notice of him as to Visit him with the Rod <note n="*" place="margin">Job 7.18.</note>; and is so kind as rather to Afflict him than lose him. This shews an high degree of Grace, not only to <hi>Iustifie</hi> God in Affliction, but <hi>Magnifie</hi> him. Believers are Gods <hi>Temples,</hi> and where should his Praises be sounded forth but in his Temples?</p>
