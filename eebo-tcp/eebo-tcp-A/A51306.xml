            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> set forth
some few yeares past with
short reflections in latin, by
way of Meditation, could not
well be translated into our language as it
was ther digested (though desired by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers)
because in greate part it was compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of loose sayings of holy fathers, which,
besides the concise expressions of the latin
tongue, would have made the translation
fall short both in substance and methode;
that manner of expression and methode
sorting better with such as are learned, and
experienced in the way of contemplation,
and an English translation being rather to
be fitted to the vulgar and vnexperienced.
I thought best therfore my self at covenient
times to take it in hand, presuming I might
have the more freedome to follow, or to
alter the methode, as I should find cause,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59570:3"/>
and also to ad what might occur to be
supplied in places which might seeme
otherwise bare.</p>
                  <p>As for the worke it self, I have little to
say; Only in regard the ground of it is the
holy Text of the Evangelists, the Reader

that the holy Scripture vttereth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

of our Saviour, was to satisfie for the Synnes of
the world and to blot them out of our soules, and also to
give vs example of vertue, and incouragement to it, we
ought to dispose ourselves to a perfect hatred of synne,
as the cause of this greate evill which happened to our
Saviour, weighing who it is that suffers, and for what:
for as the greater the person is to whome an affront is
offered, the affront is also the greater and more detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
none being comparable to God in greatnes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more detestable then synne against him, to
which if we adde the goodnes of our Saviour tovvards
vs as man, the hatred of synne must be the greater, as of
an object the most injurious that can be both to God and

of his sincere, and constant, and vnchangeable love

                  <p>II. Consider secondly that as the Jewes, though
thier malice were greate, yet <hi>feared the people,</hi> and sought
therfore privately <hi>by craft</hi> to circumvent our Saviour;
so we in the service of God must not be afrayd what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople
will thinke, or say of vs; but banishing all humane
respects, and worldly reasons, go on with that which we
know to be good, and acceptable to God, with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and resolution, in the face of the world, for the
grearer glorie of God, as much, as provident reason
will allow.</p>
                  <p>III. Consider thirdly. As the divell <hi>entred into Iudas,</hi>
as a fit instrument for the Iewes towards thier maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
intents, and he of his ovvne accord <hi>went,</hi> and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

so detesting his treacherous and covetous minde, begge
earnestly of the holy Ghost, that he will vouchsafe to
take possession of thy hart, and soule, and body, and
of all that thou hast, to vse it as a means, and an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

hast to redeeme him, and his blessed sonne our Saviour

                  <p>IV. And againe consider 4thly. As the Ievves <hi>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>II. Consider secondly. That hovvsoever we may
find repugnance in laying open our soules to our Ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father, either by reason of the troble of searching
into ourselves or the foulenes of our offenses, or the
frequency of our negligences, or for bashfulnes, or
other respects, yet if we consider well that all things
lye open to God, and that which we ourselves disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
God doth wash and cover, the ease of our mind
for the present, the satisfaction of our ovvne soules
at the houre of death, the necessitie of it at one time
or other, we shall say with S. Peeter. <hi>Lord not my feet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that in which I have lately transgressed, but whatsoever
I have done, good or badd, from the beginning to the
ending I will willingly lay open, that I may have full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and direction.</p>
                  <p>III. Consider thirdly. That comfortable, and with
all fearefull saying of our Saviour. <hi>He that is washed,
needeth only that his feete be washed, but is all cleane,
and you are cleane; but not all for he knew who it was
that would betray him.</hi> That is, he that is once washed
by a good confession, and performeth accordingly that
which he there purposeth, to wit, the keeping of the
commandments for the time to come, needeth only
that his feete be washed, that is, those lesser offenses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which cleave like dust to our feete, and no man is able to
avoyde them more or lesse who travelleth in this world,
but yet to the end that through the benefit of being
cleansed by confession, we should not grow into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,

we must remember that though by the grace of
God we are cleansed, he only knovveth who shal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sever.</p>
                  <p>IV. Consider fourthly. And admire at large the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
of our blessed Saviour, in regard wherof S. Peeter
sayd, <hi>Lord doest thou wash my feete?</hi> Thou? My feete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I.<note place="margin">Luc. 22. 15.</note> COonsider first. That the worthynes of this blessed
Mysterie was partly the cause why our Saviour a
little before so humbly washed his disciples feete,
who were to receive him: to give vs to vnderstand with
what acknovvledgment of our ovvne vnvvhorthines, and
with what puritie of soule and affection, and also of bodie
we ought to approach to this heavenly banque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Therfore
also in the Catholick Church all things about the Altar
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59570:28"/>
are so neate and costly, because nothing spirituall or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
can be precious or curious enough to bestow in
the intertainment of so divine a guest: If thou know him,
if thou esteeme him as thou oughtest, and as he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.
Bestow all the care thou canst in cleansing the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of thy soule, and dressing vp the Altar of thy hart to
receive him.</p>
                  <p>II. Consider secondly. That by this heavenly myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
it is manifest how much Christ our Saviour doth love
vs, seeing out of love he desireth allwayes to be with vs;
and being to go out of the world, would by this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Invention stay still among vs as if he could not be
without vs: To the end we should dayly increase in the
love of him, and vnderstanding that really we cannot
be without him, we might desire the more earnestly his
blessed companie and conversation, by all the means
which are possible for vs. O my love! whether doe I
wander from thee?</p>
                  <p>III. Consider thirdly that this miraculous act of
love is the more to be valued and admired because when
he was going about it (as some doe hold) there was at
board one that would betray him, divers certayne that
would forsake him, and he foresavv thousands and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
that would negligently, vnreverently vnvvorthily
misuse his blessed presence: labour thou to be none of
these.</p>
                  <p>IV. Consider fourthly. How our Saviour giving out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardly
this blessed bread of life, did invvardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
the harts of his Apostles, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this was the bread which he had promised before; bread
in outvvard shape, but really his bodie and blood: And

                     </gap>chending
and beleeving it, were filled with admiration,
and love, and thanksgiving, which are the acts which we
must exercise; begging that he will strengthen our faith,
establish our hope, and take possession of our soule and

or feelest. For condescending to our infirmitie, he
shevveth that we may earnestly begge of God to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

greately to love him, and thank him for his compassion
over thee. And on the other side hovv we must begge
with Resignation to his holy will, in regard that these
Crosses may be many wayes beneficiall to ourselves and
much for the glorie of God: And it is reason we should
leave ourselves in his hands it being a fearefull thing to
be out of them at our ovvne choyse: and say often from

will be done.</hi>
                  </p>

againe to his wonted prayer, and so againe the
second time: To shevv vs that he is willing we should
take comfort by the help of creatures, though our
chiefest comfort must still be in God: For creatures
of themselves have it not in them, though we imagin
they have it, and oftimes they breed more affliction

fell more earnestly to his prayers, and out of meere
anguish, and agonie svveating blood, that it fell in
greate dropes vpon the ground, an Angell came and
comforted him; with which he went couragiously on
to death. Shevving vs that in our afflictions we must

                     <hi>Preamble.</hi> Desirous to knovv what passed, begge
of our Saviour grace to profit by his example.</p>
                  <p>I. Consider hovv they brought our Saviour first
to Annas,<note place="margin">Adduxe. runt eum ad Annum primum 10. 18.</note> one of the chief priests, to boast
and to shevv hovv they had compassed thier
intent. And Annas began <hi>to question him about his doctrine.</hi>
Whervnto our Saviour ansvvering what he thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<hi>one of the Servants,</hi> or officers, <hi>stroock him on the face,</hi> or
cheeke, reproachfully saying, <hi>doest thou answer: he chiefe
Priest so?</hi> And our Saviour replyed mildly, <hi>if I have
spoken ill, beare witnes of the Evill, but if well, why doe
you strike me?</hi> See hovv every one applauded the bold
fellovv, and laughed at our Saviour, and insulted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him. Take heed of rashly passing thy censure v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
any man, much more of proceeding further to words
or actions before thou hast well wieghed the deser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s
of every mans cause; If thoube censured, and abused, in
word or Acton, remember our Saviours mildnes here
and every were. Beware of Passion, for such occasions
be the fewell which sets it on fire; when there is no
pregnant occasion a body may easily thinke he is fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
from passion, when it is but a sleepe.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59570:30"/>
                  <p>II. Consider secondly. How from hence they carie
him presently to Cayphas the high Priest; at whose house
the whole councell of the Iewes was met: And because
they had no true crime to charge him with, <hi>they sought
false witnes: but they agreed not</hi> in their charge, <hi>though
many came in against him.</hi> And our Saviour held his
peace. Hovv loth are we that any false things should be
bruited of vs! Hovv little are we able to hold our peace
in it, as our Saviour did? Hovv doth it free vs?
Hovv many discourses doe we intertaine in our thoughts
and with ourfrendes, and others? That we ought
not to put it vp; that to be silent were to acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ourselves guiltie; that such people are not to be
borne with for example sake, &amp;c. Oftimes though the
thing be in part, or wholly true, we storme the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re:
Consider well hovv much better it is in very many
occasions to be silent, and arme thyself with patience to
dissemble them.</p>
                  <p>III. Consider thirdly. Hovv Cayphas when nothing
would take, <hi>rose vp, and adiured our Saviour to tell him
whether he were Christ the Sonne of God!</hi> And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ansvvered plainly, <hi>I am</hi> and more over, that thy
<hi>should see the Sonne of man sitting at the right hand of God,
and coming in the Clouds of heaven.</hi> Whervpon Cayphas
<hi>tore his owne garment,</hi> as it were admiring at the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of his ansvver, <hi>and sayd he blasphemed; what need
we more wines? And all pronounced him guiltie of death.</hi>
Note our Saviours sinceritie, and playnes in that which
was the principall of his doctrine, though he knevv
he was to die for it. And hovv nothing can be done,
or sayd so just, or true in true in this world, but it is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be construed quite contrarie by Some or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But we must rest satisfied in that which is truly
vpright,
and expect our revvard in an other world,
where the just judge at the right hand of his Father will
doe every body right. Feare the judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
thou seest no greare cause to feare in the greatest time
of prosperous successe. As our Saviour was to be Iudge,
though here he were condemned, so oftimes that which
we commend will in another world be iudged. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
no bodie, though to the eye he be poore and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59570:31"/>
contemptible: perhaps in the world to come he may fit
in a throne with the ludge, or at least be cleered, when
I shall be condemned. Observe hovv patiently out Saviour
bare the pride of Cayphas the slander of blasphemie, the
rude clamours of all that he was guiltie of death, thier
vniust sentence &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Prayer.</hi> To our Saviour for patience in adversities, and
reproches, proposing to ourselves something of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues

                  <p>II. Consider secondly. Hovv our Saviour sits patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with his eyes looking dovvne to the ground, silent,
forsaken of all his disciples, and acquaintance, no body
looks after him. <hi>Pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>III. Consider thirdly, that this denyall of S. Peter

                  <p>II. Consider secondly. VVhen our Saviour was come

That our desire of knovvledge of matters of spirit must

                  <p>I. Consider secondly, that this custome of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

and thankfullnes for thier deliverie, about that time of

of synne, and theft, and sedition against God, by means
of the selfsame God that delivered them out of Egypt:
But they through thier malice and envie tovvards our
Saviour turned good to evill: wherby we may well
learne hovv deadly a thing passion is, that makes vse of the

                  <p>III. Consider thirdly. That Pilate overcome with
the clamours and threats of the Iewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if he quitted
Iesus, <hi>he should not be a frend to casar,</hi> adiudged him
to be crucified, according to thier desire, though

and passion blinds vs, and leads vs to things against
our conscience; and though we see we have reason
to think ourselves guiltie before God, we smother it
with some colourable reason to satisfie the world,
and after à sort to satisfie ourselves for a time; but
when the passion is over, the sting breakes out, and
galls vs. See therfore whose frend thou wilt be Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars

for with out it nothing is avayable: Abhorre synne, and

                  <p>III. Consider thirdly, That when he had gone about

the woman. Thou mayst easily imagin with what joy
She received it, and with what reverence She kept it; and
hovv well she thought herself payed for her charitable
commiseration. Such are the returnes which our Saviour
makes of courtesies done to himself in his service, or in
his Servants; he leaves the print of himself, and of his
love more deepely in thier harts, which Surpasseth all
treasures, and makes vs the speedier to be in tertayned in

whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pointed vs out the Traytour. O wicked Traytour
but when I accompaned him into the garden of Gethse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,

Then he was sorrovvfull, as he sayed, vnto death, and

distresse! His glorious body needeth not, yet is
honoured with our services; his mysticall body hath need
of comfort. <hi>And very early, the first:</hi> after our corporall
rest, we must furnish ourselves with good thoughts that
in the processe of the day we be not found emptie: The
<hi>penitent,</hi> the <hi>suppl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>peaceable,</hi> or contemplative, all ayme at one end, the
glorie of God, and of our Saviour: They are all three, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
that is, greatly exalted in the sight of God, and must
be so esteemed in the sight of one another.</p>
                     <p>II. <hi>And they sayed, who shall roll the stone for vs from
the doore of the monument?</hi> In the beginning of all our
our actions it is necessarie to humble ourselves, acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
our ovvne forces to be too weake to doe any
good thing, that we may have the more fervent recourse
to God, and be the more confident of his help, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in it. And this will be an effectuall means that we
shall not be overvvhelmed with apprehension of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
more then we shal find by Gods grace vpon triall: If
they had given way at first to this apprehension, they
would not have bought the spices, or set forth, and so
should have missed of the happines which befell them in
the sight of the Angel, and of our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>III. Though they set early forth, the <hi>Sunne was risen</hi>
before they came to the monument. This might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

late, and in likely hood they blamed themselves, as it is

are oft defective when we think we are not; and that very
thought is a greate defect; for wee cannot but be short
of what God deserves of vs: yet they persevered; the only
way to supply our defects; and perceiving from a farre of
the stone to be removed, we may easily imagin hovv they
mended thier pace; and not easy to say whether the <hi>penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi>

as the Apostle tells vs; but hovv soone, or in what

stone, the more they were inflamed in thier desire, and

more then it shall be ever able to effect: And even these

                  <p>I. THe height of the charitie of God, and of our

before we were we could not love, is of itself apparent;
and considering to what end he loved vs, to wit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
himself to vs, first by sayth, then by cleere
sight, and inioyment of his glorious self, we may take
a scantling according to our weake apprehension, or
dull affection, of the excellencie of his love tovvards
vs; seeing nothing can be more eycellent then to see, and
injoy God. All that we see or heare of in the world was
created for our benefit, yet all that is nothing compared
to one minute of time, what then to an eternitie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
God? O if thou hadst seen the eternall crownes

                  </p>
                  <p>II. A second degree of excellencie of the love
of God is, that which the Apostle doth reflect on,
and with reason doth dilate himself vpon it, to
wit, that not only when we were nothing, but
<hi>when we were synners, when we were enimies, when we
were weake,</hi>

another) but spared vs, had compassion on vs, releeved
<hi>vs. God commendeth his charitie towards vs, in that when we
were yet synners Christ dyed for vs:</hi>

<hi>surpasseth all knowledge and all conceite of man; for as the same

                     <hi>or when by justice he is condemned,
perhaps for a good cause, or for defence of that which is
right a body may dare to die,</hi> but for his enimie, for one
that taketh away his good name, and as much as is in
him, his life, who is there that would thinke of offering
himself to die? O my God, in this thou shewest thyself
to be God, that is, all goodnes, and all love; give me
grace to love thee at least for this thy love, and die, that
I may not die by syn.</p>
                  <p>III. Yet a third excellencie is to be reflected on,
which the same Apostle suggesteth, to wit, that God
<hi>did not spare his owne Sonne, but delivered him for vs
all.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 24.</note> In the infinite treasure of his divine knowledge and

yet this offering itself as the most convenient in all res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
he <hi>did not spare it,</hi> though the most pretious

called to counsell, nor slothfull pusillanimitie; but perfect

sustenance, then the body, and blood, and divinitie of

so here he descended vpon the Apostles, and the rest there

                        <hi>ANd there were dwelling in Hierusalem Iewes,
devout men, of every nation that is under
heaven; and when this voyce was heard a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
assembled, and was astonished, because every one
heard them speake in his owne tongue, And they were all
amazed, saying, what meaneth this? Others deriding sayed,
these men are full of new wine,</hi> The impulsions of the

Church of Christ, and the taking away the false
aspersion layed vpon him by the Iewes in his death vpon
the crosse, and the giving a happy rise to the Ghospell;
therfore it imported that <hi>a multitude should be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi>
to receive the gladsome tidings, and to receive
it in this extraordinarie way, with admiration, and
astonishment, which should make them attentive, and
dispose them to imbrace the truth; and yet we see a
means so forcible did not worke in all the like effect: by
which we are admonished to have an eye over ourselves
both to dispose ourselves towards the receiving of Gods
graces, and not to be forward to construe to the worst
that which we doe not fully vnderstand, or is not to
our humour and to reverence things which are above
our capacitie.</p>

vnto vs; first that it is not confined to one nation,
as in the law of Moyses were the promises of the Messias,
but to all nations of the world the benefit of saluation by
Christ is proclaymed, and whoever calleth vpon his name
with lively sayth, working by <unclear>charitie</unclear>, shall be saved. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
that the graces of the law of Christ are not scarce,
but abundant, and plentifully poured forth vpon all

his calling in whatever state he liveth. Be gratfull to God
for these benefits, and apply thyself diligently to make

                     <p>III. And hearing these things they were sory at hart,

                  <p>II. <hi>They continued also in the communication of breaking

                  <p>III. A third fruite was a greate contempt of humane
things, and of worldly wealth, together with greate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in God tovvards thier reliefe; and resolution to
suffer for his sake who had suffered so much for vs; for it
is sayed of them <hi>that all that beleeved were together, and
had all things common, thier possessions and substance they
sold, and divided them to all according as every one had
need:</hi> Not that every one was bound to doe so, for S. Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sayed to Ananias (who had made a shevv to quit all,
and fraudulently de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ayned part of his goods) <hi>remayning
did it not remayne to thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act: 5 4</note> 
                     <hi>and being sold was it not in
thy power? thou hast not lyed to men, but to God.</hi> But the
perfection of the doctrine of Christ tending to this heigh
contempt of all things, the better to serve him, very
many did imbrace that course; in so much that it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
the fruite of the holy Ghost, and the primitive
spirit so to doe.</p>
                  <p>IV. A fourth fruite was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nitie, and peace, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among themselves;<note place="margin">Act: 2 46</note> 
                     <hi>they were dayly continuing with
one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from house
to house, they tooke thier meate with ioy, and simplicitie of
hart, Praysing God, and having grace with all the people;
and our Lord increased them that should be saved dayly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
So that in thier spirituall, and temporall actions
there was no disagreement, but peace, and ioy, with out
deceite; and thier conversation was much to the glorie of
God, and to thier ovvne benefit, and the benefit also of
others, who by the good example which they gave were
invited, and incouraged to follovv the like course, and to
imbrace the fayth of Christ, wherin otherwise there were
points enough, both for beleefe and practise, which
might have averted them. Prayse God for all, and have
confidence in him. &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>I. VVE may love those things which we have
nor seen with our eyes, we cannot
love that which doe not some way
know: we know God by Fayth, by discourse, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
and by fruition, or injoying him. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyest
and easyest way is by Faith, as we may discover by
the difficultie which the greatest wits of the world anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
had with out Fayth to know there was a God, one,
eternall, Omnipotent, all seeing, all disposing. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must both thank God for the light of Faith, and
often exercise acts therof submitting all contrarie sugges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vnto it. This kind of knowledge was delivered first
from hand to hand by our forefathers to thier Children
successively; then renewed in the old law by God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59570:86"/>
pearing to Moyses, and the children of Israël; lastly by the
sonne of God himself our Saviour, coming into this
world<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> confirming by signes and miracles both the being
of one God, and that himself was sent to establish his law
in the harts of men, and to vnfold and perfect all that
which formerly was delivered, and practised in figure
of what was to come. The record wherof is holy
Scripture, and Tradition; both which concurring are
a proofe so invincible that vnder heaven there is not any
more forcible.</p>
                     <p>II. We may confirme this knowledge by discourse,
and contemplation; as for example; finding nothing to
be in this world which hath not some cause, or many
causes concurring to its being, we begin to think there
can be nothing which hath not some cause wherby it
begins, and yet in all absolutely it cannot be so, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
there must be a first cause, caused by nothing
els, and that is God, Then the order, and government of
the world, and seasons of the yeare shewes there is
some greate thing that governeth it; as order among
men cannot be without a directour; and the like. We
must not think notwithstanding that we can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
his Essence, or his attributes, which are in him
one single Essence; but by admiring them, and adoring
them, and acknowledging our owne weakenes to deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
them, we shall come to vnderstand more of him:
for if we know allmost nothing of these inferiour things,
but the outward appearance of them, and cannot dive
into the substance, and essence of them, though
we see them, and touch them, how shall we be able to
comprehend the least attribute of God, in whom nothing
is not infini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>III. Perfect inioying of God is not the state of this
life, neither can any creature even in any life come vnto
it, but by the speciall grace of God, vouchsafing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
himself; yet in some measure, through his grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

we may even in this life inioy him, and so increase also in
his knowledge, by beleeving him to be, as he is, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
present with vs, and that there is not a place, or
creature, in which he is not, giving it life, and motion
and subsistence; and consequently loving him for this
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59570:86"/>
continual, and loving assistance, and ioying in it: for as
by continual conversation with men we come to knovv
them, so God is also knowne by looking vpon him; and
because all that is in him, or proceeds from him, is good,
there cannot but be insinite cause of loving him, with out
any cause at all of distast; which can hardly ever be
among men.<note place="margin">Eccl. 43. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

because I am not so much as worthy of the name, of

                  <p>II. The Blessed Sacrament is tearmed the Sacrament
of the living, and nor of the dead, because if our soules be
dead by mortall synne (which God forbid) we must first
confesse our synns, and have absolution, and so be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to life, that we may receive our Lord; otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed
of cure we give ourselves another wound, and doe
incurre greater damnation, and that which is ordayned
for our good turneth to our greater harme. Yet for the
receiving of that life, he is our Physitian whome we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in this Sacrament; the Priest being his minister, and
he by the mouth of the Priest pronouncing absolution;
and here he confirmeth, and strengtheneth the same life
in vs by his blessed presence, and by more abundant
grace bestowed, giving vs more strength to overcome
temptations, keeping of our Ghostly enimie by himself;
and by his holy Angels accompanying him, and asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the heate of our concupiscences, and earthly desires;
and the oftener we come devoutly to him, the more
we shall find these gracious effects to be wrought in
vs; that we may humbly say with the Apostle. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
I was blasphemous,</hi>

                  <p>III. Life is defined to be the beginning, or fountaine
of motion, or operation; we are sayed to live, so long as
we can move, and so is a tree, or a plant, so long as it can
put forth; when we see no more such effect, we say, it is
dead. In which respect charitie, or the love of God, being
the life inherent in our soules, S. Gregorie sayth, that <q>the
proofe of charitie is the exhibition of the worke: and our

towards which also we may justly expect he will suggest

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59570:114"/>
in that which is best: And, speaking of intertayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in three things people vse to shew thier care; that
there be varietie of good meates; that they be tender
and well seasoned; that they be served in good order and
time. These three betoken the serious mortifications of
our passions and evill customes after our reconciliation:
Varietie of vertuous actions sometimes praying, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
reading, sometimes doing some deed of Charitie,
spirituall or temporall, sometime attending to our other
occasions according to our calling. And thirdly that all
these things be not done at randome, but in an orderly, and
constant way, and distribution so neere aspossibly we can.</p>
                  <p>III. It is very true, that Charitie, or the love of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is the queen of vertues, and is that <hi>one thing,</hi> which is
absolutely <hi>necessarie,</hi> as indeed comprehending all other
vertues,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13 4</note> as the Apostle setteth forth vnto vs: <hi>Charitie is patient, benigne, doth not envie &amp;c. and is never to be
taken from vs;</hi> because fayth, and hope, and other
vertues will cease in heaven, where there will be no
occasion of them. Charitie remayneth for ever. And
happy are they who with Marie Magdalen can <hi>sit at the
feete of our Saviour;</hi> by hearing and speaking of his love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to inflame it in thier harts: It is <hi>the best part,</hi> yet they
must vnderstand that, so long as we live in this vale
of miserie, it is but a part; it must be so attended vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as not to hinder other occasions, which dayly call
vpon vs. And even in this intertaynment of our Saviour,
when we receive him, though our whole life time were
not sufficient to attend vpon him for once receiving, yet
having set at his feete some convenient sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>and in
the communication of breaking of bread, and prayers,
and greate feare was in all. And all that beleeved were
together, and had all things common. Thier possessions,

to imitate, at least in the occasion which we have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

Chapter of the first of S. Paul to the Corinthians,

come abruptly to the holy table, or go from it, as we
would from an ordinarie meale; but think what we are
doing, and have done; and commend ourselves to God,

It is apparent, by his Mothers instant and confident words
to the servants, that our Saviours answer was no check,
but only that he would expresse that it was a thing not
belonging to him, nor to her, to take care of supplying
such temporall wants, or rather superfluities; not to him

The meditation of the Blessed Virgin, the prompt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

and in three dayes I will rayse it againe; the Iewes sayed, in

it in three dayes! But he spake of the Temple of his body.</hi>
It was true of both the one, and the other; he had been
able to have raysed in three dayes the materiall Temple if
it had been demclished; and he would insinuate that the
Temple, and all that which was done in it, was but a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of his body, and of the humane nature which he had
assumed to accomplish those figures in it, so sayth S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose.<note place="margin">S. Ambr.</note>
The body of Christ is truly the Temple of God,
wherin is wrought the purgation of our synnes; that flesh
was truly Gods Temple in which there could be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of synne; but was itself the sacrifice for the synnes
of the whole world; that flesh was truly the Temple of
God in which the image of God did shine, and the fullnes
of divinitie did corporally dwell. The Iewes required a

                     </gap>e things,
as if that very Action had not been signe sufficient. Yet
our Saviour did not deny them a signe, but referred them
to that which had been figured in Ionas of him and
prophecyed; that is, to vse thier owne Industrie and the
ordinarie means of vnderstanding the mysteries so faire
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59570:131"/>

other halfe the world had still in possession. And by his
speech it appeares he did not beleeve as yet that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was God, but some speciall teacher, or prophet sent
from God, testifying his mission by those signes. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
finding that he retayned too much of the Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
spirit told him three things very strange, and wholy
contrarie to his and the worlds apprehension and humour
for first he sayed <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> that is, in every truth, <hi>I say
vnto thee vnlesse a man be born againe, he cannot see the kingdome
of heaven,</hi> as if he would have sayed, you talk to me of
greatnes, but I say you must all become little, and begin of
new, and take new wayes if you will enter the kingdome
of God: and when Nicodemus asked <hi>how can these things be
done? how can a man be born when he is old?</hi> Our Savior re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
the same againe, and told him moreover, that now
he must withdraw his thoughts from materiall and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
obiects, and things concerning this corporall life, and
think of a spirituall life, the beginning and entrance wherof
is baptisme, and so to be born of water, and the spirit was
necessarie towards it. This to naturall reason and common
apprehension seemes strange, and to some perhaps imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
<hi>But no man hath ascended into heaven</hi> to know the
secrets of Gods eternall disposition, <hi>but he who descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from heaven, the sonne of man, who is in heaven.</hi> To him
the greatest Clarks must stoope, and humbly receive
from this greate Master that to which by strength of wit
and industrie they cannot reach. And to our dayly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
besides the thanks which we owe to God for the
benefit of baptisme, and of faith. S. Augustin puts
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59570:132"/>
vs in mind dayly to renew ourselves; for sayth he,<note place="margin">S. August.</note> wherfore
should a body be borne againe, but to the end to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed?
And wherfore should he be renewed; but for that
he is become old?</p>
                  <p>II. The second strange thing was, that wheras Moyses
had set vp a brasen serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the desert,<note place="margin">Num. 21. 9</note> to the end that they
who were bitten by serpents should be cured, by casting
thier eyes vpon that figure; so sayth our Saviour; <hi>must the
sonne of man be exalted, that every one that beleeveth
in him, may not perish, but have life everlasting,</hi> as if he had
sayed: this very man, whom thou doest so much reverence
as a man of God, must be exalted vpon the Crosse and die
a shamefull death, and vnlesse people doe notwithstanding
beleeve in him, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d follow him, they cannot have life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.
His person will be hated among you as much as

                     </gap>nts of the desert, yet you must fix your eyes of
faith vpon him, or ells you will perish. As Moyses by Gods
appointement placed that serpent for a corporall reliefe of
those who were stroken; by the same Gods appointment
shall I be placed vpon a Crosse, for the cure of those who
have fallen into spirituall serpents jawes by synne.</p>
                  <p>III. And yet a stranger thing I doe tell thee. <hi>God so
loved the world, as to give his only Sonne</hi> to be so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsed,
and so tormented, <hi>to the end that every one that
beleeveth in him perish not, but have life everlasting,</hi>
Thou takest me to be man only, as other men, and doest
wonder that I, so much favoured by God, should come
to suffer as I tell thee. But the love of God is greater then
to content himself to imploy a man only: I am not man
only, but <hi>the only Sonne of God;</hi> and yet I am to suffer as I
sayed for mankind. O strange thing! o infinite love! <q>Tell

Tell vs the measure, declare the greatnes, teach vs

the reason of it; why <hi>so?</hi> why not otherwise? O deapth

                  <p>II. <hi>Our Saviour asked him, what is thy name? he sayed,
a legion, for we are many; and he beseeched him much
that he would not cast them out of the country nor command
them into the depth. And there was a heard of swine fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on the mountaines, and they desired he would permit
them to enter into them, and he permited them. The divels
therfore went out of the man, and entred into the swine,
and the heard with violence went into the lake and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

that greatest synners some times see thier owne
ruine, and feate it; and fourthly; by that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
vnto the swine, we may see whether at last the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel

sea, but into a sea of torments in which we shall never

and they came to Iesus, and found the man siting at his
feete, clothed and well in his wits; and they were afrayd,
and besought him to depart from them. And the man out of
whome the divels were cast, desired he might be with him:
but Iesus dismissed him saying, returne into thy house, and
tell how greate things God hath done to thee; and he went
through the whole citty preaching how greate things Iesus
had done to him.</hi> Observe that no man in this life is so
greate a synner, or so much overgrowne with vice and
imperfection, that his conversion is to be despayred. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly;
reflect vpon the effect of true repentance, which
is humilitie: So the Magdalen layed herself at the feete of
out Saviour: Intertayne a wholsome feare of being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
separated from Iesus, and from the means by which
we were cured: Also a continuance of a greate esteeme of
the benefit which we have received, magnifying it with
in ourselves, and extolling it also before others, when there
is is occasion. Those of the towne sought the contrarie,
not knowing what was good for them. <q>Acknowledge
thyself vnworthy of divine comfort and rather deserving
affliction.</q>

harder, and harder to be brought to good: and however
pleasing for a time a heavenly inspiration is, it will take

vnto you, that their Angels in heaven doe allwayes see the face
of my father which is in heaven.</hi> Next to humilitie, and
simplicitie of hart he commends Charitie, even towards

reward of receiving our Saviour himself, while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
our neighbour; then which what can be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
or more to be desired? It is a greate motive

                  <p>II. <hi>Therfore is the Kingdome of heaven likened to a King,
takeng account of his servants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when he began to take account,
one was presented to him, who owed him ten thousand talents;
and having not whence to pay it, his Lord commanded that he
should be sold, and his wife and Children, and all that he had,
and it to be repayed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the servant faling downe, besought
him: Have patience with me, and I will repay thee all: And
the Lord of the servant moved with pittie, dismissed him, and
the debt he forgave him.</hi> The debt of ten thousand talents,
being a debt incomparable (as reckoned to be six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

which we owe God vpon infinite titles; and yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

who owed him a hundred pence, and laying hands
vpon him, throtled him, saying, repay that which thou owest;
and his follow servant falling downe, besought him, have
patience with me, and I will repay the all: And he would not,
but went his way, and cast him into prison till he repayed the
debt.</hi>
See the different wayes of men towards men, and of
God towards men. For how little a matter in comparison
of what we owe to God doe we molest on another, and
how patient is God towards vs? How cruell, and mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
are men? How easy is God to pardon? How soone
doe we forget what God hath done for vs? How little
doe we consider anothers case as our owne? But see the

oughtest not thou therfore also to have mercy on thy follow servant,
as I had mercy on thee? And his Lord being angry, delivered
him to the tormentours, vntill he repayed all the debt; soe also
shall my heavenly Father doe to you, if you forgive not every one
his brother from your harts.</hi> In the first falt, and fayling in
his account he was to be cast into prison, but no mention
of tormentours,<note place="margin">S. Ihon Chrisost.</note> in the second, he is delivered to tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours:

he came too oft, but indeavoured ever to be ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, and to be diligent, and respectfull at his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
Martha did not think she did too much, when she
desired her sister should help her, but she thought that
both of them could not doc enough: she complayned that
she was left alone to wayte vpon him, let vs looke, that
our Saviour have not reason to complayne of vs, that we
doe leave him alone he ministring to vs, and we either doo
not come to him, or whe we have received him doe not
attend him. Here he presents vs not with <hi>a part,</hi>

he sayed to the first, How much doest thou owe to my Lord? He
sayeth, an hundred pipes of oyle, and he sayed to him, take thy
bill, and sit downe, quickly write fiftie: and to another, how
much doest thou owe? He sayed an hundred quarters of wheate;

praysed the Bayly of iniquitie, because he had done wisely:

he had received so much grace as to have kept all the
commandments, from his youth, nor did esteeme of

that only God is good; we may find, both the humilitie
of our Saviour, referring all the goodnes, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
in him to his heavenly Father, without staying
his thougs in himself, though he were equally good.

from God, all vertue, all observance; all possibilitie

and begge of him, so much participation of it as he shall

have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, and when the
yongman heard this word, he went away sad, for he had many
possessions.</hi> Perfection consisteth in that coniunction with
God which we may attayne vnto in this life, that is, in
Charitie, and the love of God; to which perfection all are
bound in some degree, so that at least, they never preferre
my thing in thought, word, or deed, before the love of
God, and observance of his commandments; and to this
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59570:196"/>
perfection it seemes this yong man conceived that he had
arrived. But our Saviour shewed him that there was a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher
degree, or a more advantagious way to increase per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the love of God, then he had hitherto thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght

The yong man, when he asked <hi>what good shall I
doe?</hi> Did desire eternall life; God was desirous to give it
him in perfection, but he found his hands full; God was
ready to give, and found not where to place his gift, <hi>Go,

which here on earth doe hinder thee: of what art thou af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid?
Thou shalt not leese them: they will be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

and doest thou not feare least thyself perish?</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>And Iesus sayed to his disciples; Amen, I say to you, that
a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdome of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is
easyer for a Camell</hi> (or a cable rope) <hi>to passe through the eye of
a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And when they heard this, the disciples marvelled very much
saying, who the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be saved? And Iesus sayed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this
is impossible, but with God all things are possible:</hi> This saying of
truth itself is much be to weighed; he doth not say a rich
man shall not enter, though he retaynes his riches; but
he sayth he shall hardly enter: and in the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
he expresseth it by way of admiration, <hi>How
hardly shall they enter who have mony?</hi> Esteeming it a
miraculous thing, and above the course of ordinarie gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
without extraordinarie helps. To which purpose, S.
Ambrose<note place="margin">S. Ambro.</note> sayth, <q>whosoever is puffed vp with honour,</q>
inlarged by his treasures of gold, like a beast loden and
hampered, will not be able to passe through the narrow
way of the Kingdome of heaven. Yet the advise which S.
Augustin<note place="margin">S. August</note> gives is greately to be taken heed to: that
<q>whoever can glorie of povertie must beware of pride,</q>
least the humble rich men go before them; and beware
of floth; and want of devotion, least the devout rich men
be perferred; and take heed of intemperance, least the
sober go beyond them: what avayleth povertie, if thou
follow not Christ.</p>

the rest of the Apostles had done that hard thing, of which
the rich yong man was afraide, and sad when it was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

hast left,<note place="margin">S. August</note> in comparison of the whole world, which v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
my promise thou art to receive? <q>He leaveth
much,</q> who leaves not only what he hath but whatever
he might desire to have: for what poore snake doth not
swell with the hope which he hath in this world? Who
is there that doth not dayly desire to increase that which
he hath? This desire, this greedines is here taken away.
S. Peeter did also well observe that it was not enough to
leave all vnlesse he followed our Saviours vertues and
doctrine, neither can he indeed be truly sayed to leave all,
who retaynes so much of sense, and self-love, as to draw
back from the perfect performance of whatever vertue
he is inspired vnto; for though he leaveth all which he
had without, he leaveth not that which is with in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and which is of more importance and more deare

The Apostles <hi>were afrayd,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 20 17</note> because they knew the malice
of the Iewes against o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

made hast to Hierusalem, vvhere he vvas
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59570:202"/>
most maliced: and to add to their astonishment he began
to discourse with them of his sufferings: And certainly he
that could foretell what vvas to happen to him, could
have prevented it, if he would; but it is an evident signe
that he was willing to suffer, seeing he so willingly went
to the place, where he knew he was to suffer, and by it he
would shew vs, that our way to the heavenly Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
is by suffering, which we must also in deavour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
with alacritie.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Behold, we go vp to Hierusalem, and the sonne of man shall
be delivered to the chiefe Priests, and to the Scribes; and they
shall condemne him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills

day he shall rise againe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chrysol</note> 
                     <q>He did not content himself with
ordinarie sufferings,</q> or vvith a private death; the creatour
of the world vvould die in sight of the world; that as his
patience was singular, so might be his sufferings. He tells
them before hand of it, and of his resurrection vvithall,
that they might not thinke that those things came vpon
him at vnawares, as vpon others, or that by suffering he
vvere vtterly destroyed; but continue their beleefe in him,
seeing the prediction and event to agree, and his divine
power much more evident by his resurrection after so
cruell a death, then by all the former miracles vvhich he
had wrought. So in all our distresses, he leaveth vs not
vvithout speciall comfort, if we attend to his Words: and
in no particular shall we suffer, in vvhich we shall not be
particularly rewarded; if mocked, we shall be honoured;
if scourged, and crucified, vve shall be not only eased of
all paine, eternally freed, but shall have particular refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and content proportionable to our sufferings.</p>

was hid from them, and they vnderstood not the things
which were sayed.</hi> The Apostles first, beleeved he was God,
and could not comprehend how being God, so innocent,

they had seen by experience that when he vvould, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined

he vvould allwayes doe so. Thirdly, Nature shrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
at the very name of suffering, they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
how he should willingly put himself into their

thou, the sonne of man must be exalted? Who is this
Sonne of man? Iesus sayed to them; yet a little while the light
is among you; Walke while you have the light, that the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
overtake you not. He that walketh in darknes knoweth not
whether he goeth. While you have the light, beleeve in the light,
that you may be Children of the light. These things Iesus spake,
and nent away and hid himself from them.</hi> See how necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
it is, besides the law (which the multitude had heard.
and many of them doubtlesse had read) to have a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of the law. It was very true that Christ was to
abide for ever, and yet it was also true that he was to dye,
and not to stay here visibly for ever. In like manner there
be many things in holy Scripture which seeme to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
one to the other, and yet are not, being rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
be not therfore easyly moved, or trobled when
they occurre, but referre thyself to the Church, and to the
teachers therof. <hi>The light</hi> of the truth was among the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
for a time; by their obstinate refusing to give full cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to our Saviour they fell into the darkenes, in which
we see them, and they know not (alas) <hi>whether they go:</hi>
with them, that among them beleeved, <hi>the light</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue;
and they became <hi>the Children of light.</hi> Beleeve also

and hid himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> partly by reason of the obstinate Pharisees,

avoyde the honour, which others were ready to give him
vpon the voyce speaking to him from heavaven.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Wheras he had done so many signes before them, they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not in him, yet of the Princes also many beleeved in him, but
for the Pharisees they did not confesse, that they might not be cast

in we may rightly observe, the excellencie of faith, by
which we see God, so much as the condition of this life
will give leave: and that the only way not to remaine in
darkenes is to beleeve; for though in the acts of faith
there be ever some obscuritie, there is more light, as we

which is the greate commandment in the law? Iesus sayed to
him; Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, from thy whole hart

greatest and first commandment. It is the first and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

first in dignitie, by reason of the person whom we

the law prescribeth, that is, doe by others as we would

                  <p>II. <hi>After much time the Lord of those servants came and
tooke account of them. He that received the five talents offered
other five, saying Lord, five talents thou didst deliver me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I have gayned other five besides. His Lord sayed vnto him,

if it be not well imployed, though not much in itself
(for what is an hundred yeares to Eternitie?) Yet it is
too much for them that doe so trifle it away, or misspend
it. And in fine we shall be called to account, and there is
no avoyding it. Happy are they who have their account
ready for that day which is so vncertaine; and can
shew how they increased their talents, raysing the naturall
actions of this life by vertuous application, to a value
double to that which they received by nature, and indeed
in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parably above it. And the reward is as incomparable
