            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>28 While the word was in his mouth, a
voice came from heauen, ſaying. O
King <hi>Nabuchadnezzer,</hi> to thee
be it ſpoken, thy kingdome is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from thee.</p>
                  <p>29 And they ſhal driue thee from men
and thy dwelling ſhall be with the
beaſtes of the field, they ſhall make
thee to eate graſſe with the Oxen,
and ſeuen times ſhall paſſe ouer thee,
vntill thou knoweſt that the moſt
higheſt God beareth rule ouer the
kingdomes of men, and giueth to
whomſoeuer he will.</p>
                  <p>30 The verie ſame houre was this
thing fulfilled vpon <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer,</hi>
and hee was driuen from
men, and did eate graſſe as the
<pb facs="tcp:11149:3"/>
Oxen, and his body was wet with the
dew of heauen, till his haires were
growne as Eagles fethers, and his
nayles as birdes clawes.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the 26. verſe,
to the end of this
chapter, is layde
downe the pride,
fall, and reſtitution
of <hi>Nabuchadnezzer.</hi>
The two firſt verſes are like a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his pride, which ſhewe him
in his ruffeling as it were in the
aire, before he knewe God, or him
ſelfe. The three next verſes are the
diſcouerie of his ſhame, which
ſhew him in his miſerie, as it were
groueling on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, after God
had cooled his courage. The foure
laſt verſes are the celebration of his
recouerie, which ſhew him in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
<pb facs="tcp:11149:3"/>
as it were rapt into heauen, &amp;
ſinging with the ſaints for ioy, that
God had brought him vnto his
knowledge, thogh it were through
ſhame and trouble, and loſſe of all
that he had ſeuen yeeres togither.
Of his pride we haue heard alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
yet becauſe we are friendes to
vices, as we are to men, ſo long as
they proſper and floriſh, but when
they decay and fal, then we ſhrink
away, and are aſhamed of them: ſo
it may be, if ye could ſee pride take
a fall, though yee loue her well
yet ye would forſake her, like a
banquerout, when yee ſee that ſhe
can pleaſure you no longer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye ſhall ſee Nabuchadnezzer
vpon his feete againe: before you
beheld him vppon his knees, that
when ye ſee what a king he was in
his galleries, and after find his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb facs="tcp:11149:4"/>
in his palace, and his ſubiects
in his throne, &amp; himſelf like a beaſt
in the wilderneſſe, God may giue
you heartes to thinke a little of this
ſinne, what it is which coſt ſo dere,
and is as common now in euerie
houſe, as it was then in the Kings
court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After twelue moneths</hi> (sayth Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel)
that is, twelue moneths after
GOD had warned this king by
dreames and by Daniel, to repent
his ſins, he was ſtrouting in his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,
and thought what ſin ſhould
bee next, as though hee had neuer
heard of dreame or Prophet.</p>
            <p>By this computation of ſinne,
wherein the moneths are obſerued
ſo exactly, howe long Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer
rebelled after hee was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
Daniel ſhewes what a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
God keepes of our moneths,
<pb facs="tcp:11149:4"/>
and weekes and daies, which hee
giues vs to repent, as he did to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer,
&amp; what an account
wee ſhall make of them, as Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer
did, though we count
no more of our age then the childe
doth of his youth, &amp; haue done no
more of our taſke at twentie then
when we were but ten, nor at thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
then when we were but twenty,
nor at fortie then when wee were
thirtie, yet we ſhall giue account of
mo hours in the day of iudgement,
&amp; it ſhall be heauier to the old than
to the young, to you which haue
the word, then to them which want
it: and there is great ods betweene
Nabuchadnezzer and vs, for hee
which challenged Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer
for twelue moneths ſince hee
was warned, may challenge vs of
twelue yeres ſince we wer warned,
<pb facs="tcp:11149:5"/>
and yet wee looke not for ſo great
puniſhment as fel vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer
for twelue moneths. Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
names three twelue moneths, as
though he would ſpeake of a great
matter, and ſhewes how worthie
Nabuchadnezzer was to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
becauſe he might haue refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his life ſince he was warned:
for there were twelue moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his dreams and his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But that yeare wherein hee
had ſo manie warninges and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges,
was as vaine as the reſt, and
vainer then the yeares before: for
now he ſhould haue bin a mourner
like the king of Niniuie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ionas
threatned deſtruction vnto them.</p>
            <p>But like a victor of a countrie
returned from battell, to ſolemnize
his triumph, firſt hee decked his
pallace as braue as himſelfe, and
<pb facs="tcp:11149:5"/>
then hee walkes his ſtations in it,
and when he hath ſet all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, which might make him
forget God, and hoiſt himſelfe
in pride, like a ſerpent that would
burſt vnleſſe he diſcharged ſome of
his poyſon, hee breaketh out and
ſaith, <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babel, <hi>which
I haue built by the might of my power,
for the honour of my maieſtie?</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
obſerue firſt what a glorious
opinion this vaine king had of
his vaine buildinges. Secondly,
how that hee names himſelfe the
founder of them, as though he had
done all without an helpe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that in all his workes hee ſought
nothing but vain-glorie, as he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth
againſt himſelfe, ſaying:
<hi>which I haue built for the honour of my
maieſtie,</hi> not for the honor of Gods
maieſtie, but for the honour of my
<pb facs="tcp:11149:6"/>
maieſtie. So firſt that which hee
ſhould haue contemned, as Chriſt
did the beautie of the temple, hee
admired it,<note place="margin">Math. 24 2</note> and nothing ſeemed
ſo glorious to him, as that which
made him ſhamefull to God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that Citie which was built
by <hi>Semiramis,</hi> he arrogateth to him
ſelfe, and neuer ioyned the chiefe
workemaiſter with him, but ſaith
<hi>which I haue built by the might of my
power,</hi> when hee ſhould haue ſayd,
by the might of Gods power.<note place="margin">

but in vaine.<note place="margin">Kin. 4 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, that which hee ſhould
haue builte for the honour of
God, as the man built a chamber
for the Prophet, he builded for his
own honor, as our <hi>Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi>
do. Therfore when al his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb facs="tcp:11149:6"/>
were prepared like a feaſt, and
he came to ſit downe at the banket,
it happened to him as to the churle
in the Goſpell, after hee had filled
his barnes, when hee came to ſing
in his hart, be merrie my ſoule, that
night his ſoule was taken from him
and the deuills made merrie with
it in hell: ſo hee had feathered his
neaſt, and beganne to crowe vpon
his roofe, <hi>Is not this great Babel, &amp;c.</hi>
As if hee ſhould ſaie, Now Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer,
make thee merrie,
that houre his honour was taken
from him, for a voice came downe
from heauen like the terrible hand
which wrote vpon the wall, when
Baltazar ſate at his banquet, and
daſht his pride vppon ſuch a rock,
that within an houre all his pomp
and pleaſures and treaſures, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſuch a ſhipwracke, that his
<pb facs="tcp:11149:7"/>
that his fall was more admired of
all, than his glorie and buildinges
were admired of himſelfe. Thus all
the ioy, and pleaſures, and glorie of
pride are ſpoken with a breath, and
ſtopt with another.</p>

ſpake from earth, now you ſhall
heare what the voice ſounds from
heauen. Theſe three verſes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
declare this Kinges fall, when
and how, and from whome it was.
<hi>While the wordes were yet, &amp;c.</hi> there is
the time. <hi>A voice, &amp;c.</hi> there is the
iudge. <hi>O king, &amp;c.</hi> there is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment,
<hi>Thy kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> there
is the iudgement, <hi>He was driuen from
men, &amp; liued with beaſts in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
till his haires were growen like Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles

and maner of his puniſhment. Firſt

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11149:7"/>
As Daniel obſerued the time
when Nabuchadnezzer ſinned, ſo
he obſerueth the time when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer
is puniſhed, as if
God had lien in wait to catch him
in his words, &amp; take him at the trip:
euen as hee watched Lots wife,
when ſhe looked backe,<note place="margin">Ge. 14</note> and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
her into a piller of Salte, ſo
ſoone as ſhee looked behinde. So
now the Lord laie as it were in the
ſcout, to watch when Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer
ſpake treaſon, and to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him vpon it. O <hi>Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi>
thou haſt vaunted theſe twelue
moneths, ſince I warned thee, and
I made as though I heard not, but
ſuffered thee to doe and ſpeake thy
pleaſure, and vaunteſt thou ſtill?
Surely, thou ſhalt ſcape me no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
I will not heare a worde more
againſt mine honour: ſo hee cut
<pb facs="tcp:11149:8"/>
cut him off while the wordes were
in his mouth, and propundeth the
wordes of iudgement againſt him.
If you marke the time when the
voice ſpake from heauen, you may
ſee three wiſedomes of God, firſt
God takes him in his fault, that hee
might ſee his falt,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Kin. 13 4.</note> as Ieroboam was
ſtroken when hee ſtroke the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
that he might knowe why he
was ſtroken. Then he takes him ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
becauſe hee contemneth his
warning, as the fire came vpon So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
while they contemned Lots
warning.<note place="margin">Gen. 19 24</note> Thirdly, God takes him
where he is pleaſantest, &amp; luſtiest, &amp;
ſafeſt, in his pallace, which was lyke
a caſtle, as hee tooke Herod, when
his gard ſtod by him,<note place="margin">Acts. 12. 23.</note> that he might
ſee that nothing can garde him
from God, but God muſt garde
him from danger, or elſe Princes
<pb facs="tcp:11149:8"/>
be not ſafer than ſubiects: ſo thogh
a man ſin often, and ſteale his ſins
as it were without puniſhment, yet
at the laſt he is took napping while

then iudgement ſteps foorth,
like the Angell to ſtoppe Balaam

is more terrible and greeuous
when they looke not for it (for the

therefore God will croſſe them in
that: though they proſper alwaies
<pb facs="tcp:11149:9"/>
before, yet their endes ſhall bee a
kinde of iudgement vpon all theyr
lyfe, and a propheſie of torment,
for all men to ſee what becomes of
the wicked after death, that they
may feare to bee lyke vnto them.

and cheeketh the king as boldly as

When the voice from earth ſpake
vainely, the voice from heauen
ſpake iudgement. Heere is the king
of heauen againſt the king of earth,
the voice of God againſt the voice
of man: a diuine wrath, warring
with a humane pride: the fire is
kindled, woe to the ſtubble. The
Lord of hoſts is in arms againſt the
Lord of Babel, and begins to laie
hands on him, and to thruſt him
out of his throane. Firſt hee rattles
him like a thunder, <hi>O king Nubu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer,</hi>

neuer called king with leſſe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,

Then hee pronounceth the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

to thee which wouldeſt not take

Shall not the voice ſpoken to
vs be remembred with God, aſwell
as the threatning menaced to him?</p>
            <p>This voyce came from heauen,
and therefore it ſpake home, not
like them which glide by the faults
of Princes, and whiſper behinde
their backs, as though they would
reproue them if they durſt, but for
feare leaſt the Prince, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,
or Iudge, or Magiſtrate,
ſhould take it as hee meanes it, and
think that he aimes at them, which
makes them ſpeake in parables, as
though they woulde caſt a vaile o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their reproofe, and eate their
meſſage before they haue ſpoken
it. The holy ghoſt teacheth vs here
to reproue, ſo that whoſoeuer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
may know, that thou ſpeakeſt

heauen (as this voyce did) muſt
ſpeake like Iohn Baptiſt among the

as though he went from one

this is ſpoken to thee. For vnleſſe
wee come neere this mortall Gods

<hi>To thee be it ſpoken.</hi> And then
they will reforme the matter, or
elſe God ſhewe ſome iudgement
vppon them, as hee did heere vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this great King Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer.
Nowe the decree go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
foorth, that Nabuchadnezzer
<pb facs="tcp:11149:14"/>
ſhall be king no more. <hi>Thy kingdom
is departed from thee.</hi> This is ſuch a
ſaying, as if <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> had
thought of it before, hee woulde
haue wept when hee vaunted, to
thinke that his honour was going
from him, when he thought it was
comming to him: yet his kingdom
was not departed from him, &amp; yet
God ſayth, <hi>Thy kingdome is departed
from thee,</hi> becauſe thy decree was
paſt, which ſhoulde as ſurely come
to paſſe, as if it were paſt alreadie,
Therefore becauſe we care not ſo
long as the Prophet ſaith, we ſhall
die, we ſhall ſuffer, we ſhal anſwer,
he leaueth <hi>Shall,</hi> and ſayth <hi>Now,</hi> as
God ſayd to Abimelec: <hi>Thou art a
dead man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ene. 20 3</note> not <hi>thou ſhalt die,</hi> but <hi>thou
art dead,</hi> which rouſed him more,
then if hee had threatned him an
hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred deaths, becauſe he thought
<pb facs="tcp:11149:14"/>
that he ſhould die preſently: ſo the
holy Ghoſt is forced as it were to
exceede, and ſpeake more than we
thinke hee ſhoulde ſpeake, for the
hardnes of our hearts, which heare
like ſtones, and go like ſnails. If we
haue but a weeke to repent, we will
defer it to the laſt day, that we may
ſinne all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore it was meete to ſay,
<hi>Thy kingdome is departed from thee.</hi>
That ſeeing his iudgement ſhould
not ſtay, hee ſhould not ſtay his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
If this voice had ſaide,
<hi>Thy Babell ſhall ſinck,</hi> as Nemrods
Babel did, it ſeemeth hee woulde
haue thought his honour buried,
but when he was ſtript, not only of
his pallace, but alſo of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
what heauy newes was this
vnto him, which thought himſelfe
equal with God, and now may not
<pb facs="tcp:11149:15"/>
be a king. But when hee was thruſt
among beaſts to eat graſſe with ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
what a downfull was this to be
brought vnder all his ſubiectes,
which ſpake euen nowe as though
there none but he: and now his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes
ſeruant would not be like
vnto him? So the king of kings wil
be honoured of kinges, as they are
of their ſubiects, or els he wil tread
vpon their crownes, and they ſhall
heare the ſame at laſt, <hi>Thy kingdome
ſhall depart from thee.</hi> Now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the execution of this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for Daniel ſaith, <hi>The ſame
houre all this was fulfilled.</hi> So he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the order of it: as a priſoner is
brought to the barre, and lead to
gybbet, ſo this king was drawne
from his throne, and turned into
the wilderneſſe, where hee abode
among wilde beaſtes ſo long, <hi>Till
<pb facs="tcp:11149:15"/>
his haires were growne like Eagles
feathers, and his nayles like Birdes
clawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God began, hee made
haſte, it was long before hee ſpoke,
but when he ſpoke, hee did it, and
effected in an houre all that the
dreame, and the Prophet had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.
Then was fulfilled, <hi>The pride
of man ſhall bring him low:</hi> Euen in
that houre that Nabuchadnezzer
aduanced himſelfe more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in the ſame houre hee was
brought vnder al his ſubiects, al his
ſeruantes and pages: ſo hee which
ſetteth vp can pull down, he which
gaue can take, he which made can
deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Therefore let no man vaunt
though he were a king of his houſe
or land, or farme or children, but
knowe that he ſhoulde haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb facs="tcp:11149:16"/>
if God did not regarde him
more than other: and thinke when
thou doeſt reade this ſtorie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou be not as proude of thy
welth, as Nabuchad. was of his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace:
whether thou be not as proud
of thy children, as Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer
was of his kingdome: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou bee not as proude of thy
parentage, as Nabuchadnezzer
was of his honour: whether thou
be not ſo proud of thy learning, as
<hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> was of his traine.
If thou be not ſo proud, then God
doth ſay no more, <hi>O king, to thee be
it ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> O ſubiect to thee be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<hi>theſe bleſsings ſhall be taken from
thee,</hi> For, hath God taken no mans
kingdome from him but Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzers?
Hath hee taken no
mans office from him but Iudas?
hath he taken no mans riches from
<pb facs="tcp:11149:16"/>
him but Iobs? how did Antiochus
and Iulian, and Herod, and Saul,
and Athalia, and Iezabel, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
the third goe from theyr
thrones, as if God had pulled them
out by the eares: he had no reſpect
vnto their perſons, but vſed them
like beaſts, as hee did Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer,
&amp; fulfilled his threatning.
The candle of the wicked ſhall be
put out. Therefore as Chriſt ſaith
vnto them which turne backe, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>Lots</hi> wife: ſo I ſay to them
which beare high minds, &amp; proud
lookes, and ſtout wordes, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
king Nabuchadnezzer, howe
God reſiſteth the proud. Now if
anie man long to be reſolued, how
this king was changed to a beaſt,
he muſt not imagine anie ſtrange
metamorphoſis, or popiſh tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
as though his ſhape
<pb facs="tcp:11149:17"/>
were altered, or his manhoode re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued,
or that he put on hornes &amp;
hoofe, as the Poets faine of Acte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the voice doth not ſaie that
he ſhould become a beaſt, but that
he ſhould dwell with the beaſtes.
Daniel doth not ſaie that his head
or arms, or legs were tranſformed,
but that the haire of his head &amp; the
nailes of his fingers did grow lyke
Eagles feathers, &amp; like birds claws,
as euerie mans haire and nayls wil
if he do not pare them. Laſtly, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer
ſayth not, that his
ſhape was reſtored vnto him, but
that his vnderſtanding was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto him: all which declare
that he was not changed in bodie,
but in minde: not in ſhape, but in
qualitie. A ſauage minde came on
him,<note place="margin">Genes. 4 12</note> like that which droue Caine
from the companie of men, and he
<pb facs="tcp:11149:17"/>
became like a Satire or wild man,
which differeth not from a beaſt
but in ſhape: though hee was not
tourned to a beaſt, yet this was a
ſtrange alteration, to bee ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in an houre, that his nobles
abhorred him, his ſubiects deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him, his ſeruants forſooke him,
none woulde companie with him
but the beaſts. Conſider this all
that aduaunce themſelues agaynſt
God and deſpiſe his word, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer
did. Take warning
by a king, which euen now walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his galleries, and his nobles
ſerued him in his pallace, with all
diſhes that the aire, or ſea, or lande
could affoord: now he is turned to
graſe and feede like an oxe with
the beaſts in the wilderneſſe. This
was to ſhew that God maketh no
more account of the wicked then
<pb facs="tcp:11149:18"/>
of beaſtes, and therefore the holie
Ghoſt calleth them often by the
name of beaſts: ſhewing how that
ſinne and pleaſure make men lyke
beaſts, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue abuſed their
wits often, and peruerted their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
at laſt God taketh their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
from them, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
like beaſtes, loathſome to
themſelues and others: many ſuch
beaſts we haue ſtil like Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer,
who were fitter to liue in
the deſart among lions, wher they
might not annoy others, then in
townes amongſt men, where they
infect more then the plague. Thus
