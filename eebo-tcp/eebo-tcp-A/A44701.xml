            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A View of the late CONSIDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATIONS
addrest to H. H.
about the TRINITY.</head>
            <p>YOU see, Sir, I make no haste to
tell you my Thoughts of what
hath been publish'd since my
last to you, against my Sentiments
touching the H. Trinity. I saw the
Matter less required my Time and
Thoughts, than my other Affairs: And
so little, that I was almost indifferent
whether I took any notice thereof or
no. There is really nothing of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in what I have seen, but what I
had suggested before, and objected to
my self, in <hi>those very Discourses</hi> of mine,
now animadverted on; which not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
prevented, with me, the Opinion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107349:3"/>
I am of, can as little alter it, and should
as little any Man's else.</p>
            <p>But a little leasure, as it can, without
extortion, be gained from <hi>other occasions,</hi>
I do not much grudg to bestow on
<hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find my self concern'd in the <hi>late
Considerations</hi> on the Explications of the
Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi>—in a Letter to
<hi>H. H.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author is pleas'd to give me the
honour of a Name, a lank, unvocal
one. It is so contrived, that one may
easily guess whom he means; but the
reason of his doing so I cannot guess.
Is it because he knew <hi>himself,</hi> what he
would have others believe?</p>
            <p>But I suppose he as well knew his
<hi>own Name.</hi> If he knew not the former,
he ran the hazard of injuring either the
supposed Author, or the true, or both.
I could, I believe, make as shrewd a
guess at <hi>his Name,</hi> and express it as
plainly. But I think it not civil to do
so; because I apprehend he hath some
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107349:3"/>
reason to conceal it, whereof I think he
hath a Right to be the Judg. But I
will not prescribe to him Rules of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
of which that he is a great Judg, I
will not allow my self to doubt.</p>
            <p>Yet I will not suppose him to have so
very diminishing Thoughts of <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
as not to acknowledg and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the Authority of that <hi>great Rule of
his,</hi> which he knows gain'd Reverence
with some who called not themselves
Christians, <hi>[Whatsoever you would that Men
should do to you</hi>—&amp;c.] Nor can divine
what greater reason he should have to
hide his own Name, than to expose
mine, or make the Person he indigitates,
be thought the Author of the Discourse
he intended to expose. Since no Man
can imagine how, as the <hi>Christian World</hi>
is constituted, any one can be more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
for denying <hi>three Persons,</hi> than
for asserting <hi>three Gods:</hi> Which latter
his impotent attempt aims to make <hi>that
Author</hi> do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:107349:4"/>
               <hi>For his Censures</hi> of <hi>that Author's</hi> stile,
and difficulty to be understood, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
me not. But so I have known
some pretend Deafness, to what they
were unwilling to hear. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
one place <hi>Sob. Enq. p.</hi> 24. in the
end of <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. where <hi>must</hi> should have
been left out, upon the adding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of <hi>can;</hi> that might give one
some trouble. In which yet, the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of a (not unusual) <hi>Asyndeton,</hi> would,
without the help of Magick, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
a considering Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for his Complements,</hi> as they do me
no real good, so, I thank God, they
hurt me not. I dwell at Home, and
better know my own Furniture, than
another can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For himself,</hi> I discern, and readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
in him, those excellent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments,
for which I most hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
wish him an Advocate in a better
Cause, without Despair he will yet
prove so; when I take notice of some
Passages which look like Indications of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107349:4"/>
a serious temper of Mind, as of <hi>choosing
God, and the honour of his Name, for our
Portion and Design;</hi> and <hi>that he lives in vain,
who knows not his Maker, and his God,</hi> with
the like.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, I was as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
sorry to meet with an expression of
so different a strain, on so awful a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
of <hi>making a Coat for the Moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Precept which <hi>Josephus</hi> inserts
among those given the
<hi>Jews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Lib. 4. Jud. Antiq.</note> doth for the reason
it hath in it, abstracting
from its Authority, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be considered. It
seems to import a decency to the rest of
Mankind, whose notions of a Deity did
not argue them sunk into the lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Sottishness and Stupidity.
Good Sir, what needed (think you) so
adventurous Boldness, in so lubricous a
Case! It gains nothing to a Man's Cause
either of Strength or Reputation with
wise and good Men. A sound Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be as sound without it. Nor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107349:5"/>
should I much value having them on
my side, whom I can hope to make
laugh at so hazardous a Jest. I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
indeed have any great Veneration
for a morose Sourness, whatsoever affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
appearance it may have with it, of
a simulated Sanctimony or Religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but I should think it no hardship
upon me to repress that Levity, as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
dancing upon the brink of so tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
a Precipice. And would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
express my self with suspicion,
and a supposed possibility of being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
in a case wherein I find many of
noted Judgment and Integrity, in the
succession of several Ages, differing from
me.</p>
            <p>But go we on to the Cause it self,
where he pretends,</p>
            <p>1. First to give a View of the Sober
Enquirer's Hypothesis.</p>
            <p>2. And then to argue against it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the former.</hi> He doth it, I am
loth to say, with less fairness than from
a Person of his (otherwise) appearing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107349:5"/>
Ingenuity, one would expect. For he
really makes me to have <hi>said more than I
ever did,</hi> in divers Instances; and <hi>much
less</hi> than I have expresly said; and that
he cannot have so little understanding as
not to know was most material to the
Cause in hand.</p>
            <p>He represents me <hi>p. 40. col. 1. saying</hi>
the Persons <hi>are distinct Essences, numerical
Natures, Beings, Substances;</hi> and <hi>col. 2.
That I hold them to be three Spirits;</hi> when
in the close of one of those Paragraphs,
viz. <hi>Calm Discourse, p.</hi> 112, 113. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the Words of <hi>W. J.</hi> 
               <q>In the Unity
of the Godhead there must be no
plurality or multiplicity of Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
allowed:</q> And do add, <hi>nor do I
say</hi> that there must. And <hi>p.</hi> 39, 40.
<q>I do not positively say there are three
distinct Substances, Minds, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</q>
I would ask this my learned
Antagonist, have <hi>saying,</hi> and <hi>not saying,</hi>
the same signification? And again,
when <hi>Calm Discourse,</hi> p. 123. my words
are, <hi>I will not use the Expressions,</hi> as signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107349:6"/>
my formed Judgment, <hi>That there
are three Things, Substances or Spirits in the
Godhead;</hi> how could he say, <hi>I hold the
three Persons to be three Spirits?</hi> Is any
Man, according to the ordinary way of
speaking, said <hi>to hold</hi> what is not his
<hi>formed Judgment?</hi> If he only <hi>propose</hi>
things whereof he doubts, to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and discust by others, <hi>in order to</hi>
the forming of it, and by gentle venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to sift out Truth, it the rather ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
him not to <hi>hold</hi> this or that.</p>
            <p>And I think much Service might be
done to the <hi>common Interest of Religion,</hi>
by such a free mutual Communication
of even more doubtful Thoughts, if
such Disquisitions were pursu'd with
more Candour, and with less Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and prepossession of Mind, or
addictedness to the Interest of any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
whatsoever. If it were rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured,
to reason one another into,
or out of, this or that Opinion, than
either by Sophistical Collusions to cheat,
or to Hector by great words, one that is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107349:6"/>
not of my mind. Or if the Design
were less to expose an Adversary, than
to clear the matter in Controversy.</p>
            <p>Besides, that if such Equanimity did
more generally appear, and govern, in
Transactions of this nature, it would
produce a greater liberty in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
our Thoughts, about some of the
more vogued and fashionable Opinions,
by exempting each other from the fear
of ill Treatment, <hi>in the most sensible kind.</hi>
It being too manifest, that the same
confident insulting <hi>Genius,</hi> which makes
a Man think himself competent to be a
Standard to Mankind, would also make
him impatient of dissent, and tempt
him to do worse, than reproach one
that differs from him, if it were in his
power. And the Club or Fagot-Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
must be expected to take place,
where what <hi>he thinks</hi> rational ones, did
not do the business. This only on the
by.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>that there is a Trinity
in the Godhead,</hi> is no matter of doubt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107349:7"/>
with me; but only whether <hi>this</hi> be the
<hi>best way</hi> of explaining and defending it.
If <hi>this be</hi> not the <hi>best,</hi> or <hi>sufficient,</hi> some
other will, I believe, or hath been found
out by some other. Of which I have
spoken my sense not only indefinitely,
<hi>Calm Disc. p.</hi> 81. but particularly of the
more common way; not that I did then,
or have yet thought it <hi>the best,</hi> but <hi>not
indefensible,</hi> p. 73, 74.</p>
            <p>And I must now sincerely profess,
That the perusal of <hi>these very Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
gives me more confidence about <hi>this
Hypothesis,</hi> than I allowed my self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
finding that the <hi>very sagacious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
of them, of whose Abilities and
Industry together, I really have that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
as to count him the most likely
to confute it of all the <hi>modern Antitrinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
hath no other way to deal with it,
than first, both <hi>partially</hi> and <hi>invidiously</hi> to
represent it; and then, rather to <hi>trifle</hi>
than <hi>argue</hi> against it. He first paints it
out in <hi>false</hi> and <hi>ugly Colours,</hi> before he
comes to <hi>reasoning.</hi> And then, when
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107349:7"/>
he <hi>should reason,</hi> he says nothing that hath
so much as a <hi>colour.</hi> It seems to me an
Argument of a suspected ill Cause on his
side, that he thought it needful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess
the Reader with the imagination
of I know not (and I believe he knows
not) what <hi>gross Ideas,</hi> as he romances,
belonging to this <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> Because
from those words, Prov. 8. <hi>Then was I
by him, as one brought up with him, and daily
his Delight;</hi> the Author speaks of the
<hi>delicious Society,</hi> which these words inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
the <hi>Eternal Wisdom,</hi> and the <hi>prime
Author and Parent of all things,</hi> to have each
with other.</p>
            <p>For my part, I have little doubt but
this ingenious Writer is so well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the gust and relish of intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Delight, that he chose to expose
his Adversary by using that odd Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>gross Ideas</hi> so causlesly, in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
only to the <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>some other
Men,</hi> whom he thought fit to humour,
rather <hi>than his own.</hi> Nor can he be so
little acquainted with the <hi>Paganish Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:107349:8"/>
as not to apprehend a <hi>vast disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
between <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> and a <hi>much
greater Agreement</hi> between the <hi>Paganish
Notion</hi> of the Deity, and <hi>his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>the Questions</hi> which he supposes me
to put, and makes me answer as he
thinks fit, by (misapplied) Passages of
that Discourse, I hope it will appear
they were either prevented, or answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at another rate.</p>
            <p>At length he says, The <hi>Butt-end of
this Hypothesis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I like not <hi>that Phrase</hi> the worse for the
<hi>Author's</hi> sake, of whom it seems bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
whose Memory greater things
will make live, when we are forgot.</p>
            <p>But let him proceed—<hi>The Butt-end of
this Hypothesis is the true strength of it.</hi> But
that <hi>true strength</hi> he hath either had <hi>the
hap</hi> not to observe, or taken <hi>the care</hi> not
to represent, <hi>i. e.</hi> from what is so often
inculcated <hi>in that Discourse, the necessary
existence of two Hypostases of and in the first,</hi>
and of <hi>an omnimodous simplicity</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
supposed in the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107349:8"/>
hath kept himself at a wary cautious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
when he might apprehend <hi>there
was its strength.</hi> Therefore I cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
but observe, that as he hath <hi>mark'd</hi>
this Hypothesis, with (most undue) <hi>ill
Characters;</hi> so he hath <hi>maimed</hi> it too, of
what was most considerable belonging
to it, that he might expose it <hi>by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
means,</hi> so as to make it need <hi>much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;</hi>
and that <hi>by the latter,</hi> it might
seem quite destitute of any defence at
all.</p>
            <p>And now when (not without some
untoward Disfigurations) it hath thus
far 'scap'd his hands, and is (in none of
the best shapes) set up only to be beaten
down; The <hi>Argument</hi> he first attacks it
with is the <hi>inartificial one</hi> of <hi>Authority.</hi>
And yet his Argument from <hi>this Topick,</hi>
is only negative, that <hi>the Opinion</hi> he would
confute <hi>wants Authority,</hi> 
               <q>That <hi>the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer</hi>
was the <hi>first that ever dreamt of
it.</hi> And that no learned Divine
of any Perswasion will subscribe to
it:</q> 
               <hi>q. d.</hi> 'Tis false, and <hi>impossible to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107349:9"/>
be true;</hi> the <hi>Enquirer</hi> only proposing
what he offer'd, <hi>as possible for ought we
know,</hi> is not otherwise oppos'd than by
asserting it to be impossible. This
therefore he must say, or he saith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpose; And why now is
it impossible? <hi>Because no Body said it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
So, then, was every thing that any
Man <hi>first said;</hi> but afterwards, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
often spoken, it might, it seems,
at length become true!</p>
            <p>For any <hi>learned Divines subscribing to
it,</hi> I suppose he intends <hi>that</hi> in the <hi>strict
sense.</hi> And so the <hi>Enquirer</hi> never said
he would subscribe it himself, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than that his Judgment did
more incline to it, as liable to <hi>less
exception</hi> than <hi>other ways of defending the
Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> or than denying
it, which he thought <hi>least defensible of
all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now supposing one should find
<hi>learned Divines</hi> of the same Mind, (and
perhaps some may be found more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
than he) I would ask the <hi>Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:107349:9"/>
whether he will therefore confess
a <hi>Trinity</hi> a possible thing?</p>
            <p>If not, he deals not fairly, to put
the <hi>Enquirer</hi> upon quoting Authorities
to no purpose: Or that he would have
<hi>them</hi> conclude him, by whom he will
not be concluded himself.</p>
            <p>He seems indeed himself to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the Question (with which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he charges the <hi>Enquirer)</hi> as it is set
down <hi>Sober Enquiry p.</hi> 1. Whether <hi>a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
in the Godhead be a <hi>possible thing?</hi>
This was the Question, not what <hi>John,</hi>
or <hi>Thomas,</hi> or <hi>James such a One</hi> thought?</p>
            <p>But while he pretends to think no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
else is of <hi>the Enquirer's</hi> Mind in the
particular point he is now speaking to,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Delicious Society</hi> the <hi>Divine Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases</hi>
are supposed to have with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
give me leave freely to discourse
this matter. I would fain know what
it is, wherein he supposes <hi>the Enquirer</hi> to
have overshot his Mark: Or of what
makes he here so mighty a Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:107349:10"/>
It can be but one of these two things:</p>
            <p>Either that there are three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the Godhead really distinct;
Or,</p>
            <p>That they have (if there be) a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Society or Conversation with each
other.</p>
            <p>Will he say <hi>the former</hi> is a singular O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion?
Or that 'tis Novel? Was there
never a <hi>real Trinitarian</hi> in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Doth he not, in his own express
words, sort <hi>the Enquirer</hi> with one, whom
he will not deny to be a <hi>learned Divine,
p.</hi> 43. of these his <hi>present Considerations,</hi>
col. 1. <hi>[The Author of the 28 Propositions,
and Mr.</hi> H—w, as he calls the Enquirer,
<hi>are honest Men, and real Trinitarians.]</hi> By
which former Character he hath, I dare
say, ten thousand times more gratify'd
his Ambition, than by calling him <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
too. And I believe he will as little
think this a <hi>novel Opinion,</hi> as a <hi>singular</hi>
one.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I thank him for acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
it to have been the Opinion of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107349:10"/>
the Fathers, generally, not only <hi>Ante-Nicene</hi>
and <hi>Nicene,</hi> but <hi>Post-Nicene</hi> too,
for some following Ages, unto that of
<hi>P. Lombard,</hi> so obvious it is to every
one that will but more slightly search.</p>
            <p>For my part, I will not except <hi>Justin
Martyr</hi> himself, whom I the rather menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both as he was one of the more <hi>antient</hi>
of the Fathers; and as I may also call him,
the <hi>Father of the Modalists;</hi>

Notion</hi> even about the <hi>Homoou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian-Trinity,</hi>
as he expresly stiles it.</p>
            <p>For tho it will require more time than
I now intend to bestow, to give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
account of every Passage through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that Discourse of his, yet his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> must not be
so taken, as if it were to be torn away
from its coherence, and from it self.
When therefore he says the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the being unbegot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
begotten, and having proceeded,
are not Names of the Essence, but
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) Modes of Subsistence;
he must mean they are not <hi>immediately</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:107349:11"/>
Names of the Essence, but <hi>mediately</hi> they
cannot but be so. For what do they
modify? Not nothing. When they are
said to be Modes of Subsistence, what
is it that subsists? We cannot pluck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
these Modes of Subsistence from
that which subsists, and whereof they
are the Modes. And what is that?
You'll say the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>one Essence,</hi>
which he had mentioned before; and
that <hi>one Essence</hi> is, 'tis true, as perfectly
one, as 'tis possible; for <hi>what is of it self,</hi>
and <hi>what are from that,</hi> to be with <hi>each
other, i. e.</hi> that they are <hi>congenerous,</hi> as the
Sun and its Rays (according to that
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

there is nothing else but Substance) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial
Thought</hi> or <hi>Word.</hi> Therefore
this <hi>Oneness of Essence</hi> must be taken in so
large and extensive a sense, as that it
may admit of <hi>these Differences.</hi> For so
he afterwards plainly speaks, <q>if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
<hi>If the one</hi> (the Father)
hath his Existence without being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>another</hi> (the Son)
by <hi>being begotten,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but
<hi>that</hi> (the Holy Ghost) <hi>by having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
here it befals us to behold differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) or the things that
import difference.</q> There must be <hi>a
sense,</hi> therefore, wherein he understood
<hi>this Essence</hi> to be <hi>most truly One;</hi> and <hi>a
sense</hi> wherein he also understood it to
<hi>have</hi> its <hi>differences,</hi> and those too not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>important
ones, as <hi>being unbegotten,</hi> and
<hi>being begotten,</hi> signify no light diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
            <p>And in what latitude of sense he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the <hi>Oneness of Essence,</hi> whereof
he had before spoken, may be seen in
his following Explication, when what
he said he would have be (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) more
manifest; he makes <hi>Adam</hi>'s peculiar <hi>Mode</hi>
of <hi>Subsistence</hi> to be that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>not begotten,</hi> but <hi>made</hi> by
God's own Hand; but <hi>for them that were
from him,</hi> he intimates <hi>theirs</hi> to be, that
they were <hi>begotten,</hi> not <hi>made.</hi> If then you
enquire concerning the <hi>same Essence</hi> that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107349:12"/>
was common to <hi>him</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> you still
find that <hi>Man</hi> is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
whether of <hi>formation,</hi> as to <hi>him,</hi> or
of <hi>generation,</hi> as <hi>to them.</hi> And who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
not in what latitude of sense
the <hi>humane Nature</hi> is <hi>One,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to <hi>Adam,</hi> and his <hi>Posterity?</hi> Tho
the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is incomparably <hi>more
One,</hi> which is common to the <hi>Father,
Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> as we have formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
and shall further shew it cannot
but be, in all <hi>necessary,</hi> and <hi>continually-depending
Emanations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet I might, if there were need, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
(as to this part) quote the</hi> Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
<hi>to</hi> himself. <hi>For I suppose he will
not disown the</hi> Considerations <hi>in 1693. in
which,</hi> pag. 15. col. 1. <hi>are these words,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> by a great number of very
pertinent and Home-quotations, hath proved
that his Explication (I mean that part of it
which makes the three Persons to be so many
distinct Essences, or Substances) is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Principal, if not of all the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
as well as of the <hi>Platonists. And
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107349:12"/>
'tis added,</hi> and I (for my own part) do
grant it.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole then, I reckon that
as to this <hi>first part,</hi> we stand clear not
only to the rest of the World, but with
<hi>this Author</hi> himself, that to be a <hi>real Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarian</hi>
is not so unheard-of a thing, or
what no learned Divine of any Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
ever dreamt of before the <hi>Enquirer.</hi>
But now for the</p>
            <p>Second Part. <hi>The Delicious Society sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be between</hi> (or rather among) <hi>the
three Persons.</hi> Is this a Dream! And so
strange a One! Why, good Sir! Can
you suppose <hi>three Persons,</hi> i. e. <hi>three intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Subsistences,</hi> perfectly Wise, Holy,
and Good, co-existing with, inexisting
in one another, to have no Society? Or
that Society not to be delicious? He
says, How can it be? I say, how can
it but be? Herein I am sure <hi>the Enquirer</hi>
hath far more Company than <hi>in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
For whether the <hi>three Persons</hi> have
all the same <hi>numerical Essence,</hi> or <hi>three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct;</hi>
all agree they most delightfully
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107349:13"/>
converse. Will he pretend never to
have read any that make <hi>Love</hi> (as it were
intercurrent between the <hi>two first)</hi> the
Character of the <hi>third?</hi> In short; Is it
<hi>the Thing</hi> he quarrels with as singular, or
<hi>the Word?</hi> At <hi>the Thing,</hi> supposing <hi>three
Persons,</hi> he can have no Quarrel, without
quarreling with the common Sense of
Mankind. For the Word, he hath more
wit and knowledg of Language than to
pretend to find fault with that. For let
him but consult Expositors (even the
known Criticks) upon the mentioned
place <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. (whom, in so plain a
case, I will not be at the pains to quote
and transcribe) and take notice whether
none read those words, <hi>fui in deliciis.</hi>
Therefore I believe <hi>the Considerator</hi> will
be so ingenuous, as to perceive, he hath,
in this part of his Discourse, grosly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vershot,
or undershot, or shot wide of
his own Mark, if indeed he had any,
or did not (letting his Bolt fly too soon)
shoot at Rovers, before he had taken
steady aim at any thing. In short, all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107349:13"/>
this Dust could be rais'd but with design
only, because he could not <hi>enlighten</hi> his
Readers, to <hi>blind</hi> them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now when he should come by
solid Argument to disprove the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
by</hi> shewing that three individual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Natures, or Essences, can possibly have no
Nexus, so as to become one entire Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and, at the same time, (which this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
supposes) remain still three individual
Divine Natures and Essences, <hi>he thinks fit
to leave it to another to do it for him,
who, he says,</hi> if he cannot prove this, can
prove nothing. <hi>And when we see that
Proof, it will be time enough to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time I cannot here but
note what I will neither, in Charity, call
Forgery in the <hi>Considerator,</hi> nor, in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
Ignorance, but it cannot be less
than great Oversight; his talk of <hi>these
Three,</hi> so united as to <hi>become One:</hi> the
Enquirer never spake (nor <hi>dreamt)</hi> of
their <hi>becoming One,</hi> but of their being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
necessarily, and eternally so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:107349:14"/>
Then he comes to put the Question,
as (he says) it is <hi>between</hi> the <hi>Enquirer</hi> and
the <hi>Socinians.</hi> And he puts it thus, <hi>How
three distinct, several, individual, Divine
Beings, Essences, or Substances, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
three several individual Substances, and
yet, at the same time, be united into One Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Substance called God?</hi> One would
have thought, when he had so newly
wav'd the <hi>former Question,</hi> as wherein he
meant not to be concern'd, he should
presently have put a <hi>new One,</hi> upon
which he intended to engage himself.
But we have <hi>the same</hi> over again, even
with the same <hi>ill look</hi> of an equivalent
Phrase unto <hi>[becoming] [united] into One,</hi>
to insinuate to his Reader, as if his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist
thought these Three were <hi>de novo
united,</hi> not <hi>in,</hi> but <hi>into One.</hi> Which he
knew must have a harsh sound, and as
well knew it to be most repugnant to the
<hi>Enquirer's</hi> most declared Sentiment. Nor
will it be any presumption, if I take
the liberty to set down the Question
according to the <hi>Enquirer's Mind,</hi> who
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107349:14"/>
have as much reason to know it, as <hi>he;</hi>
and I am sure it will be more agreeable
to the tenour of his Discourse now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to, <hi>Whether the</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>or the Divine
Being, may not possibly, for ought we know,
contain three Natures, or Essences, under the
Names of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, so
far distinct, as is necessary to found the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Predications or Attributions severally
given them in the Holy Scriptures, and yet be
eternally, necessarily, naturally, vitally so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as notwithstanding that remaining distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to be One God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let us now see what he hath to
say;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> To the Enquirer's Illustrations
of it, <hi>as possible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What he brings to <hi>prove</hi> it
<hi>impossible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the former part.</hi> He first falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what <hi>the Enquirer</hi> had said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>vegetative, sensitive,</hi> and <hi>intellective
Natures</hi> in our selves. And upon this he
insists so operously, as if the whole
weight of the Cause had been laid upon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107349:15"/>
it, and seems to think the <hi>Enquirer</hi> had
forgot the Question, when he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it; because he says, those are only
<hi>distinct Faculties,</hi> not <hi>Persons,</hi> or <hi>Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
(tho <hi>Persons</hi> were not in his Question)
without ever taking any notice of the
Enquirers waving it, with these words,
<hi>That he would content himself with what was
more obvious.</hi> But this is is <hi>all Art.</hi> To
raise a <hi>mighty posse,</hi> and labour to seem to
those that he believed would read what
he writ only, not what the other did,
most effectually to expugne what he saw
was neglected, tho not altogether use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
as we shall see anon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the mean time, it is observable
how needlesly he slurs himself in this his
first brisk Onset. He says,</hi> No Man ever
pretended—That the vegetative, sensitive,
and intellective Faculties (or Powers) are so
many distinct, individual Persons, Substances,
or Essences, we grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What did no Man ever pretend that
<hi>these three distinct Natures,</hi> the <hi>vegetative,
sensitive, intellective,</hi> were, in Man, three
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107349:15"/>
distinct <hi>Substances,</hi> or <hi>Souls,</hi> concurring
by a certain subordination in him? What
necessity was there, that to heighten his
Triumph, in the Opinion of his credulous
Followers, he should, with so glorious
a Confidence, put on the vain and false
shew of having all the World on his
side; and herein either dissemble his
Knowledge, or grosly bewray his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the meer <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
And most imprudently suppose all his
Readers as ignorant, as he would seem!
What, did he never hear of an <hi>Averroist</hi>
in the World? Doth he not know that
<hi>Physician</hi> and <hi>Philosopher,</hi> and his <hi>Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
earnestly contended for what he
says no Man ever pretended to? Or that
divers <hi>other Commentators</hi> upon <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
have some abetted, others as vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppos'd them in it? Not to insist al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that some thought the <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi>
and <hi>Patiens</hi> to be <hi>distinct Substances,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Nature of Man, as others
had also other Conceits about the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?
And if he look <hi>some hundreds of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107349:16"/>
Years</hi> back, as far as the time, and extant
Work of <hi>Nemesius, Bishop</hi> and <hi>Philosopher</hi>
(as he writes himself) <hi>of the Nature
of Man,</hi> (who liv'd in the Time of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
Nazianzen,</hi> as appears by an <hi>Epistle</hi>
of his writ to him, and prefixt to that
little Book of his) he will find <hi>that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
takes notice there were divers that
took Man to consist of <hi>Mind, Soul,</hi> and
<hi>Body,</hi> and that some did doubt <hi>whether
the Mind super vening to the
Soul,</hi>

And in several
other parts of that Work
(easy, if it were necessary to be recited)
he speaks it as the Judgment of some,
<hi>That the unreasonable Nature

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:107349:16"/>
And he carries us yet much farther

            <p>It matters not whether this Opinion
be true or false, but a great mistake (or
misrepresentation) it was, to say no Man
ever pretended to it.</p>
            <p>And be that as it will; if all the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
will suspend their Judgments, <hi>That a
Trinity in the Godhead is impossible,</hi> till the
<hi>Considerator</hi> shall have prov'd, by plain
demonstration, the concurrence of three
such <hi>Spirits</hi> (a <hi>vegetative, sensitive,</hi> and
<hi>intellective)</hi> vitally united <hi>in the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Man,</hi> is a thing <hi>simply impossible,</hi> I
believe he will not in haste, have many
Proselytes.</p>
            <p>I, for my part, as his own Eyes
might have told him, laid no stress up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; but only mentioned it <hi>in transitu,</hi>
as I was going on to what is obvious,
and in view to every Man, <hi>the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
our Soul and Body.</hi> Nor was I sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107349:17"/>
to find <hi>this</hi> an <hi>exact Parallel,</hi> as he
fancies I was obliged to do. What if
there be no exact Parallel? Will any
Man of a sober Mind, or that is Master
of his own Thoughts, conclude every
thing impossible <hi>in the uncreated Being,</hi>
whereof there is not an exact parallel <hi>in
the Creation?</hi> If any Man will stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, come make an Argument of
it, let us see it in form, and try its
strength. <hi>[Whatsoever hath not its exact
parallel in the Creation, is impossible in God,]</hi>
&amp;c. He will sooner prove himself ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
than prove his Point by such
a <hi>Medium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis enough for a sober Man's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
in such a case as we are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
if we find such things actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are (or might as easily be, as what
we see actually is) among the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that are <hi>of as difficult conception, and
explication,</hi> as what appears represented
in the <hi>Enquirers Hypothesis</hi> concerning a
Trinity. 'Tis trifling to attempt to
give, or to ask a parallel exact <hi>per omnia.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:107349:17"/>
It abundantly serves any reasonable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
if there be a parallel <hi>quoad hoc,</hi>
viz. <hi>in respect of the facility or difficulty of
Conception.</hi> And tho the <hi>vegetative, sensitive,</hi>
and <hi>intellective</hi> Natures be not so many
distinct Substances, a Trinity is not less
conceivable in the Divine Being, than
three such Natures, or natural Powers,
in the One humane Nature.</p>
            <p>And whoever they be that will not
<hi>simplify the Divine Being into nothing</hi> (as
the Excellent <hi>Author</hi> of the 28 Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
speaks) must also acknowledg the
most real Perfections in the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
tho not univocal, but infinitely
transcendent to any thing in us. And
are they no way distinct? Let any sober
Understanding judg, will the <hi>same No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
agree to them all? Is his <hi>Knowledg,</hi>
throughout, the same with his <hi>effective
Power?</hi> Then he must <hi>make himself.</hi> For
who can doubt he <hi>knows himself?</hi> And is
<hi>his Will</hi> the self-same undistinguishable
Perfection, in him, with <hi>his Knowledg?</hi>
Then the <hi>Purposes of his Will</hi> must be to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107349:18"/>
effect all that he can. For doth he not
know all that he can do? And the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencies
of his Will</hi> must be as much in
what is <hi>evil,</hi> as <hi>good,</hi> even in the most
odious turpitude of the vilest, and most
immoral Evils! For he knows both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
I know what is commonly said
of <hi>extrinsecal Denominations:</hi> But are such
Denominations true, or false? Have
they any thing <hi>in re</hi> correspondent to
them, or have they not? Then <hi>some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi>
there must be of <hi>these Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
themselves. If so, how are they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisht?</p>
            <p>And there appears great reason, <hi>from
God's own Word,</hi> to conceive greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of the <hi>three Hypostases</hi> in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than of the <hi>Attributes</hi> which are
common to them, as is said, <hi>Sob. Enq.
pag.</hi> 140. In reference whereto, it is
not improper or impertinent to mention
such Differences, as we find <hi>in our own
Being,</hi> tho they be not <hi>distinct Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:107349:18"/>
               <hi>Less distinction</hi> in our selves may lead
us to conceive the possibility of greater
in him, in whom we are wont to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
nothing but Substance.</p>
            <p>What he adds concerning <hi>the Union of
Soul and Body</hi> in our selves, (which
he cannot deny to be distinct Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
is, from a Man of so good sense,
so surprisingly strange, and remote from
the Purpose, that one would scarce
think it from the same Man; but that he
left this part to some other of the Club,
and afterwards writ on, himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reading it over; or this was with
him (what we are all liable to) some
drowsy Interval.</p>
            <p>For when he had himself recited as
<hi>the Enquirer's</hi> words, or sense, <hi>If there is
this Union between two so contrary Natures
and Substances, as the Soul and Body, why
may there not be a like Union between two or
three created Spirits?</hi> He, without sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

again to have forgot the Question, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

Substances.</hi> And why, Sir, doth this
argue him to have forgot the Question?
'Tis as if he expected a Man to be at the
top of the Stairs, assoon as he toucht
the first Step. In a Series of Discourse,
must the beginning touch the end, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out what is to come between, and
connect both parts? What then serve
<hi>Mediums</hi> for? And so farewel to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
since nothing can be proved
by it self. He expected, it seems, I
should have proved <hi>three intelligent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
might be united,</hi> because <hi>three intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Natures might be united!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But say I (and so he repeats) if there
be so near Union <hi>between things of so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Natures as Soul and Body, why not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two or three created Spirits?</hi> The
Question is, as he now states it himself,
why may not three intelligent Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
—be united? And hither he (with
palpable violence) <hi>immediately</hi> refers the
mention of the <hi>Union of Soul and Body;</hi>
and says he, <hi>Why Sir, are Body and Soul
intelligent Substances?</hi> And, say I, but why,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107349:21"/>
Sir, are not the three (supposed) created
Spirits intelligent Substances? And now,
thinks he, will my easy admiring Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that read me only, and not him,
say, What a Baffle hath he given the
Enquirer? What an ignorant Man is this
Mr.—to talk of Soul and Body, as
both intelligent Substances? But if any
of them happen upon the <hi>Enquirer's Book</hi>
too, then must they say, how scurvily
doth this Matter turn upon himself?
How inconsiderate a <hi>Prevaricator</hi> was
he that took upon him the present part
of a <hi>Considerer,</hi> so to represent him?
And I my self would say, had I the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of free Discourse with him in
a Corner, (which because I have not, I
say it <hi>here)</hi> Sir, is this sincere Writing?
Is this the way to sift out Truth? And
I must further say, this looks like a Man
stung by the pungency of the present
Question. <hi>If Soul and Body, things of
so contrary Natures, that is, of an intelligent
and unintelligent Nature, can be united into
one (humane) Nature, why may not three cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107349:22"/>
Spirits, all intelligent Natures, be as
well united into some one thing?</hi> It appears
you knew not what to say to it; and
would fain seem to say something, when
you really had nothing to say, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so egregiously tergiversate, and
feign your self not to understand it, or
that <hi>your Antagonist</hi> did not understand
himself. The <hi>Enquirer's</hi> Scope was
manifest. Nothing was to be got by
so grosly perverting it. Is there no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
but <hi>à pari?</hi> Might you not
plainly see, he <hi>here</hi> argued <hi>à fortiori? If
contrary Natures might be so united, why not
much rather like Natures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you ask me this Question, <hi>Do
not Body and Soul remain two Substances, a
bodily, and a spiritual, notwithstanding their
concurrence to the Constitution of a Man?</hi> I
answer, Yes. And I thank you, Sir,
for this kind Look towards <hi>my Hypothesis.</hi>
If they were not so, the mention of
<hi>this Union</hi> had no way serv'd it. You
know 'tis only <hi>Union,</hi> with <hi>continuing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,</hi>
that is for my purpose. I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107349:22"/>
doubt you nodded a little, when you
ask'd me that Question; and I do <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the Discourse was only of
a <hi>natural Union,</hi> what, in the Name of
Wonder, made you dream of a <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass-Pye?</hi>
Had you writ it at the same
time of Year I am now writing, I
should have wondered less. But either
you had some particular, preternatural
Appetite to that sort of Delicate; or you
gave your Fancy a random liberty, to
make your Pen write whatever came to
your fingers end, and that whirl'd you
unaware into a <hi>Pastry,</hi> and so, by meer
chance, you came to have your finger
in the Pye. Or you thought to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this wild Ramble might not issue as
luckily for you, as Dr. <hi>Echard</hi>'s Jargon
of Words fortuitously put together
(to ridicule <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s fatal Chain of
Thoughts) at length ending in a <hi>Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin;</hi>
which was mightily for your turn,
in your present Case.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:107349:23"/>
But upon the whole Matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when
you let <hi>your Mind</hi> so unwarily be <hi>in pati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

your <hi>Cookery</hi> quite spoil'd your <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</hi>
Otherwise, when you had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
read those words in the <hi>Sob. Enquiry,</hi>
(as I find you had) <hi>pag. 17. [Waving the
many artificial Unions of distinct things, that
united, and continuing distinct, make one
thing, under one Name, I shall only consider
what is Natural]</hi> you would never have
let it <hi>(your Mind,</hi> I mean so fine a thing)
be huddled up, and sopt, with Meat,
Plums, Sugar, Wine, in a <hi>Christmass</hi>-Pye;
or have thought that the Union
of an humane Soul with an humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was like such a jumble as this. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
when some among the <hi>Antients</hi>
made use of this <hi>Union of Soul and Body,</hi>
(as I find they have) to represent a very
sacred, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hypostatical One, they
little thought it would be so debased; or
that any thing would be said of it so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
as this. And, if we design doing
any Body good by writing, let us give
over this way of Talk, lest People think,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107349:23"/>
what I remember <hi>Cicero</hi> once said of the
<hi>Epicureans</hi> arguing, that they do not so
much consider, as <hi>(sortiri)</hi> cast Lots
what to say.</p>
            <p>But now 'tis like we may come to
some closer Discourse. We see what is
said to the <hi>Enquirer's</hi> Elucidation of his
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> to <hi>represent it possible,</hi> which
by meer Oversight and Incogitance (as I
hope now appears) was too hastily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
an <hi>Oversight, or Incogitancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We are next to consider what he
says <hi>to prove it impossible.</hi> And so far as I
can apprehend the drift of the Discourse,
what he alledges will be reduced to
these two Heads of Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viz.</hi> That <hi>three such Hypostases</hi> (or
<hi>Subsistents,</hi> as I have chosen to call them)
can have no possible <hi>Nexus,</hi> by which
to be one God.</p>
            <p>1. Because they are all supposed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent.</p>
            <p>2. Because they can neither be said to
be finite, nor infinite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:107349:24"/>
He should not therefore have said the
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> was meer incogitance and
oversight; for he knows I saw, and
considered them both. (In the <hi>Sob. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi>
it self; the former <hi>pag.</hi> 20, 21. the
latter <hi>pag.</hi> 70, 71. with <hi>pag. 122, 123.)</hi>
And thought them unconcluding then,
as I still think. Nor do I find the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderer</hi>
hath now added any strength to
either of them. But I shall, since he
is importune, go to the reconsideration
of them with him. And</p>
            <p>1. As to the former, I cannot so
much as imagine what should make
him, confessing (which he could not
help) the <hi>actual Union</hi> of an <hi>intelligent and
unintelligent Being,</hi> deny the <hi>possible Union</hi>
of intelligent Beings. He seems to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
many <hi>dangerous things</hi> in it, that
if he cannot <hi>reason,</hi> he may <hi>fright</hi> a Man
out of it, and out of his Wits too. It
will infer <hi>associating, discoursing, solacing.</hi>
But where lies the danger of all this?
Or to whom is it dangerous? He says
it introduces <hi>three Omniscient, Almighty
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107349:24"/>
Beings,</hi> as I expresly call them, <hi>associat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
&amp;c. But he cites no place where,
and I challenge him to name any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
among whom, I so <hi>expresly called</hi>
them. He may indeed tell where I
blam'd him for representing some of his
Adversaries, as affirming <hi>three Almighties,</hi>
and <hi>denying more than One;</hi> but that is not
expresly calling them so my self. And
he may know in time 'tis one thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
to call them so, and another to
put him (as he is concerned) to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it.</p>
            <p>Ay, but it will further infer <hi>Tritheism.</hi>
It will make <hi>three Gods.</hi> And if this be
not to make three Gods, <hi>it can never be
made appear that the Pagans held more Gods</hi>
—Yes, if there be no natural, vital
<hi>Nexus,</hi> if they be not <hi>united in One,</hi> of
which the <hi>Pagans</hi> never talkt: Or, if
they be <hi>co-ordinate,</hi> not <hi>subordinate,</hi> as
Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> speaks. And I add, if that
<hi>subordination</hi> be, <hi>not arbitrary,</hi> but by <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
natural, continual emanation</hi> of the
<hi>second</hi> from the <hi>first,</hi> and of the <hi>third</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:107349:25"/>
from <hi>both</hi> the <hi>other;</hi> so as that their <hi>goings
forth</hi> may be truly <hi>from everlasting,</hi> as is
said of the One, and may as well be
conceived of <hi>another</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>I would have the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with the <hi>Reproach</hi> of falling in, <hi>quoad
hoc,</hi> with <hi>Plato;</hi> and not envy their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonists</hi>
the honour of more closely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Mahomet.</hi> And, Sir, there is
more <hi>Paganism</hi> in denying this, and the
<hi>Divine Revelation</hi> upon which it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
than in supposing it.</p>
            <p>No. But there can be no such <hi>Nexus.
Conversation, Consociation, mutual Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Agreement, and Delectation—cannot be
conceived, but between Beings so distinct and
diverse, that they can be One in no Natural
respect, but only in a Civil, or Oeconomical.</hi>
This is <hi>loud,</hi> and <hi>earnest.</hi> But why can
there not? Setting aside <hi>Noise</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi>
I want to know a <hi>Reason,</hi> why
intelligent Beings may not be as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately,
and naturally united with one
another, as <hi>unintelligent,</hi> and <hi>intelligent?</hi>
And if so, why <hi>such Union</hi> should spoil
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107349:25"/>
               <hi>mutual Conversation</hi> and <hi>Delight?</hi> Perhaps
<hi>his Mind</hi> and <hi>mine</hi> might not do well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
for he cannot conceive, and I,
for my part, cannot but conceive, that
most perfect intelligent Natures, vitally
united, must have the most delightful
Conversation, Harmony, and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
together; and so much the more,
by how much the more perfect they are,
and by how much more perfect their
Union is.</p>
            <p>Whereas then I expect a <hi>Reason,</hi> why
<hi>intelligent Beings</hi> cannot be capable of
<hi>natural Union,</hi> and no other is given me,
but <hi>because they are intelligent.</hi> And again,
why such Beings <hi>naturally united</hi> cannot
converse, and no other is given me, but
because they are <hi>naturally united,</hi> i. e.
Such things cannot be, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be. By how much the less such
Reasons have to <hi>convince,</hi> they have the
more to <hi>confirm</hi> me, that the <hi>Hypothesis</hi>
I have propos'd is not capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disproved. And for my increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Confidence I must profess my
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107349:26"/>
self so far beholden to the <hi>Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This,</hi> in the mean time, I do here
declare, that I see not so much as the
shadow of a Reason from him, why
<hi>three spiritual,</hi> or <hi>intelligent Beings</hi> cannot
be <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>vitally united</hi> with each
other, with <hi>continuing distinction,</hi> so as to
be really and truly <hi>One thing.</hi> If they
cannot, I would know why? <hi>i. e.</hi> Why
they cannot as well, or much rather than
the <hi>Soul and Body,</hi> so as to be one <hi>entire
Man.</hi> If they can; such a created Union
is acknowledged possible; which is all
that part of our Discourse contends for.
And 'tis enough for our present purpose;
for this will be an Union of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>i. e.</hi> of things of the same nature, the
Soul and Body are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> things
of very different Natures. And it
sufficiently prepared our way, as
was intended, to advance further, and
add,</p>
            <p>That if such a <hi>created or made Union</hi> be
possible, it cannot be understood why a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107349:26"/>
like <hi>uncreated or unmade Union</hi> should be
thought impossible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if it be possible,</hi> the noisy Clamour,
that a <hi>Trinity in the Godhead is impossible,</hi> or
that it will infer <hi>Tritheism,</hi> must cease,
and be husht into everlasting silence. Or
if it shall still be resolved to be kept up,
to carry on the begun Humour, can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
serve to fright Children, or unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
People; but can never be made ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate
enough, to have any significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Men of sense.</p>
            <p>For when the Father is acknowledg'd
on all hands to be the Original, or
Fountain-Being, existing necessarily, and
eternally of himself; the Son existing
by eternal Promanation necessarily of,
and from, and in the Father; the Holy
Ghost of, and in them both; <hi>These, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they all exist necessarily, cannot</hi> but be
<hi>each of them God,</hi> and, <hi>because they exist
in necessary, natural, eternal Union,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be <hi>one God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he that shall attempt to make
<hi>Tritheism</hi> of this, will sooner prove
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107349:27"/>
himself not the <hi>third part</hi> of a wise Man,
than from hence prove <hi>three Gods.</hi> We
may truly and fitly say <hi>the Father is God,</hi>
the <hi>Son is God,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost is God.</hi> But
<hi>that form of Speech,</hi> the <hi>Father is a God,</hi>
the <hi>Son is a God,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost is a God,</hi>
I think unjustifiable. The former way
of speaking well agrees with the <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousiotes</hi>
of the Deity, the <hi>Substance</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is <hi>congenerous.</hi> You may fitly say of
three drops of the same Water, they are
each of them <hi>Water.</hi> But if you should
say they are each of them <hi>a Water,</hi> one
would understand you to mean they
were all drops of so many different sorts
of Water. I do upon the whole judg
the Substance or Essence of the <hi>three
Hypostases</hi> to be as perfectly <hi>One,</hi> as can
possibly consist with the emanation of
<hi>some</hi> from <hi>other</hi> of them. But now next.</p>
            <p>In his way to his <hi>second Topick</hi> of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation,
he is guilty of a strange
sort of omission, <hi>i. e.</hi> he twice over says
<hi>he will omit,</hi> what he greatly insists upon,
as a mighty matter, that <hi>this</hi> (meaning
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107349:27"/>
               <hi>the Enquirer's Hypothesis)</hi> is <hi>Heresy</hi> among
those of his own Party, whether they
be the <hi>nominal,</hi> or the <hi>real Trinitarians,</hi>
who all agree, That each of the Divine
Persons is <hi>perfect God,</hi> in the most ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
and perfect sense; and this too, as
<hi>such Person is considered</hi> sejunctly, <hi>or as the</hi>
Athanasian <hi>Creed speaks, by himself,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this I only say, in <hi>the first place,</hi>
that, if this weigh any thing, it ought
in reason to be as heavy upon him, as
me; for I believe the same People that
will call <hi>this account of the Trinity Heresy,</hi>
will call his denial of it <hi>Heresy</hi> much
more. But if he be not concern'd at
that, I am the more obliged to him,
that he hath a kinder concern for me
than himself. And if he really have, let
it ease his mind to know, that let the
Opinion be <hi>Heresy</hi> never so much, I, for
my part, am however resolv'd to be no
<hi>Heretick,</hi> as he, and they may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
see, by the whole tenour of <hi>that
Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:107349:28"/>
But yet I humbly crave leave to differ
from him <hi>in this,</hi> as well as <hi>in greater
Matters.</hi> I am apt enough indeed to
think that the <hi>Nominal Trinitarians</hi> will
judg the Opinion of the <hi>Real Trinitarians</hi>
to want <hi>Truth;</hi> and the <hi>Real</hi> will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
more truly judg <hi>theirs</hi> to want
<hi>Sense.</hi> But neither the one, nor the other
will say that <hi>each of the Divine Persons is
perfect God, in the most adequate and perfect
sense.</hi> For <hi>both</hi> cannot but agree that
<hi>God,</hi> in the <hi>most adequate and perfect sense,</hi>
includes <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi>
but they will none of them say that <hi>each,</hi>
or <hi>any</hi> of the Persons is <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and
<hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> And I am very confident,
he that shall so represent them, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
them by it into such inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and so much against their mind
and intent, that if ever they did trust
him, as I believe they never did <hi>this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderator,</hi>
to express their sense for them,
they never will do it more. As for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi>
himself, whose <hi>Creed</hi> he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
tho he often speaks of an <hi>equality of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107349:28"/>
the Persons</hi> in point of <hi>Godhead;</hi> yet he
also often, <hi>Tom. 2. p.</hi> 576. most expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excepts the Differences (which I
take to be very important) of <hi>being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begotten,
begotten, and proceeding.</hi> And
which is a Difference with a Witness, <hi>in
his Questions and Answers;</hi> He asks <hi>how
many Causes are there in God? [(Q. 11.)</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,] and answers, <hi>One only,</hi> and
that is the Father. And then asks <hi>[Q.</hi> 12.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] How many effects, or
things caused? And answers <hi>two,</hi> the
<hi>Son</hi> and <hi>the Spirit.</hi> And adds, <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is call'd a Cause, because he begets the
Son, and sends out the Spirit. The Son and
Spirit are said to be caused, because the Son
is begotten, and doth not beget; the Spirit is
sent forth, and doth not send.</hi> Now can
he be thought all this while to mean <hi>an
absolute equality?</hi> And whereas he uses
the Term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which our Author
renders <hi>sejunctly,</hi> or <hi>by himself,</hi> that he
may make it seem opposite to what is
said by <hi>the Enquirer, pag.</hi> 50. I, for my

of these Persons is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, singly <hi>God,</hi>
and <hi>Lord;</hi> but I say not, as he doth not;
and he denies what the <hi>Sober Enquiry</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
in the mentioned place, <hi>That any
one of the Persons sejunctly,</hi> is <hi>all that is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd
by the Name of God,</hi> which words
this Author slily leaves out, for what
purpose he best knows. But his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
be it what it will, can no longer be
served by it, than till <hi>the Reader</hi> shall
take the pains to cast back his Eye upon
<hi>pag.</hi> 50. of the <hi>Sober Enquiry.</hi> And I
must here put the <hi>Considerator</hi> in mind of
what I will not suppose him ignorant,
but inadvertent only, at this time;
That one may be <hi>sejoin'd,</hi> or <hi>abstracted</hi>
from another <hi>two ways,</hi> or by a twofold
<hi>abstraction, precisive,</hi> or <hi>negative.</hi> That
we may truly say of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> or
<hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that the <hi>One</hi> of them is, or
is not God, abstracting from both the
other, according as you differently ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract.
If you abstract any one of the
Persons from both the other by <hi>precisive
abstraction,</hi> and each of them is <hi>God</hi> or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107349:31"/>
               <hi>Lord,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or singly considered;
but if by <hi>negative abstraction</hi> you sever
any one from the other, so as to say
the one is God, and not the other, or
any one is all that is signify'd by the
Name of God, I deny it, as before I
did; for so you would exclude the other
two the Godhead; which is but what
was expresly enough said <hi>Sob. Enquiry,</hi>
pag. 47. <hi>The Father is God, but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the Son and the Holy Ghost, the Son
is God, but not excluding</hi>—&amp;c.</p>
            <p>And if (as this Author quotes) <hi>we are
compelled by the Christian Verity so to speak,</hi>
I wonder it should not compel him, as
it is <hi>Christian Verity,</hi> or at least as it is <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
as well as the rest of <hi>Christians,</hi> or
<hi>Mankind.</hi> Why hath he only the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of exemption from being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
by truth? <hi>Athanasius</hi> his word is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we are necessitated; and if
the <hi>Considerator's</hi> own Translation grieve
him, he might relieve himself by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that <hi>all Necessity is not compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:107349:32"/>
And because he hath brought me to
<hi>Athanasius,</hi> I shall take the occasion to
say, I cannot apprehend him to have
any sentiment contrary to this <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.</hi>
His business was against the <hi>Arians,</hi>
or the <hi>Ariomanites</hi> (as he often called them,
as symbolizing also with <hi>Manes.)</hi> And
because <hi>with them</hi> the Controversy was,
whether <hi>the Son and Spirit were Creatures,</hi>
in opposition hereto he constantly asserts
<hi>their consubstantiality with the Father,</hi> never
intending (for ought that appears) that
their Being was <hi>numerically</hi> the same with
his; but of the <hi>same kind,</hi> uncreated,
coessential, coeternal with his own.
For so he expresly speaks
in his <hi>other</hi> (or additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal)
<hi>Questions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quaestiones aliae.</note>

many sorts of Essence (as the Answer
will direct us to understand it) <hi>do you
acknowledg in God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Answer is, I say, <hi>one Essence, one

               </gap>) which sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107349:32"/>
all the rest. He acknowledged
no different <hi>kinds</hi> of Essence or Nature
in the Godhead, but <hi>that One only,</hi> which
was <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>uncreated;</hi> agreeably to

could never be said (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) there
was a time when they were not, which

admit to be called <hi>one Man,</hi> as the
three Persons in the Godhead, are and
cannot but be <hi>one God.</hi> Inasmuch as
these three Divine Persons partake real
Godhead (as existing necessarily each of
them) they are each truly God: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they partake it in necessary, eternal,
vital Union; and so that the <hi>first</hi> is the
<hi>radix,</hi> the second perpetually spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the first, and the third from
both the other, they are therefore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<hi>one God</hi> As Branches, tho really
distinct from <hi>each other,</hi> and the <hi>Root,</hi> are
altogether notwithstanding but <hi>one Tree,</hi>

            <p>And if there be any, now a days, that

<hi>German</hi> Divine, not of meanest account,
calls <hi>one of the four Evangelists of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But having now done with what he
said he would omit, but did not, (tho
he might to every whit as good purpose)
we come to what he overlooks not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(he intimates) <hi>he cannot.</hi> And let
us see whether he <hi>looks into it,</hi> to any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
purpose, than if he had <hi>quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd
it.</hi> He is indeed the more excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that he overlooks it not, because (he
says) <hi>he could not.</hi> In that case there is
no remedy. Nor do I see how he well
could, when the <hi>Sober Enquirer</hi> had
once and again so directly put it in his
view, and, as was said, objected it to
himself.</p>
            <p>But he thinks, however, to make an

all to pieces, and he brings it into

our Author doth of his.</p>
            <p>But let us see how much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our Author uses it in the present
case.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Enquirer</hi> had represented three
really distinct <hi>Subsistents</hi> in the Godhead
<hi>as possible,</hi> for ought we know, not
presuming to determine herein, this way
or that, beyond what is plain in it self,
or plainly revealed. And so still he thinks
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107349:35"/>
it may be, <hi>for ought he knows;</hi> for he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
not to know any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Yes (saith the Considerator)
but I do. No doubt, if any Man. But
say I, how know you? I know, saith
he, they can neither <hi>be finite,</hi> nor <hi>infinite,</hi>
therefore there can be no such thing at
all.</p>
            <p>But, say I, Do you know what <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi>
is, or can you comprehend it? Yes,
very well,<note place="margin">Considerations on the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>'s Sermon; <hi>p.</hi> 7, 8.</note> says he; for I
have an infinite all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
Mind. What
a Cyclopick understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is this? Nay, and he
pretends he can comprehend the <hi>very
Being of God</hi> (otherwise all Religion must
cease) after he had granted, <hi>we</hi> (inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
himself) <hi>cannot comprehend the least
spire of Grass.</hi> And yet that <hi>Being of God</hi>
is nothing else with him, but <hi>Existence,</hi>
(i. e. <hi>not to be nothing)</hi> which he there va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frously
inserts, but very imprudently;
for every one sees he said it only to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the purpose he was to speak to, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107349:36"/>
so said it not to any present good
purpose at all? As if it had been the
<hi>Bishop's</hi> word, and all one with <hi>God's
Being.</hi> 'Tis true that <hi>his Being</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<hi>his Existence:</hi> But hath he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a clear, distinct and adequate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<hi>what God is,</hi> because he, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
conceives a Being, vulgarly
signify'd by the Name of God, <hi>doth
exist?</hi> Bring the matter to Creatures,
and because he knows, as he may by the
sight of his Eye, that such a Creature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,
doth he therefore understand its
Nature? <hi>Existence</hi> is to be <hi>extra causas,</hi>
and this is common to all Creatures; as
to be necessarily, and without a cause,
is peculiar to God. If therefore <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,</hi>
and <hi>their Being</hi> be all one, <hi>all
Creatures</hi> are the same, and differ not
from one another; for to be <hi>extra causas</hi>
is that wherein they all agree. And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it further, as Existence is <hi>to be, in
rerum naturâ,</hi> abstracting from being
<hi>caused,</hi> or <hi>uncaused;</hi> and so <hi>God,</hi> and
<hi>Creatures</hi> will be all one. And see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107349:36"/>
this will not make all Religion
cease too?</p>
            <p>But if he say, tho <hi>Existence</hi> abstractly
taken, distinguishes not God from
Creatures; yet <hi>his</hi> Existence doth distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
him. Very true; but that leads
us back to the Consideration of <hi>his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
of what <hi>sort that is.</hi> Which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if he had pleased, he might as
well have let stand before as it was; and
might have considered that <hi>Existence,</hi>
and <hi>that which doth exist,</hi> are not of the
same import. Or that it is not all one,
to say <hi>that God doth exist,</hi> and <hi>what he is</hi>
that doth <hi>exist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it will be worth the while to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
a little further <hi>this Author's compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of Infinites.</hi> He says it is to have
a clear, distinct, and adequate concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, so he comprehends the
infinite Attributes of God. His Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
i. e. <hi>that Duration, by which he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all beginning, and end.</hi> This tells us
what it is not. But doth it tell us what
it is? <hi>q. d.</hi> An infinite Duration is a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107349:37"/>
boundless Duration: A Grammatical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition!
Or rather a meer Translation
of <hi>Latin</hi> into <hi>English.</hi> And so he might
teach a <hi>meer Latinist</hi> what <hi>boundless</hi> is, by
turning the <hi>English</hi> back again into <hi>Latin.</hi>
And greatly hath he edify'd his Disciple!
As much as he should, without such
change of Language, by saying <hi>Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is <hi>Invasion.</hi> And doth he give any
better account of infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> and
<hi>Power?</hi> Are his Conceptions of them
<hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct.</hi> 'Tis possible to <hi>know
much,</hi> and not be very <hi>wise.</hi> I do not
think <hi>that</hi> therefore, <hi>which he gives,</hi> a
very good account of <hi>Wisdom.</hi> Again,
<hi>knowing</hi> is <hi>doing</hi> somewhat. He speaks
not now of <hi>making</hi> this or that, but
more generally of <hi>doing any thing.</hi> Nor
doth any one know any thing, but what
he <hi>can</hi> know. Therefore his <hi>Wisdom</hi> is
<hi>Power;</hi> for so is an ability <hi>to know, Power,</hi>
as truly, as an ability <hi>to do</hi> any thing
else. Here is confusion, therefore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of distinction. And to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
any thing, I should think it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107349:37"/>
as requisite a Man's Conception be <hi>true,</hi>
as <hi>distinct.</hi> Now when he pretends to
have distinct Conceptions of God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> if also his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
be true, those infinite Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
are distinct. I am sure he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
them not, if, whereas he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceives them distinct, they are not
so. But if they are distinct, they are
distinct, what? Substances? or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents?
If the former, according to him,
<hi>distinct Divine Substances</hi> must be <hi>distinct
Gods.</hi> If the latter, let him weather
the Difficulties as he can of admitting
Accidents in the Divine Being. Either
way, he must as little pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
an <hi>omnimodous simplicity there,</hi> as the
<hi>Enquirer.</hi> But would he then have <hi>him</hi>
give better and fuller Conceptions of
these infinite Attributes, or rather <hi>of the
Infinity of them,</hi> which is his present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
No, no, that is none of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer's</hi>
part. He pretends not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Infiniteness. 'Tis enough for
<hi>One,</hi> among Mortals, to offer at
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107349:38"/>
(that <hi>ingens ausum)</hi> so great a thing!</p>
            <p>When again he says his Conception
of the <hi>Infinite Divine Wisdom, Power,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>is adequate,</hi> telling us they are <hi>those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
whereby God knows, and can do, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
implies not a contradiction to be known,
and done:</hi> I ask, but doth he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
in his Mind all those things which
it implies not a contradiction for him to
know and do? If not, what is become
of his adequate Conception? He may
so comprehend all that the most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Book contains, because he knows the
Title, or something of its Cover; and he
hath a very adequate Conception of all
that is contained in the Universe, because
he hath some general notion of what is
signify'd by the word <hi>World.</hi> Let him
then pretend as long as he please to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<hi>Infiniteness,</hi> no sober Man will
believe him, and the less, <hi>because he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it.</hi> If he put his Mind upon the
trial, and deal justly and truly when he
hath try'd, I would ask him, let him
put the Notion of Infiniteness upon
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107349:38"/>
what he pleases, <hi>Space,</hi> for instance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>as</hi> he thinks away any whatsoever
bounds of it, new ones do not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
succeed? And let him think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
those, whether still he doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
conceive new? Yes, but he can
divert and think no more of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> he can
think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what Infinite is, by not thinking!
And yet if he did understand Infinites
never so well, it would be no small
spite to him if a Man did but assert the
Infiniteness of one of the Persons (the
Father), and only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as to the other
two, as knowing their intimate Union
<hi>with him,</hi> makes his Wisdom, Power,
<hi>&amp;c. as truly theirs,</hi> as if it <hi>first</hi> resided in
<hi>themselves;</hi> his Argument is quite undone
by it to all intents and purposes.</p>
            <p>But I shall however, farther state and
weigh this case of [knowing, or not
knowing, <hi>three such Hypostases</hi> cannot be
infinite.] And</p>
            <p>1. Shew what might cast a thinking
Man upon, supposing they may be all
infinite <hi>for ought one knows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:107349:39"/>
2. Then consider the difficulty that
is in it.</p>
            <p>1. As to the former. That the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
virtually</hi> (or <hi>eminently</hi> rather) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
<hi>all being, created</hi> and <hi>uncreated,</hi>
there is no doubt. Nor again, that <hi>what
is from him,</hi> by <hi>perpetual, natural, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Emanation,</hi> cannot but be <hi>homoousial</hi> to
himself, the <hi>Athanasian Differences</hi> only
supposed, of being <hi>unbegotten,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,</hi>
&amp;c. But how to understand
<hi>these</hi> is the difficulty; <hi>i. e.</hi> How the
<hi>same numerical Nature</hi> is both <hi>begotten,</hi> and
<hi>no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> begotten;</hi> nor will I determine it.
Let them do it that can better. I, for
my part, as I have said, assert nothing
<hi>in this matter,</hi> only have proposed to be
considered what may be <hi>thought possible
herein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any would set themselves to
consider this matter, I would have them
take the difficulty they are to consider,
entirely, and as it truly is in it self; that
they may not be short in their reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And to that purpose to bethink
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107349:39"/>
themselves what is the <hi>proper Character</hi>
(as <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and before him <hi>Justin
Martyr</hi> phrase it) or <hi>Modus of the Son</hi> (for
instance) that 'tis <hi>to be begotten.</hi> This
methinks should bear very hard upon
the <hi>meer Modalists,</hi> who hereupon must
say, that to <hi>be begotten</hi> is the only thing
begotten, and so consequently that <hi>to be
begotten,</hi> is the thing that is peculiarly
said to be incarnate, and <hi>that suffered,</hi>
&amp;c. For they must assign that which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes
the <hi>Son</hi> from the <hi>Father,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they will make the <hi>Father</hi> be <hi>begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
which is somewhat harder than to
be <hi>Patripassians,</hi> or to make him to have
suffered.</p>
            <p>But it must also be upon the matter
even the same difficulty, to say, <hi>the same
numerical Nature, with the Modus, is
begotten.</hi> For then the same numerical
Nature must still be both <hi>unbegotten,</hi> and
<hi>begotten,</hi> which is very hard. And if
they reply, Yes, but <hi>under a distinct Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi>
Well; but <hi>what is that distinct Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus?</hi>
And when they find it is <hi>but to be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107349:40"/>
begotten,</hi> they must be hugely abashed,
as one of less deep Thought than they
would think. For so, the Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
common both to the <hi>Father</hi> and the
<hi>Son,</hi> all that is peculiar <hi>to the begotten,</hi>
from <hi>the Begetter,</hi> will still be but <hi>to be
begotten, i. e.</hi> When the Question is askt,
What only is begotten? the Answer
will be but as above, <hi>to be begotten.</hi> It
hath hitherto, therefore, been only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
Whether it will not seem easier
to suppose <hi>each Subsistent</hi> to have its own
<hi>singular Nature,</hi> tho <hi>Homoousial,</hi> as, the
<hi>two latter</hi> being by <hi>emanation</hi> from the
<hi>first,</hi> it cannot but be? Which hath been
often inculcated, and is plain in it self.
<hi>Meer arbitrary Productions</hi> may be very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
from their <hi>Original,</hi> but <hi>purely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
especially emanative, cannot be so.
And then the only considerable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which remains is this now before us,
<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>finiteness</hi> or <hi>infiniteness</hi> of these
<hi>three Hypostases:</hi> 'Tis plain they cannot
be <hi>all finite.</hi> But <hi>here</hi> our <hi>present Adversary</hi>
places his principal pains, and labour,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107349:40"/>
to prove, what he knows no Body will
deny, that they cannot be so. And
hence he carries away glorious Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies,
<hi>That three, or three thousand finites,
will never make one infinite.</hi>—Spolia
ampla—!</p>
            <p>But how knows he they are not
all Infinite? <hi>That,</hi> in short, which
he hath <hi>here</hi> to say, is but this, and can
be no more than this, till his Thoughts
have run through and compass'd the
never-utmost range of <hi>Infiniteness, viz.</hi>
That <hi>he knows they are not, he knows not
what!</hi> But how can he soberly say that?
How can he either affirm or deny of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
what he doth not understand? Is
this his demonstration of the impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Trinity in the Godhead? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the <hi>Father infinite,</hi> cannot the <hi>other
two</hi> be infinite also, for ought he knows?
How doth he know they cannot? By
the <hi>same medium,</hi> by which he knows it,
he may make <hi>other Mortals</hi> know it too,
if he think fit to communicate it. Which,
from so mighty Confidence, especially
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107349:41"/>
when he pretends it to be so easy, I have
hitherto expected, but in vain. Is it
because the <hi>first</hi> is infinite, therefore the
<hi>two other</hi> cannot be so? I am sure <hi>he</hi>
ought not to say so, whatever <hi>others</hi>
may, or whatsoever the truth of the
thing is (which we shall enquire into
by and by) for he hath over and over
acknowledg'd <hi>more Infinites than one.</hi> As
when he ascribes <hi>infinite Comprehension</hi> to
the Mind of Man (as hath been noted,
<hi>pag.</hi> 8. of these <hi>Considerations)</hi> he doth
not indeed say the Mind is <hi>simply in it self
infinite,</hi> but it is so <hi>in respect of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,</hi>
which <hi>Comprehension</hi> must
therefore be infinite. How agreeable
or consistent these Terms are, <hi>the infinite
Comprehension of a finite Mind, we are not
to consider;</hi> let <hi>him</hi> take care for that,
who can easily make light of such tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
Difficulties as these. But in the
mean time this infinite Comprehension
is an infinite something, not an infinite
nothing; and then so many Minds, so
many <hi>Comprehensions,</hi> and so many <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites.</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:107349:41"/>
No doubt he includes his own
Mind; and 'tis possible he may think
some other Minds as comprehensive as
his own. And ought not to think it
impossible, supposing an uncreated,
eternal <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> in the Deity,
that they may be <hi>infinite,</hi> as well <hi>as the
comprehension of his own</hi> and
some other <hi>Minds.</hi>
               <note place="margin">These Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>p.</hi> 31, 32.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what he seems to
grant of infinite <hi>Guilts,</hi> and <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
due,</hi> tho he doth not grant the
Sacrifice of Christ to be an equivalent
for them. All shews <hi>he thinks</hi> there
may be many <hi>Infinites,</hi> and <hi>even in the
same kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho to him, to whom it is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
to guess what would be difficult, this
would seem a very vincible Difficulty;
it is of much greater importance, that
we may <hi>do right to Truth,</hi> to consider it,
<hi>as it is in it self.</hi> And I acknowledg it
(as I have said over and over) to be <hi>in
it self,</hi> a great difficulty, as all sober
Men have been wont to do, that have
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107349:42"/>
had any occasion to employ their
thoughts that way.</p>
            <p>But my part herein hath less of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in it; which is only to expect, and
examine, what <hi>another</hi> will attempt to
prove from <hi>this Topick,</hi> not to assert any
thing my self. My Opponent takes
upon him boldly to pronounce, <hi>there
cannot be three distinct Hypostases in the
Deity.</hi> Why? say I. Because saith he,
that will suppose each of them infinite,
which cannot be. I say, why can it
not be? He perhaps may tell me, if any
one be infinite, nothing can be added
thereto, or be without its compass, much
less can there be <hi>another Infinite</hi> added to
the <hi>former.</hi> I only now say, you talk
confidently in the dark, you know not
what. And so as to involve your self
in Contradictions, do what you can.</p>
            <p>1. In saying nothing can be added to
what is infinite.</p>
            <p>2. In pretending to know, if any
thing can be added, how much, or how
little can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:107349:42"/>
1. In saying nothing can be added
to, or be without the compass of, <hi>what
is infinite.</hi> For then there could be no
Creation, which I cannot doubt him to
grant. Before there was any, was there
not an <hi>infinitude of Being</hi> in the <hi>eternal God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head?</hi>
And hath the Creation nothing in
it of <hi>real Being?</hi> Or will you say the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Creature is the Being of God?
I know what may be said (and is else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
said) to this, and 'twill better
serve my purpose than <hi>his.</hi>

            <p>2. In pretending to know what can,
or cannot be added. Or that, <hi>in the
way of necessary eternal Emanation,</hi> there
cannot be an infinite addition; tho <hi>not
in the way of voluntary, or arbitrary and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
production.</hi> The reason of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is too obvious to need elucidati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to them that can consider. But for
your part (I must tell my Antagonist)
you have concluded your self, even as
to that which carries the greatest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of impossibility, come off as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107349:43"/>
you can.<note place="margin">Considerations, <hi>pag.</hi> 8.</note> You say, <hi>a Body
of an Inch square,</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not infinite in extension,
but is a very small Body; yet <hi>it hath this
infinite power,</hi> to be divisible to infinity.
So, I suppose, you must say of <hi>half that
Inch,</hi> or a <hi>quarter,</hi> or the <hi>thousandth part</hi>
of it, much more of <hi>two,</hi> or <hi>twenty,</hi> or
a <hi>thousand Inches.</hi> You say, indeed, <hi>this
Body it self</hi> is not infinite. Nor will I
insist upon the trite and common Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
against you. <hi>How can any thing be
divisible into parts which it hath not in it?</hi>
Which yet Men have not talkt away, by
talking it often over. Still <hi>haeret lateri</hi>
—Nor of an <hi>infinite Power's</hi> being lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a <hi>finite</hi> (and so minute a) Subject.
But, in the mean time, here are <hi>Infinites</hi>
upon <hi>Infinites,</hi> an <hi>infinite Power</hi> upon an
<hi>infinite Power</hi> multiplyed <hi>infinitely;</hi> and
still these <hi>infinite Powers</hi> greater and less
than other, as either the Inch is augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
or diminished. And he saith
the Mind of Man hath the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of infinite or eternal duration.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107349:43"/>
so many Minds, so many Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites.
And he must suppose the infinite
duration of some Minds to be greater
than of others, unless he think his <hi>own
Mind</hi> to be as old as <hi>Adam</hi>'s; or do not
only hold <hi>their preexistence,</hi> but that
they were all created <hi>in the same moment.</hi>
Which if he do, I am sure he can never
prove. And so, for ought he knows,
there may not only be <hi>many Infinites,</hi> but
<hi>one greater than another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What therefore exceeds all limits
that are assignable, or any way conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by us, as we are sure the <hi>Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
doth, it is impossible for us to know
what differences that <hi>vast Infinitude</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
And we shall, therefore, but
talk at random, and with much more
<hi>presumption</hi> than <hi>knowledg,</hi> when we take
upon us to pronounce it <hi>impossible, there
should be three infinite Hypostases in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>

Wisdom, Power, Goodness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is in
any one, is each ones as truly as any

as the first and everliving fountain of all.
As was said, <hi>Sober Enquiry,</hi> p. 31, 32.</p>
            <p>But whereas the <hi>Considerator</hi> urges, <hi>If
the Father be infinite in his Substance, in his

in the most adequate and perfect sense of the

If therefore he mean the <hi>Son</hi> and the

let him prove his consequence if he

<hi>Sob. Enquiry,</hi> pag. 53. I shall not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107349:44"/>
nor love, when I have writ a
Book, to write it over again. His No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may fit <hi>Pagans</hi> well enough, or

Christians are directed to understand
that the <hi>Deity</hi> includes <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and

difference</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> from
all Creatures, <hi>viz. Necessity of Existence,</hi>
is conceivable enough.</p>
            <p>To sum up all, the <hi>Considerator</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
even by the whole manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Discourse, and specially <hi>by
the conclusion of that part wherein the Enquirer
is concern'd,</hi> to have most entirely given
up this Cause, as ever did any Man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Enquirer's</hi> only Undertaking was
to maintain <hi>the possibility of a Trinity in the
Godhead,</hi> in opposition to his <hi>former,</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Assertion, of <hi>its being impossible, and
nonsense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:107349:45"/>
He now, <hi>in conclusion,</hi> says, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer</hi>
saw <hi>there must be a Nexus;</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
if there can, that he hath gain'd
his point; <hi>but,</hi> 'tis added, <hi>he durst not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to say what it was.</hi> To which I must
say,</p>
            <p>That this is most <hi>uncautiously</hi> said, I
will not say, deceitfully, tho I know
'tis said <hi>untruly;</hi> and he might have
known (or remembred) too, that he
(the Enquirer) often spoke of it, as a
<hi>necessary, natural, eternal, vital, and most
intimate Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He further says,</hi> he only explains it
by the Union of Soul and Body. <hi>Which
again,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Is so great a Misrepresentation,
that I wonder he would say it <hi>here,</hi> when
he himself but two or three Pages off
recites <hi>as the Enquirer's words,</hi> 
               <q>[If God
could unite into one, two such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Natures, let any Man give me
a reason why he might not (much
more) first make, and then unite
two, and if two, why not three Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107349:45"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
               </q> Is this <hi>only</hi> to explain it by
the <hi>Union of Soul and Body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by the way that [first <hi>make,</hi> and
then unite] was none of the <hi>Enquirer's,</hi>
but appears thrust in to make what was
manifestly possible, seem impossible.
<hi>Sic notus</hi>—Let <hi>two Substances</hi> be <hi>created
entire,</hi> with no <hi>natural Propension</hi> to each
other, they are capable of no <hi>natural
Union,</hi> without change of <hi>their Natures.</hi>
Who sees not, it were a Contradiction
to suppose them, <hi>the same still,</hi> and <hi>not
the same?</hi> But suppose them created
with <hi>mutual aptitudes</hi> to Union, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
what should hinder but they may
continue united, without being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded?</p>
            <p>2. And 'tis said <hi>impertinently,</hi> as well
as <hi>untruly;</hi> for what if he had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
it at all, is it therefore <hi>impossible,</hi>
which it belonged to him to prove, or
he did nothing; and he hath done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
towards it. I have askt him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and now I put it again seriously
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107349:46"/>
to him, whether he do in his Conscience
believe this a good <hi>Argument</hi> [Such an
Union, <hi>i. e.</hi> natural, necessary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath
no pattern or parallel in the Creation;
therefore it is impossible in the Nature
of God?]</p>
            <p>For what he adds, <hi>That the Soul and
Body in a Man are not united into one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or Essence, nor possibly can be;</hi> The
Cause indeed depends not on it, but lies
remote from it. Methinks however it
is very feat, and shews him pinch't,
that he can be brought to this! Hath <hi>a
Man</hi> no Substance? Is he a shadow? Or
hath he no Essence? Is he a Non-enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Or is his Essence a <hi>Body?</hi> Then <hi>a
Body is a Man.</hi> Or is his Essence <hi>a Spirit?</hi>
Then, <hi>a Spirit is a Man.</hi> If he say either
of these, I wish he would tell us the
<hi>quantity</hi> of <hi>those Propositions,</hi> that we may
know whether he means <hi>that every Body
is a Man,</hi> or <hi>every Spirit is a Man?</hi> I am
sure where the <hi>Essence</hi> is, there must be
the <hi>Essentiatum.</hi> Or whether Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107349:46"/>
united, make nothing different from
<hi>either,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> disunited? Or whether a
Man be only such a thing as a <hi>Pye?</hi> Or
why might not a Pudding serve as well,
if made up of several Ingredients? He
hath greatly indeed oblig'd Mankind for
such an Honour done them! If indeed
the Cause depended on it, he would
have good store of <hi>Philosophers</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute,
and all that have any concern for
their own kind, before he could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the possibility of the supposed U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the Deity, and you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for it but his bare word: Which
(at least, without the addition of his
<hi>Name)</hi> will not do the business. Nor,
if he could also bring us a demonstration
against the Union of Soul and Body, can
he thereby prove such an Union as we
suppose in the Godhead impossible. The
case is quite another. The Union of
the Soul and Body was never by me cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>essential;</hi> for I well know, if they
were <hi>essentially united,</hi> in the strict sense
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107349:47"/>
they could never be disunited. But 'tis
commonly call'd a <hi>substantial Union,</hi> and
I called it <hi>natural</hi> in respect of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Nature,</hi> in contradistinction to <hi>Art.</hi>
As for the <hi>supposed Union</hi> we speak of in
the <hi>Deity,</hi> that, being <hi>necessary, original,
eternal,</hi> it must be <hi>essential,</hi> or none; but
with such distinction as before was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
For it was <hi>Union,</hi> not <hi>Identity,</hi>
that was meant, <hi>which Union, with such
distinction, till they be proved impossible,</hi>
the <hi>Enquirer's</hi> Cause is untoucht. And
is certainly to any such purpose, <hi>not in
the least touch'd by the Considerator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether there be any <hi>such Union</hi> that
may admit to be called <hi>essential</hi> among
the Creatures, doth neither make nor
marr. We have never said there was,
nor doth the stress of the Cause lie upon
it.</p>
            <p>I find indeed an ingenious, merry
Gentleman animadverts upon a <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script</hi>
writ against the <hi>Sober Enquiry,</hi> and
upon <hi>a Letter</hi> in answer to it, who at a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107349:47"/>
venture calls all <hi>essential Union, essential
Contradiction,</hi> and <hi>substantial Nonsense.</hi>
Who this is, I will not pretend to guess,
only I guess him not to be the same
with the <hi>Considerator,</hi> for <hi>this,</hi> besides
<hi>other Reasons,</hi> that he calls the <hi>Author of
the Considerations</hi> a <hi>great Man;</hi> and I scarce
think he would call himself so. His
Wit, and sportful Humour, I should
have liked better in a less serious Affair.
For <hi>this</hi> heboldly pronounces, in immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
reference to <hi>the Trinity it self,</hi> (that the
World might know he hath a <hi>Confidence,</hi>
at least, equal to his <hi>Wit</hi>) I can easily ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from <hi>asserting</hi> that any <hi>created Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are to be called strictly <hi>essential,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
then they must be <hi>simply indissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
And I see not but whatsoever
things <hi>the Creator</hi> hath united, he may
disunite, if he be so pleased. Yet one
might have expected <hi>this Author</hi> to have
been a little more civil to <hi>him</hi> whom he
stiles <hi>the late famous Dr.</hi> More, who hath
publisht to the World his express Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107349:48"/>
in this matter, that created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
have <hi>real amplitude,</hi> made up of <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerpible
parts,</hi> essentially united, so as not
to be separable, without annihilation
of the whole. One would think he
should not have treated <hi>him</hi> so, as to
make <hi>his essential Union, substantial Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are those left in the World,
who have that Veneration for the
Doctor, as to think it no indecent rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to this Gentleman, not to put his
judgment in the ballance against <hi>the
Doctor's,</hi> or to distinguish between his
calling it <hi>Nonsense,</hi> and proving it
so.</p>
            <p>But if any wonder that they who
think there is no such thing as an <hi>essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Union</hi> among Creatures, do yet think
there may be in the <hi>uncreated Being,</hi> they
will shew themselves mighty wise in
their wonder, <hi>i. e.</hi> in wondering that the
Creatures are not God. And if they
further hereupon enquire, why we will
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107349:48"/>
then make use of <hi>Unions not essential,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Creatures, to illustrate <hi>that</hi> which
is supposed <hi>essential</hi> in the uncreated Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and expect very particular, distinct
accounts of every thing so represented;
they will shew themselves as wise in
their Expectations, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they think
nothing can serve to illustrate, unless it
be <hi>like in all respects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Question still returns. Is every
thing to be judg'd by any Man of sense
impossible in God, whereof he hath
not given distinct and explicit accounts,
and illustrations from somewhat in the
Creatures? And another will be added,
Is there any thing originally <hi>in God,</hi> not
essential to him?</p>
            <p>But <hi>when</hi> the World is so full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of <hi>substantial Unions,</hi> without
Confusion, or Identification, that he
cannot so much as name me a created
Substance, that he can be sure exists <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
simple,</hi> I am sure it can be no
contradiction to suppose that there may
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107349:49"/>
be uncreated, necessary, eternal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without Confusion or Identification;
and that it would be, as he phrases it,
essential Contradiction, or substantial
Nonsense, to say that things united ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
(tho distinct) can possibly ever
admit of Separation. And if our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<hi>Anti-Trinitarians</hi> (for I will not call
them by the <hi>inept</hi> Name of <hi>Unitarians,</hi>
which as rightfully belongs to them
whose Adversaries they are pleas'd to be,
as <hi>to themselves,</hi> and therefore cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
the one from the other) would
allow it to be their Method to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Doctrine of the <hi>Orthodox Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi>
before they decry and hoot at it,
they would find that as <hi>they</hi> allow suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>distinction</hi> of the <hi>sacred Hypostases;</hi>
so <hi>the Union</hi> they assert, is not such as

This <hi>Author</hi> would fain have me with
him to the Play-House, whither really I
have no leasure to accompany him, nor
much temptation; for I perceive it hath
fill'd his Mind with <hi>Ideas</hi> not useful to
my purpose; nor, I think, to any good
one of his own. If there he learned to
jest away that which should be the best
part of himself; and of which <hi>Socrates,</hi>
dying, told his Friends it would be gone
far enough out of their hands, and for
that which was left behind, they might
bury, or do with it what they pleased.
If there he was taught to ridicule the

            <p>And besides, as he is too much given
to play, to mind any thing of serious
Discourse, so I find he is not throughout
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107349:50"/>
honest in his Play neither; but that even
when he pretends to sit out, and be but
<hi>a Spectator,</hi> only taking care that there
be fair play, he falls in himself, and
plays booty. Nor do I find he hath any

came not to my Sight, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
till some hours after the last Sheet of this
Discourse was brought me from the Press; I
have not time therefore to say much to it, nor
yet should say more than I do had I never so
much. The Author seems to think what he
was now doing, <hi>as to the Enquiry, superfluous,
because he said it was so fully done by an ab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er
Hand,</hi> &amp;c. In the mean time he was <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n ill
case, that he was neither <hi>able</hi> to write to any
purpose, nor be silent: A most deplorable
double <hi>Impotency?</hi> But he hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his Modesty, shown a double <hi>Ability,</hi>
to invent and make an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of his own
Fingers Ends, and then most dexterously to
combat that Shadow. <hi>Three inadequate Gods,</hi>
is indeed (to use his own Phrase) <hi>his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi>
constantly disavow'd by the <hi>Enquirer,</hi>
who, with the generality of Trinitarians, calls
the three Subsistents in the Godhead, <hi>God;</hi>
being each of them necessarily existent, but
none of them alone exclusively, a <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Art he hath is shewn in fighting this
his own <hi>Figment.</hi> As also <hi>that</hi> of Parts of the
Deity, other than conceptible, which no Man
can avoid. So we have his Dream of a <hi>third
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107349:51"/>
part of a God,</hi> about which he so learnedly
raves in his Dream, as to disprove, as effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
any God at all. For I appeal to what Sense
he hath left himself, whether <hi>Power alone</hi> be
God exclusive of <hi>Wisdom and Goodness?</hi> Then
'tis an inadequate, or a not compleat Notion
of God, then by his profound reasoning, <hi>not
eternal.</hi> No more are Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost <hi>Parts,</hi> unless you be enamoured of
the <hi>Bull, impartible Parts,</hi> that never were
parted, nor ever can be. As what are <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi>
united (tho unconfounded) cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Nonsense and Contradiction, be said to
be parted. His Fiction, that what is from
the eternal Father by <hi>necessary Emanation,
cannot be eternal, but must have a beginning,</hi>
is of the same <hi>stamp.</hi> He did not need when
he writ, to have abandoned all Logick and
common Sense, that would have told him
<hi>relata sunt simul naturâ.</hi> His so confidently
taking it for granted on all Hands, that <hi>all
Infinites are equal,</hi> shews his little compass of
Thought, and how unacquainted he is with
the Difficulties of a Controversy, wherein
yet he will be so over-meddlesome. <hi>Qui
pauca respicit,</hi> &amp;c. But who so bold as—?
I leave him to compound that Difference with
his <hi>abler Considerator, Whether one Inch and
two Inches be equal?</hi> and so bid him good
night.</p>
