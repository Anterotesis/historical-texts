            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER·</head>
            <p>THis Excellent Discourse, breathing the Excellence of it's (now Deceased) Authors Spirit, craves thy most serious perusal; and it will plentifully reward the hours which shall be spent thereon. It greatly savours of deep thoughts, strict observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and long and great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, of Things, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Creatures look best when
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:62989:3"/>
at a distance, and in prospect; but when nearer to us, they are then easily looked through, and seldom found to correspond with their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances to us, and with our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from them. But God is such a deep and boundless Abyss of Perfection, as most delightfully will endure and recompence all the severity and closeness of our eternal Thoughts about him. Perfected Spirits are all thought concerning God, and find their Hearts enflamed, and all their Powers invigorated thereby e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, to inexpressible Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: And what varieties of pleasant Thoughts the Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Instances and Mirrours of Divine Excellencies in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:62989:3"/>
will endlesly Minister unto, I do not know, nor dare I guess too boldly at them. But how those Souls can look for Heaven, or tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be accounted gracious, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver retire solemnly to converse with God, I know not. Surely, where God is not more than all to us, he can be comfortably nothing: And our religious Exercises and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences must needs be mean and dull, whilst God is triflingly and seldom thought on, and conversed with by us. Can holy Walking be preserved and promoted without love? Can love to God and Christ, and to the invisible State, be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, cherished, and continually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced without Faith? Can Faith be any thing but Fancy and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:62989:4"/>
without Thought and Knowledge? And can the Life of Faith, Hope, Love, and holy Walking, be fixt and vigorous, and proficient, without our serious and frequent representations of God unto our selves by solemn Contemplations of his excellent Perfections, free Communications, plentiful Provisions, and glorious Designs, whereto he hath entitled us, seeing our Religion and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in all the parts thereof can have no Life and Soul but this? What is it to converse with God in Solitude, but to actuate our Thoughts of what we know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God in Christ, and to accomodate them to all the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:62989:4"/>
and useful Purposes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Devotion; and to make Thoughts solemnly serviceable to the great Ends thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> our due and seasonable Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our God to us, and of our selves to him in Christ, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant to the stated and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional Ends and Interests of Christian Godliness, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may require? Conversing thus with God, wants not its great Advantages in life and death. And if these Thoughts contained in this Book, (which did so greatly reconcile the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the Thoughts of his then approaching, but now experienced Death,) were more in Exercise at
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:62989:5"/>
Funeral Solemnities, and this Book then put into the hands of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it would be no matter of Repentance that I know of. These are the hasty Thoughts and Sentiments of thine in and for the Lord, whilst</p>

He <hi>foretold</hi> them of the Fruit which their Infirmity would produce, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them that were apt to think too highly of themselves for the late free Confession they had made of Christ, when they had newly said [<hi>Now we are sure that thou knowest all things: by this we are sure, that thou comest forth from God,</hi> ver. 30.</p>
            <p>He answereth them [<hi>Do ye now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? Behold, the hour cometh,</hi> &amp;c.] Not that Christ would not have his Servants know his graces in them, but he would

also have them know the <hi>Corruption</hi> that is latent, and the infirmity consistent with their grace. We are very apt to judge of all that <hi>is in us,</hi> and of all that we <hi>shall do</hi> hereafter, by what we <hi>feel at the present</hi> upon our hearts.

and of the Life to come. <hi>Do we now rejoyce</hi> in the persuasions of the Love of God?

It is well: But the time may be coming when we shall seem to be as dumb and prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and say, we cannot pray, or else we find no audience and acceptance of our Prayers.

            <p>What Christ here prophesieth to them did afterwards all come to pass. As soon as ever Danger and Trouble did appear, they began to flag, and to shew how ill they could adhere unto him or suffer with him, without his special cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborating Grace.

            <p>Here are three observable points in the Text, that are worthy our distinct Consideration, though for brevity sake I shall handle them together.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Christ was forsaken by his own Disciples, and left alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When the Disciples left Christ, they were scattered every one to his own.</hi> They returned to their old Habitations, and old Acquaintance, and old Employment, as if their hopes and hearts had been almost <hi>broken,</hi> and they had lost all their labour in following Christ so long: Yet the root of Faith and Love that still remained, caused them to enquire fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the end, and to come together in secret to confer about these Matters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When Christ was forsaken of his Disciples, and left alone, yet was he not forsaken of his Father, nor left so alone as to be separated from him or his love.</hi>

possibly seem strange to us, that Christ would suffer <hi>all his Disciples</hi> to <hi>forsake</hi> him in his Extremity; and I doubt it will seem strange <hi>to us,</hi> when in our <hi>extremity,</hi> and our suffering for Christ (and perhaps <hi>for them</hi>) we shall find our selves forsaken by those that we most highly valued, and had the greatest familiarity with. But there are many Reasons of this permissive Providence open to our observation.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

and healing grace, by the means or occasion of the sins which he pardoneth and healeth.</p>

Lastly, by the desertion and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his Disciples, Christ would teach us whenever we are called to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in suffering, what to expect from the best of men; Even to know that of themselves they are untrusty, and may fail us: and therefore not to look for too much assistance or encouragement from them. <hi>Paul</hi> lived in a time when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were more self-denying and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast than they are now: And <hi>Paul</hi> was one that might better expect to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accompanied in his sufferings for Christ, than any of us: And yet he saith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. [<hi>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me:</hi>] and prayeth, that it be not laid to their charge: Thus you have seen some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why Christ consented to be left of all, and permitted his Disciples to desert him in his sufferings.</p>
            <p>Yet note here, that it is but a partial temporary <hi>forsaking</hi> that Christ permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not a total or final forsaking or Apostasie.

            <p n="7">7. And some of your friends will think that by a more <hi>through acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> with you, they have found out more of your <hi>infirmities</hi> or <hi>faults</hi>; and therefore have found that you are <hi>less aimable</hi> and <hi>valuable</hi> than at first they judged you: They will think that by distance, unacquaintedness, and an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hasty love and judgment, they were mistaken in you; and that now they see reason to <hi>repent</hi> of the love which they think was guilty of some <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi>: when they come nearer you, and have had more tryal of you, they will think they are fitter to judge of you than

before: And indeed our defects are so many, and all our infirmities so great, that the more men know us, the more they may see in us that deserveth pity or reproof; and as Pictures, we appear less beautiful at the nearest view: Though this will not warrant the withdrawing of that Love which is due to friends, and to vertue even in the imperfect: nor will excuse that alienation and decay of friendship that is caused by the pride of such as overlook, perhaps much greater failings and weaknesses in themselves, which need forgiveness.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And perhaps <hi>some</hi> of your Friends will <hi>grow weary</hi> of their Friendship, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that infirmity of humane nature, not to be much pleased with one thing long. Their love is a flower that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withereth: It is a short liv'd thing that soon groweth old. It must be <hi>novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> that must feed their love and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And perhaps they may have got some better <hi>Friends</hi> in their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that may have so much interest as to take them up, and leave no room for antient Friends. It may be they have met with those that are <hi>more suitable,</hi> or

               <hi>can</hi> be <hi>more useful</hi> to them: that have <hi>more learning,</hi> or wit, or <hi>wealth,</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> than <hi>you</hi> have, and therefore seem more worthy of their Friendship.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And some of them may think when you (are in a <hi>low</hi> and <hi>suffering state,</hi> and in <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>worse,</hi> that it is part of their <hi>duty of self-preservation</hi> to be strange to you though in heart they wish you well) They will think they are <hi>not bound</hi> to hazard themselves upon the displeasure of superiours, to own or befriend you or any other: Though they must not desert Christ, they think they may desert a <hi>man</hi> for their own preservation.</p>
            <p>To avoid both extreams in such a case, men must both study to understand which way is most serviceable to Christ, and to his Church, and withal to be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themselves, and also must study to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what Christ meaneth in his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sentence [<hi>In as much as you did it (or did it not) to one of the least of these my Brethren, you did it (or did it not (to me.</hi>] As if it were to visit the <hi>Contagious,</hi> we must neither cast away our lives to <hi>do no good,</hi> or for that which in <hi>value</hi> holdeth no proportion with them; nor yet must we deny to run any hazard when it is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

And yet this is a thing that must be expected: yea even your most self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying acts of obedience to God, may be so misunderstood by godly men, and real friends, as by them to be taken for your great miscarriage, and turned to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke: As <hi>Davids</hi> dancing before the Ark was by his wife; which yet did but make him resolve to be yet more vile: If you be cast into poverty, or disgrace, or prison, or banishment, for your necessary obedience to Christ, perhaps your friend or wife may become your accuser for this greatest service, and say, This is your own doing: your rashness, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion, or self-conceitedness, or will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness hath brought it upon you: what

            <p n="13">13. You may be permitted by God to fall into some <hi>real crime,</hi> and then your friends may possibly think it is their <hi>duty</hi> to disown you, so far as you have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God: When you provoke <hi>God</hi> to frown upon you, he may cause your <hi>friends</hi> to frown upon you: If you fall out with him, and grow strange to him, no marvel if your truest friends fall out with you, and grow strange to you. They love you for your godliness, and for the sake of Christ; and therefore <hi>must</hi> abate their love if you abate your godliness; and must for the sake of Christ be displeased with you for your sins. And if in such a case of real guilt, you should be displeased at their displeasure, and should expect that your friend should befriend your sin, or carry himself towards you in your guilt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62989:23"/>
as if you were innocent, you will but shew that you understand not the nature of true friendship, nor the use of a true friend; and are yet your selves too friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to your sins.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Moreover, those few friends that are truest to you, may be utterly unable to relieve you in your distress, or to give you ease, or do you any good. The case may be such that they can but pity you and lament your sorrows, and weep over you: you may see in them that man is not as God, whose friendship can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish all the good that he desireth to his friends. The wisest and greatest and best of men are silly comforters, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual helps: you may be sick, and pained, and grieved, and distressed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any thing that they can do for you: Nay, perhaps in their ingno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, they may increase your misery, while they desire your relief; and by stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving indirectly to help and ease you, may tye the knot faster and make you worse. They may provoke those more against you that oppress you, while they think they speak that which would tend to set you free: They may think to <hi>ease</hi> your troubled minds by such words as shall <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease</hi>

If your friend cut your throat while he thought to cut but a vein to cure your disease, it is not his <hi>friendly meaning</hi> that will save your lives. Many a thousand sick people are <hi>killed</hi> by their <hi>friends,</hi> that attend them with an earnest desire of their life; while they ignorantly give them that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their disease, and will not be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet a great part of the calamity of the World of sickness, and the misery of mans life, proceedeth from the ignorant and erroneous indulgence of Mothers to their Children, who to please them, let them eat and drink what they will, and use them to excess and gluttony in their childhood, till nature be abused and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62989:24"/>
and crudities, which are the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill matter of most of the following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of their lives.</p>
            <p>I might here also remember you how your friends may themselves be overcome with a temptation, and then become the more dangerous tempters of you, by how much the greater their interest is in your affections. If they be infected with <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> they are the likest persons to ensnare you: If they be tainted with <hi>Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> or <hi>Pride,</hi> there is none so likely to draw you to the same sin: And so your <hi>friends</hi> may be in <hi>effect</hi> your most deadly <hi>Enemies,</hi> deceivers and destroyers.</p>
            <p n="15">15. And if you have <hi>friends</hi> that are never so <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>constant,</hi> they may prove (not only unable to relieve you) but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry increasing to your grief. If they are afflicted in the participation of your <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> as <hi>your troubles</hi> are become <hi>theirs</hi> (without your ease) so <hi>their trouble for you</hi> will become <hi>yours,</hi> and so your stock of sorrow will be encreased And they are mortals, and liable to distress as well as you. And therefore they are like to bear their share in several sorts of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: And so friendship will make their sufferings to be yours: Their sicknesses
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62989:24"/>
and pains, their fears and griefs, their wants and dangers will all be yours. And the <hi>more</hi> they are your <hi>hearty Friends,</hi> the more they will be <hi>yours.</hi> And so you will have as many additions to the proper burden of your griefs, as you have suffering Friends: When you do but hear that they are dead, you say as <hi>Thomas,</hi> Joh. 11.16. [<hi>Let us also go that we may die with him.</hi>] And having <hi>many</hi> such friends you will almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have one or other of them in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress; and so be seldom free from sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; besides all that which is properly your own.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Lastly, if you have a Friend that is both true and useful, yet you may be sure he must stay with you but a little while. <hi>The godly men will cease, and the faithful fail from among the Children of men; while men of lying flattering lips, and double hearts survive, and the wicked walk on every side while the vilest men are exalted,</hi> Psal. 12.1, 2, 8. while swarms of false malicious men, are left round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, perhaps God will take away your <hi>dearest Friends</hi>: If among a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of unfaithful ones, you have but <hi>one</hi> that is your <hi>friend indeed,</hi> perhaps
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62989:25"/>
God will take away that one. He may be <hi>separated</hi> from you into <hi>another Country</hi>; or taken away to God by Death. Not that God doth grudge you the mercy of a faithful Friend; but that he would be your <hi>All,</hi> and would not have you hurt your selves with too much affection to any Creature, and for other reasons to be named anon.</p>
            <p>And to be forsaken of your Friends, is not all your affliction; but to be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken is a great aggravation of it. 1. For they use to forsake us in our greatest suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and streights, when we have the <hi>greatest need</hi> of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They fail us most at a <hi>dying hour,</hi> when all other worldly comfort faileth: As we must leave our houses, lands and wealth, so must we for the present leave our Friends: And as all the rest are sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforters, when we have once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our citation to appear before the Lord, so also are our Friends but silly Comforters: They can weep over us, but they cannot with all their care, delay the separating stroak of death, one day or hour.</p>
            <p>Only by their prayers, and holy advice, remembring us of everlasting things, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62989:25"/>
provoking us in the work of preparation, they may prove to us friends indeed. And therefore we must value a holy, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, faithful friend, as one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Treasures upon Earth. And while we take notice how <hi>as men</hi> they may forsake us, we must not deny but that <hi>as Saints</hi> they are precious, and of singular use to us; and Christ useth <hi>by them</hi> to communicate his mercies; and if any Creatures in the World may be blessings to us, it is <hi>holy persons,</hi> that have most of God in their hearts and lives.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And it is an aggravation of the Cross, that they often fail us, when we <hi>are most faithful in our Duty,</hi> and stumble most upon the most excellent acts of our <hi>obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And those are the persons that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fail us, of whom we have <hi>deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> best, and from whom we might have <hi>expected most.</hi>

            <p>Review the experiences of the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest Servants that Christ hath had in the World, and you shall find enough to confirm you of the vanity of man, and the instability of the dearest Friends. How highly was <hi>Athanasius</hi> esteemed? and yet at last deserted and banished even by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62989:26"/>
the famous <hi>Constantine</hi> himself! How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Man was <hi>Gregory Nazianzene,</hi> and highly valued in the Church? and yet by reproach and discouragements driven away from his Church at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> whither he was chosen: and envyed by the Bishops round about him. How worthy a man was the eloquent <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and highly valued in the Church! And yet how bitterly was he prosecuted by <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi>; and banished, and dyed in a second ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, by the provocation of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contentious Bishops, and an Empress impatient of his plain reproofs? What person more generally esteemed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for learning, piety and peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness then <hi>Melanchthon</hi>? and yet by the Contentions of <hi>Illyricus</hi> and his party, he was made aweary of his life. As highly as <hi>Calvin</hi> was (deservedly) valued at <hi>Geneva,</hi> yet once in a popular lunacy and displeasure, they drove him out of their City, and in contempt of him some called their Dogs by the name of <hi>Calvin</hi>; (though after they were glad to intreat him to return.) How much our <hi>Grindal</hi> and <hi>Abbot</hi> were esteemed, it appeareth by their advancement to the Archbishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62989:26"/>
of <hi>Canterbury</hi>: And yet who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that their eminent piety sufficed not to keep them from dejecting frowns! And if you say, that it is no wonder if with <hi>Princes</hi> through <hi>interest,</hi> and with <hi>People</hi> through levity, it be thus; I might keep up instances of the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trustiness of <hi>particular Friends</hi>: But all History and the experiences of the most, do so much abound with them, that I think it needless. Which of us must not say with <hi>David</hi> that [<hi>all men are lyars</hi>] Psal. 116. that is, <hi>deceitful</hi> and <hi>untrusty,</hi> either through unfaithfulness, weakness or insufficiency; that either will forsake us, or cannot help us in the time of need?</p>
            <p>Was <hi>Christ forsaken</hi> in his extremity by his own <hi>Disciples,</hi> to teach us what to <hi>expect,</hi> or <hi>bear</hi>? Think it not strange then to be conformed to your Lord in this, as well as in other parts of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. <hi>Expect</hi> that <hi>Men</hi> should prove <hi>deceitful</hi>: Not that you should entertain <hi>censorious</hi> suspicions of your <hi>particular friends</hi>: But remember in general that Man is frail, and the best too selfish and <hi>uncertain</hi>; and that it is no wonder if those should prove your greatest grief, from whom you had the highest expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62989:27"/>
Are you better then <hi>Iob,</hi> or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> or Christ? and are your Friends more firm and unchangeable then theirs?</p>
            <p>Consider, 1. That Creatures must be set at a sufficient distance from their Creator. All-sufficiency, Immutability and indefectible fidelity, are proper to Jehovah. As it is no wonder for the Sun to set or be Eclipsed, as glorious a body as it is; so it is no wonder for a Friend, a pious Friend, to fail us, for a time, in the hour of our distress. There are some that <hi>will not</hi>: But there is <hi>none but may,</hi> if God should leave them to their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>Man</hi> is not your <hi>Rock:</hi> He hath <hi>no stability</hi> but what is derived, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and uncertain, and defectible. Learn therefore to rest on God alone, and lean not too hard or confidently upon any mortal might.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And God will have the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of man to be <hi>known,</hi> that so the <hi>weakest</hi> may not be <hi>utterly discouraged,</hi> nor take their <hi>weakness</hi> to be <hi>gracelesness,</hi> whilst they see that the strongest also have their <hi>infirmities,</hi> though not so great as theirs. If any of God's Servants lives in constant holiness and fidelity, without <hi>any shakings</hi> or stumbling in their way, it would tempt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62989:27"/>
some self-accusing troubled Souls, to think that they were altogether graceless, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are so far short of others. But when we read of a <hi>Peters</hi> denying his Master in so horrid a manner, with swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cursing that he knew not the man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.74. And of his dissimulation and not walking uprightly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. and of a <hi>Davids</hi> unfriendly and unrighteous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> the seed of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>; and of his most vile and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous dealing with <hi>Vriah,</hi> a faithful and deserving Subject; it may both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate our wonder and offence at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness of our Friends, and teach us to compassionate their frailty, when they desert us; and also somewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate our immoderate dejectedness and trouble, when we have failed God or man our selves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Moreover, consider, how the <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> of that <hi>sin,</hi> which is the root and cause of such unfaithfulness, is greatly manifested by the failing of our Friends. God will have the <hi>odiousness</hi> of the <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> of our <hi>Self-love</hi> and <hi>Carnal mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,</hi> and <hi>Cowardize</hi> appear. We should not discern it in the Seed and Root, if we did not see, and taste it in the Fruits.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62989:28"/>
               <hi>Seeing</hi> without <hi>Tasting</hi> will not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently convince us. A Crab looks as beautiful as an Apple; but when you <hi>taste</hi> it, you better know the difference. When you must your selves be unkindly used by your Friends, and forsaken by them in your distress, and you have <hi>tasted</hi> the Fruits of the Remnants of their Worldliness, Selfishness and Carnal Fears, you will better know the odious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these Vices, which thus break forth against all Obligations to God and you, and notwithstanding the Light, the Conscience, and perhaps the Grace, that doth resist them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Are you not prone to <hi>overvalue</hi> and <hi>overlove</hi> your Friends? If so, is not this the meerest Remedy for your Disease? In the <hi>loving of God,</hi> we are in no danger of <hi>Excess</hi>; and therefore have no need of any thing to <hi>quench</hi> it. And in the <hi>loving</hi> of the <hi>Godly purely</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of <hi>Christ,</hi> and in loving <hi>Saints</hi> as <hi>Saints,</hi> we are not apt to go <hi>too far.</hi> But yet our Understandings may mistake, and we may think that Saints have more of sanctity than indeed they have; and we are exceeding apt to mix a <hi>Selfish Common Love</hi> with that which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62989:28"/>
is <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi>; and at the same time, when we love a <hi>Christian</hi> as a <hi>Christian,</hi> we are apt not only to love him (as we ought) but to <hi>overlove</hi> him, because he is <hi>our Friend,</hi> and <hi>loveth us.</hi> Those <hi>Christians</hi> that have no <hi>special Love to us,</hi> we are apt to <hi>undervalue</hi> and <hi>neglect,</hi> and love them below their holiness and worth: But those that we think <hi>entirely love us,</hi> we love <hi>above</hi> their <hi>proper Worth,</hi> as they stand in the esteem of God: Not but that we <hi>may</hi> love those that love us, and add this love to that which is purely for the sake of Christ; but we should not let our <hi>own Interest prevail</hi> and <hi>overtop</hi> the Interest of Christ, nor love any <hi>so much</hi> for <hi>loving us,</hi> as for <hi>loving Christ</hi>: And if we <hi>do so,</hi> no wonder if God shall use such Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as he seeth meet, to abate our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of Selfish Love.</p>
            <p>O how highly are we apt to think of <hi>all that Good</hi> which is found in those who are the highest <hi>esteemers of us,</hi> and most <hi>dearly love us</hi>; when perhaps in it self it is but some <hi>ordinary Good,</hi> or <hi>ordinary Degree</hi> of Goodness which is in them! Their Love to us unresistibly procureth our Love to them: And
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62989:29"/>
when we love them, it is wonderful to observe, how easily we are brought to think well of almost all they do, and highly to value their Judgments, Graces, Parts and Works: When <hi>greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies</hi> in <hi>another</hi> perhaps are scarce observed, or regarded but as a common thing: And therefore the destruction or want of Love, is apparent in the vilifying Thoughts and Speeches, that most Men have one of another; and in the low esteem of the Judgments, and Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Lives of other Men; (much more in their Contempt, Reproaches, and cruel Persecutions.) Now though God will have us encrease in our love of Christ in his Members, and in our pure love of Christians as such, and in our common Charity to all, yea, and in our just Fidelity to our Friend; yet would he have us suspect and moderate our selfish and excessive Love, and inordinate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial esteem of one above another, when it is but for our selves, and on our own account. And therefore as he will make us know, that we our selves are no such excellent Persons, as that it should make another so laudable, or advance his worth, because he loveth us; so he will make
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62989:29"/>
us know, that our Friends, whom we overvalue, are but like other Men: If we exalt them too highly in our esteem, it is a sign that God must cast them down. And as their Love to us was it that made us so exalt them; so their unkindness or unfaithfulness to us, is the fittest means to bring them lower in our estimation and affection. God is very jealous of our hearts, as to our overvaluing and overloving any of his Creatures. What we give inordinately and excessively to them, is some way or other taken from him, and given them to his Injury, and therefore to his offence. Though I know, that to be void of natural, friendly or social af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, is an odious extreme on the other side; yet God will rebuke us, if we are guilty of Excess. And it's the greater and more inexcusable fault to over-love the Creature, because our Love to God is so cold, and hardly kindled and kept alive. He cannot take it well to see us dote upon dust and frailty like our selves, at the same time when all his wondrous kindness, and attractive goodness, do cause but such a faint and languid Love to him, which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62989:30"/>
we ourselves can scarcely feel. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cures us by permitting our Friends to shew us what they are, and how little they deserve such excessive Love (when God hath so little) it is no more wonder, than it is, that he is tender of his Glory, and merciful to his Servants Souls.</p>
            <p n="5">5 By the failing and unfaithfulness of our Friends, the wonderful <hi>Patience of God</hi> will be observed and honoured, as it is shewed both to <hi>them and us.</hi> When <hi>they forsake us</hi> in our distress, (especially when we suffer for the Cause of Christ) it is <hi>God</hi> that they injure more than us: And therefore if <hi>he</hi> bear with them, and forgive their Weakness upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, why should not <hi>we</hi> do so, that are much less injured? The worlds perfideousness should make us think, How great and wonderful is the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, that beareth with, and beareth up so vile, ungrateful, treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men that abuse him, to whom they are infinitely obliged? And it should make us consider, when Men deal trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously with us, How great is that mercy that hath born with, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned greater wrongs, which I my self have done to God, than these can be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62989:30"/>
which men have done to me! It was the remembrance of <hi>David</hi>'s Sin, that had provoked God to raise up his own Son against him (of whom he had been too fond) which made him so easily bear the Curses and Reproach of <hi>Shimei.</hi> It will make us bear abuse from others, to remember how ill we have dealt with God, and how ill we have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at his hands our selves.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And I have observed another of the Reasons of God's permitting the failing of our Friends, in the <hi>season</hi> and <hi>success.</hi> It is, that the <hi>Love of our Friends may not hinder us when we are called to suffer or die.</hi> When we <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi> them, it teareth our very hearts to leave them: And therefore it is a strong temptation to draw us from our Duty, and to be unfaithful to the cause of Christ, lest we should be taken from our too-dear Friends, or lest our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering cause their too-much Grief. It is so hard a thing to die with willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and peace, that it must needs be a mercy to be saved from the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which make us backward: And the excessive Love of Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is not the least of these Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62989:31"/>
O how loth is many a one to die, when they think of parting with Wife, or Husband or Children, or dear and faithful Friends! Now I have often observed, that a little before their death or sickness, it is ordinary with God to permit some unkindness between such too dear friends to arise, by which he moderated and abated their affections, and made them a great deal the willinger to dye. Then we are ready to say, it is time for me to leave the World, when not only the rest of the World, but my dearest Friends have first forsaken me! This helpeth us to remember our dearest everlasting Friend, and to be grieved at the heart that we have been no truer our selves to him, who would not have forsaken us in our extremity. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it makes us ev'n weary of the world, and to say as <hi>Elias,</hi> Lord take away my Life, &amp;c. 1 <hi>King</hi> 19.4.10, 14. When we must say, I thought I had one friend left, and behold even he forsaketh me in my distress.] As the love of Friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth our affections to this World, so to be weaned by their unkindnesses from our Friends, is a great help to loosen us from the World, and proveth oft a very great
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62989:31"/>
mercy to a Soul that is ready to depart.</p>
            <p>And as the friends that Love us most, and have most interest in your esteem and Love, may do more than others, in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to be unfaithful to our Lord, to to entertain any errour, to commit any sin, or to flinch in suffering; so when God had permitted them to forsake us, and to lose their too great interest in us, we are fortified against all temptations from them. I have known where a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intimate friend hath grown strange, and broken former friendship, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after turned to such dangerous ways and errours, as convinced the other of the mercifulness of God, in weakning his temptation by his friends desertion; who might else have drawn him along with him into sin. And I have often observed, that when the husbands have turned from Religion to Infidelity, Familism, or some dangerous heresie, that God hath permitted them to hate and abuse their wives so inhumanly, as that it preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the poor women from the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of following them in their Apostasie or sin: When as some other women with whom their husbands have dealt more kindly, have been drawn away with them into pernicious paths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:62989:32"/>Therefore still I must say, we were undone if we had the disposing of our own conditions. It would belong before we should have been willing our selves to be thus unkindly dealt with by our friends: And yet God hath made it to many a soul, a notable me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them from being undone for ever. Yea the <hi>unfaithfulness</hi> of all our <hi>friends,</hi> and the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> of all our <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> doth us not usually so much harm, as the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>temptation</hi> of some one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ring friend, whom we are ready to follow into the gulf.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Lastly, consider that it is not <hi>desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or suitable to our state, to have too much of our comfort by any creature</hi>: Not only because it is most pure and sweet which is most immediately from God; but also because we are very prone to over-love the Creature; and if it should but seem to be very commodious to us, by serving our necessities or desires, it would seem the more amiable, and therefore be the stronger snare: The work of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication doth much consist in the annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or deadness of all the Creatures as to any power to draw away our hearts from God, or to entangle us and detain
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62989:32"/>
us from our duty. And the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and lovely the Creature appeareth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o us, the less it is dead to us, or we to it; and the more will it be able to hinder or ensnare us.</p>
            <p>When you have well considered all these things, I suppose you will admire the wisdom of God in leaving you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this kind of tryal, and weaning you from every creature, and teaching you by his Providence as well as by his word, to <hi>Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi>] And you will see that it's no great wonder that corrupted souls, that live in other sins, should be guilty of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness to their friends: And that he that dare unthankfully trample upon the unspeakable kindness of the Lord should deal unkindly with the best of men. You make no great wonder at other kind of sins, when you see the world continually commit them; why then should you make a greater or a stranger matter of this than of the rest? Are <hi>you</hi> better than <hi>God</hi>? Must unfaithfulness <hi>to you</hi> be made more hainous, than that unfaithfulness <hi>to him,</hi> which yet you daily see and slight? The <hi>least</hi> wrong to God is a thousand fold more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62989:33"/>
than the greatest that can be done to you, as such. Have you done that for your nearest friend, which God hath done for him and you, and all men? Their obligations to you are nothing in comparison of their great and manifold obligations to God.</p>
            <p>And <hi>you</hi> know that you have more wronged God, <hi>your selves,</hi> than any man ever wronged <hi>you</hi>: And if yet for all that <hi>he</hi> bear with <hi>you,</hi> have you not great reasons to bear with others?</p>
            <p>Yea, you have not been innocent <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men</hi> your selves: Did you never wrong or fail another? Or rather, are you not apter to see and aggravate the wrong that others do to you, than that which you have done to others? May you not call to mind your own neglects, and say, as <hi>Adonizebeck,</hi> Judg. 1.7. [<hi>Threescore and ten Kings having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: As I have done, so God hath requited me.</hi>] Many a one have I failed or wronged: and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if others fail and wrong me.]</p>
            <p>Nay you have been much more unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and injurious to <hi>your selves,</hi> than ever any <hi>other</hi> hath been to you. No friend
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62989:33"/>
was so near you, as <hi>your selves:</hi> None had such a charge of you: None had such helps and advantages to do you good or hurt: And yet all the Enemies you have in the world, even in Earth or Hell, have not wronged and hurt you half so much as you have done your selves. O, methinks the man or woman that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth themselves, and knoweth what it is to Repent; that ever saw the greatness of their sin and folly, should have no great mind or leisure, or aggravate the failings of their friends, to the injuries of their enemies, considering what they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to themselves! Have I forfeited my <hi>own salvation,</hi> and deserved everlasting wrath, and sold my Saviour and my Soul for so base a thing as sinful pleasure, and shall I ever make a wonder of it, that <hi>another</hi> man doth me some <hi>temporal hurt</hi>? Was any friend so near to me as my self? Or more obliged to me? O sinful soul, let <hi>thy own,</hi> rather then <hi>thy friends</hi> deceit and treachery, and neglects, be the matter of thy displeasure, wonder and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints!</p>
            <p>And let thy <hi>Confirmity</hi> herein to Jesus Christ, be thy holy ambition and delight: Not as it is <hi>thy suffering,</hi> nor as it is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62989:34"/>
by <hi>mens sin:</hi> but as it is thy <hi>Confirmity</hi> and fellowship in the sufferings of thy Lord, and caused by his Love.</p>
            <p>I have already shewed you that <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> for Christ, are in the highest form a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Disciples. The Order of his followers usually is this; 1. At our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and in the lowest form, we are exercised with the fears of Hell, and Gods displeasure, and in the Works of Repentance for the sin that we have done. 2. In the second form, we come to think more seriously of the Remedy, and to enquire what we shall do to be saved, and to understand better what Christ hath done and suffered, and what he is and will be to us; and to value him and his love and grace. And here we are much enquiring how we may know our own sincerity, and our interest in Christ, and are labouring for some as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, and looking after signs of Grace. 3. In the next form or order we are searching after further Know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, and labouring better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the mysteries of Religion, and to get above the Rudiments and first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: And here if we escape turning bare Opinionists or Hereticks by the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62989:34"/>
snare of Controversie or Curiosity, it's well. 4. In the next form we set our selves to the fuller <hi>improvement</hi> of all our further <hi>degrees of Knowledge</hi>; and to <hi>digest it all,</hi> and turn it into <hi>stronger Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Hope, and greater Humility, Patience, Self-denial, Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and contempt of Earthly Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and hatred of Sin; and to walk more watchfully and holily, and to be more in holy Duty. 5. In the next form we grow to be more publick-spirited: To set our Hearts on the Churches welfare, and long more for the progress of the Gospel, and for the good of others: and to do all the good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the World that we are able, for mens Souls or Bodies, but especially to long and lay out our selves for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and Salvation of ignorant, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, unconverted Souls. The <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit</hi> of this, is, An eager desire to Proselyte others to our Opinions or that Religion which we have chosen, by the direction of Flesh and Blood, or which is not of God, nor according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Godliness, but doth subserve our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ends. 6. In the next form we grow to study more the pure and wonderful
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62989:35"/>
Love of God in Christ, and to relish and admire that Love, and to be taken up with the goodness and tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Lord, and to be kindling the Flames of holy Love to him that hath thus loved us; and to keep our Souls in the Exercise of that Love: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to live in Joy, and Thanks, and Praise to him that hath redeemed us and loved us. And also, by Faith to converse in Heaven, and to live in holy contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beholding the Glory of the Father and the Redeemer in the Glass, which is fitted to our present use, till we come to see him face to face. Those that are the highest in this form, do so walk with God, and burn in Love, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> so much above inferiour Vanities, and are so conversant by Faith in Heaven, that their hearts even dwell there, and there they long to be forever. 7. And in the highest form in the School of Christ, we are exercising this confirmed Faith and Love, in Sufferings, especially for Christ. In following him with our Cross, and being conformed to him, and glorifying God in the fullest exercise and discovery of his Graces in us, and in an actual trampling upon all that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62989:35"/>
standeth up against him, for our hearts; and in bearing the fullest witness to his Truth and Cause, by constant enduring, though to the Death. Not but that the <hi>weakest</hi> that are sincere, <hi>must suffer for Christ,</hi> if he call them to it. <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> it self is not proper to the <hi>strong Believers</hi>: Whoever forsaketh not all that he hath for Christ, cannot be his Disciple, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.33. But to suffer with that Faith and Love foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in that manner, is proper to the strong: And usually God doth not try and exercise his young and weak ones with the tryals of the strong; nor set his Infants on so hard a service, nor put them in the front or hottest of the Battel, as he doth the ripe confirmed Christians. The sufferings of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Doubts and Fears doth take up such. It is the <hi>strong</hi> that ordinarily are called to <hi>Sufferings for Christ,</hi> at least in any <hi>high Degree</hi>; I have digrest thus far to make it plain to you, that our <hi>Conformity to Christ, and fellowship with him in his Sufferings,</hi> in any <hi>nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree,</hi> is the lot of his <hi>best confirmed Servants,</hi> and the highest form in his School, among his Disciples: And
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62989:36"/>
therefore not to be inordinately feared or abhorred, nor to be the matter of impatiency, but of holy joy; and in such infirmities we may glory. And if it be so of <hi>Sufferings</hi> in the <hi>general</hi> (for Christ) then is it so of this particular sort of Suffering, even to be forsaken of all our best and nearest, dearest Friends, when we come to be most abused by the Enemies.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I must confess that as I am much wanting in other parts of my conformity to Christ, so I take my self to be yet much short of what I expect he should advance me to, as long as my Friends no more forsake me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not long since I found my self in a low (if not a doubting) case, because I had so few Enemies and so little Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for the Cause of Christ (though I had much of other sorts:) And now that doubt is removed by the multitude of Furies which God hath let loose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me. But yet, methinks, while my <hi>Friends themselves</hi> are so <hi>friendly</hi> to me, I am much short of what I think I must at last attain to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62989:36"/>BUT let us look further in the Text, and see what is the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>failing</hi> and <hi>forsaking</hi> Christ in the <hi>Disciples</hi>; and what it is that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves to, when they leave him.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Ye shall be scattered every Man to his Own.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Self-Denyal was not perfect in them, selfishness therefore in this hour of temptation did prevail. They had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forsaken all to follow Christ; they had left their Parents, their Families, their Estates, their Trades, to be his Disciples: But though they believed him to be the Christ, yet they dreamt of a visible Kingdom, and did all this with too carnal Expectations of being great men on Earth, when Christ should begin his Reign. And therefore when they saw his apprehension and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious suffering, and thought now they were frustrate of their hopes, they seem to repent that they had followed him (though not by Apostacy and an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or plenary change of mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yet) by a sudden passionate, frightful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, which vanished when grace per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62989:37"/>
its part. They now began to think, that they had <hi>lives</hi> of their <hi>Own</hi> to save, and <hi>families</hi> of their <hi>Own</hi> to mind, and <hi>business</hi> of their <hi>Own</hi> to do. They had before forsaken their private <hi>Interests</hi> and <hi>Affairs,</hi> and gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Jesus Christ, and lived in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, and one another. But now they return to their Trades and Callings, <hi>and are scattered every Man to his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Selfishness</hi> is the great Enemy of all Societies, of all Fidelity and Friendship. There is no trusting that person in whom it is predominant. And the Remnants of it where it doth not Reign, do make men walk unevenly and unstedfastly towards God and men. They will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deny both God and their Friends, in a time of tryal who are not able to deny themselves: Or rather, he never was a real Friend to any, that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominantly selfish. They have alway some interest of their <hi>Own,</hi> which their Friend must needs contradict, or is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to satisfie. Their Houses, their Lands, their Moneys, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, their Honour, or something which they call their <hi>Own,</hi> will be frequently
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62989:37"/>
the matter of contention; and are so <hi>near them,</hi> that they can for the sake of these cast off the nearest Friend. Contract no special friendship with a selfish man: Nor put no confidence in him, whatever Friendship he may profess. He is so confined to himself, that he hath no true love to spare for others: If he seem to love a Friend, it is not <hi>as a Friend,</hi> but as a <hi>Servant,</hi> or at best as a Benefactor: He loveth <hi>you for himself,</hi> as he loveth his Mony, or Horse, or House, because you may be serviceable to him: Or as a Horse or Dog doth love his Keeper, for feeding him.

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Is this your case? I pray you answer these few Questions, and suffer the truth to have its proper work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your mind.</p>
            <p>Quest. 1. <hi>Who was it that deprived you of your Friend?</hi> Was it not God? Did not he that gave him you take him from you? Was it not his Lord and Owner that call'd him home? And can God do any thing injuriously or amiss? will you not give him leave to do as he list with his own? Dare you think that there was <hi>wanting</hi> either <hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Goodness, Iustice</hi> or <hi>Mercy</hi> in God's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of your Friend? Or will you ever have <hi>Rest,</hi> if you cannot have <hi>Rest</hi> in the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How know you what sin your Friend might have fallen into, if he had lived as long as you would have him?</hi> You'll say, that God could have preserved him from sin. It's true: But God preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <hi>sapientially,</hi> by means, as well as <hi>omnipotentially:</hi> And sometime he seeth that the temptations to that person are
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62989:38"/>
like to be so strong, and his Corruption like to get such advantage, and that no means is so fit as Death it self, for his preservation. And if God had permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your Friend by temptation to have fallen into some scandalous sin, or course of evil, or into errors, or false ways, would it not have been much worse than Death to him and you? God might have suffered your Friend that was so <hi>faithful,</hi> to have been sifted and shaken as <hi>Peter</hi> was, and to have denied his Lord; and to have seemed in your <hi>own Eyes,</hi> as odious as he before seemed <hi>amiable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>How know you what unkindness to your self, your dearest friend might have been guilty of?</hi> Alas! there is greater frailty and inconstancy in man, than you are aware of. And there are sadder roots of Corruption unmortified, that may spring up into bitter Fruits, than most of us ever discover in our selves. Many a Mother hath her heart broken by the unnaturalness of such a Child, or the unkindness of such a Husband, as if they had died before, would have been lamented by her, with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and excess. How confident
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62989:39"/>
soever you may be of the future Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of your Friend, you little know what tryal might have discovered. Many a one hath failed God and Man that once were as confident of <hi>themselves,</hi> as ever you were of your <hi>Friend.</hi> And which of us see not reason to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trustful of our selves? And can we know another better than our selves? or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise more concerning him?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>How know you what great calamity might have befallen your Friend, if he had lived as long as you desired?</hi> When the <hi>Righteous</hi> seem to men to <hi>perish, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Men are taken away,</hi> it is <hi>from the evil to come</hi> that they are taken, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.1. How many of my Friends have I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented as if they had dyed unseasonably, concerning whom some following Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence quickly shewed me, that it would have been a grievous misery to them to have lived longer! Little know you what Calamities were imminent on his Person, his Family, Kindred, Neighbours, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that would have broke his Heart: What if a Friend of yours had died im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before some calamitous subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Kingdom, some ruines of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if ignorantly he had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62989:39"/>
done that which brought these things to pass, can you imagin how lamentably sad his life would have been to him, to have seen the Church, the Gospel, and his Country in so sad a case? especially if it had been long of him? Many that have unawares done that which hath ruined but a particular Friend, have lived in so much grief and trouble, as made them consent that death should both revenge the injured on them, and conclude their misery. What then would it have been to have seen the publick good subverted, and the faithful overwhelmed in misery, and the Gospel hindred, and holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship changed for deceit and vanity; and for Conscience to have been daily say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, [I had a hand in all this misery: I kindled the fire that hath burned up all.]</p>
            <p>What comfort can you think such Friends if they had survived, would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and afflictions themselves? Is it a matter to be so much lamented that God hath prevented their greater mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and wo?</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>What was the World to your Friends while they did enjoy it?</hi> Or what is it now, or like to be hereafter to your selves? Was it so <hi>good</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> to them, as that you should lament their <hi>separation</hi> from it? Was it not to them a place of toil and trouble, of envy and vexation, of enmity and poison? of successive cares and fears and griefs? And worst of all, a place of sin? Did they groan under the burden of a sinful nature, a distempered, tempte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And would you have them under these again? Or is their deliverance become your grief? Did you not often joyn in prayer with them, for deliverance from Malice, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, troubles, imperfections, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Sin? And now those Prayers are answered in their deliverance: And do you now <hi>grieve</hi> at that which then you <hi>prayed</hi> for?</p>
            <p>Doth the VVorld use <hi>your selves</hi> so well
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62989:40"/>
and kindly, as that you should be sorry that your Friends partake not of the Feast? Are you not groaning from day to day your selves? And are you grieved that your Friends are taken from your griefs? you are not well pleased with your own condition: VVhen you look into your hearts, you are displeased and complain; when you look into your <hi>lives,</hi> you are displeased and complain: When you look into your <hi>Families,</hi> into your <hi>Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,</hi> unto your <hi>Friends,</hi> unto the <hi>Church,</hi> unto the Kingdom, unto the World, you are displeased and complain: And are you also displeased that your Friends are not under the same displeasedness and complaints as you? Is the World a place of <hi>Rest</hi> or <hi>trouble</hi> to you? And would you have your Friends to be as far from <hi>Rest</hi> as you?</p>
            <p>And if you have some <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> at present, you little know what storms are near! You may see the days, you may hear the tydings, you may feel the gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping griefs and pains, which may make you call for Death your selves, and make you say that a life on Earth is no feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and make you confess that they are <hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. It is said expresly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12.

            <p n="6">6. <hi>Love</hi> (even to the <hi>Saints</hi> as well as <hi>unto God</hi>) is one of the graces that shall endure <hi>for ever,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised

            <p>It is a state too high for such as we, and I think for any meer Creature to live so <hi>Immediately</hi> and <hi>only upon God,</hi> as to have no <hi>use</hi> for any fellow <hi>Creature,</hi> nor no comfort in them. God can make use of Glorified Creatures, in such sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency and subordination to himself, as shall be no diminution to his All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency or Honour, nor to our glory and felicity. We must take heed of fancying even such a Heaven it self, as is above the capacity of a Creature; as some very wise Divines think they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one, that tell us we shall <hi>Immediately see Gods Essence</hi> (his <hi>Glory</hi> being that which is provided for our <hi>intuition</hi> and felicity, and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from his <hi>Essence</hi>; being not <hi>every where</hi> as his <hi>Essence</hi> is) And as those do that tell us because that God will be <hi>All in All,</hi> therefore we shall there have none of our comfort by any Creature. Though
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62989:46"/>
               <hi>flesh and blood shall not enter into that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> but our <hi>Bodies</hi> will then be <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bodies</hi>; yet will they be really the same as now, and distinct from our Souls: and therefore must have a felicity suitable to a <hi>Body</hi> glorified: And if the soul did <hi>immediately</hi> see <hi>God's Essence,</hi> yet as no reason can conclude that it can see <hi>nothing else,</hi> or that it can see even <hi>Created Good,</hi> and <hi>not Love it,</hi> so the <hi>Body</hi> however must have objects and felicity fit for a Body.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But it is said, If we knew Christ after the flesh, henceforth know we him no more.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If you <hi>had</hi> none in them, it is no diminution to our happiness, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we should have all in God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62989:46"/>
and alone. 2. But if you have as much in others that you never knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that will not diminish any of your comfort in your antient Friends. 3. But it is most probable to us, that as there is a twofold Object for our love in the Glorified Saints; one is their <hi>Holiness,</hi> and the other is the <hi>Relation</hi> which they stood in between God and us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his instruments for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and salvation, so that we shall <hi>love Saints in Heaven</hi> in <hi>both</hi> respects: And in the first respect (which is the chiefest) we shall love those most that have most of God, and the greatest Glory (though such as we never knew on Earth.) And in the second respect, we shall love those most that were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God for our greatest good.</p>
            <p>And that we shall not there lay by so much respect to <hi>our selves,</hi> as to forget or disregard our <hi>Benefactors,</hi> is manifest, 1. In that we shall forever <hi>remember Christ,</hi> and <hi>love him,</hi> and <hi>praise him,</hi> as one that <hi>formerly Redeemed us,</hi> and <hi>wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in his Blood, and hath made us Kings and Priests to God:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may also in <hi>just subordination to Christ,</hi> remember them <hi>with Love and

            <p n="2">2.

And therefore I must Love <hi>Holiness</hi> in my self and others, better than meat and drink, and wealth, and honour, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and pleasure; because it must be Loved for ever, when the Love of these must needs be transitory, as <hi>they</hi> are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory. I must profess from the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of my soul, that it is the belief that I shall Love my friends in Heaven, that principally kindleth my Love to them on Earth: And if I thought I should never know them after death, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently never love them more, when this life is ended, I should in reason number them with temporal things, and Love them comparatively but a little; even as I Love other transitory things (allowing for the excellency in the nature of Grace) But now I converse with some delight with my Godly friends, as believing I shall converse with them for ever, and take comfort in the very <hi>Dead</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> as believing we shall shortly <hi>meet in Heaven</hi>: And I Love them, I hope, with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62989:48"/>
a Love that is of a <hi>Heavenly Nature,</hi> while I Love them as the <hi>Heirs of Heaven,</hi> with a Love which I expect shall there be perfected, and more <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>for ever</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised,</p>
            <p n="12">12. The last Reason that I give you, to move you to bear the <hi>Loss</hi> or <hi>Absence</hi> of your friends, is, that it gives you the loudest call to retire from the world, and to converse with God himself, and to long for Heaven, where you shall be sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from your friends no more. And your forsaken state will somewhat assist you to that solitary converse with God, which it calls you to: But this brings us up to the third part of the Text.</p>

us: And if he be our All, we shall not much find the want of creatures while he is with us.</p>
            <p>For 1. He is <hi>with us,</hi> who is <hi>Every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,</hi> and therefore is never from us; and knoweth all the ways and projects of our enemies; being <hi>with them in wrath,</hi> as he is <hi>with us in mercy.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. He is with us who is <hi>Infinitely wise,</hi> and therefore we need not fear the subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of enemies; nor shall any of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken works for his Church or us, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry for want of foresight, or through any oversight. We shall be preserved even from our own <hi>Folly,</hi> as well as from our Enemies subtilty: For it is not our own wisdome that our greatest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do principally rest upon, nor that our safety and peace are chiefly secured by; but it is the Wisdome of our great

            <p n="5">5. He is <hi>with us,</hi> who is most nearly related to us, and most dearly loveth us; and therefore will never be wanting to us in any thing that is fit for us to have.

He gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to himself as the Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.37, 3.

Though we have no other to teach us, and to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve our doubts,</hi> yet he is with us that is our chiefest Master, and hath taken us to be his Disciples, and will be our Light and Guide, and will lead us into the Truth. Though we have none else to be our <hi>Comforters,</hi> in our agony, darkness or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress; but all forsake us, or are taken from us, and we are exposed as <hi>Hagar</hi> with <hi>Ishmael</hi> in a Wilderness; yet still the Father of all consolations is with us; his Spirit who is the Comforter is in us: And he that so often speaketh the words of Comfort to us in his Gospel, and saith, [<hi>Be of good chear; let not your hearts be troubled, neither be afraid, &amp;c.</hi>] will speak them (in the season and measure which is fittest for them) unto our <hi>hearts.</hi> Though all Friends turn Enemies, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy us, or turn false Accusers, as <hi>Iob</hi>'s Friends, in their ignorance or passion; though all of them should add affliction to our affliction, yet is our Redeemer and

sweet and excellent work than to love him: He wanteth neither work nor pleasure, that in his solitude is taken up in the believing contemplations of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Love, and of all his blessed Attributes and Works. O then what happy and delightful converse may a Believer have with God alone! He is always present, and always at leisure to be spoken with; and always willing of our access and audience: He hath no interest Cross to our felicity, which should move him to reject us (as worldly great ones often have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) He never misunderstandeth us, nor chargeth that upon us which we were never guilty of: If we converse with <hi>Men,</hi> their <hi>Mistakes,</hi> and <hi>Interests,</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> and <hi>Insufficiencies,</hi> do make the trouble so great, and the benefit so small, that many have become thereby aweary of the World, or of human Society, and have spent the rest of their days alone in desert places.

and dampeth the pleasure, and blasteth the fruit of our Societies and Converse. O how oft have I been solaced in God, when I found nothing but deceit and darkness in the World! How oft hath he comforted me, when it was past the power of Man! How oft hath he relieved and delivered me, when all the help of Man was vain!

               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. WE see our <hi>Example,</hi> and our <hi>Encouragements.</hi> Let us now as <hi>followers of Christ,</hi> endeavour to <hi>imitate</hi> him in this, and to <hi>Live upon God, when
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62989:54"/>
men forsake us,</hi> and to know that while <hi>God is with us,</hi> we are not alone, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>forsaken</hi> while he forsakes us not.</p>
            <p>I shall, 1. Shew you here <hi>Negatively,</hi> what you must not do. 2. <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> what you must do; for the performance of your duty in this imitation of Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You must not make this any pretence for the undervaluing of your useful Friends; nor for your unthankfulness for so great a Benefit as a Godly Friend: nor for the neglect of your Duty in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Company and help of Friends: Two is better then one: The communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, and help of those that are wise and faithful, is a mercy highly to be esteemed. And the undervaluing of it, is at least a sign of a declining Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You must not hence fetch any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to slight your Friends, and disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them, or neglect any duty that you owe them, or any means therein necessary to the continuation of their Friendship.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You must not causelesly withdraw from humane society into <hi>Solitude.</hi> A weariness of converse with Men, is oft conjunct with a weariness of our Duty: And a retiring voluntarily into Solitude, when God doth not call or drive us thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62989:54"/>
is oft but a retiring from the place and work which God hath appointed us: And consequently a retiring rather from God, than to God. Like some idle Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that think they should not work so hard, because it is but <hi>Worldly business,</hi> and think their Masters deal not Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously by them, unless they let them neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their labour, that they may spend more time in serving God: as if it were no serving God to be faithful in their Masters Service.</p>
            <p>I deny not but very holy persons have lived in a state of retirement from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane converse: In such cases as these it may become a Duty, 1. In case of <hi>such persecution</hi> as at present leaveth us no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of serving or honouring God so much in any other place or state.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In case that <hi>natural infirmity,</hi> or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, or any <hi>other accident</hi> shall make one less serviceable to God and his Church in Society than he is in solitude.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In case he hath committed a sin so heinous and of indelible scandal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, as that it is not fit for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ any more to receive him into their local Communion, though he repent: (For as to <hi>Local Communion,</hi> I think, such a case may be.)</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:62989:55"/>4. In case a man through custom and ill company be so captivated to some fleshly Lust, as that he is not able to bear the <hi>temptations</hi> that are <hi>found in humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi>; but falleth by them into frequent heinous sinning: In this case the right hand or eye is rather to be parted with, than their Salvation. And though a meer restraint by distance of temptations and opportunities of sinning, will not prove a man sanctified, nor save the soul that loveth the sin and fain would live in it; Yet, 1. Grace may sometime appear in the strength and self denyal which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in the very avoiding of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when yet perhaps the person hath not strength enough to have stood against the temptation if it had not been avoided. And 2.

            <p n="5">5. In case a man by <hi>age</hi> or <hi>sickness</hi> find himself so <hi>near to death,</hi> as that he hath now a more <hi>special call</hi> to look after his <hi>present actual preparation,</hi> than to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any more the <hi>good of others</hi>; and find withall, that <hi>solitude</hi> will help him in his <hi>preparations,</hi> his Society being such as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62989:55"/>
would but hinder him. In these <hi>five</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses I suppose it lawful to retire from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane converse into <hi>solitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when there is no such necessity or call, it usually proceedeth from one of these vicious distempers: 1. From <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize</hi> and fear of suffering, when the souldiers of Christ do hide their heads, instead of confessing him before men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From a laziness of mind and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness of duty: when slothful unprofitable servants hide their talents, pretending their fear of the austerity of their Lord. Its easier to <hi>run away from our work,</hi> then <hi>do it</hi>: and to go out of the reach of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, malice, contradiction and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness, than to <hi>encounter them,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer them</hi> by Truth and Holy lives. So many persons as we converse with, so many are there to whom we owe some duty: And this is not so easie as it is to over run our work, and to hide our selves in some Wilderness or Cell, whilst others are fighting the Battels of the Lord. 3. Or it may proceed from meer <hi>impatience</hi>: When men cannot bear the frown, and scorns, and violence of the ungodly, they fly from sufferings, which by patience they should overcome. 4. Or it may
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62989:56"/>
come from <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>mutability</hi> of mind, and discontent with ones condition: Many retire from humane converse to please a <hi>discontented</hi> passionate mind; or expecting to find that privacy, which in publick they could not find, nor is any where to be found on Earth. 5. And some do it in <hi>Melancholy,</hi> meerly to please a <hi>sick imagination,</hi> which is vexed in company, and a little easeth it self in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as the possessed man among the Tombs. 6. And somtimes it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from <hi>self ignorance,</hi> and an <hi>unhumbled state</hi> of a Soul: When men think much better of themselves than others, they think they can more comfortably converse with <hi>themselves</hi> than with <hi>others</hi>: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they well understood that they are the <hi>worst</hi> or <hi>greatest enemies,</hi> or <hi>troubles</hi> to themselves, they would more fear their own Company than other mens: They would then consider what proud, and fleshly, and worldly, and selfish, and disordered hearts they are like to carry with them into their solitude, and there to be annoyed with from day to day: And that the <hi>nearest</hi> enemy is the worst, and the <hi>nearest</hi> trouble is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:62989:56"/>These <hi>vices</hi> or <hi>infirmities</hi> carry many into solitude; and if they live where Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish vanity may seduce them, they will perhaps imagine, that they are <hi>serving God,</hi> and entring in <hi>perfection,</hi> when they are but <hi>sinfully</hi> obeying their <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>: and that they are advanced above others in degrees of grace, while they are pleasing a diseased fancy, and entring into a dangerous course of sin. No doubt but the duties of a publick life are more in number, and greater in weight, and of more excellent consequence and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency (even to the most publick good, and greatest honour of God) than the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of privacy or retirement. <hi>Vir bonus est commune bonum</hi>: A good man is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good.

much more, than by laying my flesh to rot in darkness. Fain I would know God, and fain I would more love him and enjoy him: But O this hurtful love of life!

He can deliver me from all the corruptions and distempers of my froward heart; and ease me and secure me in the troublesom war which is daily managed in my breast. He can make it as easie a thing to dye, as to lye down and take my rest when I am weary, or to undress me at night and go to bed.

heart lay dead on earth, and would not stir, or quickly fall down again, if by any Celestial force it began to be drawn up, and move a little towards him: My carnal mind was entangled in diverting vanities: And thus I have been kept from communion with my God.

These have been my bars, and bolts, and jaylors; These are they that have kept me from my God: Had it not been for these I might have got <hi>nearer</hi> to him; I might have walkt with him, and dwelt with him; yea <hi>dwelt in him, and he in me</hi>: and then I should not have mist any friends, nor felt mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: And is it my sinful distance from my God that hath been my loss, my wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, my woe! And is it a nearer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to the presence of his Love that must be my recovery and my joy, if ever I attain to joy! O then my soul, lay hold on Christ the Reconciler, and in him and

by him draw near to God: And cease from man whose breath is in his nostrils: Love God in his Saints, and delightfully converse with Christ in them, while thou hast opportunity. But Remember thou Livest not upon them, or on their Love, but upon God, and therefore desire <hi>their Company</hi> but for <hi>His</hi>: And if thou have <hi>His,</hi> be content if thou have not <hi>theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He wants not man that enjoyeth God. Gather up all the Love, and Thoughts, and Desires which have been scattered and lost upon the Creatures, and set them all on God himself, and press into his presence, and converse with him, and thou shalt find the mistake of thy present discontents, and sweet experience shall tell thee thou hast made a happy change.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>If God be with me, I am not alone, because he is with me with whom my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est business lyeth</hi>: And what company should I desire, but theirs with whom I have my daily necessary work to do? I have more to do with God, than with all the World: Yea more and greater busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with him in one day, than with all the World in all my life. I have business with man about house, or lands, or food,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62989:70"/>
or raiment, or labour, or journying, or Recreations, about society and publick peace: But what are these to my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with God! Indeed with holy men I have holy Business; but that is but as they are Messengers from God, and come to me on his business, and so they must be dearly welcome: But even then my business is much more with God then with them; with him that sent them, then with the Messenger. Indeed my business with God is so great, that If I had not a Mediator to encourage and assist me, to do my work and procure me acceptance, the thoughts of it would overwhelm my Soul.</p>
            <p>O therefore my Soul, let man stand by: It is the Eternal God that I have to do with: And with whom am I to transact in this little time the business of my endless life. I have to deal with God through Christ, for the pardon of my sins, of all my great and grievous sins; and wo to me if I speed not, that ever I was born: I have some hopes of pardon, but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with many perplexing fears: I have evidences much blotted, and not easily understood: I want assurance that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed my Father, and reconciled to me,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62989:71"/>
and will receive me to himself when the World forsaketh me: I have many lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing graces to be strengthened; and alas, what radicated, obstinate, vexatious corruptions to be cured! Can I look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my heart, into such an unbelieving, dead, and earthly heart, into such a proud and peevish and disordered heart, into such a trembling, perplexed, self-accusing heart, and yet not understand how great my business is with God! Can I peruse my sins, or feel my wants, and sink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my weaknesses, and yet not discern how great my business is with God! Can I look back upon all the time that I have lost, and all the grace that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfully resisted, and all the mercies that I trod under foot, or fool'd away, and can I look before me and see how near my time is to an end, and yet not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how great my business is with God; Can I think of the malice and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of Satan, the number, power and subtilty of mine Enemies, the many snares and dangers that are still before me, the strength and number of temptations, and my ignorance, unwatchfulness and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to resist, and yet not know that my greatest business is with God: Can I feel
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62989:71"/>
my afflictions and lament them, and think my burden greater than I can bear, and find that man cannot relieve me; can I go mourning in the heaviness of my soul, and water my Bed with Tears, and fill the air with my groans and lamentations, or feel my soul overwhelmed within me, so that my words are intercepted, and I am readier to break than speak, and yet not perceive that my greatest business is with God? Can I think of dying? Can I draw near to judgment? Can I think of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting joys in Heaven? and of everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pains in Hell, and yet not feel that my greatest business is with God? O then, my soul, the case is easily resolved, with whom it is that thou must most desirously and seriously converse. Where shouldst thou be but where thy business is, and so great business! Alas, what have I to do with man! what can it do but make my head ake, to hear a deal of senseless chat, about preferments, lands and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, about the words and thoughts of Men, and a thousand toys that are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impertinent to my great imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and signifie nothing but that the dreaming world is not awake! What pleasure is it to see the busles of a Bedlam
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62989:72"/>
world? what a stir they make to <hi>prove</hi> or <hi>make</hi> themselves unhappy? How low and of how little weight, are the learned discourses about syllables and words, and names and notions, and mood and figure, yea, or about the highest Planets, when all are not referred unto God? Were it not that some converse with men, doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my converse with God; and that God did transact much of his business by his messengers and servants, it were no matter whether ever I more saw the face of man: were it not that my Master hath placed me in society, and appointed me and much of my <hi>work for</hi> others, and <hi>with</hi> others, and much of his <hi>mercy</hi> is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>by</hi> others, man might stand by, and solitude were better then the best society, and God alone should take me up. O nothing is so much my misery and shame, as that I am no more willing, nor better skilled in the management of my great important business! That my work is with God, and my heart is no more with him! O what might I do in holy medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Prayer one hour; if I were as ready for prayer, and as good at prayer as one that hath so long opportunity and so great necessity to converse with God,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62989:72"/>
should be! A prayerless heart, a heart that flyeth away from God, is most excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable in such a one as I, that hath so much important business with him: It is work that must be done; and if well done, will never be repented of: I use not to return from the presence of God (when indeed I have drawn near him) as I do from the company of empty men, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I have lost my time, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that my mind is discomposed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the vanity and earthly savour of their discourse: I oft repent that I have prayed to him so <hi>coldly,</hi> and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with him so <hi>negligently,</hi> and served him so <hi>remisly</hi>; but I never repent of the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>cares,</hi> the <hi>afflictions,</hi> or the <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> imployed in his holy work. Many a time I have repented that ever I spent so much time with <hi>man,</hi> and wisht I had never seen the faces of some that are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the world, whose favour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse others are ambitious of: But it is my greif and shame that so small a part of all my life, hath been spent with God; and that fervent prayer and heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, have been so seldom and so short. O that I had lived more with God, though I had been less with my dearest of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62989:73"/>
my friends! How much more blameless, regular and pure! How much more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and answerable to my obligations and professions! How much more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my review! How many falls, and hurts, and wounds, and greifs, and groans might I have escaped! O how much more pleasing is it <hi>now</hi> to my Remembrance, to think of the hours in which I have lain at the feet of God, though it were in tears and groans, than to think of the time which I have spent in any common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with the greatest, or the learnedest, or the dearest of my acquaintance!</p>
            <p>And as my <hi>Greatest business</hi> is with God, so my <hi>daily-business</hi> is also with him: He purposely leaveth me under wants, and suffers necessities daily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and enemies to assault me, and affliction to surprize me, that I may be daily driven to him: He loveth to hear from me: He would have me be no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with him: I have business with him every hour: I need not want employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all the faculties of my Soul, if I know what it is to converse in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Even Prayer, and every holy thought of God, hath an Object so great and excellent, as should wholly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62989:73"/>
take me up. Nothing must be thought or spoken lightly about the Lord. His Name must not be taken in vain: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is common beseemeth his Worshipers. He will be sanctified of all that shall draw near him: He must be loved with all the Heart and Might. His Servants need not be wearied for want of employment, nor through the lightness or unprofitableness of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: If I had Cities to build, or Kingdoms to govern, I might better complain for want of Employment for the Faculties of my Soul, than I can when I am to converse in Heaven. In other Studies the delight abateth, when I have reached my desire, and know all that I can know: But in God there is infinitely more to be known, when I know the most. I am never <hi>satiated</hi> with the <hi>easiness</hi> of knowing, nor are my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires <hi>abated</hi> by any <hi>unusefulness</hi> or <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness</hi> in the Object; but I am drawn to it by it's highest Excellencies, and drawn on to desire more and more by the infiniteness of the Light which I have not yet beheld, and the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Good which yet I have not enjoyed. If I be idle, or seem to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62989:74"/>
want employment, when I am to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template all the Attributes, Relations, Mercies, Works, and revealed perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Lord, it's sure for want of Eyes to see, or a Heart enclined to my business: If God be not enough to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my Soul, then all the Persons and Things on Earth are not enough.</p>
            <p>And when I have <hi>Infinite Goodness</hi> to delight in, where my Soul may freely let out it self, and never need to fear excess of Love; how sweet should this employment be? As <hi>Knowledge,</hi> so <hi>love</hi> is never stinted here, by the narrowness of the Object: can never love him in any proportion either to his Goodness and amiableness in himself, or to his Love to us. What need have I then of any other company or business, when I have infinite Goodness to delight in, and to Love (further than they subserve this greatest Work?)</p>
            <p>Come home then, O my Soul, to God: Converse in Heaven: Turn away thine eyes from beholding Vanity: Let not thy affections kindle upon straw or bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, that go out when they have made a flash or noise, and leave thee to thy cold and darkness: But come and dwell upon celestial beauties, and make it thy daily
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62989:74"/>
and most diligent Work, to kindle thy affections on the infinite everlasting Good; and then they will never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished or decay for want of Fewel; but the further they go, and the longer they burn, the greater will be the Flame. Though thou find it hard while Love is but a Spark to make it burn, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that thy cold and backward heart is hardly warmed with the love of God, yet when the whole pile hath taken fire, and the flame ascendeth, fire will breed fire, Love will cause Love; and all the malice of Hell it self shall never be able to suppress or quench it unto all Eternity.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And it is a great Encouragement to my converse with God, that no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding, no malice of Enemies, no former sin or present<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> frailty, no, nor the infinite distance of the most holy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God, can hinder my access to him, or turn away his Ear or Love, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt my leave and liberty of converse. If I converse with the poor, their wants afflict me, being greater than I can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: Their complaints and expectations which I cannot satisfie, are my trouble. If I would converse with Great ones, it is not easie to get access: and less easie
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62989:75"/>
to have their Favour, unless I would purchase it at too dear a rate: How strangely and contemptuously do they look at their inferiours! Great Friends must be made for a word or Smile: And if you be not quickly gone, they are aweary of you: And if you seek any thing of them, or would put them to any cost or trouble, you are as welcom to them as so many Vermin or noisom Creatures. They please them best that drive you away. With how much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and difficulty must you clime, if you will see the top of one of these Mountains? And when you are there, you are but in a place of barrenness; and have nothing to satisfie you for your pains, but a larger prospect and vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous despect of the lower grounds which are not your own: It is seldom that these Great Ones are to be spoken with: And perhaps their Speech is but a denyal of your Requests, if not some snappish and contemptuous Rejection, that makes you glad when you are got far enough from them, and makes you the better like and love the accessible calm &amp; fruitful Plains.</p>
            <p>But, O how much greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hath my Soul to converse with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62989:75"/>
God! Company never hindereth him from harkning to my Suit: He is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and Omnipotent, and as sufficient for every individual Soul, as if he had no other to look after in the World: When he is taken up with the attendance and praises of his heavenly Host, he is as free and ready to attend and answer the groans and prayers of a contrite Soul, as if he had no nobler Creatures, nor no higher Service to regard. I am oft unready, but God is never unready: I am unready to pray, but he is not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hear: I am unready to come to God, to walk with him, and to solace my Soul with him; but he is never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to entertain me. Many a time my Conscience would have driven me away, when he hath called me to him, and rebuked my accusing fearful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Many a time I have called my self a Prodigal, a companion of Swine, a miserable hard-hearted Sinner, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called his Son, when he hath called me <hi>Child,</hi> and chid me for my questioning his Love. He hath readily forgiven the Sins which I thought would have made my Soul fuel of Hell: He hath entertained me with Joy, with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62989:76"/>
Musick and a Feast, when I better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to have been among the Dogs without his Doors. He hath embraced me in his sustaining consolatory Arms, when he might have spurned my guilty Soul to Hell, and said, Depart from me, thou worker of Iniquity, I know thee not. O little did I think, that he could ever have forgotten the Vanity and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany of my Youth; yea, so <hi>easily</hi> have forgotten my most aggravated sins. When I had sinned against Light; when I had resisted Conscience; when I had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and wilfully injured Love, I thought he would never have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it: But the greatness of his Love and Mercy, and the blood and interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Son, hath cancelled all. O how many Mercies have I tasted since I thought I had sinned away all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies! How patiently hath he born with me, since I thought he would never have put up more? And yet besides my sins and the withdrawings of my own heart, there hath been nothing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt our converse. Though he be God, and I a worm, yet that would not have kept me out: Though he be in Heaven, yet he is near to succour
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62989:76"/>
me on Earth, in all that I call upon him for: Though he have the praise of Angels, he disdaineth not my Tears and Groans: Though he have the perfect Love of perfect Souls, he knoweth the little Spark in my Breast, and despiseth not my weak and languid Love: Though I injure and dishonour him by loving him no more; though I oft forget him, and have been out of the way when he hath come or called me; though I have disobediently turned away mine ears, and unkindly refused the entertainments of his Love, and unfaithfully plaid with those whose company he forbad me, he hath not divorced me, nor turned me out of doors. O wonderful! that Heaven will be familiar with Earth! and God with Man! the Highest with a Worm! and the most Holy with an unconstant Sinner! Man refuseth me, when God will entertain me: Man, that is no wiser or better than my self. Those that I never wronged or deserved ill off, reject me with Reproach: And God whom I have unspeakably injured, doth invite me, and intreat me, and condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth to me, as if he were beholden to me to be saved: Men that I have
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62989:77"/>
deserved well of, do abhor me: And God that I have deserved Hell of, doth accept me. The best of them are Briars, and as a thorny Hedge, and he is Love, and Rest, and Joy: And yet I can be more welcom to him, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Is it not much better thus to converse with him that I must be with for ever, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the place, and the company, and work, and concernments of my perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al abode, then to be taken up with stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in my way, and detained by their impertinencies?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:62989:82"/>I have form'd my self so long in these meditations, that I will but name the rest, and tell you what I had further to have treated on, and leave the enlargement to your own meditations.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I have no reason to be weary of converse with God, seeing <hi>it is that for which all human converse is regardable.</hi> Converse with <hi>man</hi> is only so far desirable as it tendeth to our <hi>Converse with God</hi>: And therefore the <hi>end</hi> must be preferred before the <hi>means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. It is the <hi>Office of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>work of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and the <hi>use</hi> of all the <hi>means of Grace,</hi> and of <hi>all creatures, mercies</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> to reduce our stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing souls to God, that we may converse with him and enjoy him.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Converse with God is most suitable to those that are so near to death</hi>; It best prepareth for it: It is likest to the work that we are next to do. We had rather when <hi>death</hi> comes, be found conversing with <hi>God</hi> then with <hi>Man</hi>: It is <hi>God</hi> that a dying man hath principally to do with: It is <hi>his judgment</hi> that he is going to; and <hi>his mercy</hi> that he hath to trust upon: And therefore it concerneth us to draw near him <hi>now,</hi> and be no strangers to him,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62989:82"/>
lest strangeness <hi>then</hi> should be our ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p n="11">11. How wonderful a condescension is it that <hi>God should be willing to converse with me</hi>! with such a worm and sinful wretch: And therefore how unexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is my crime, if I refuse his company, and so great a mercy!</p>
            <p n="12">12. Lastly, Heaven it self is but our Converse with God and his Glorified ones, (though in a more perfect manner then we can here conceive.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our holy converse with him here is the state that is likest Heaven, and that prepareth for it, and all the Heaven that is on earth.</p>
            <p>IT remaineth now that I briefly tell you, what you should do to attain and manage this Converse with God, in the improvement of your solitude. (For Directions in general for <hi>Walking with God,</hi> I reserve for another place.) At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent let these few suffice.</p>
            <p>Direct. 1. If you would comfortably Converse with God, <hi>make sure that you are Reconciled to him in Christ, and that he is indeed your friend and Father.</hi> Can
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62989:83"/>
two walk together except they be agreed? Can you take pleasure in dwelling with the consuming fire? or conversing with the most dreadful enemy? Yet this I must add, that every <hi>doubting</hi> or <hi>self-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing soul</hi> may not find a pretence to fly from God. 1. That God ceaseth not to be a Father when ever a fearful soul is drawn to question it or deny it. 2. That in the Universal Love and Grace of God to miserable sinners, and in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal act of conditional pardon and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, and in the offers of Grace, and the readiness of God to receive the penitent, there is <hi>Glad Tidings</hi> that should exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly rejoyce a a sinner; and there is sufficient encouragement to draw the most guilty miserable sinner to seek to God, and sue for mercy. But yet the <hi>sweetest converse</hi> is for <hi>children,</hi> &amp; for those that have <hi>some assurance</hi> that they <hi>are children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps you will say, that <hi>this is not easily attained: How shall we know that he is our friend?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In brief, I answer, If <hi>you are unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friends to God,</hi> it is because he <hi>first loved you.</hi> Prefer him before all other friends, and all the wealth and vanity of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62989:83"/>
the world; Provoke him not by wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or neglect: use him as your best friend, and abuse him not by disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or ingratitude; own him before all, at the dearest rates, whenever you are called to it: Desire his presence: Lament his absence: Love him from the bottom of your hearts: Think not hardly of him: Suspect him not; Misunderstand him not: Hearken not to his enemies: Receive not any false reports against him: Take him to be really better for you than all the world: Do these, and doubt not but you are friends with God, &amp; God with you: In a word, <hi>Be but heartily willing to be friends to God, and that God should be your cheifest friend,</hi> and you may be sure that <hi>it is so indeed,</hi> and that you <hi>are</hi> and <hi>have</hi> what you <hi>desire.</hi> And then how delightfully may you converse with God!</p>
            <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Wholly depend on the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Christ, the great Reconciler</hi>: Without him there is no <hi>coming near to God</hi>: But in <hi>his Beloved</hi> you shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Whatever fear of his displeasure shall surprize you, fly presently for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto Christ: whatever guilt shall look you in the face, commit your self and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62989:84"/>
cause to Christ, and desire him to answer for you: When the doors of mercy seem to be shut up against you, fly to him that bears the keyes, and can at any time open to you, and let you in: Desire him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for you to God, to your consciences, and against all accusers: By him alone you may boldly and comfortably converse with God: But God will not know you out of him.</p>
            <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Take heed of bringing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Guilt into the presence of God, if you would have sweet communion with him:</hi> Christ himself never reconciled God to <hi>sin</hi>: And the <hi>sinner</hi> and <hi>sin</hi> are so nearly related, that for all the death of Christ, you shall <hi>feel</hi> that iniquity dwelleth not with God; but he hateth the works of it, and the foolish shall not stand in his sight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that if you will presume to sin because you are his Children, <hi>be sure your sin will find you out.</hi> O what fears, what shame, what self-abhorrence and self-revenge will guilt raise in a penitent soul, when it comes into the light of the presence of the Lord; it will unavoidable abate your boldness and your comforts: When you should be sweetly delighting in his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed face, and promised Glory, you will
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62989:84"/>
be be fooling your selves for your former sin, and ready even to tear your flesh, to think that ever you should do as you have done, and use him as you would not have used a common friend, and cast your selves upon his wrath. But an innocent soul, or pacified conscience, doth walk with God in quietness and delight, without those frowns and fears which are a taste of Hell to others.</p>
            <p>Direct. 4. If you would comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly converse with God, <hi>be sure that you bring not Idols in your hearts</hi>: Take heed of <hi>inordinate affection to any Creature.</hi> Let all things else be nothing to you, that you may have none to take up your thoughts but God. Let your <hi>Minds</hi> be further seperate from them than your <hi>Bodies</hi>: Bring not into solitude or to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a proud, or lustful, or covetous mind: It much more concerneth thee, what <hi>Heart</hi> thou bringest, that what <hi>Place</hi> thou art <hi>in,</hi> or what <hi>work</hi> thou art upon. A mind that is drowned in ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sensuality or passion, will scarce find God any sooner in any wilderness than in a croud (unless he be there return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from those sins to God) where-ever he seeth him, God will not own and be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62989:85"/>
familiar with so foul a soul. <hi>Seneca</hi> could say <hi>[Quid prodest totious regionis silentium, si affectus fremunt?] What good doth the silence of all the Country do thee, if thou have the noise of raging affections within?</hi>] And <hi>Gregory</hi> saith [<hi>Qui corpore remotus vivit, &amp;c. He that in body is far enough from the tumult of human conversation, is not in solitude, if he busie himself with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cogitations and desires: and he is not in the City that is not troubled with the tumult of worldly cares or fears, though he be pressed with the popular crouds.</hi>] Bring not thy house, or land, or credit, or carnal friend along with thee in thy heart, if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and expect to walk in Heaven, and to converse with God.</p>
            <p>Direct. 5. <hi>Live still by Faith; Let Faith lay Heaven and Earth as it were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>: Look not at God as if he were <hi>far</hi> off: set him aways as before you, even as at your right hand; <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.8. Be still with him when you awake, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.18. In the morning thank him for your rest; and deliver up your self to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and service for that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Go forth as with him, and to do his work: Do every action, with the Command of God, and the promise of Heaven before your eyes,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62989:85"/>
and upon your hearts: Live as those that have incomparably more to do with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> than all this world; That you may say with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 37.25, 26. (as aforecited) <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee! and there is none on Earth that I desire besides thee</hi>:] And with <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 1.21. [<hi>To me to Live is Christ, and to Dye is gain.</hi>] You must shut up the eye of sense (save as subordinate to Faith) and live by Faith upon a God, a Christ, and a World that is unseen, if you would know by experience what it is to be above the brutish life of sensualists, and to Converse with God. O Christian, if thou hadst rightly learned this blessed life, what a high and noble soul-conversation wouldst thou have! How easily wouldst thou spare, and how little wouldst thou miss the favour of the greatest, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of any worldly comfort! City or Solitude would be much alike to thee, saving that the place and state would be best to thee, where thou hast the greatest help and freedom to converse with God. Thou wouldst say of human society as <hi>Seneca [Vnus pro populo mihi est, &amp; populus pro uno: Mihi satis est unus, satis est nullus.] [One is instead of all the people to me, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62989:86"/>
the people as one; One is enough for me, and none is enough.]</hi> Thus being taken up with God, thou mightest live in prison as at liberty, and in a wilderness as in a City, and in a place of banishment as in thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Land: For the Earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof: and everywhere thou mayest find him, and converse with him, and lift up pure hands unto him: In every place thou art within the sight of home; and Heaven is in thine eye, and thou art conversing with that God, in whose converse the highest An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do place their highest felicity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
            <p>How little cause then have all the Churches enemies to triumph, that can never shut up a true believer from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his God? nor banish him into such a place where he cannot have his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation in Heaven? The stones that were cast at holy <hi>Stephen,</hi> could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from seeing the Heavens opened, and Christ sitting at the right hand of God. A <hi>Patmos</hi> allowed holy <hi>Iohn</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ, being there in the Spirit on the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.9, 10. Christ never so speedily and comfortably owneth his servants, as when the world
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62989:86"/>
disowneth them, and abuseth them for his sake, and hurls them up and down as the scorn and off-scouring of all. He quickly found the blind man that he had cured, when once the Jews had cast him out, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.35. Persecutors do but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the blessedness and exceeding joy of sufferers for Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11.12.</p>
            <p>And how little Reason then have Christians to shun such sufferings by unlawful means, which turn to their so great advantage? and to give so dear as the hazard of their souls by wilful sin, to escape the honour, and safety, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of Martyrdom?</p>
            <p>And indeed we Judge not, we Love not, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ive not as sanctified ones must do, if we <hi>judge</hi> not that the truest Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Love it not as the Best Condition, in which we may <hi>Best</hi> converse with God. And O how much harder is it to walk with God, in a Court, in the midst of sensual delights, than in a prison or wilderness, where we have none to interrupt us, and nothing else to take us up? It is our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed minds, our earthly hearts, our carnal affections and concupisence, and the pleasures of a prosperous state, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62989:87"/>
are the prison and the Jaylors of our souls. Were it not for these, how <hi>free</hi> should we be, though our bodies were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the straightest room! He is at Liberty that can walk in Heaven, and have access to God, and make use of all the Creatures in the world, to the promoting of this his Heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. And he is the prisoner whose soul is chained to flesh and earth, and confined to his lands and houses, and feedeth on the dust of worldly riches, or walloweth in the dung and filth of gluttony, drunkenness and lust: that are far from God, and desire not to be near him; but say to him, Depart from us, we would not have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy ways: that Love their prisons and chains so well, that they would not be set free, but hate those with the cruellest hatred that endeavour their deliverance. Those are the poor prisoners of Satan, that have not liberty to believe, nor to Love God, nor converse in Heaven, nor seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to mind or seek the things that are high and honourable: that have not liberty to meditate or pray, or seriously to speak of holy things, nor
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62989:87"/>
to love and converse with those that do so: that are tyed so hard to the drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of sin, that they have not liberty one month, or week, or day, to leave it, and walk with God so much as for recreation! But he that liveth in the family of God, and is employed in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him, and doth converse with Christ, and the Host of Holy ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, in reason should not much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his want of friends, or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or accommodations, nor yet be too impatient of any corporal confinement.</p>
            <p>Lastly, be sure then most narrowly to watch your hearts, that nothing have entertainment there, which is against your Liberty of converse with God. Fill not those Hearts with worldly trash, which are made and new-made to be the dwelling place of God. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire not the company which would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish your heavenly acquaintance and correspondency. Be not unfriendly, nor conceited of a self-sufficiency; but yet beware lest under the honest inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous title of a friend, a special, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, prudent, faithful friend, you should entertain an Idol, or an enemy to your Love of God, or a corrival and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62989:88"/>
with your highest friend: For if you do, it is not the specious title of a friend that will save you from the thorns and bryars of disquietment, and from greater troubles than ever you found from open enemies.</p>
            <p>O blessed be that High and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friend, who is every way suited to the upright souls! To their Minds, their Memories, their Delight, their Love, &amp;c. By surest Truth, by fullest Goodness, by clearest Light, by dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Love, by firmest Constancy, &amp;c. — O why hath my drowsie and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted soul been so seldom with him! why hath it so often, so strangely, and so unthankfully passed by, and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served him, nor hearkened to his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est calls! O what is all this trash and trouble that hath filled my memory, and employed my mind, and cheated and corrupted my affections, while my dearest Lord hath been days and nights so unworthily forgotten, so contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously neglected, and disregarded, and loved as if I loved him not! O that these <hi>drowsie</hi> and those <hi>waking</hi> nights, those loitered, lost, and empty hours, had been spent in the humblest converse
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62989:88"/>
with him, which have been dreamed and doted away upon — now I know not what! O my God, how much wiser and happier had I been, had I rather chosen to mourn with thee, than to rejoyce and sport with any other! O that I had rather wept with thee, than laughed with the creature! For the time to come, let that be my friend, that most befriendeth my dark, and dull, and backward soul, in its undertaken progress, and heavenly conversation! Or if there be none such upon earth, let me here take one for my friend! O blot out every Name from my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted heart, which hindereth the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er engraving of thy Name! Ah Lord, what a stone, what a blind ungrateful thing, is a Heart not touched with celestial Love! yet shall I not run to thee, when I have none else that will know me! shall I not draw near thee, when all fly from me! When daily experience cryeth out so loud [NONE BUT CHRIST: GOD OR NOTHING.] Ah foolish Heart, that hast thought of it [Where is that place, that Cave or Desert, where I might soonest find thee, and fullest enjoy thee?
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62989:89"/>
Is it in the wilderness that thou walkest, or in the croud: in the Closet, or in the Church; where is it that I might soonest meet with God?] But alas, I now perceive, that I have a <hi>Heart</hi> to find, before I am like to find my <hi>Lord</hi>! O Loveless, Lifeless, stony heart! that's dead to him that gave it Life! and to none but him! Could I not <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>Think,</hi> or <hi>Feel</hi> at all, methinks I were less dead than now? Less dead, if dead, than now I am alive? I had almost said [Lord, let me never Love more till I can Love thee? Nor think more on any thing till I can more willingly think of thee?] But I must suppress that wish; for <hi>Life</hi> will <hi>act</hi>: And the mercies and motions of <hi>Nature</hi> are <hi>necessary</hi> to those of Grace. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the life of Nature, and in the glimmerings of thy Light, I will wait for more of the Celestial life! My God, thou hast my consent! It is here attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under my hand: <hi>Separate me from what and whom thou wilt, so I may but be nearer thee</hi>! Let me Love thee more, and feel more of thy Love, and then let me Love or be beloved of the world, as little as thou wilt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:62989:89"/>I thought <hi>self-love</hi> had been a more predominant thing: But now I find that Repentance hath its anger, its Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and its Revenge! I am truly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with that Heart that hath so oft and foolishly offended thee! Methinks I <hi>hate</hi> that Heart that is so cold and backward in thy love, and almost grudge it a dwelling in my breast! Alas when Love should be the life of Prayer, the life of holy Meditation, the life of Sermons and of holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and my soul in these should long to meet thee, and delight to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thee, I straggle Lord, I know not whether! or I sit still and wish, but do not rise and run and follow thee, yea, I do not what I seem to do. All's dead, all's dead, for want of Love! I often cry, O where is that place, where the quickening beams of Heaven are warmest, that my soul night seek it out! But whether ever I go, to City or to Solitude, alas, I find it is not <hi>Place</hi> that makes the difference. I know that Christ is perfectly replenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Life and Light, and Love Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: And I hear him as our Head and Treasure proclaimed and offered

to us in the Gospel! This is thy Record, that he that hath the Son hath Life! O why then is my barren soul so empty! I thought I had long ago consented to thy offer; and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Covenant, both He and Life in him are mine! And yet must I still be dark and dead!</p>
            <p>Ah dearest Lord, I say not that I have too long waited! but if I <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue thus</hi> to wait, wilt thou never find the time of Love? and come and own thy gasping worm? wilt thou never dissipate these clouds, and shine upon this dead and darkened soul? Hath my Night no Day? Thrust me not from thee, O my God! For that's a Hell, to be thrust from God. But sure the cause is all at home, could I find it out, or ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her could I cure it! It is sure <hi>my</hi> face that's turned from God, when I say, His face is turned from me. But if my Life must here be out of sight, and hidden in the Root (with Christ in God,) and if all the rest be reserved for that better world, and I must here have but these small begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, O make me more to Love, and long for the blessed day of thine appearing,

and not to fear the time of my deliverance, nor unbelievingly to linger in this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> as one that had rather stay with sin, then come to thee! Though sin hath made me backward to the <hi>fight,</hi> let it not make me backward to receive the Crown; Though it hath made me a loiterer in thy work, let it not make me backward to receive that wages, which thy Love will give to our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, poor, accepted services. Though I have too oft drawn back, when I should have come unto thee, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with thee in thy ways of Grace, yet heal that unbelief, and disaffection, which would make me to draw back, when thou callest me to possess thy Glory? Though the sickness and lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my soul have hindered me in my journy, yet let their painfulness help me to desire to be delivered from them, and to be at home, where (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interposing nights of thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure) I shall fully feel thy fullest Love, and walk with thy Glorified on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:62989:91"/>BUT now I have given you these few Directions for the <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your solitude for converse with God,</hi> lest I should occasion the hurt of those that are unfit for the Lesson I have given, I must conclude with this Caution (which I have formerly also published,) That it is not malencholly or weak-headed persons, who are not able to bear such exercises, for whom I have written these Directions. Those that are not able to be much in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious solitary thoughtfulness, without confusions and distracting suggestions, and hurrying vexatious thoughts, must set themselves for the most part to those duties which are to be done in company by the help of others; and must be very little in solitary duties: For to them whose natural faculties are so diseased or weak, it is <hi>no duty,</hi> as being <hi>no means</hi> to do them the desired good; but while they strive to do that which they are naturally unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, they will but confound and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract themselves, and make themselves unable for those other duties which yet they are not utterly unfit for. To such persons therefore instead of order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62989:91"/>
well-digested Meditations, and much time spent in secret thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it must suffice that they be brief in secret Prayer, and take up with such occasional abrupter. Meditations as they are capable of, and that they be the more in reading, hearing, conference, and praying and praising God with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: untill their melancholly distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are so far overcome, as that (by the direction of their Spiritual Guides) they may judge themselves fit for this improvement of their Solitude.</p>
