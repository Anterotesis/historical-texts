            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true bill of the whole number that hath died in the Cittie of London, the citty of Westminster, the citty of Norwich, and diuers other places, since the time this last sicknes of the plague began in either of them, to this present month of October the sixt day, 1603. With a relation of many visitations by the plague, in sundry other forraine Countries.</head>
            <p>IT is no doubt that the corruption of the ayre, together with vncleanly and vnwholsome kéeping of dwelling, where many are pestered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as also the not obseruing to haue fiers priuate &amp; publiquely made as well within houses, as without in the stréets, at times when the ayre is infected, are great occasions to increase corrupt and pestilent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases. Neither can it be denied, that the ouer-boldnes of many preasing into infected places, and the lewdnes of others with sores vppon them, presuming into the open ayre, some of wilfulnes, but truly many of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, contaminateth &amp; corrupteth diuers: as the Leprosie, the Pocks, and sundry such vncleane diseases doo: as by drinking, lying in company, and other such meanes, where pure complexions and cleane bloods are defiled with such as are putrified: and therefore carefully to be auoyded. But all these are accidentall, and rather effects then the cause.</p>
            <p>Then first this Citty of London cannot be denied, to haue had as great blessings as euer had Ierusalem, for héere God hath long time béen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by his Word and Sacraments, yet they haue abounded in all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, when Ierusalem long since had not a stone left vpon a stone.</p>
            <p>In the yéere of Christ, 81. and in the yere 188. there continued a great time a plague in Rome, of which there daily died two thousand people.</p>
            <p>In the yéere 254. fiftéene prouinces of the Romaine Empire, were in a manner consumed with the pestilence.</p>
            <p>In the yéere 530. there died in Constantinople fiue thousand a day, and diuers times tenne thousand: and at that time, in some other parts of Gréece, there were not sufficient liuing men left to bury their dead.</p>
            <p>And in the yéere 1569. there fell such a plague in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that there died in sixe months space, 7. hundred thousand persons, and the yéere following fell such a famine, that a penny loafe of bread of English mony, was worth a crowne of gold: by reason whereof, the people died as fast then of the famine, as they did before of the plague.</p>
            <p>In the yéere 540. there began an vniuersall plague all ouer the world, that continued 50. yéeres with great violence.</p>
            <p>In the yéere 1348. in <hi>Paris</hi> in Fraunce, there died a hundred thousand people of the Plague.</p>
            <p>In the yéere 1359. so great a pestilence there was in Italy, that there were scarce tenne left of a thousand. And in the yéere 1521. there died in Rome a hundred thousand of the pestilence.</p>
            <p>In the yéeres 1576. and 77. in Millan, Padua, and Uenice, there fell a hundred thousand in euery Citty: and in Bohemia (béeing but a small Kingdome) there died thrée hundred thousand the same time.</p>
            <p>Soone after the conquest of King <hi>William,</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> when the people were subdued to him, and the Knights fés rated which he had made, and himselfe placed with crowne and scepter, hee tooke number of the acres of land in all the realme, and of all the people, and of all the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: after which fell so sore a plague, that the people died in such number that tillage decaied, and famine ensued, with rot of cattell, that men were faine to eate flesh of dogs, cats, &amp; mise. A fearefull example for Princes.</p>
            <p>In the raigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, there fell a very great pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the East-Indies, among the Tartarians, Saracens, &amp; Turks, which lasted the space of seauen yéeres: through the feare whereof, many of the Heathens willingly offered themselues to become Christians. And shortly after, by reason of passengers from one Prouince to another, the same pestilence was dispersed in many Christian Kingdoms, &amp; amongst other places, brought into England: where it was so forcible all ouer the Land, that not onely men, but also beasts, birds, and fishes were smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten therewith, and found dead with botches vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Also among men, the number y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were left aliue, were scarely sufficient to bury their dead. At which time, with the rest that then died of the plague, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Lancaster, <hi>Blanch</hi> Dutchesse of Lancaster, and the Earle of Warwicke ended the liues. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in one yéere, in a little plot of ground of 13. acres compasse, then called Spittle-croft, and now the Charter-house, was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried fifty thousand persons, besides all them that were then buried in the Churchyards, and diuers places in the fields.</p>
            <p>Also in Barbarie, Alexandria, Tripolie, and in Constantinople, this last yéere 1602. fell so grieuous a plague, that there died thréere thousand a day for a long time together.</p>
            <p>Our visitations, though our sinnes excéede, haue beene more gentle. For in the first great plague in our memory after the losse of Newhauen, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the first of Ianuary 1562. to Decemb. 1563. there died of the plague, twenty thousand, one hundred, thirtie sixe.</p>
            <p>And in the last great visitation, from the 20. of December 1592. to the 23. of the same month in the yéere 1593. died in all 25886. of the plague in and about London, 15003. And in the yéere before, 2000.</p>
            <p>God of his mercy, as he did then, hold his heauy hand from vs, and giue vs true repentance, the onely meane to win his grace toward vs.</p>
            <p>And now in this present visitation which it pleaseth God to strike vs with, there hath died from the 17. of December 1602. to the 14. of Iuly 1603. the whole number in London and the liberties, 4314. Whereof of the plague, 3310. The rest are set downe as they haue followed wéekely.</p>
