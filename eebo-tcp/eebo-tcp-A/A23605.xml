            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

EPISTLE DEDICATORY,
To the Right Honourable
EVELIN
EARL OF
KINGSTON.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My LORD,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE deserving Patron reads
the Dedication with a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as curious, as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Poet feels when writing
it; both equally afraid of any Thing
that looks like Flatt'ry. But Your
<pb facs="tcp:31658:4"/>
Lordship may be, (at present) as easie
in a Poet, as I am happy in a Patron;
You are above it; and I think, I
need take no great Pains to Vindicate
the Assertion, since I shall make it my
business in this Address to convince
Your Lordship, that 'tis below ev'n
me. Nor will I, with industrious Art,
couch Flatt'ry under the pretence: of
disavowing it. I would not apply to
any Person, whom I believe not every
way Noble; I am a Stranger to Your
Lordship, I mean, so far a Stranger,
as only to know Your Lordship by
the Opinion of the World, and by
the Character Mankind has given you:
Why should I then run out on your
<hi>Encomiums,</hi> and only Eccho to the
World what I first hear'd from them?
All that becomes me to say at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
is, that I agree with the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Consent of either Sex, and make
one to fill the Train of your Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
<pb facs="tcp:31658:4"/>
To whom can I more fitly
present the <hi>Art of Love,</hi> than to Your
Lordship? You are the Lover in all
the several Scenes of Life, the Courtier,
the Husband, and the Widdower;
you were the Lover of your Wife, you
<hi>lov'd</hi> beyond the Fashion, you <hi>lov'd</hi> her
tho' your Wife; you were the Lover of
your Wife, and are the Lover of your
Children. So fond you are of those
young Pledges of your Nuptial Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
you seem the admiring Courtier
of them, you seem wedded to them,
you seem the <hi>very Father of Love</hi> it
self. Hence 'tis that this Book, the
Child of Love, flies to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for Protection. 'Tis an Original,
not Copied after <hi>Ovid;</hi> for <hi>Ovid's</hi> Book
indeed cannot be properly said with
modesty, to be the <hi>Art of Love.</hi> Where
his Precepts are virtuous, as they fall
in naturally to the purpose, I could
not well avoid them; for every Man
<pb facs="tcp:31658:5"/>
that Loves, runs fondly, (I may say
without Thought almost,) on the same
amorous Expressions. How far I have
Succeeded in the Attempt, Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
can best Judge, who are the
greatest Master in all the Noble In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
of generous Gallantries; Your
Approbation of it will sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it to the Fair, and Crown
with Success, the Wishes of</p>

                  <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE Bookseller has prevail'd on
me to Write something by
way of Preface, with which
I should not otherwise have
troubled the Reader, or my self.</p>
                  <p>When the Title of this Poem is read,
'twill, doubtless, be concluded that 'tis a
Translation of <hi>Ovid De arte Amandi,</hi>
but in my Opinion. <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Book <hi>De
arte Amandi</hi> cannot <hi>justly</hi> be English'd
into <hi>The Art of Love;</hi> 'tis rather the
Art of something else. His Poem, I am
positive, cannot be <hi>Modestly,</hi> and, <hi>Litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:31658:6"/>
Translated. He has taken such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
with the <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies, as I am
sure, the most Airy of our <hi>English</hi> Ladies
would blush to allow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cupid</hi> may be drawn, he's but a Child;
be has been drawn, but always Blind;
the Poets thought not fit to give him
Eyes, least he should see the Nakedness
of his Mother's Beauty. <hi>Venus</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
painted Naked, and therefore <hi>Venus</hi>
should not be painted.</p>
                  <p>That there are greater Masters in
Poetry than I, must be confest, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it here, and all I write con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
it; but that there are greater Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in Love I will not easily allow. He
who has serv'd his Time to a Trade, in
all probability, has had the best Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of understanding the Crafts which
may be practicable in it; and he who
has the greatest Stock, when he sets up,
<pb facs="tcp:31658:6"/>
is capable of making the greatest Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>Now half my 'Life I have been bound to
Love, and I have serv'd a rigid Mistress
faithfully, too faithfully ever to have
made Advantage in her Service. O
what a load of Love have I upon my
Hands, upon my Heart! My Liberty
seems now to me the greatest Bondage;
for I can never perfectly grow free from
my first Slavery, unless it could be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that I could serve again. Thus, from
the <hi>Art of Love,</hi> I wander insensibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Nature of it; and I may hence
infer that should I ever endeavour again
to Love (for sure I must endeavour it,
if e're I do) <hi>Amasia's</hi> Memory would
still be dearer to my Soul than any other
living Charmer.</p>
                  <p>To make some Application of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
digression, to my present purpose, I
shall confess, without a Blush, I have
<pb facs="tcp:31658:7"/>
lov'd indeed, lov'd with all the Fondness
and with all the Passion that any Poet
can Express. Why should I be asham'd
of what was unavoidable? The Folly
seiz'd me Young, and Love and Poetry
grew up together. But I'll neither praefix the
time, nor oblige my self to the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of either, by making Vows to the
contrary: Lovers and Poets keep equally
their Resolutions; or good or ill Success
sets them on edge again. To Love I owe
Poetry, to Poetry all the Misfortunes of
my Life.</p>
                  <p>I Lov'd—that brings me again to what
I have left already twice unmention'd where
I had design'd it; I lov'd—I felt all I
writ, and thence conclude I have writ natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
on the Subject, if naturally where I talk
of my own Passion, then may I hope too I
have write Artificially on others, for to others
I have Copied out my own Original. I
have felt Love, and I think, he who has
<pb facs="tcp:31658:7"/>
felt it, can best teach others how to
feign it. I am positive, he who never
felt it, can never Feign it well, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
grow <hi>Naturally</hi> Artificial in it. He
who never knew what Gold was, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gild a Counterfeit. <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
had been in Love, or he had never
fraim'd his Maid of Iv'ry; my fancy has
not been unlike <hi>Pigmalion's,</hi> for my <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masia</hi>
is my lv'ry Maid. O happy Artist!
But I shall ne're be the <hi>Pigmalion</hi> here.
His Art was the Reverse of mine; his
Statue grew a perfect Woman; his Art
was the Cause of very Nature, but mine is
the Effect.</p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Ovid; Ovid</hi> is my
Friend, my Favourite, I admire him in
his way of Writing, as much as I can
any Author; I admire him, and I love
him, but still my Passion for him is like
the blushing, vertuous Virgin's for her
Lover, and I must quarrel with him when
<pb facs="tcp:31658:8"/>
he grows too free in his familiarity:
He is here and there loose in all his
Writings, but the very Design of his Poem
call'd <hi>De arte Amandi</hi> is not only loose
but lew'd. Some Precepts there are Modest
in't, 'tis true; for what Man can at all
times play the Libertine? Where they are
so, I have sometimes imitated him, and
as far as Modesty allows, I may say, with
Modesty, my Poem is <hi>Ovidian.</hi> 'Twill
not be kind in me to Attribute the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of his Banishment to the looseness of his
Writings, tho' in one of the Elegies of his
<hi>De Tristibus</hi> inscrib'd to <hi>Caesar,</hi> he seems
to imagine <hi>That</hi> the Cause; (I say, imagine,
for, to me he seems not to have been fully
satisfy'd in the Cause of it himself.) Nor
would it look friendly in me to recite some of
the loosest of his Lines; I shall content my
self at present, (since 'tis my business to
prove him immodest in his Poem of <hi>Amandi</hi>)
only with a Verse or two where he speaks of
his own Work. Before he enters on his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
he says—
<pb facs="tcp:31658:8"/>
                     <q>
                        <l>Este procul vittae tenues, insigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doris,</l>
                        <l>Quaeque tegis medios, instita longa,
pedes.</l>
                     </q>
herein he plainly says that Modesty has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do in his Art, and that those who
are Chast must shun it. by this Advice, and
the Confession in the following Line,—
<q>Nos venerem tutam, concessaque Furta
canemus.</q>
he seems to own himself a Criminal; but
when he Writes <hi>de Remedio Amoris,</hi> he
does not only confess, but he seems to boast
his Crime.—
<q>
                        <l>Thais in arte mea est: Lascivia libera
nostra est:</l>
                        <l>Nil mihi cam vitta est: Thais in arte
mea est.</l>
                     </q>
all I have said amounts to only this; if any
modest Man attempts to translate <hi>Ovid de
<pb facs="tcp:31658:9"/>
arte Amandi,</hi> he must both alter and omit,
if he would still be thought a modest Man;
and when he has done so, the Poem will be
<hi>his,</hi> not <hi>Ovid's.</hi> if literally he translates
him, and makes him Chast, let his next
Vndertaking be to wash an <hi>Aethiopian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Poem, I have ventur'd to call <hi>The
Art of Love,</hi> if it Succeeds, 'twill be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

                     <l>As Bees draw Honey from the blooming flowers.</l>
                     <l>Seeking sweet Love, we, like the Boy grow blind,</l>
                     <l>And feel the sting, as we the Honey find.</l>

                     <l>Sweet as they are, yet they are sharp, as sweet.</l>

                     <head>The Vision.</head>
                     <l>YOung, Infant Love is in fair Gardens nurst,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Amasia</hi> charm'd me in fair Gardens first.</l>
                     <l>Roving thro' flowry Gardens, fragrant Bow'rs,</l>
                     <l>I first beheld her on a Bed of Flow'rs.</l>
                     <l>All ore surpris'd, all ravisht with the view,</l>
                     <l>Soft, Infant sighs with painful risings flew,</l>
                     <l>My Blood thrill'd quick, and light'nings peirc'd me thro'.</l>
                     <l>My panting Heart did with short tremblings move,</l>
                     <l>In all the longing Agonies of Love.</l>
                     <l>Her blooming Beauties did my wonder raise,</l>
                     <l>The more I gaz'd, the more I wish'd to gaze.</l>
                     <l>I gaz'd, and sigh'd, then, sighing gaz'd again,</l>
                     <l>And was at once all extasie, and pain.</l>
                     <l>

Methinks, I see her, as she then was lay'd,</l>
                     <l>With careless Charms on the fair, painted Bed.</l>
                     <l>Her fragrant breath perfum'd the Neighb'ring air,</l>
                     <l>And all the Flow'rs spread more than usual fair.</l>
                     <l>With her loose Robes did wanton <hi>Zephirs</hi> play,</l>
                     <l>And flew in whistlings, as if pleas'd, away.</l>
                     <l>One Snowy Hand did in her Bosom lye,</l>
                     <l>The other thrown, as if neglected, by;</l>
                     <l>On that she lean'd her Head in soft repose,</l>
                     <l>While her dear Breasts with swelling motions rose.</l>
                     <l>At awful distance did I wondring stand,</l>
                     <l>E're I approach'd to kiss her Beauteous Hand.</l>
                     <l>Softly I mov'd to the Celestial Maid,</l>
                     <l>As if not she, but I the Theif had play'd.</l>
                     <l>Gently I kneel'd, afraid to wake the fair,</l>
                     <l>And view'd the wond'rous charm of Beauty there.</l>
                     <l>My courage quite forsook my sickly Soul,</l>
                     <l>And hopes and fears did in my fancy rowl.</l>

Thro' tedious strugglings of my thoughts I broke,</l>
                     <l>And kiss'd her Hand, before she yet awoke.</l>
                     <l>Thus, with short tremblings still I fondly prest,</l>
                     <l>And kiss't, and sigh'd, and then again I kiss't.</l>
                     <l>Assaults too feirce at last my flames did make,</l>
                     <l>Too much I Lov'd her, now too soon awake.</l>
                     <l>In hast, the frighted Virgin trembling rose,</l>
                     <l>Nor look'd behind, fled me, and fled repose.</l>
                     <l>Silent I stood, and saw her hast away,</l>
                     <l>No power was left me but the power to stay,</l>
                     <l>And fall all ravisht, where the charmer lay.</l>
