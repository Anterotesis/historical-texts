            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>James Standsfield,</hi> the Subject of this
Tragical Relation, was Born in <hi>England,</hi>
whence in his younger Years he went into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and was Secretary to the Famous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General <hi>Morgan,</hi> upon His Late Majeſties happy
Reſtauration; and the Armies Disbanding, he betook
himſelf to Merchandizing, and very conſiderably in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
of Monies betwixt the Two Kingdoms: In
which he behaved himſelf with that Honour, Juſtneſs
and Punctuality, as ſoon made him Rich and Eminent,
and alſo well known to His Late Majeſty, and the
Greatest Perſonages of both Courts, and Kingdoms. He
was a Gentleman of a Publick Spirit, and having Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a <hi>Scotch</hi> Lady, and gain'd a conſiderable Eſtate
in that Kingdom, ſought all Ways, Juſt and Honourable
to do it good: And amongſt others, at a vaſt Expence,
ſettled the Linnen and Woollen Manufactures at his own
Seat, called <hi>New-Milns,</hi> near <hi>Hadington,</hi> a
few Miles on this ſide <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where not only great
Sums of Money, but Hundreds of poor People were
Employ'd, and Conveniences made for their Working,
from the Wool to the Draper's Shop, as was generally
known in that Kingdom, and alſo in this. He was a
Gentleman of that Sobriety, Temperance, and diſcreet
<pb facs="tcp:37914:3"/>
Behaviour, as obliged all Perſons he had Converſe with;
and I have heard ſome Perſons of Quality, that knew
him Intimately for Thirty Years, ſay, they neither ſaw,
nor ever heard of ſo much as one Intemperate, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morral
Act that he was guilty of. Yet this worthy
good Gentleman fell by the Hands of his most Cruel and
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nnatural Eldeſt Son, even in his own Bed-Chamber,
a Son to whom he had given very Liberal Education,
and whoſe repeated Extravagancies had coſt many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds.
Still hoping that his Tenderneſs and Indulgence
towards him, together with a Sight of his Errors, would
as he grew in Years reclaim him; but inſtead thereof,
as he increaſed in Years, he increaſed in Vice, and ſuch
a Riotous Courſe of Living, as rendred a plentiful An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Allowance not ſufficient for a Month. Being thus
Arrived to a mighty height in all manner of Wickedneſs, a
low Ebb of Fortune, and nothing but his Fathers Life
ſtanding betwixt him and a plentiful Eſtate: The want
of Grace, and the Strength of the Tempter put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
perpetrating the Horrid Fact, which notwithſtanding
all Endeavours was uſed to bring him to Confeſs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of, yet he remained Obſtinate to his laſt moment;
which ſome attribute to the Shame that muſt naturally
be the Conſequent of ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nnatural and Bloody a Fact.</p>

preſume and dare to begin a Health to the Confuſion of His Sacred <hi>Majeſty,</hi>
his native Soveraign, and did drink off the ſame, and cauſed others in his
Company do the like. And ſicklike Sir <hi>James Standsfield</hi> of <hi>New-milns</hi> his
Father, haveing cauſed Educat and bring him up Decentlie, and in plenty
conform to his Rank and Quality, and having left no means uneſſayed for
his Literature, Education and Subſiſtence; yet he being a profligate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
Perſon, did commit, and was acceſſory to ſeveral notorious Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,

Priſoner, as in the <hi>Marſhal-Sea-Priſon</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> in the publick Priſions

Malice and Prejudice againſt the ſaid Sir <hi>J. S.</hi> his Father, and moſt barbarouſly

of them moſt wickedly, unnaturally, and bitterly Rail upon, abuſe
and Curſe the ſaid Sir <hi>James Standsfield,</hi> his natural and kindly Parent,
And being tranſported with rage and malice, he did, contrary to the light
and tyes of Nature, not once, but often, and frequently curſe his Father,
by bidding, and praying the <hi>Devil</hi> to take him, and the Devil rive him.

went back with his Accomplices to a little Kiln near by, and conſulted and

adviſed, whether it was more fit to throw him in the Water, with the Stone
about his Neck, to make him ſink, or to take away the Stone, leaſt when
he ſhould be found, it might thereby appear that the Stone had been tyed
by ſome other hand than his own; and at laſt reſolved to take away the Stone,
and throw his Body in the Water, which they returning, did accordingly
And ſome Perſons being accidentally lying in the Houſe at the time, they did
hear a Noiſe of many Tongues and Voices, to their great Terror and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement;
And the next Morning very early, ſome of the Servants in the
Houſe, having come to the Roum, where his ſaid Father did lye, and having
miſſed him out of the Roum, gave notice thereof, to ſome others of the
Servants. He declared that he had been ſeeking him about the Water-pools;
and a Noiſe and Cry having ariſen, Search and Inquiry was made for his ſaid
Father: (and by him ſeemingly amongſt the reſt) And after ſome time
his Body was found in the Water hard by his own Houſe, and being dead,
and his Neck broken before he was thrown in the Water, his Body did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſink to the ground, nor receive Water, (as all drowned Bodies are in

on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Morning directly to the place where his Body was in the
Water, and ſtood a conſiderable ſpace upon the Water-ſide, directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite

(a ſtranger) paſſing that way, and ignorant of the whole Matter, or
that Sir <hi>James</hi> was amiſſing, called to him, and asked, who that was in the

<hi>New-Milns,</hi> and gave no intimation to him, or any other Perſon what he
had ſeen in the Water, but appeared ſurpriſed when his Body was found there,

deſired by the Friends and Servants preſent, to ſuffer his Fathers dead Body
to be carryed to his own Houſe, and kept therein, and not to be buried
till his Friends in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and elſwhere, and Phyſicians in <hi>Haddintoun,</hi>

him, and his Accomplices: Order was given by theſe in Authority, to

And accordingly, by the Report of the ſaids Chirurgians who inſpected the
Body, it did appear, that his ſaid Father was cruelly ſtrangled and murdered,
and not drowned, and that he had been caſt in the water of purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal

ſaid is, ſo as the leaſt Blood was not on it, did (according to God's uſual
Method of diſcovering Murders) blood afreſh upon him, and defiled all his
hands, which ſtruck him with ſuch a terrour, that he immediately let his
Father's Head and Body fall with Violence, and fled from the Body, and
in conſternation and confuſion, cryed, <hi>Lord, have Mercy upon me,</hi> and

them to compeir and plead the Pannals Defence.</opener>
                  <p>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> for the Pannal (always denying the Inditement, and
whole members and qualifications thereof) alleadges, That as to the firſt
part of the Inditement, in relation to the drinking an Health to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of his Sacred <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as it is moſt calumnious, ſo it is not to be
ſuppoſed, that any man in his right wits would have been guilty of ſuch a
thing; And it is poſitively offered to be proven, that at or about the time
lybel'd, and ſeveral times before and after, the Defender did moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
and chearfully in ſeveral Companies drink the King's Health, and upon
all occaſions he was ready to teſtifie his Loyalty to the King, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the time of the Invaſion by the late Duke of <hi>Munmouth</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
where he did enter himſelf voluntarly a Souldier in the Earl of <hi>Dumbarton</hi>'s
Regiment, and continued in the King's Army till the Rebels were defeat, and
the Voluntiers diſmiſſed.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond part of the Libel, in relation to the Pannal, his alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
commiting and being guilty of, and acceſſory to many notour Crimes
abroad, and being detained Priſoner in <hi>London, Antwerp, Orleance,</hi> &amp;c. and
that he vented and entertained malice againſt his Father, and that he declared
many times that he would cut his Throat, and that he did rail againſt and
curſe his Father, by many Imprecations.</p>
                  <p>It is anſwered, <hi>primo,</hi> That it is abſolutely deny'd, that the Pannal was
guilty of, or acceſſory to any notorious Crime abroad, or put in Priſon upon
that account, nor is there ſo much as any Crime condeſcended upon.</p>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The Defender could not conceive any prejudice againſt his Father,
upon the account of Diſponing his Eſtate to his ſecond Son; for he knew
nothing thereof till after his Father's deceaſe, that one <hi>Alexander Ainſlie</hi>
told him that his Father made ſuch a Diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to the pretended Expreſſions, that the Defender ſhould have had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37914:6"/>
of Railing, Curſing, and uſing Imprecations againſt his Father, in ſo far as
the ſamen are lybel'd to have been done abroad, in <hi>England, Holland,</hi> or
other places, he cannot be lyable to the puniſhment inflicted by the Law of
this Kingdom, becauſe when a party commits a Crime in another Nation,
he is only to be puniſhed according to the Law of the place where the Crime
was committed, and not according to the Law of the Nation where he is
a Subject, or has his dwelling: As is clear by the Common Law, Authentick
<hi>Cod: ubi de criminibus agi oportet, Qua in provincia quis delinquit, ant in qua
pecuniarum aut criminum reus ſit, ſive de terra, ſive de terminis, ſive de poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione,
ſive de proprietate, ſive de hypotheca, aut de alia qualibet occaſione, vel de
qualibet re fuerit reus illic jure ſubjaceat, quod jus est perpetuum.</hi> In that
Nation where any Perſon commits a Crime, or is lyable to anſwer upon any
account whatſomever, he is to be judged by the Law of that place, which is
eſtabliſhed as a perpetual Law, and <hi>Mattheus de Criminibus,</hi> in his title, <hi>de
poenis,</hi> is expreſs of the ſame opinion.</p>
                  <p>4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to all thoſe pretended Expreſſions of railing, curſing, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
lybel'd, that were before <hi>March,</hi> 1685. The Defender is ſecured by
the Act of Indemnity, by which all Crimes are indemnified, preceeding that
time, againſt the Government and Laws.</p>
                  <p>5<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to any pretended Expreſſions, of railing and curſing, ſince that
time, they being but Injuries alledged done to the Father, he might and
did remit the ſamen, in ſo far he did not challenge and purſue the ſame
in his own time, and this is clear from the Common Law, <hi>Carpzov. Part</hi> 2.

injuria;</hi> and if it could be made appear, that the Pannal had any ſuch
Expreſſions, the Father did diſſimulat and paſs from the ſame, in ſo far as
by a Letter, dated in <hi>June</hi> laſt, written by the Father to the Pannel, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
him to take in his Chamberlain Accompts of the Rents of his Lands,
and of any Money he had received from the Tenements, or for the Corns
ſold, and that he expects he will do the ſame exactly, and recommends to
him, to be careful of all his Affairs, and ſubſcribes himſelf to be his Loving
Father; By which it is evident, that all former differences (if any were) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them were then taken away.</p>
                  <p>As to the third part of the Indytement, in relation to the ſeveral Acts
and Qualifications inſiſted upon: To inferr, that the Defender had acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to his Father's death. It is anſwered, (<hi>primo</hi>) That the Indytement,
in ſo far as it is founded upon the 51. <hi>Act Par. 11. K. Ja.</hi> 6. in relation to the
Murder under truſt, which is declared to be puniſhable as Treaſon, is not
relevant: Becauſe the Father cannot in Law be ſaid to be under truſt and
aſſurance of the Son, and that Act of Parliament takes only place in Caſes
where a man is invited to his neighbours Houſe, or of an Traveller being in
an Inn, and that he be murdered under that truſt, and the ſame Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
being founded on in the caſe of <hi>Swinton,</hi> who killed his Wife, in the
year 1666. the Inditement was reſtricted to ſimple Slaughter. And in the
caſe of Maſter <hi>James Oliphant,</hi> in the year 1665, The Lords of the Seſſion
found, that a Son's killing his Mother, was not Murder under truſt, and
ſo he was not puniſhable by that Act of Parliament, as guilty of the Crime
of Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The Acts and qualifications condeſcended on to infer the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37914:6"/>
Acceſſion to his Fathers death, are but very remote and uncertain, for
as to that expreſſion, That the defender is alledged to have threatned his
Fathers death, It is the opinion of all Lawyers, who have written upon
the ſubject, that that is but a very remot Preſumption. And as <hi>Carpzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
expreſſes it, <hi>Part. 3. Queſt. 121. Numb. 51. quod est indicium ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum
periculoſum quippe cum homines ſaepe nil minus faciant quam quod
minas exequantur et ira cundia agitatus minas de crimine perpetrando ſaepe

a facinore illo quod forſan ab alio poſtea committitur.</hi> And <hi>Paris de puteo</hi>
gives an inſtance in his <hi>Tractat de ſyndicatu</hi> upon the word <hi>Tortura;</hi> and
<hi>Boverius,</hi> That a Woman ſeeing a Perſon going by her Window, againſt
whom ſhe had a Prejudice, and that another having a hatred againſt her,
and hearing that ſhe had threatned to cut off that Perſons Leggs, the party
that did hear the Woman uſe the threatning, did the thing, upon which the
Woman that did threaten, being challenged, and put to the Torture, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs;
Yet thereafter it was found, that ſhe was altogether innocent, and
that another had done it.</p>
                  <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to the pretended Acts of the Defenders alledged Purſuing, and
Invading his Father, and fireing Piſtols at him, at <hi>Lothian burn and Culter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allors,
in Annis</hi> 1683, and 1684. As it is moſt groundleſs, ſo if need were
it could be made appear by the Perſons who were in company with him at
that time, That the Defender, and his Father, were then in intire friendſhip
all alongſt the journey, and he was ſo far from making any ſuch attempt,
That it can be made appear, that the Defender did behave himſelf towards
his Father, with all the ſubmiſſion and reſpect that became a Son to have to
his Father; But as to theſe and all other Acts preceeding <hi>March,</hi> 1685. the
Defender is ſecured by the Act of Indemnity, and as the Defender cannot be
purſued for any Crime preceeding that time; neither in Judgment nor out
with the ſame, they in effect being no Crimes, being taken away by the
Act of Indemnity, they cannot be ſo much as made uſe of as qualifications
or aggravations to infer another Crime poſterior thereto.</p>
                  <p>4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to that pretended qualification, that when the Defender did touch
his Fathers dead body after it was taken out of the grave, the Corps did bleed.</p>
                  <p>It is anſwered, that this is but a ſuperſtitious obſervation without any
ground either in Law or Reaſon. And <hi>Carpzovius</hi> relates, <hi>Part 3. Queſt.</hi>
122. <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. That ſeveral Perſons upon that ground had been unjuſtly
challenged, and that he in his own experience, had ſeen a dead body bleed
in preſence of a perſon who was not guilty, as alſo that he has ſeen the body
not bleed in preſence of the Perſon that was guilty. And <hi>Mattheus de Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus,</hi>
is of the ſame opinion, <hi>Tit. 16. de Quaeſtionibus, Numb. 12. de
Sanguine porro de Cadavere profluente quod dicitur id de plurimis experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis
comprobetur tamen cum experimenta falſa ſint ratio vero idonea nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la

ſapientis Judicis est incerto experimento credere quod certa ratione di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimendum

was that the Chirurgions that came out to viſit the body, did make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
about the neck, which might be the occaſion of the bleeding, and
alſo the very moving of the dead body when it was taken out of the grave,
and out of the Coffin might occaſion the bleeding; eſpecially ſeeing the
body did not bleed for ſome time after, which certainly was made by the
motion, and by the inciſion: As alſo as a further evidence, that it could not
be the Defenders touching the body, the Chirurgions did likeways touch
the Body as well as he, and ſeveral others preſent, ſo that the bleeding could
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37914:7"/>
no more be aſcribed to his touching, than the touching of the other perſons
preſent.</p>
                  <p>5<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to the other Articles Lybel'd, Relating to the pretended Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
They are but meer ſtories, and the truth is, and it is offered to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
That the Defender having gone to his Chamber and Bed the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Father's death, He did not ſtir out of his Bed, nor out of the Roum,
till the next morning, that <hi>John Robertſon</hi> his Fathers Servant came to his
Chamber, where he was in Bed, and told him that he had been in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
roum, and that he could not find him; Upon which the Defender im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
aroſe, and put on his cloaths, and went out to ſee where his Father
was. And ſhortly after word being brought him, by ſome Perſons in the
Town, that they did ſee his Father's Body lying in the Water, and it being
generally concluded by all, that he had thrown himſelf in the Water, and
the body being taken out, and laid in a Low-Roum; It was thought fit by
all the neighbours about, that he ſhould be buried the next day.</p>

                  <p>7. The preſumptions and qualifications Lybel'd, cannot be ſuſtained
even to infer an Arbitrary puniſhment: Becauſe they may and are taken
off by other preſumptions, That either the Father was not murdered, but
that in a Frainzie or melancholy fit he had thrown himſelf in the Water:
Or at leaſt if he was Murdered, that the Defender had no acceſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and the preſumptions condeſcended upon in behalf of the Defender, to
eleid the preſumptions contained in the Inditement, <hi>are theſe.</hi> That it is
notourlie known, That his Father was ſubject to melancholy fits, and
that in the year 1679, the time of Bothwell-bridge, It is offered to be
proven, that he was in a fit of diſtraction; And at another time in his houſe
at the <hi>Netherbow,</hi> he was going to throw himſelf out over the Window, If
one <hi>Thomas Lindall</hi> had not come in at the time &amp; pulled him back by the
Leggs, when his body was half out at the Window: And ſome few dayes
before he went out of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> laſt, he came to <hi>George Sterling, Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
and deſired him to draw blood of him, for a diſtemper in his head,
which he refuſed, unleſs he had advice from a <hi>Phyſician.</hi> As alſo a day or two
before he went out of the Town, he was ſeen reading upon the Book of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touns
Melancholy.</hi> And that day when he went out of the Town in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Mr. <hi>Bell</hi> the Miniſter, &amp; <hi>Aiton</hi> Merchant in <hi>Haddingtoun,</hi> they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him to be melancholy, diſordered, and more troubled than ordinary; Or
if it could be made appear, that the Father was murdered, Yet it cannot
be preſumed that the Defender had any acceſſion thereto, or that he would
have committed ſuch an Act againſt the very ties and light of nature: As
alſo it appears by the foreſaid letter, written to the Defender by his Father,
that they were in intire Friendſhip; As alſo when the ſurmiſe went abroad,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37914:7"/>
that his Father had been murdered, if he had been conſcious to himſelf that
he had any acceſſion thereto, he would have certainly fled the Countrey,
and gone away: But he was ſo far from that, that upon the firſt rumor of
it he came preſently in to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and ſeveral days thereafter, it being
told him, that he was ſuſpected to have acceſſion to his Fathers Death, he came
voluntarly and entered himſelf in Priſon, that he might undergo the ſtricteſt
and ſevereſt Tryal. Which alone is ſufficient, if it were no more to take off
all the preſumptions Lybel'd, and to convince the World of the Defenders
innocence; And it being a principle in Law, That <hi>una praeſumptio tollit ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
The preſumptions adduced for the Defender ought to be preponderat,
<hi>Maſcard. Concluſ.</hi> 1205. is poſitive, That <hi>preſumptiones quae ſtant pro reis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</hi>
As alſo that <hi>Praeſumptio affectionis naturalis praevalet contrariis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptionibus.</hi>
So that upon both theſe conſiderations, the preſumptions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for the Defender ought to be ſuſtained, to take away the preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Lybel'd, and to free him from the Crime.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſties Advocat anſwers, That the Libel conſiſts of three Articles,
<hi>(Primo)</hi> Treaſon by the Pannal's drinking the King's Confuſion, and by the
Murder under Truſt. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The Curſing of a Parent. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
inferring the Pannal's acceſſion to the Murder of his Father.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, it cannot be denied, but that the drinking or wiſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> is the higheſt Act of Contempt, Malice, and Diſdain to
his Royal Perſon; and as the Relevancy of this Article is not expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverted,
ſo the atrocity of the Act, and the forcing others to do the ſame
upon the common grounds of Law, does clearly infer Treaſon, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be expected, that ſuch extravagant words ſhould either be expreſt, or
particularly provided againſt by any Law in expreſs terms; but the nature
of the words in expreſs terms of our Law diſcharging all Speeches to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> the contempt of his Authority, do clearly and naturally
comprehend the words Libeled, and by the common Law, <hi>Ad leg: jul. Maj.
crimen laeſae Majeſtatis ad exemplum legis ſcriptae est vindicandum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas it is pretended, that theſe words were inadvertantly ſaid,
and that it appears by the tract of the Pannal's life, and his readineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Service, that the words could not be deliberate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious.
It is replyed, That it is offered to be proven, that the drinking
Confuſion to the King, was openly and plainly propoſed; And that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
did deliberately ſend out for Ale to drink certain Healths, and that this
Health to the King's Confuſion was the firſt or ſecond; and that it was no
lapſe or miſtake in the expreſſion; but that he forced others to pledge and
drink that ſame Health: And the malice and diſloyalty is evident by the
Healths ſubſequent, <hi>viz.</hi> Antichriſt's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it is not at all relevant, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the reiterate and deliberat expreſſing of theſe words) that he had retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
or drank the King's health; for a crime once committed, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
or taken off by ſuch inconſiſtent and unconſequential Speeches; But
to ſhew the ſence the Pannal had of the importance of his own words, the
Pannal being informed, that ſome of the perſons preſent had divulged his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
drunk the King's Confuſion, the Pannal did conjure them to ſecrecie,
and did menace the Witneſſes with a great Kane, that he would beat and
brain them if ever they told it.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is anſwered in general, as to all Crimes committed without
the Kingdom, that they cannot be cognoſced or puniſhed here. It is reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That as to all Crimes againſt Nature or the Law of Nations, as every
party is competent to be an Accuſer, ſo every Judicature is competent, and
therefore as to the crimes of Treaſon, or Curſing of Parents, wherever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37914:8"/>
they are puniſhable by the Juſtices: But becauſe in relation to the
Crimes committed abroad, there is no poſitive Probation, but Declarations
and Teſtimonies; Therefore as to theſe Crimes, His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Advocat does
not inſiſt on them as diſtinct Crimes <hi>per ſe,</hi> but as Qualifications, Documents
and Evidences of the habitual Debauchry, and unnatural Malice expreſt by
the
Pannal againſt his Father for a Tract of many Years.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is anſwered, That as to all Crimes preceeding 1685, they
are taken off by the Indemnity. It is replyed, The Indemnity 1685, is
no general Indemnity, neither as to Perſons nor Crimes, but particular Crimes
are Remitted, and particularly enumerat without any general Clauſe: And
as Curſing of Parents is not particularly enumerat, ſo by the Nature of that
Crime, it cannot be included or comprehended in any general Indemnity:
And the words of the Act of Parliament, 20. <hi>Act. 1. Par. K.</hi> Ch. 2d. bears
expreſly, <hi>That the Curſers of Parents ſhall be put to death without mercy.</hi> So
that a general Act of Indemnity or Mercy without a ſpecial Remiſſion,
could not include this Crime, which as the Act of Parliament bears, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
againſt Nature and the Law of God: And by the Opinion of all
Lawers, General Indemnities do not extend to all Crimes; but theſe Crimes
which are called in Law <hi>Crimina excepta,</hi> are never intended to be Indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
nor ſuch Crimes, where the Intereſt of Parties is more than the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of publick Juſtice, and in all former and General Indemnities, Murther
and other Crimes are particularly excepted with a general Clauſe, excepting
all ſuch Crimes as uſe not to be comprehended in general Acts of Indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
So that this ſo horrid a Crime, wherein the Parent was more intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than the Publict, neither was nor could be comprehended under a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Indemnity: As alſo that reſtricted, limited Indemnity, bears expreſly an
exoneration for all perſons below the degree and quality of an Heretor, Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetter
or Burgeſs; and whether the Pannal were an Heretor or not, yet it
cannot be ſaid, that he is below the degree and quality of a Wodſetter or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſs;
and therefore the Act of Indemnity is of no uſe to him.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is anſwered, That Sir <hi>James</hi> was reconciled with the Pannal,
and wrote kind Letters to him, whereby <hi>diſſimulando</hi> former Injuries were
taken off. It is replyed, That Injuries are only taken off <hi>diſſimulando,</hi> which
are not atrocious, but never ſpecifick Crimes, wherein the Diſcharge or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Renunciation of the Party injured cannot liberat <hi>a vindicta publica,</hi> the
puniſhment of Crimes, eſpecially in Capital Puniſhments, belonging to the
Magiſtrat, and the privat Party has not the ſole Intereſt, nor can diſpenſe
with Capital Puniſhments: But the Letter founded upon, does not in the
leaſt infer the Parties forgiveneſs or diſſimulation of the injury: And a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ordering his Son to call in for Chamberlain Accompts, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering
him to Diſcharge the ſame, is not the leaſt evidence of confidence
in his Son, much leſs a Remitting of his Crime.</p>
                  <p>And as to the ſecond Article in relation to the Curſing, it is poſitively
offered to be proven, not in ſingle Acts, but by a tract and habit of curſing
his Father in the moſt abominable Termes imaginable.</p>
                  <p>As to the third Article in Relation to the Murder, that this matter may
be clear, <hi>&amp; ut conſtet de corpore delicti,</hi> theſe undoubted Qualifications are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to inſtruct, that Sir <hi>James Standsfield</hi> was murdered and ſtrangled, and
that he did not drown himſelf. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It is offered to be proven by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
that was that night in the Houſe, that long after ten a Clock at night,
and that Sir <hi>James</hi> had retired to the Chamber, where he lay a lone, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
heard the confuſed Whiſpers, Murmurs, and Noiſe of ſeveral perſons,
both Men and Women, which afrighted him, and that he heard the noiſe go
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37914:8"/>
away by the back-ſide of the Houſe, which leads directly to that Pool where
Sir <hi>James</hi> his Body was thrown in the Water.</p>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Body was found ſwimming above the Water, and albeit it
appeared by the Ice upon the top of his Cloaths, that he had been ſeveral
hours in the Water, yet there had no Water entred into his Body, which is a
demonſtration, that he was dead before he was thrown in the Water; for a
perſon thrown alive into Water drawing in of Air and Reſpiration, being in
the Water, he muſt draw in Water, and if the perſon drawes in as much Water
as fills his concavitie, he becomes heavy, having ſo much more weight of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and therefore he ſinks; But if a perſon be thrown dead into the Water,
when the Clap of his Throat is ſhut, the Water cannot enter, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much emptineſs, the Body is light and ſupported by more parts of
Water, than the gravity of the Body can depreſs. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. There being ſeveral
Chyrurgions and others ſent out by order from Authority to take up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the Body; to ſee whether there was any evidence of Strangling, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Symptoms of Murder upon the Body: It did appear to all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who did depone before a Committee of the Privy Council; That from
the one Jugular Vein to the other round the Neck, there was a tumour of
congealed black bruiſed Blood, three inches broad, and that there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
Blood in the Throat, upon which matter of Fact, the Colledge of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
have given an unanimous Teſtimony in writing, that Sir <hi>James Stands<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
was Strangled and not Drowned: And the Deaconry of the Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being conveened, have emitted a Declaration in Writing, concurring
and agreeing with the Report of the Phyſicians; So that it is as clear as the
Light of Day, that Sir <hi>James Standsfield</hi> was murdered.</p>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. For the Qualifications that the Pannal was the Murderer, or acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Murder of his Father, theſe clear evidences are offered, which makes
his Crime without poſſibility to be palliat or denyed. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It is notorious
that the Pannal is a moſt debauched, vitious, pernicious Perſon, and has been
Priſoner or condemned to dy in all the places or Societies he ever haunted;
He entred a Souldier in the <hi>Scots</hi> Regiment where he was condemned to die
at <hi>Treves,</hi> but made his eſcape, and his being in Priſon, in the <hi>Marſhal-Sea-Priſons,
Orleance,</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> (which makes the Circuit of his Travels) are
not denyed; and his profligat life and conſtant drunkenneſs, ſince he came
to the Priſon, is offered to be proven by the Keepers: and as it is unneceſſar
to trace all his Debauches; ſo there is one material point offered to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
That upon the leaſt provocation either by Man or Woman, the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
uſed to ſwear by horrid Oaths, that he would take their lives, though
he ſhould die in the <hi>Graſs-mercat</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Sir <hi>James Standsfield</hi> for theſe Debaucheries having diſheriſhed the
Pannal, and diſponed his Eſtate to his ſecond Son: It is poſitively offered to
be proven, That in the <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>gate</hi> of <hi>Haddingtoun,</hi> in <hi>James Smith</hi>'s Houſe,
the Pannal being told, that his Father would diſheriſh him, he with horrible
Oaths vowed to cut his Fathers throat.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is anſwered to this qualification, That the ſaying that a
Son would cut a Father's throat, is but a remot circumſtance. It is reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That the Law, and all Lawers do agree, That <hi>Minae praecedentes &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
ſequutum,</hi> is a moſt pregnant qualification of that party's Crime, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
where the Threats were to cut a Fathers throat, which of it ſelf was ſo
horrid and unnatural a Villany, that it cannot be doubted he who durſt vow
it, wanted but an occaſion to act it. And it is acknowledged, that though
this be the cleareſt preſumption, yet <hi>per ſe,</hi> it is not full probation: For
though the Son had both vowed it, and reſolved it, yet by an accident he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37914:9"/>
might have been prevented; but the preſumption at leaſt lays the burden,
that except the Pannal could condeſcend, and document, that ſome other
Perſon killed his Father, he muſt be repute the Murderer.</p>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It is offered to be proven, that Sir <hi>James Stansfield</hi> who was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of eminent ſobriety, and veracity, did declare to ſeveral perſons, that
his unnatural Son had attempted his life, and offered violence to his perſon,
and particularly, that he had purſued him on Horſe-back, and fired Piſtols
on him; and that ſame <hi>Friday</hi> before Sir <hi>James</hi> was Murdered, he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that it was not his Debts, or any thing under Heaven that troubled
him, but that his Son, and Family were plotting and contriving his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and the next night he was murdered.</p>
                  <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It is offered to be proven, that the Pannals Mother declared, that
her Son had vowed to be his Fathers death, and that he was a vindictive
Perſon, and that ſhe did apprehend he had murdered him. So as to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
there is a concourſe of the Pannals own Oaths, to murder his Father,
and of his Father and Mothers Declarations, that he had attempted, and
was ſtill plotting the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Qualification is, that that <hi>Saturdays-</hi> night, Sir <hi>James Stans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
came home: The Pannal would not come where his Father was, either
to Supper, or Prayer, and being expreſly deſired by ſeveral Perſons, to go
to his Father, and ſpeak with him: He declared, (that ſame night he was
murdered) he could not endure to ſee, or look upon his Father; and he
had been all that day cloſs with <hi>Thomſon</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> and <hi>Janet Johnſton.</hi>
So after ten hours at even after the Family was gone to Bed, he came
out to <hi>Thomſons</hi> Houſe, which is hard by the Gate, and there in preſence
of <hi>Thomſon,</hi> his <hi>Wife,</hi> and <hi>Jannet Johnſton,</hi> he declared that his Father would
neither give him Money, nor Cloaths, and curſed his Father, and declared
that he would ſhortly make ridd of him, which agrees with what he had
ſeveral times ſaid in other Companies, that he was to be Laird before <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
and that he was ſhortly to be Maſter of all, and none could think
how ſoon. As alſo ſhortly before Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Death, the Pannal's Mother
falling in ſwound, it was ſaid to him, <hi>Philip,</hi> ye will ſhortly want your
Mother; to which he anſwered, by <hi>God</hi> his Father ſhould be dead before
her; And eight days after, his Mother falling again Sick, he repeated the
ſame words, whereby it is evident the Murder was deliberate and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. On the <hi>Sunday</hi> morning, before Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Body was found, <hi>Philip</hi>
came to the Miniſter's Chamber, and told him that his Father was gone
out in the night, and that he had been ſearching for him about the Pools, and
water ſide; and when the Miniſter reproved him for making ſuch inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt his Father, he laughed at him, and went away to the Pool, and
ſtood looking upon his Father in the water, but made no Diſcovery; and
thereafter a ſtranger coming by upon the High-way likeways, ſeeing Sir
<hi>Jame</hi>'s body in the water, he came back and diſcovered the matter; at
which <hi>Philip</hi> ſeemed ſurpriſed, and told that he had ſeen his Father's Body
in the water before, but he did not think fit to be the firſt diſcoverer, which
ſhews, that he was conſcious of his own guilt; other wayes upon the firſt
ſight of his Father in the water, he would have gone to him, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he never laid a hand upon his Father's Body, either to pull him out of
the water, or to carry him into the Houſe, for the dread of ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
diſcovery, and did not allow the Corps to be brought within his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
gates, but cauſed carry the Corps to the Wake-miln, where to cover
the appearance of Strangling upon his Body, he entruſted <hi>Jannet Johnſton</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:37914:9"/>
with the care of woonding him, who was known to be a perſon ſo odious to
Sir <hi>James,</hi> that he could not ſee her for her baſeneſs with the Pannal, and ſhe
did acknowledge, that ſhe had not been for three quarters of a year within
the Houſe before; and yet this infamous Strumpet, who has been Tortured
by order of the Privy-Council, as Acceſſory to the Murder, chiefly intruſted
to ſee the naked body, and the cloaths put on.</p>
                  <p>4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The Pannal did refuſe to ſend for a Chyrurgion, and to let his Father's
Body be ſighted, though the Miniſter, and others did expreſly demand it;
and the <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> in the <hi>Manufactory,</hi> who were acquainted with the <hi>Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-Laws,</hi>
they made a mutiny anent the Burial, till the Corps were ſighted;
yet the Pannal cauſed bury the Corps that ſame night without ſhewing them.</p>
                  <p>The Corps being raiſed by order, and inciſion being made, whereby the
Strangling did clearly appear, and the Corps being dreſſed clean, and Linen
put on, there did appear no blood; but to take off all ſuſpition, the Corps
were lifted up, and the Night cap being wrong put on, it was altered and
changed, and thereafter the Corps were laid down without any blood upon
the Linen; and the Pannal (who to this time had never touched his Father's
Corps) being required to aſſiſt to lift the Body into the Coffin, having taken
his Father by the right ſide of the Head with his left hand, <hi>James Row</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the left, the Pannal's hand was altogether blooding, as if his Hand had
been put in a Veſſel of Blood, which notwithſtanding of all his Impudent
reſolution to the contrary, had that horrible impreſſion, and conviction upon
him, that he let his Father's Head fall to the ground, and cryed out, <hi>O God,</hi>
and run away and went to a Desk in the Church, where he lay groaning and in
confuſion, but durſt never return to touch the Corps, and as there can no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
reaſon be given, but an ordinar and wonderful Providence of God, in
this kind of diſcoveries of Murder: So the Fact was never more evident, and
ſure, though half a dozen of Perſons were bearing the Corps, no mans hands
were bloody but the Pannals, and the Corps being two intire days in the
Grave, in that Weather and Seaſon, the Blood by the courſe of nature was
become ſtagnat and congeal'd, ſo that the former toſſing, and lifting of the
Corps, and even the inciſion itſelf had occaſioned no ſuch effuſion, but only
ſome water or gore; but upon the firſt touch of the Pannal the Murderer,
there appeared abundance of liquid florid Blood, and though this <hi>per ſe</hi>
might not be ſufficient, and as <hi>Mattheus</hi> is cited, it ſhould not inferr Torture,
yet <hi>Mattheus</hi> acknowledges that moſt part do ſuſtain this, as a violent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
oft times experimented, yet in his opinion it is not ſufficient for
Torture, Becauſe Torture being in it ſelf a puniſhment, it cannot be uſed,
except where there is <hi>ſemiplena probatio,</hi> or where the Conſcience of the Judge
is ſatisfied, as to the truth of the Crime, and therefore uſes an extraordinar
courſe, to extort an confeſſion, which proves that this preſumption is <hi>ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plena
probatio per ſe</hi> according to their own grounds.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is alledged, that Capital puniſhment cannot be infered
from conjectures, but from clear and poſitive teſtimonies. It is anſwered,
that the <hi>Lex. vlt: Cod: de probationibus,</hi> clearly ſtates that probation is either,
<hi>Teſtibus, tabulis inſtrumentis documentis &amp; indiciis.</hi> And <hi>Mattheus</hi> ſtates a
particular title upon this ſingle queſtion, <hi>Cap. 6. Titulo 15 deprobationibus,</hi>
and does moſt poſitively determin that Crimes are to be proven <hi>Documentis,
Argumentis &amp; Indiciis.</hi> And it is moſt evident, that the probation which
ariſes from the nature of the thing, which is incapable to be ſoffiſticate, or
impoſed upon, as Witneſſes may be, that kind of probation is the ſureſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is always the ſame, and admits no variation: It's true, and it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that <hi>Argumenta &amp; Indicia</hi> muſt be <hi>clara &amp; evidentia,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37914:10"/>
being <hi>Quod facit fidem Judici,</hi> every mans experience tells him, that
the complication and conjunction of ſo many evident qualifications, though
none of them <hi>per ſe</hi> were ſufficient, yet being all of them joyned, it induces
a greater certainty, than two Witneſſes poſitively deponing upon the Fact.
And therefore the evidence of the probation belongs to the Inqueſt, and the
relevancy that theſe Articles conjoyn'd, or any part of them are ſufficient to
infer the Crime, belongs to the Judge.</p>
                  <p>As to the Preſumptions offered for the exculpation of the Pannal, they are
not at all relevant; for though ſo horrid a Murder is not to be preſumed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Nature, yet being proved, or ſo ſtrongly evinced, it does but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Pannal's greater Guilt; and ſuppoſe that Sir <hi>James Standsfield</hi> was
formerly Melancholy, and had been Frantick in the year 1679, yet it is
known he recovered his Health, and was of a compos'd, ſedat temper of
mind for many years thereafter, and was as capable and diligent about his
Affairs, theſe many years, as he had been formerly, and was ſo conſidered
and employed by the wiſeſt men in the Kingdom; and at the time of his
Death there was no Sickneſs, or returning of Frenzie upon him, but all
that Week he had compoſedly done his Affairs; and did upon the <hi>Saturday,</hi>
when he went Home, diſcourſe rationally upon all the Subjects that occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
But it being ſo clearly documented and proven that he was Strangled,
it is a ridiculous conceit, and there remains no poſſibility that after he was
Strangled, he walked out and drowned himſelf. And as to that Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the Pannal rendered himſelf Priſoner, it was indeed ſuitable to the
reſt of his Impudence, and he did not render himſelf till after the Order to
apprehend him was intimate to him, when he could not Eſcape, and when
he was under Obſervation, and there did not want Project in fixing upon
this Impudence when he could not Eſcape, as an qualification of Innocence,
that he would render.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> David Thoirs <hi>without repetition of the Replyes made by His</hi> Majeſties
<hi>Advocat, doth make his Duply to the foreſaids Replyes, and every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thereof, in order as follows,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p>TO the Firſt, Anent the Treaſonable Words, the Pannals Procurators
oppon their former Anſwers, and the Act of Parliament whereupon
that part of the Ditty is founded, being only in order to ſuch Treaſonable
Speeches adviſedly ſpoken. The conſtant tract of the Pannal's life, in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>Majeſties</hi> good Health at all occaſions, and offering to adventure his
life in his Service in the laſt Rebellion, ſufficiently demonſtrats, that if any
ſuch Expreſſion did eſcape the Pannel, as it is denyed, the ſame was only
raſh and unadviſed, and not deliberate and adviſed, as is required by the Act
of Parliament, to infer the pains libelled; and the qualifications added by
my Lord Advocat, bearing, that the Pannal did conjure the perſons then
preſent to Secrecy, demonſtrats, that the Pannal was <hi>ex incontinenti</hi> hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſorrowful and penitent for the ſame. And it's clear by that excellent
Law of the <hi>Cod,</hi> the words whereof are, <hi>Si quis Imperatori maledixerit, ſi
ex inſania miſerando, ſi ex temeritate, &amp; petulantia temnenda, ſi ex animo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriandi
ad principem remittendum,</hi> which demonſtrats, that by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, ſuch an raſh and unadviſed Expreſſion was never to be laid hold
on to infer a capital Puniſhment, where the Perſon alledged, expreſſer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
was not otherways ſuſpect of Diſloyalty.</p>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Repeats the Defence as to Crimes alledged committed abroad, and
it were againſt reaſon, and equity, that perſons for one and the ſelf-ſame
Crime, ſhould be ſubject to the puniſhments of ſeveral Juriſdictions, where
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37914:10"/>
the puniſhment of the ſaids Crimes are different: But ſeeing my Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat
declares he hath no Probation for theſe alledged Crimes, but Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats
and Affidavits, they cannot be obtruded as a part of the Libel, becauſe
the ſaids pretended Certificats and Affidavits, are neither inſert in the Libel, or
given out to the Pannal, and all Crimes are to be proven <hi>teſtibus, non teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniis;</hi>
and if the cuſtom of Affidavits ſhould be introduced in this Court,
all Pannals (how innocent ſoever) might be murdered, by being deprived
of their unanſwerable Objections againſt the Granters of theſe Affidavits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and therefore they cannot be ſuſtained as a qualification to load the Pannal,
or make the Inqueſt have a prejudicat opinion of him.</p>
                  <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to my Lord Advocat's Reply anent the Act of Indemnity, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Defence and Act of Indemnity is opponed, and bears expreſly Murders,
Robberies, Slaughters, and all other Crimes committed againſt His <hi>Majeſty,</hi>
and Laws of the Kingdom, either by Word, Writ, or Deed, which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
excludes all alledged Crimes, ſaid, done, or committed by the Pannal
before that time, and this favour <hi>&amp; gratia principis,</hi> is to be ampliat and
extended, and not reſtricted, and all His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Judges and Officers of
State are commanded to ſuſtain the ſame, according to the moſt ample In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
for the Pannal, that the Words will allow.</p>
                  <p>4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The pretence that the Pannal was of the quality of a Burger, or a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
is moſt irrelevant, the Pannal having no viſible Fortune at the time,
and as my Lord Advocat himſelf acknowledgeth, no expectation of any
Fortune whatſoever, ſo that if Barons, Burgars, Liferenters, Woodſerters,
and likewiſe theſe who have nothing in poſſeſſion at the time, ſhall be ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the benefit of that Indemnity, it is ſcarce intelligible, to whom, and
for what cauſe the ſame was granted. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. And as to that part of the Reply,
bearing, that this was a privat Injury, and ſo not comprehended within the
Act of Indemnity, the former Defence is opponed, and all pretence of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
Injury was taken away by diſſimulation or death.</p>
                  <p>As to the pretence that the Reconciliation can be no defence againſt the
Libel, as to <hi>vindicta publica,</hi> and that the Letter whereupon the Defence is
founded doth not import a Diſſimulation. It is Duplyed, That the Act of
Parliament being an Comminatory Law, and principally intended in favours
of Parents, the ſame was never yet made uſe of, and it were very hard to
make uſe of the ſame to deprive a Parent of his Child, for any raſh or paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Expreſſion, eſpecially where upon Repentance the Father had remitted
the Injury; but the Father being in effect Judge of the Injury, his remitting
the ſame ought at leaſt to Aſſoilzie the Child, from any capital concluſion. And
as to the alledged habitual Curſing, the ſame is denyed, and the former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
founded upon the Act of Indemnity is repeated and opponed, and the
Libel is opponed, which doth not bear habitual Curſing, but particular Acts
at particular Times.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Qualifications alledged by my Lord Advocat, for clearing
that the Defunct Sir <hi>James Standsfield</hi> was murdered, the Pannal is truly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that for his own Defence, and for clearing of his own Innocence his
Lawers ſhould be neceſſitate to plead any thing relating to his Fathers Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
or way and manner of his Death. But it is duplyed, That the whole
Preſumptions adduced by my Lord Advocat are allanerly fallacious Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and can neither be <hi>ſeparatim,</hi> or complexly relevant to infer any ſuch
thing, becauſe 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That the Miniſter did hear a whiſpering noiſe, and was
thereby terrified, his Terror and Conſternation having (as he himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends)
put him in a Diſorder and Confuſion, he was thereby rendered inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to obſerve or judge of any thing that happened. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That the Body
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37914:11"/>
was ſwiming above Water, imports nothing, the Defunct having a great
Coat of thick Cloth about him, which was ſufficient to keep him floating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.
3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The pretence that there was no Water in the Defuncts Body
when the Chirurgions viſited the ſame, imports nothing becauſe the Defuncts
Body having been ſeveral times ſtirred before that time, by which the water
might have run out, as it actually did (in caſe there was any water within it).</p>
                  <p>4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Albeit where a Man is drowned unwillingly, and endeavors to
breathe, ſo long as he can, his breathing may ſuck-in the Water; Yet if a
Man intend to drown himſelf, he will certainly endeavour all means for quick
diſpatch of himſelf, and thereby keep in his Breath, and the keeping in of
the Breath after that manner was ſufficient, both to keep the Body floating,
and the water from coming in.</p>
                  <p>5<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. To put the matter beyond all queſtion, the Defunct was lying in the
water a conſiderable ſpace from the Bank; And albeit the Ice was not ſo
ſtrong as to have carried a Child, yet the Ice was whole and intire betwixt
the Defunct and the Bank, which demonſtrats, that the Defunct had jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in from the Bank to that place where he was lying. 6<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that there was Blood about the Defuncts neck, all lapper'd and bruiſed
before inciſion was made, the Defunct being pulled out of the water, by an
great Cleik, the touching of the Neck with the Cleik, when his breath was
juſt gone out, was ſufficient to have made the Blood where that part was to
lapper and congeal. 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to the declarations of the Phyſicians, and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions,
they are only declarations <hi>ex auditu,</hi> and upon report of one or two
Chirurgions, and hath no foundation, but the ignorance or knowledge of the
ſaids two Reporters; neither can any ſuch declarations be obtruded againſt
the Pannal, becauſe not given out with the Libel; But whatever may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from theſe Preſumptions, whether the Defunct was Murdered or not,
the ſame does not concern the Pannal, unleſs his acceſſion to the Murder
were inſtructed, as is impoſſible it can be.</p>
                  <p>As to the qualifications alledged by my <hi>Lord Advocat,</hi> for fixing the
Murder, or acceſſion thereto upon the Pannal; It is duplyed to the firſt,
That the Pannal's alledged vitious Life, and the ſtory at <hi>Treves,</hi> his being
Drunk in Priſon, and Threatning to cut Throats upon ſmall provocations,
the ſame are extrinſick to the Lybel, and cannot be reſpected. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As
to the alledged threatning uſed in <hi>James Smith</hi>'s Houſe, the Lybel is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned,
bearing theſe expreſſions, to have been uſed in the year 1684, or
ſome year preceeding; And therefore the former defence founded upon
the Indemnity, is repeated, and opponed. And whereas my <hi>Lord Advocat</hi>
pretends, that <hi>minae praecedentes cum damno ſequuto,</hi> is ſufficient either to fix
the guilt upon the Perſon who uſed the Threats, or at leaſt to burden him
with the probation, that another commited the Crime. It is Duplyed,
1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That My <hi>Lord Advocat's</hi> Poſition is abſolutly denyed, unleſs he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
ſome other poſitive acceſſion againſt the Pannal, and theſe pretended
Threats being taken away, not only by the Act of Indemnity, but likeways
by diſſimulation, which is not only offered to be inferred from the Letter
made mention of in the Defence, but likeways by the Defuncts owning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
intertaining, furniſhing, and providing for the Pannal, in every
thing ſuitable as his eldeſt Son, the ſame doth undoubtedly take away all
pretence that can be founded upon threatning, ſo many years preceeding;
and by no Law can the Pannal be burdened to prove who were either A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
or in acceſſion to his Fathers Murder.</p>
                  <p>As to the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> qualification bearing, that the Defunct ſaid to ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that the Pannal offered to invade him (denying the ſame) the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37914:11"/>
aſſertion could not infer a Crime againſt the Pannal, unleſs the
Crime it ſelf were otherwayes proven by witneſſes, and the ſame is Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have been ſaid by Sir <hi>James</hi> before the Act of Indemnity. And Sir
<hi>James</hi>'s other aſſertion, that he was in trouble, for fear of prejudice from
his Family, cannot infer a Crime, eſpecially againſt the Pannal; and far leſs
can it be proven by the Relict and the other Son, who in Sir <hi>James</hi>'s ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
were deſigning miſchief againſt him, and for their own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they would certainly depone partially againſt the Pannal. And the
ſame is repeated againſt the other expreſſions alledged ſpoken by the Mother;
And witneſſes cannot be received to prove what another witneſs ſaid.</p>
                  <p>As to the pretence, that the Pannal refuſed to ſup with his Father the
night before his Death. It is Duplyed, the Pannal was not at all in uſe to ſup,
except on Sundays night. And the Pannal had no kindneſs for the Miniſter,
Becauſe he and others of his Gang, had endeavoured to keep up diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and his Father.</p>
                  <p>As to the alledged Bleeding of the Corps, the former Defences are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned;
And albeit the Pannal did help to lift his Fathers Corps before the
inciſion, yet no Blood did appear till long thereafter that the inciſion was
made, and the Pannal did fall to grip that part of his Father's Head where
the Inciſion was. So that the Blood falling from the wound, can neither be
a Ground nor Preſumption for guilt; And though the Pannal was ſurpriſed
to ſee his Father's Blood, Yet the ſame did only proceed from natural Duty
and Affection, and not from any apprehenſion of Guilt. And theſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being all Libel'd and Debated upon, It is humbly deſired for the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
that the Lords of Juſticiary would give a ſeparat Interloquitor upon
every particular qualification.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> for the Pannal adds, That as to the point of Treaſon,
It is offered to be proven, that it was when he was Drunk, and after Cups,
and is ſo preſumed, eſpecially it being, as it is acknowledged by the Libel, in
a Drunken company.</p>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to the Act of Indemnity, It is extended to all Crimes except the
<hi>Arch-biſhop's</hi> Murder, and <hi>exceptio firmat regulat, &amp;c.</hi> And the Act bears not
that Clauſe excepting other Crimes, which uſes to be excepted.</p>
                  <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to the qualifications condeſcended on in my <hi>Lord Advocat's</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
either they are Libel'd, and ſo oppones the former anſwer; And if
they be not Libel'd, they cannot be conſidered as qualifications.</p>
                  <p>4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Whereas it is alledged, That the Pannal was in uſe to threaten to cut
Throats, when in paſſion, the Argument is retorted: For though he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
nothing followed; And ſo his Threatnings were but <hi>verba jactantia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. As to the citation out of <hi>Mattheus,</hi> that parties may be puniſhed upon
preſumptions. It is anſwered, That the Caſe there ſtated is where the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who committed the Slaughter, was apprehended in the place where it
was committed, That he was all bloody and with a bloody Sword, àn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to the Wound, and that he became pale when he was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and that he made no anſwer, but in terrour fled away, which are ſuch
Acts as do evidently make appear the Slaughter, and could admit of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſtruction, but that cannot be pretended in this Caſe, where all the
Preſumptions are remote and extrinſick, and even in the Caſe inſtanced by
<hi>Mattheus,</hi> and others of that Nature, they are only to take effect in order to
an Arbitrary, but not a capital Puniſhment, which is the opinion of all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who ever wrote upon the ſubject, and particularly <hi>Muſcard, de prob: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſ.</hi>
123. <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. and 31. where the queſtion is ſtated, <hi>an plures praeſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiones
conjunguntur,</hi> in order to inferr a capital puniſhment? And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37914:12"/>
in the negative as a general concluſion by all Lawers, but only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
an arbitrary Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>As to the bleeding of the Body, It is offered to be proven, that the Pannal
touched his Father's Body before the Inciſion, and it did not bleed.</p>
                  <p>THe Lords, Juſtice General, and Commiſſioners of Juſticiary, Having
conſidered the Libel, purſued by His <hi>Majeſtie's</hi> Advocat againſt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip

they find the ſamen as it is lybel'd, relevant to inferr the pain of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Pannal's curſing of his Father, mentioned in the Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
They find theſe Expreſſions, or either of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Devil take
him, the Devil rive him, God damn him, relevant to inferr the pain of Death:
And repells the Defence founded upon the Act of Indemnity, and finds the
Pannal is not under or below the quality therein ſpecified.</p>
                  <p>As to the Pannal's murthering of his Father mentioned in the Inditement,
they found the Libel as it is lybelled and qualified relevant to inferr the
pain of Death, and remits the ſame with the qualifications lybel'd to the
knowledge of the Aſſiſe, and allowes Witneſſes to be led for the Pannal's
proving his Father to have been Melancholy the day before the committing
of the Murder, and remits to the Aſſiſe to conſider the Import thereof, if it
be proven, and repells the whole other Defences proponed for the Pannal.</p>
                  <p>The Lords continues the Dyet againſt the ſaid <hi>Philip Standsfield,</hi> till to

That ſhe did hear the Pannal uſually vow and ſwear he would kill

<hi>Janet Johnſton, George Thomſon</hi> and his Wife, and that he went frequently out
of his Fathers Houſe after Supper to theſe perſons; and further Depones,
that ſhe has heard the Pannal frequently curſe his Father, and bid the Devil
damn him, and rive him, and ſwell him; and that ſhe has frequently heard
him expreſs his hatred and abhorrence of his Father, and that he could not
abide to ſee his Father: further Depones, that the <hi>Munday</hi> at Night before
Sir <hi>James</hi> came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the laſt time he was in it, being about a Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
before his Death, the Deponent was ordered to call the Pannal to his
Mother after he was gone to his Chamber, and that accordingly ſhe did it,
and when the Pannal came down, the Deponent left him with his Mother
alone, and when ſhe was without the Door, ſhe heard him ſay to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeveral times, <hi>God damn him if he did it not;</hi> and deſired his Mother
to take a good Heart, for as long as he had, ſhe ſhould not want: Depones,
ſhe knows not what he meaned by theſe words, but knows there had been
a little quarrel betwixt Sir <hi>James</hi> and his Lady that ſame Night: Further
Depones, that on <hi>Tueſday</hi> thereafter, when Sir <hi>James Standsfield</hi> was going
in to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> ſhe did hear <hi>Philip Standsfield</hi> the Pannal ſay in his Mothers
Chamber (his Father not being preſent,) God let him never return, God let
him never ſee his Fathers face again, the Devil go with him, the Devil rive
him, and take him away; and that there was no body in the Roum at the
time but the Pannal and his Mother, and the Deponent was at the Door:
Further Depones, that about a month before, Sir <hi>James</hi> having reproved the
Pannal, upon the occaſion of an Accompt given in by <hi>William Anderſon</hi>
Brewer, ſhe did hear the Pannal ſay in his Mothers Chamber (Sir <hi>James</hi> not
being preſent,) God damn him if he ſhould not do ten times worſe, and
that he could not endure to ſee his Fathers face, and that he had hated his
Father theſe ſix or ſeven years: Further Depones, that about a Fourth-night
or twenty days before Sir <hi>James</hi> his death, it being ſaid that <hi>Philip</hi> was to
go to Town with his Father, ſhe heard him ſay, he would be hang'd ere he
went with him, let him go, the Devil go with him, and let him never return,
and this likewiſe in his Mothers Chamber, and in her preſence: Depones, the
Pannal did ordinarly ſhift occaſions of being in his Fathers company: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones,
that the <hi>Friday</hi> before Sir <hi>James</hi> his death, ſhe knows the Pannal and
<hi>Janet Johnſtoun</hi> were a conſiderable time together in the Pannal's Chamber,
where the Deponent heard <hi>Janet Johnſtoun</hi>'s tongue, but doth not know if
<hi>George Thomſon</hi> and his Wife were with them: Depones, that on the <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi>
before Sir <hi>James</hi> his death, <hi>Philip</hi> having curſed ſome of the Servants,
the Deponent ſaid to him, God be thanked, he was not their Maſter; and
that he anſwered her with an Oath, ſhe knew not how ſoon he might be
their Maſter: Further Depones, that ſhe thought Sir <hi>James</hi> not ſo merry as
his ordinar the night before his death, but that he conveyed Mr. <hi>Bell</hi> to his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37914:13"/>
Chamber, and thereafter came down to his own; and the Deponent having
deſired to ſpeak with Sir <hi>James,</hi> his Servant <hi>John Robertſon</hi> told her ſhe could
not, becauſe his Chamber-door was ſhut, and he was gone to Bed; and that
ſhe did then ſee light in his Roum, and when ſhe was going away, found
the Hall-door which was without his Chamber-door ſhut, and that the Hall-door
was not uſually cloſed in the night-time except Sir <hi>James</hi> had done it
himſelf, and which he did but once in two or three Nights: Depones, that
on the <hi>Saturday's</hi> night when Sir <hi>James</hi> came home, he did go to his Ladies
Chamber, where he ſtayed not a quarter of an hour, and that his Lady fell
a quarreling of him for going to another Houſe before he came there, and
that the Deponent came out of the Chamber, and knows not what more paſt
there: Depones, the next morning, when Sir <hi>James</hi> was miſt, the Deponent
went in to his Roum to put on a Fire, and found the Bed better ſpread up
than it uſed to be, and the Curtains more drawen about it, and the Candle
which uſually was at the Bed-head, ſhe found it ſtanding on a Chair at the
Bed-foot. And further Depones, that when the Defunct's body was bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to the Houſe, the Deponent would have had him brought to his own
Chamber, but <hi>Philip</hi> ſwore that the Body ſhould not enter there, for he had
not died like a Man, but like a Beaſt: Depones, that the Body was then put
in the <hi>Walk-miln</hi> (but knows not if <hi>Philip</hi> cauſed do it,) and that the Body
from that was brought to a Cellar within the Cloſs where there was very
little light: Depones, that ſhe did not ſee any water come out of his mouth,
and that when the Deponent lifted up the Linen-ſheet, which was over him
in the Cellar, ſome of them cauſed let it down again, for it was not fit to let
the Body be ſeen. Depones, that <hi>Janet Johnſtoun</hi> was preſent with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the Cellar with the reſt; and though it was known that neither Sir
<hi>James</hi> nor his Lady would look upon her for a good time before, nor was ſhe
openly ſeen about the Houſe, yet that morning ſhe went to the Ladies
Chamber, as ſoon as the Body was taken out, and the Deponent was preſent
and ſaw her come in, and well enough taken with: Depones, ſhe heard <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
after his Father's death, Greet and Cry, but ſaw no Tears: Depones, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
after his Fathers body was found, he would have forced his Fathers
Chamber-door it being ſhut, but the Key being gotten, it was opened and he
entred in, and firſt took his Fathers Gold and Money out of his pocket, and
then got the Keys, and ſearched the Cabinet, and that within an hour after
his Father was brought from the Water, he got the Buckles of his Father's
ſhoes, and put them in his: Depones, that on the <hi>Munday</hi> after Sir <hi>James</hi>'s
death, the Lady and <hi>Janet Johnſtoun</hi> having quarrelled together about ſome
remains of the Holland of the Woonding-ſheet, <hi>Philip</hi> came down out of
his own Chamber, and the Deponent heard him ſay to <hi>Janet Johnſtoun,</hi> hold
your peace when I command you, for he would reward her well for the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhe had done to him at that time: Depones, that when the order came
from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to raiſe the Corps again, the Deponent did meet <hi>George
Thomſon</hi> the Taylor, and perceived him ſhaking and trembling, and asked
him what troubled him? and that his anſwer was, he heard the blackeſt
Newes that ever he heard in his life, for Sir <hi>James</hi>'s body was to be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and ſaid he would ſew no more in the Houſe of <hi>New-milns</hi> for the World,
and carried the Mournings to his own Houſe: Depones, ſhe knows nothing
of falſe Keys made uſe of about the Houſe, only ſhe heard the Lady ſay, that
there were: Depones, <hi>Philip</hi> had no lockfaſt place in the Houſe, except a
little Coffer, and that it once being opened, the Deponent did ſee ſeveral Keys
within it, and that he offered once the Key of one of the Roums to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponet,
but the Deponent took it not, becauſe ſhe had the ordinar Key of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37914:14"/>
Roum: Depones, that <hi>Philip</hi> was in uſe to ly alone, but that after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
death, he would not ly in a Roum alone at <hi>New-milns,</hi> and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to the Deponent that he was afraid to be alone in a Roum, either
night or day, and that he ſleept not the night after his Father died, and that
he ſhould not go into the Roum where his Father lay, if once he had the
Cabinet out of it: Depones, that a ſhort time before Sir <hi>James</hi> died, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
having fallen in a Swond, and the Deponent having told <hi>Philip</hi> of it,
<hi>Philip</hi> came to his Mothers Chamber, and that his Mother told him then,
that he was like in a ſhort time to loſe his Mother; and that he anſwered in
the Deponents hearing, that his Father ſhould be dead firſt: And depones,
that ſome few days thereafter, in his Mothers Chamber again, and in the
Deponents hearing, he renewed the ſame Words with an Oath: Further
depones, that two Nights after Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Death, the Lady told to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,
that ſomething then came in her Mind which ſhe had heard, to
wit, that <hi>Philip,</hi> before he went to <hi>London,</hi> when he was in his Pomp, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard that Sir <hi>James</hi> was to give his Eſtate to his ſecond Son, in the
Houſe of <hi>James Smith</hi> in the <hi>Nungate,</hi> had vowed to kill his Brother, and
the like, or little leſs to his Father; and that thereafter, when they were
coming into <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Lady renewed again to the Deponent, the ſame
Words, and added, what if they ſhould put her Bairn in Priſon. And
this is the Truth, as ſhe ſhall anſwer to God. Depones ſhe cannot write,</p>

his Throat, and the Land-lord of the Houſe being by, and preſent, and

down on the bed ſide, I ſaid to an honeſt man who accompanied me, this
is the ſaddeſt day that ever I ſaw; my affrightment in the night was terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
to me, but this is more grievous; and having gone to an honeſt mans
houſe, where I took horſe that morning, I ſaid, if the Majeſtie of God did
ever permit the devil, and his inſtruments, to do a honeſt man wrong, then
Sir <hi>James Standsfield</hi> has received wrong this laſt night, which the Lord will
diſcover in his good time.</p>
                     <p>5<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. I declare that after my return from <hi>Morum,</hi> that Sabbath evening,
<hi>Philip</hi> told me that he had advertiſed ſeveral Freinds at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and that
he was expecting the Commiſſary amongſt others that night, whereupon I
commended what he had done, in ſending for ſuch intelligent Perſons, and
that for two reaſons (1) Becauſe it was neceſſary his Fathers body ſhould be
ſighted. (2) Becauſe they could adviſe him about his Burial. <hi>Philip</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
that he was ſeen by theſe that took him out of the water. But I
replyed that was not enough, for the Murder committed was either a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Murder, or a diſtracted Murder; and having deſcribed what a diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Murder was (upon <hi>Philips</hi> relateing ſome diſtemper his Father had been
in ſome years formerly) I ſaid, That I conceived no Perſon, could come to
ſuch a high Act of frenzie, to do ſuch a thing, but it would be known on
him, many hours, yea ſome days before; But I could teſtifie, that Sir <hi>James</hi>
was in his right reaſon yeſternight at ten a clock, wherefore I inclin'd to
think it was a violent Murder committed by wicked Spirits; And ſo advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that the Corps might be ſighted by the neareſt Phyſicians, and Freinds,
and the honeſt men living in that Town; nevertheleſs they went and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Sir <hi>James</hi> that night, without either acquainting me, or ſeveral honeſt
Perſons who lived in the place. Mr. <hi>John Bell</hi> depones his above written de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
is truth, as he ſhall anſwer to God,</p>

the Corps, about the Neck, and ſewed it up again, and removed the foul
Linen, and put on again the clean Linens, in doing whereof they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to ſhake the Body to and fro, and move the head back and foreward:
The Deponent deſired that the Friends might lift the Body, and put it in
the Coffin, and that the Pannal having come and lift up the Head, he did
let it fall upon the Table ſuddenly, and that it made a conſiderable noiſe at
the falling, and that the Pannal retired back quickly rubbing his Hands on his
Breaſt, and crying, <hi>O God! O God!</hi> and ſome ſuch other Words, and that
the Deponent being aſtoniſhed thereat, looked to the Corps, and as the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
did take away his hand from it, did ſee it darting out Blood through the
Linnen, from the left-ſide of the Neck which the Pannal touched, and that
the Deponent was amazed at the ſight, partly through the darting out of
the Blood, and partly through the apprehenſion he had of the Murder. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones,
he ſaw no Body touch the left-ſide of the Defunct's Head the time it
bled, but the Pannal: Depones, that as ſoon as the Deponent recovered out
of his amazement, he cryed to his Boy to give the Pannal ſome Triacle wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

to the Body of his Father: Depones when the Deponent and the other

the Report made by <hi>James Craufurd,</hi> and <hi>James Murehead,</hi>
concerning the condition of the Corps of Sir <hi>James Standsfield,</hi> and though
it be not uſual to declare more than matter of Fact, yet in obedience to your
Lordſhips commands, where ye deſire to be informed, if theſe Symptoms,
found upon the Body, do import, Drowning, or Strangling. We humbly
offer our opinion, ſo far as our Art or Experience will allow. And whereas
the report informs us, that there was found a ſwelling, and preter-natural
redneſs in the Face, a large and conſpicuous Tumour, about three Inches
broad, of a dark red, or black colour, from the one ſide of the Larinx, round
backwards to the other ſide thereof, a large ſwelling betwixt the Chin and
the Cartilago ſcutiformis, the Jugular Veines, on both ſides very large, and
diſtended, and when Inciſion was made downwards, betwixt the Os hyoid
and Larinx was obſerved a laxnes, and diſtance betwixt the Os hyoid and
the Cartilago ſcutiformis, Inciſion being made croſs alongſt the Tumor, it
was found full of bruiſed Blood; The Jugulars likeways when opened yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a conſiderable quantity of Blood, eſpecially on the left ſide, no ſmell, or
corruption appearing in any part of the Body. It is very probable theſe parts
have ſuffered ſome external violence, which hath made them appear ſo
far different from their natural figure and colour, and could not be cauſed
by Drowning ſimply. As to the other part of the report, the Breaſt, and
Belly, being opened, the Lungs found diſtended, the Bronchi full of air,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37914:16"/>
without any water, nor any water found in the Stomach, or Inteſtines, a
Body when drowned, being generally found to have much water in it, with
other circumſtances of the Report conſidered, gives juſt ground to think he
was not drowned.</p>

                     <p>About ſix weeks before the death of Sir <hi>James Standsfield,</hi> after Night I
went to pay my reſpects to Sir <hi>James,</hi> as I uſually did when he was at <hi>New-milns,</hi>
at which time I found him not ſo free for Diſcourſe, nor ſo pleaſant as
at other times: In ſo much that I uſed that freedom with him, to <hi>Quere</hi> the
reaſon why his Honour was ſo Melancholy? who with a great ſigh, wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his hands together, with tears trickling down his Cheeks; ſaid, Mr. <hi>Spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
I have great cauſe for it; I have born my own burden, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
to others, but I have a very wicked Family, and it's very ſad that a
man ſhould be deſtroyed by his own Bowels; But let me be never ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in my expence, both at home and abroad, yet they at home of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
conſume me; condeſcending on ſome particulars, of ſome extravagant
ſums of money, monethly brought into him, that his Family had expended,
beſides what he allowed for them, which was very ſufficient: But that which
grieved him moſt was, that his youngeſt Son, whom he had ſome Comfortable
hopes of, and upon whom he had ſettled his Eſtate upon; His juſt Debts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt payed, and that to the knowledge of his Son; But now he was fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
of his hopes of that his Son too: For his eldeſt Son had debauched
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37914:17"/>
his youngeſt Son, who had ſeveral times of late come in Drunk, as the other;
This he declared to me with very great grief of heart: But the Saturday's
night after Sir <hi>James,</hi> and a Miniſter, one Mr. <hi>Bell,</hi> came to <hi>New-milns</hi>
from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> I came in at the houſe of one <hi>James Marr,</hi> where I ſaw
Sir <hi>James,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bell</hi> ſitting by the fire, before he had been at his own
houſe, which I wondred at, having never known the like done by him
before; but ſince, I have had my thoughts, that he had a fear upon him,
(good Gentleman) of going to his own houſe, but having ſat ſome time
with him, he deſired Mr. <hi>Marr</hi> to ſend one of his People at his houſe, to know,
if they had kindled a fire for him; And upon the return the Meſſenger gave
this anſwer: <hi>May it pleaſe your Honour, your fire is kindled for you;</hi> upon
which Sir <hi>James,</hi> and the Miniſter aroſe, and took their leave of Mr. <hi>Marr;</hi>
And I alſo accompanyed Sir <hi>James</hi> and the <hi>Miniſter</hi> half the way toward his
home, and ſo took my leave of him, wiſhing his Honour a good night: But
the next morning being Sabbath-day after the light well appeared, one <hi>Agnes
Bruce</hi> came at my Chamber-door, and knocked. I went and opened the
door, ſays ſhe, <hi>Sir, Sir</hi> James <hi>is gone out of his Lodging-roum this morning, and
we have ſought all the Roums of the houſe for him, but cannot find him;</hi> ſhe goes
off, I immediatly followed her, and when I came out of my door, I met
with Maſter <hi>Philip Standsfield,</hi> and <hi>James Dick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Standsfield</hi> declares to
me, <hi>Lord, Maſter</hi> Spurway, <hi>what ſhould be the cauſe of this man's diſcontent,
that he ſhould thus leave his Lodgings, and walk out?</hi> To which I replyed,
<hi>Sir, do you wonder the cauſe of his diſcontent, who never gave him content, but
had been the cauſe of grieving him, from one to the other of them ever ſince I knew
the Family:</hi> But he turned his back upon me, and made no reply at all;
however I went at Sir <hi>James</hi>'s houſe, but could not procure the keys of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Gardens, and I ſent abroad of Sir <hi>James</hi>'s ſervants, and of my
own, ſome on horſe-back, and ſome on foot, to inquire after him; At laſt a
ſervant of mine, one <hi>Will. Bowman</hi> found him in the River, a little be-weſt
the Town; I went at the place, and ſaw him lying about two yeards, or eight
foot from the Brink of the River, lying upon his Belly, juſt at the top of the
water, as it were floating, only his Coat and Weſtcoat looſe about him, and a
ſhirt on him that I ſaw. I ſaw the place at the Brink of the River, where ſome
one had ſtood all beaten to maſh with feet, and the ground very open and
mellow, although a very hard froſty morning; So I gave order to ſome to
get a Ladder, and to ſet the one end into the River, as near the hinder part of
Sir <hi>James</hi> as they could, and the other end of the Ladder to fall at the top
of the Brae, which was very ſteep, and ſo they might get him out eaſily;
So I came away from the place, and deſired Mr. <hi>Marr</hi> to ſee the Body land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Declaring that I would go home, and write to Mr. <hi>George Hume</hi> merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> of the ſad ſight which I had ſeen, deſiring him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat
the ſame to my Lord Advocat, with deſire to know by the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
his Lordſhip's pleaſure, what of advice or direction he would be
pleaſed to give concerning it, and it ſhould be followed; But the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that I ſent, after he had delivered my Letter to Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> and Order
given by Commiſſary <hi>Dalrymple,</hi> how to proceed further with the Body
of Sir <hi>James,</hi> which Order was directed to my ſelf by a Letter, which when
I read the Letter, the Contents was: That I ſhould endeavour to procure
two or three diſcreet perſons of <hi>New milns</hi> to my ſelf, and we together view
the Body of Sir <hi>James;</hi> and if we found no grounds to believe that his
Perſon had not been wronged by others, that then with all ſpeed he ſhould
be Buried, and that as privatly, and with as little noiſe as could be; But this
Letter, which was the Commiſſary's Order to me, was ſent by the hand of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37914:17"/>
one <hi>James Mitchel,</hi> Kinſman to Sir <hi>James;</hi> For that Horſe that the Expreſs
rode on to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> was taken out of the Stable, where he was ſet up:
And one Mr. <hi>Patrick Smith,</hi> the Brother-in-Law of Sir <hi>James Standsfield,</hi>
mounted on him to come for <hi>New-Milns:</hi> So that my Expreſs was thereby
diſabled, to bring me the anſwer of my Letter; and the ſaid <hi>James Mitchel,</hi>
who brought my Letter, came home at the place by Nine of the Clock,
that <hi>Sabbath</hi> day at night, and gave an account of the Letter that he had for
me; but they diſwaded him from bringing it me, ſo that I had it not till three
hours after Sir <hi>James</hi> was buried. But upon <hi>Monday</hi> morning, I aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three or four of the Clock; and coming out of my Houſe, I ſaw great
Lights at Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Gate, which occaſioned my going down, to ſee what
the matter was; and as I went, I met with one <hi>Will. Robiſon,</hi> coming up
of home, I asked what the meaning was of theſe Lights, and of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that I then ſaw at Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Gate? who anſwered me, that Sir <hi>James</hi>'s
Corps were brought out at the Gate, and that they were carrying it at
<hi>Morum</hi> to be buried, having received orders from my Lord Advocate for
that purpoſe: At which I returned to my Houſe, thinking it very ſtrange
thus to proceed without having had the Corps viewed by ſome Perſon, as
I well knew was cuſtomary in <hi>England,</hi> in ſuch caſes. The next ſtep to
my remembrance, was, that upon the <hi>Tueſday</hi> night following, after I was
in Bed, one Mr. <hi>Alexander Campbell</hi> in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> with one Mr. <hi>James
Row,</hi> and an Gentleman, one Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> with two Chirurgions, came
at my Houſe, and cauſed me to riſe out of my Bed, ſhowing me an order,
which they had from my Lord Advocat, for the taking up again the Body
of Sir <hi>James Standsfield;</hi> and commanded me to make ready to go with
them, and having ſeen the Order, readily ſubmitted thereunto, and when
coming upon the place at <hi>Morum,</hi> cauſed the ſaid Grave to be opened, and
the Coffin taken up. It was carried into the Church, and there opened;
and as ſoon as Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Grave-cloaths were taken off him, and all his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
parts uncovered home to his privy parts, me-thought his Face look'd
not as I expected, nor as others had inſinuated, that were at the dreſſing of
him at firſt; for they ſaid that his Body and Face was very fair and freſh;
but I found his Face at firſt view of another Complection, being blackiſh
with ſome ſtrakes of red-like ſtanding, or rather ſtrangled Blood; and under
his left Ear I ſaw a ſwelling home to his Throat, of a blackiſh red Colour:
After this I ſaw the Chirurgions opening his Body, beginning at the top of
his Chin, and ſo down to the Pit of his Stomach, and then cut his Skin on
both ſides his Throat, towards each Ear, and coming at the place near his
left Ear, that I ſaw ſwoln, I there ſaw of corroded, or congeal'd Blood, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a lump of a great thickneſs, and two or three inches long, which
proved to me he had been Strangled: And one thing more I obſerved, that
when Mr. <hi>Murehead</hi> put off his Cap at firſt from his Head, in ſlipping it
back, Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Eye-lids opened, and his Eyes appeared, but his Eye-lids
much ſwoln, and very red, which did alſo prove to me a Symptom of
Strangling.</p>
                     <p>This being done, and his breaſt opened, ſo that his intrals appeared, and
to me ſeemed in good order, and no appearance of water in his Body; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then, nor when firſt he was taken out of the River; the like I think,
has not been ever known by any man that caſt himſelf, or that has been
caſt into a River alive, and not to have his Body full of water; nor that
ever a dead man ſhould ly at the top of the water, where no running
Stream is, but a ſtill Water, of about 5 foot deep: But to me in this it
ſhowes, that as God is a Wonder-working-God, ſo he has in this ſhowen
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37914:18"/>
no leſs, to convince men, that this worthy Gentleman murdered not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
but was murdered.</p>
                     <p>But my laſt Obſervation was of a wonder more, that the Lord did ſhow,
when the Chirurgions had cauſed the Body of Sir <hi>James</hi> to be by their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
ſewen up again, and his Grave-cloathes put on. A Speech was made to
this purpoſe, It is requiſit now, that thoſe of Sir <hi>James Standsfield</hi>'s Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and neareſt Friends ſhould take him off from the place where now he
lyes, and lift him into his Coffin. So I ſaw Mr. <hi>James Row</hi> at the left-ſide
of Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Head and Shoulder, and Mr. <hi>Philip Standsfield</hi> at the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of his Head and Shoulder, and going to lift off the Body, I ſaw Mr.
<hi>Philip</hi> drop the Head of his Father upon the Furm, and much Blood in his
Hand, and himſelf flying off from the Body, crying, <hi>Lord, have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me,</hi> or upon us, wipeing off the Blood on his Cloaths, and ſo lay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
over a Seat in the Church, ſome ſuppoſing that he would ſwarff or ſwoun
away, called for a Bottle of Water for him. After this we went for <hi>Morum</hi>
Caſtle, where Mr. <hi>Philip Standsfield,</hi> my ſelf, and ſeveral others ſtayed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
it was day: In which time I challenged Mr. <hi>Philip</hi> for his unkindneſs to
me, by his not inviting me to accompany the Corps of his Father, when
firſt buried, knowing the Intimacy that there was betwixt his Father and
my ſelf; and that of all the People in or about the Town, his Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in no ones Company, as in mine; and that he did not give me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of his Burial, that I might do my laſt Office of Love and Service to
him, by accompanying his Body to his Burial place; I took it very ill from
him: So then Mr. <hi>Philip</hi> ſwore that he had ſent two of his Servants to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
me, but if thoſe damn'd Rogues would not do it, what could he help
it; and yet did declare, as is proved, and as himſelf ſince confeſt before my
Lord Advocat, that he would not invite me, aſſigning this as his Reaſon,
ſuppoſing that my ſelf, and <hi>James Marr</hi> had been Inſtruments of ſetting his
Father againſt him, which was a falſe ſuggeſtion: All which particulars I
have before the Lords of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Honourable Privy Council declared:

of the Juſtices and Inqueſt, declared as after follows; That <hi>Janet
Johnſtoun</hi> came to <hi>George Thomſons</hi> houſe betwixt nine and ten at night, and
<hi>Philip Standsfield</hi> the Pannal came there ſhortly thereafter, and the Houſe
being dark, the ſaid <hi>Philip</hi> gave the Declarant a turnor to buy a Candle,
which he did in the neighbouring houſe, and after the Declarant returned
with the Candle, his Mother ordered him to go to his Bed, which was in
the ſame Roum, and beat him becauſe he did not preſently obey. Declares
he heard one come to the Door, and inquire for <hi>Janet Johnſtoun,</hi> and deſire
her to come home, and give her Child ſuck: Declares he knew by the
voice that the Perſon who came was <hi>Agnes Mark</hi> the ſaid <hi>Janets</hi> daughter,
and that <hi>Janet</hi> ordered her to go away, and ſhe ſhould follow her; Declares
ſhe ſtayed a conſiderable time thereafter, and the ſaid <hi>Thomſons</hi> wife was
deſired to go for a pint of Ale, and <hi>Philip</hi> took out an handful of Money
to ſee if he had any ſmall Money, and finding he had none, the Ale was
taken on upon truſt; Furder Declares that the ſaid <hi>George Thomſon</hi> and his
Wife, and <hi>Janet Johnſtoun</hi> did ſtay together, and whiſper ſoftly a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time; Declares he heard <hi>Philip Standsfield</hi> complain that his Father
would not give him Money, and pray the Devil take his Father, and God
damn his own Soul if he ſhould not make an end of his Father, and then all
would be his, and then he would be kind to them; Declares <hi>Philip Standsfield</hi>
and <hi>Janet Johnſtoun</hi> went away about eleven, and ſhortly after his Father
and Mother came to the bed where the Declarant was lying croſs the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot;
and the Declarant in the night time perceived his Father and Mother
riſing out of the Bed, and going out of the houſe, and that they ſtayed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
time away, about an hour and an half, or two hours, and that the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37914:19"/>
Declarant was perfectly awake, when they went and were away, and he
wondred what they were going about: Declares his Mother came in firſt,
and came ſoftly to Bed, and within ſome time after his Father came in, and
put a ſtool to the back of the door, without locking it, for the Lock made
always a great noiſe when they locked the door, and the Declarants Father
called to him whenever he came in, but the Declarant made no anſwer, that
it might be thought he was ſleeping, and his Mother asked, what had ſtayed
his Father; and thereupon his Father and Mother did fall a diſcourſing of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things, and particularly his Father ſaid, that the Deed was done, and
that <hi>Philip Standsfield</hi> guarded the Chamber-door, with a drawen Sword and
a bendet Piſtol, and that he never thought a man would have died ſo ſoon,
and that they carried him out towards the water-ſide, and they tyed a ſtone
about his Neck, and leaving him there came back to the little kiln, and
reckoned whether they ſhould caſt him in the water with the ſtone about
his Neck or not, and whether they ſhould caſt him far in or near the ſide,
and at length they returned and took away the ſtone from about his Neck,
and threw him in the water; Declares his Father ſaid, that yet he was afraid
for all that, that the Murder would come out, and his Mother anſwered,
Hout fool, there is no fear of that, it will be thought he has drowned himſelf,
becauſe he will be found in the water; Declares when Sir <hi>James</hi> was miſſed
in the morning, the Declarants Mother ſaid to his Father, Riſe quickly, for
if ye be found in your Bed, they will ſay that ye have a hand in the Murder;
Declares the Coat and Waſtecoat which were upon Sir <hi>James,</hi> when he was
found in the water, were ſent to <hi>Thomſons</hi> houſe, and <hi>Thomſons</hi> Wife ſaid to
her Husband and <hi>Janet Johnſtoun</hi> in preſence of the Declarant, that ſhe was
affrighted to ſee the ſaid Coat and Waſtecoat, for ſhe thought that ſome
evil ſpirit was in it, and deſired her Husband to ſend it away, which he
would not; And further that his Mother ſaid to her Husband in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarants
hearing, that ſhe was affrighted to be in the houſe alone after night
fell, and accordingly when ever her Husband went out, ſhe went out with
him, which was not her ordinary; Declares the ſaid <hi>George Thomſon</hi> did go
into <hi>Edinburgh</hi> ſeveral days before the Declarants Mother was brought in,
and ſhe did immediatly after he came into <hi>Edinburgh</hi> ſend away Sir <hi>James</hi>'s
Coat and Waſtecoat, and that ſhe was never in her own houſe after night,
ſince her Husband came in, but did lie in <hi>Janet Johnſtouns</hi> houſe.</p>

loves to ſee juſt things done in a legal way, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
thereafter a full probation in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
manner, whereby we might not only
convince our ſelves, but all ſuch as are not
wicked enough to have been the Authors. You
will diſcern the Finger of God in all the ſteps
of this Probation, as evidently as <hi>Philip</hi>'s Guilt;
and this extraordinary Diſcovery has been
made, as well to convince this wicked Age,
that the World is govern'd by Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as that he is guilty of this Murder. He
is accuſed before you for three Crimes, <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
the <hi>Curſing of his Father,</hi> and <hi>the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him:</hi> Crimes in great Affinity, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſubſervient to one another; for to pray
Confuſion to the King, who is <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> is
a Curſing our great Parent; And what can
prove better a deſign to Murder his Parent,
than the malitious hatred that prevails over a
Son to Curſe him? What reſtrains vitious
men from Murdering thoſe, by whoſe Death
they may expect licentious Liberty, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent
Succeſſion, ſave the fear of the Laws of
the Land, or at leaſt an innate awe of the Law
of Nature? But here you ſee in the Treaſon
a contempt of the Laws of the Land, and in the
Curſing an abhorrence of the Laws of Nature.</p>
                     <p>There is no Reaſon to ſuſpect our Zeal in
this Caſe from any State Deſign; for we took
pains to ſhun a Probation of the Treaſon: It
was forced upon us, and not ſought by us, ſo
violent were, and are we in the ſearch of the
Murder, that even Treaſon was not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
us. Nor preſs I it at this time; but to
let you ſee there is nothing ſo wicked or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
which this Pannal durſt not attempt.
He not only wiſhes the King's Confuſion, but
drinks it openly; and not only drinks the
King's Confuſion himſelf, but he forces others
to do ſo; nor needed he to be drunk, to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for this was the firſt ſtep of his drinking;
and to convince you that he knew it was a
Crime, it is proved that he took his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſworn, never to detect it, the fatal Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
which always tempt him to commit
his Villanies. The Curſing his Father is not
from meer humor or diſſoluteneſs, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
yet probable by a previous deſign to have
his Eſtate, and from the reſtraint he found from
him, of being debarred from the raviſhing
hopes of a boundleſs Liberty: The Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are various and execrable, ſuch as, Devil
take him, drown him, rive him, let him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come back, let him never eat more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and theſe Expreſſions, which ſhould never have
been once ſpoke, were frequently repeited, and
are prov'd, not by ſuſpect Perſons, or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
but by his Father's, and his own Servants,
and ſuch of them too as were <hi>Philip</hi>'s own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourits,
and who think themſelves very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in being obliged to Depone againſt him.</p>
                     <p>You are then, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> in the third place
to judge, how far this Murder and Paricide
are prov'd, in which you need to be the leſs
ſcrupulous, that the Son, who is accuſed of it,
is to die however; for either of the two former
Crimes are ſo far prov'd beyond all doubt, that
though he ſhould eſcape this, he cannot theſe.
And as to the Probation of this Crime, I muſt
firſt repreſent to you, that in occult or atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Crimes, the Law has relaxed, and remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
much of its ſcrupulouſneſs in Probation,
becauſe in theſe the ordinary Probation cannot
be had, and to admit none but ſuch, were to
reject all: And therefore in Hameſucken,
which is the Beating a man in his own Houſe,
but much more the Murdering a man by way
of Hameſucken in his own Houſe, wherein all
means are uſed to cover, and few can be got
for diſcovering; you muſt not expect two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
who ſaw the Murder committed, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch Probation as can before God convince
you, that this Murder was committed by that
man; no Inqueſt ever failed to find the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Children to be clearly prov'd, though
there were no Witneſſes that ſaw it committed,
and the Murdering Parents is a more atrocious
Crime, becauſe we owe more Duty to our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
than any Parent does to a Child, and
never Son ow'd more than this did, nor can be
more believ'd to have killed a Parent. For
clearing whereof you are to conſider firſt, that
he did not Drown himſelf, as was pretended,
but was Murdered by ſome Perſons; and as
the Law violently preſumes, that no man would
Murder himſelf, ſo without the help of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
it is prov'd moſt convincingly by
ocular Inſpection, that he was Strangled; the
marks of Strangling, <hi>viz.</hi> the congeal'd Blood,
the diſlocation of one of the Vertebrae in his
Neck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being viſible ſigns prov'd in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way, and we have added to this the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37914:20"/>
both of the Chirurgions and Phyciſians,
who at once declare, that he was not Drown'd,
and that he was Strangled; the outward marks
likewiſe of his not being Drown'd, appearing as
viſibly as that he was Strangled; ſo you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that he was Strangled; except you can
think, that after he had Strangled himſelf, and
broke his own Neck, he drown'd himſelf.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, who could have Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this innocent and obliging Gentleman, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ſome Perſon who had acceſs to his Houſe,
wherein he was Murdered, and had Malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
himſelf. And theſe two can meet in no
Perſon, but this unnatural barbarous Son; for
one of the things that hightens his Guilt is, that
he ſhould abhorre a Father, who engaged meer
Strangers to love him as a Friend: and we
have prov'd, that he not only hated his Father,
and that he had done ſo for many years, but
that he vowed he would take away his Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſtmaſs next, and that in many vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but clear expreſſions, and at many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times; for ſometimes he ſwore, if he made
a Diſpoſition to his ſecond Son, he ſhould take
his Life; ſometimes, that he ſhould be Maſter
of all before Chriſtmaſs, and he ſhould uſe the
Servants as they uſed him; that though his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was like to die, that his Father ſhould die
before her: and he ſcarce ever ſpoke of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without ſwearing he would ſtrike a
Sword to his Heart; nor would his Paſſion ſo
much as ſuffer him to diſſemble this even to his
Mother; and he who durſt own it to her,
durſt certainly do it whenever he had occaſion.</p>
                     <p>I proceed now to clear to you, that I have
prov'd, that he not only deſign'd and vow'd in
Paſſion, that he would Murder his Father, but
that he actually attempted to Murder him, and
for this I have led theſe Witneſſes, who prove,
that when his Father came from the Leaden-Mines,
he fled into <hi>Culter,</hi> as a trembling Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge
purſued by a Haulk, telling ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
that he had been purſued ſeven Miles
by his unnatural Son, who accordingly came to
the Houſe, and ſhot ſeveral Piſtols in at the
Windows, whereupon the Gentlemen, who now
Depone, were forc'd to watch with his Father
all the night, and were forc'd to Convoy him
the next day near to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
produc'd other Gentlemen, to whom his
Father declared, that he attempted againſt his
Life: and who will not believe the beſt of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Deponing againſt the worſt of Sons?
Nor could any thing have drawn this from the
Father, ſave the terrifying danger, to which
he was hourly expoſed. All the Supream
Courts of <hi>Europe</hi> have found the attempt to
kill, ſufficient to infer Paricide, this is a higher
degree of Guilt than Curſing, and yet that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
Death; and to attempt to kill a Father is
more villanous, than to kill a Stranger. What
ſhall be ſaid then of frequent, and deliberate
attempts? And thus you have this Son again
prov'd guilty of Death, and even of Paricide.
That which haſtened the perpetrating this
Crime was, that his Father wearied out with
his Villanies, was at laſt forc'd to diſpone his
Eſtate to his ſecond Son, and tho' there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more ridiculous than to ask, What Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the Son had to kill his Father, as he now
does? For there can be no Reaſon for ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
an Action; yet this was a Motive to
him, and may be a Proof to you; for ſo kind
a Father, who had tryed all Means and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to reclaim his licentious Son, had never
proceeded to this, unleſs he had been driven to
it by thoſe frequent Attempts made by his Son
upon his Life, in hopes to enjoy his Eſtate by
the Death that he was to give. To diſappoint
which hopes his Father deſign'd to ſettle the
Eſtate on the ſecond Brother, after which Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
he could gain nothing but the Gallows
by killing his Father. Whereupon he to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the delivery of the Diſpoſition, did aſſociat
to himſelf <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Thomſon,</hi> whom himſelf
uſed to call the Devil's Taylor, <hi>Thomſon</hi>'s Wife,
and <hi>Janet Johnſton,</hi> who was his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine,
and his Father's known Enemy, whom
he could never have frequented, except upon
ſo barbarous a deſign. <hi>Thomſon</hi> denyed that
he was in the Houſe for eight days before, and
yet it is prov'd he was in Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Houſe, the
night the Murder was committed; <hi>Johnſton</hi>
deny'd alſo before the Council, that ſhe was
out of her Houſe after nine a Clock that night,
and yet it is prov'd that ſhe ſtay'd abroad till
after twelve, ſo that her Husband was forc'd
to ſend for a Stranger, to give ſuck to her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant.
Why did they both deny, or ſhe aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
her Child, at ſo ſuſpect a time? And it is
ridiculous to pretend as they do, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
ſo extraordinary a circumſtance in ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
a night, eſpecially being examined
upon it, within two or three days thereafter.

but God to diſcover, and revenge a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(which he thought fit to ſuffer to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
for the puniſhment of ſo many preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
horrid Crimes) inſpired Sir <hi>James</hi> to bring
with him that night, a devout Miniſter, for
preparing the Father, and proving againſt the
Son; and this pious and grave man, whoſe
Merit may be laid in Ballance with many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
Depones, that he heard that night, the
noiſe of many People within the Houſe, which
was inconſiſtent with Sir <hi>James</hi>'s drowning
himſelf without it: And Depones, that his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
followed this noiſe until it died out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the River, into which he was thrown by
them; and the Brink is prov'd to have been
broken, and beat by many Feet, which forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
much this Depoſition. It is alſo prov'd,
that he refuſed that night to come to publick
Prayer with his Father, ſwearing that he could
not look upon him, and that the next morning,
when all went to find out his Father, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
he had firſt found him; but that he
came away, without diſcovering that he had
found him, nor did he ſhew the leaſt grief
when he was found by others; whereas if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had not been quit devour'd by Vice and
Guilt, he had certainly thrown himſelf upon
his dead Father, and had lamented that fatal
Death, which no man, except he, ſaw with
dry eyes; but whilſt others were mourning
for his Father, this Miſcreant would not ſuffer
him to be carried in to his own Houſe, ſaying,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37914:20"/>
that he died like a Dog, O criminal Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that never appeared in this paſſionat Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſave upon the Death of his Father. O
curſed Juſtice never ſhowen or pretended to
ſave in aſſerting, that his Father deſerved no
reſpect, becauſe he drown'd himſelf. Upon
this villanous pretext, he cauſed throw him
into a remot Houſe, where none were allowed
to ſee the Body, ſave his own Accomplices, to
prevent all Diſcovery by Inſpection of it, and
for the ſame reaſon cauſed bury him very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
in ſpight of a Countermand from his
Freinds at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> But they fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that Sir <hi>James</hi> was Murdered by his own
Son, ſent out ſome Chirurgions and Freinds,
who having raiſed the Body, did ſee it bleed
miraculouſly upon his touching it. In which
God Almighty himſelf was pleaſed to bear a
ſhare in the teſtimonies which we produce;
that Divine Power, which makes the Blood
circulat during Life, has oft-times, in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
opened a paſſage to it after Death, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch occaſions; but moſt in this caſe, for
after all the Wounds had been ſewed up, and
the Body deſignedly ſhaken up and down, and
which is moſt wonderful, after the Body had
been buried for ſeveral days, which naturally
occaſions the Blood to congeal; upon <hi>Philip</hi>'s
touching it the Blood darted and ſprung out
to the great aſtoniſhment of the Chirurgions
themſelves, who were deſired to watch this
Event, whereupon <hi>Philip</hi> aſtoniſhed more than
they, threw down the Body, crying, <hi>O God!
O God!</hi> and cleanſing his Hand grew ſo faint,
that they were forc'd to give him a Cordial. But
leaſt any ſhadow of difficulty might remain
with you, his Divine Providence, which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
reveals it ſelf by the mouths of Babes
and Sucklings, has brought us two little Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
whom as no body could be ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
as to corrupt, ſo none can be ſuch Infidels
as not to believe, eſpecially ſince they Depone
againſt their own Parents, and have owned
firmly in their preſence, what they now De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
in yours; from them ye have an account,
how <hi>Philip</hi> that night came into the Houſe of
their Parents, and there ſwore, <hi>He would be
ridd of his Father that very Night;</hi> how they
went out at midnight, and after their return
made their reflections, how eaſily Sir <hi>James</hi>
had died, and how briskly <hi>Philip</hi> had beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
by guarding the door with a Piſtol in
his one Hand, and a Sword in the other, how
they had hung a Stone about his Neck, but
had thereafter taken it away, and how the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
durſt not ſtay in her own Houſe, while
Sir <hi>James</hi>'s Coat was there, and if you had
ſeen this little Boy upon his knees, begging his
Father to confeſs with ſo much Affection, ſo
much Judgement, ſo much Piety, you had
needed no other Probation but himſelf; the
Father himſelf before his Death was convinced,
and frequently foretold, that his Son would
kill him, and the Mother how ſoon ſhe heard
of her Husband's death, and ſome of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
now inſiſted upon, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
what ſhe had heard her Son ſay to her
ſelf, and what he had ſaid at <hi>Nunland,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
he was the Murderer, in ſpight even of
that criminal kindneſs which ſhe had for him;
almoſt the whole Nation was convinced of this
before any Probation was led: and the Lords
of the Privy Council, among whom many of
our Judges ſit, did declare, that they thought
that half of the Probation which was led be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, ſufficient to convince an Inqueſt.
How then ſhould the leaſt ſcruple remain with
you, before whom ſo full, ſo clear, and ſo le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
a Probation has been led, that like a Pend,
every part of it ſupports another, and like a
Chain, every Link draws on another.</p>
                     <p>I need not fortifie ſo pregnant a Probation,
by laying out before you, how often he and his
Complices have contradicted one another, and
even how often he has contradicted himſelf,
in the moſt obvious and material points, and
how he denyes every thing with Oaths, and
with equal confidence, though never ſo clearly
prov'd: Albeit ſuch as theſe are the chief things
that make up the Probation in other Caſes, nor
how he ſuffered the greateſt Indignities ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
from his Complices, in preſence of
the Privy Council, though this convinced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their Lordſhips, that he was at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of thoſe Complices, who were too far upon
his Secrets, not to be ſlaviſhlie ſubmitted to.
But I cannot omit, how that ſince he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Priſon, he has lived ſo Impiouſlie, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſticallie,
as ſhewes, that he had no awe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Spirit, to reſtrain him from commiting
any Crime from a love to God, or a fear to
Hell, and that he conſtantly filled and kept
himſelf drunk from morning till night, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to drown the voice of his Conſcience, and
to make himſelf inſenſible of the Terrors of the
Almighty.</p>
                     <p>The Judges have declared what was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be prov'd, and you are only to judge,
if we have prov'd what they thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and therefore there is no place to doubt,
if a man's life may be taken away upon meer
preſumptions; for the Judges have eaſed you
of that ſcruple, by finding the grounds in this
qualified Libel relevant: and his own Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats
have acknowledged this Probation to be
ſo ſtrong and unanſwerable, that before the
half of it was led, they went away and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
a Client, whom they found they could
not defend, nor ſhould any man doubt of a
Probation, which ones own Advocats thinks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible.
If then ſuch amongſt you as are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
would not wiſh to be murdered by your
own Children; or ſuch of you as are Sons,
would not wiſh the World to believe that you
are weary of your Fathers; you will all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
to find this Miſcreant guilty of a Crime
that God has taken ſo much pains to detect,
and all mankind has ſuch reaſon to wiſh to be
puniſhed. May then the Almighty God who
form'd your Hearts, convince them; and
may this poor Nation Cite you, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makable
Curbers of Vice, to all ſucceeding
Ages.</p>
