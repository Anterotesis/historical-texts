            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HIS GRACE THE Duke of Ormond.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SOME Estates are held in <hi>England,</hi> by paying a Fine at the change of every Lord: I have enjoy'd the Patronage of your Family, from the time of your excellent Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to this present Day. I have dedicated the Lives of <hi>Plutarch</hi> to the first Duke; and have celebrated the Memory of your Heroick Father. Tho' I am very short of the Age of <hi>Nestor,</hi> yet I have liv'd to a third Generation of your House; and by your Grace's Favour am admitted still to hold from you by the same Tenure.</p>
            <p>I am not vain enough to boast that I have deserv'd the value of so Illustrious a Line; but my Fortune is the greater, that for three Descents they have been pleas'd to distinguish my Poems from those of other Men; and have accordingly made me their peculiar Care. May it be permitted me to say, That as your Grandfather and Father were cherish'd and adorn'd with Honours by two successive Monarchs, so I have been esteem'd, and patronis'd, by the Grandfather, the Father, and
<pb facs="tcp:58868:4"/>
the Son, descended from one of the most Ancient, most Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous, and most Deserving Families in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, that by delaying the Payment of my last Fine, when it was due by your Grace's Accession to the Titles, and Patrimonies of your House, I may seem in rigour of Law to have made a forfeiture of my Claim, yet my Heart has always been devoted to your Service: And since you have been graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleas'd, by your permission of this Address, to accept the tender of my Duty, 'tis not yet too late to lay these Poems at your Feet.</p>
            <p>The World is sensible that you worthily succeed, not only to the Honours of your Ancestors, but also to their Virtues. The long Chain of Magnanimity, Courage, easiness of Access, and desire of doing Good, even to the Prejudice of your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, is so far from being broken in your Grace, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Metal yet runs pure to the newest Link of it: Which I will not call the last, because I hope and pray, it may descend to late Posterity: And your flourishing Youth, and that of your excellent Dutchess, are happy Omens of my Wish.</p>
            <p>'Tis observ'd by <hi>Livy</hi> and by others, That some of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest <hi>Roman</hi> Families retain'd a resemblance of their Ancestry, not only in their Shapes and Features, but also in their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, their Qualities, and the distinguishing Characters of their Minds: Some Lines were noted for a stern, rigid Virtue, sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, haughty, parcimonious and unpopular: Others were more sweet, and affable; made of a more pliant Past, humble, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and obliging; studious of doing charitable Offices, and diffusive of the Goods which they enjoy'd. The last of these is the proper and indelible Character of your Grace's Family. God Almighty has endu'd you with a Softness, a Beneficence, an attractive Behaviour winning on the Hearts of others; and so sensible of their Misery, that the Wounds of Fortune, seem not inflicted on them but on your self. You are so ready to redress, that you almost prevent their Wishes, and always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their Expectations: As if what was yours, was not your own, and not given you to possess, but to bestow on wanting Merit. But this is a Topick which I must cast in Shades, left
<pb facs="tcp:58868:4"/>
I offend your Modesty, which is so far from being ostentatious of the Good you do, that it blushes even to have it known: And therefore I must leave you to the Satisfaction and Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your own Conscience, which though it be a silent Panegyrick, is yet the best.</p>
            <p>You are so easy of Access, that <hi>Poplicola</hi> was not more, whose Doors were open'd on the Outside to save the People even the common Civility of asking entrance; where all were equally admitted; where nothing that was reasonable was deny'd; where Misfortune was a powerful Recommendation, and where (I can scarce forbear saying) that Want it self was a powerful Mediator, and was next to Merit.</p>
            <p>The History of <hi>Peru</hi> assures us, That their <hi>Inca's</hi> above all their Titles, esteem'd that the highest, which call'd them Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Poor: A Name more glorious, than the <hi>Felix, Pius,</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors; which were Epithets of Flattery, deserv'd by few of them; and not running in a Blood like the perpetual Gentleness, and inherent Goodness of the <hi>ORMOND</hi> Family.</p>
            <p>Gold, as it is the purest, so it is the softest, and most ductile of all Metals: Iron, which is the hardest, gathers Rust, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes its self; and is therefore subject to Corruption: It was never intended for Coins and Medals, or to bear the Faces and Inscriptions of the Great. Indeed 'tis fit for Armour, to bear off Insults, and preserve the Wearer in the Day of Battle: But the Danger once repell'd, 'tis laid aside by the Brave, as a Garment too rough for civil Conversation; a necessary Guard in War, but too harsh and cumbersome in Peace, and which keeps off the embraces of a more human Life.</p>
            <p>For this Reason, my Lord, though you have Courage in a heroical Degree, yet I ascribe it to you, but as your second Attribute: Mercy, Beneficence, and Compassion, claim Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence, as they are first in the divine Nature. An intrepid Courage, which is inherent in your Grace, is at best but a Holiday-kind of Virtue, to be seldom exercis'd, and never but in Cases of Necessity: Affability, Mildness, Tenderness, and a
<pb facs="tcp:58868:5"/>
Word, which I would fain bring back to its original Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Virtue, I mean good Nature, are of daily use: They are the Bread of Mankind, and Staff of Life: Neither Sighs, nor Tears, nor Groans, nor Curses of the vanquish'd, follow Acts of Compassion, and of Charity: But a sincere Pleasure, and Serenity of Mind, in him who performs an Action of Mercy, which cannot suffer the Misfortunes of another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out redress; least they should bring a kind of Contagion along with them, and pollute the Happiness which he enjoys.</p>
            <p>Yet since the perverse Tempers of Mankind, since Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on one side, and Ambition on the other, are sometimes the unavoidable Occasions of War; that Courage, that Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, and Resolution, which is born with you, cannot be too much commended: And here it grieves me that I am scanted in the pleasure of dwelling on many of your Actions: But <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is an Expression which <hi>Tully</hi> often uses, when he would do what he dares not, and fears the Censure of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have sometimes been forc'd to amplify on others; but here, where the Subject is so fruitful, that the Harvest overcomes the Reaper, I am shorten'd by my Chain, and can only see what is forbidden me to reach: Since it is not permitted me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you, according to the extent of my Wishes, and much less is it in my Power to make my Commendations equal to your Merits.</p>
            <p>Yet in this Frugality of your Praises, there are some Things which I cannot omit, without detracting from your Character. You have so form'd your own Education, as enables you to pay the Debt you owe your Country; or more properly speaking, both your Countries: Because you were born, I may almost say in Purple at the Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> when your Grandfather was Lord-Lieutenant, and have since been bred in the Court of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Address had been in Verse, I might have call'd you as <hi>Claudian</hi> calls <hi>Mercury, Numen commune, Gemino faciens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercia mundo.</hi> The better to satisfy this double Obligation you
<pb facs="tcp:58868:5"/>
have early cultivated the Genius you have to Arms, that when the Service of <hi>Britain</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> shall require your Courage, and your Conduct, you may exert them both to the Benefit of either Country. You began in the Cabinet what you afterwards practis'd in the Camp; and thus both <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> (to omit a crowd of shining <hi>Romans</hi>) form'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the War by the Study of History; and by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the greatest Captains, both of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> before their time. I name those two Commanders in particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were better read in Chronicle than any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Leaders; and that <hi>Lucullus</hi> in particular, having only the Theory of War from Books, was thought fit, without Practice, to be sent into the Field, against the most formidable Enemy of <hi>Rome. Tully</hi> indeed was call'd the learn'd Consul in derision; but then he was not born a Soldier: His Head was turn'd another way: When he read the Tacticks he was thinking on the Bar, which was his Field of Battle. The Knowledge of Warfare is thrown away on a General who dares not make use of what he knows. I commend it only in a Man of Courage and of Resolution; in him it will direct his Martial Spirit; and teach him the way to the best Victories, which are those that are least bloody, and which tho' atchiev'd by the Hand, are manag'd by the Head. Science distinguishes a Man of Honour from one of those Athletick Brutes whom undeservedly we call Heroes. Curs'd be the Poet, who first honour'd with that Name a meer <hi>Ajax,</hi> a Man-killing Ideot. The <hi>Ulysses</hi> of <hi>Ovid</hi> upbraids his Ignorance, that he understood not the Shield for which he pleaded: There was engraven on it, Plans of Cities, and Maps of Countries, which <hi>Ajax</hi> could not comprehend, but look'd on them as stupidly as his Fellow-Beast the Lion. But on the other side, your Grace has given your self the Education of his Rival; you have studied every Spot of Ground in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which for these ten Years past has been the Scene of Battles and of Sieges. No wonder if you perform'd your Part with such Applause on a Theater which you understood so well.</p>
            <p>If I design'd this for a Poetical Encomium, it were easy to enlarge on so copious a Subject; but confining my self to the
<pb facs="tcp:58868:6"/>
Severity of Truth, and to what is becoming me to say, I must not only pass over many Instances of your Military Skill, but also those of your assiduous Diligence in the War; and of your Personal Bravery, attended with an ardent Thirst of Honour; a long Train of Generosity; Profuseness of doing Good; a Soul unsatisfy'd with all it has done; and an unextinguish'd Desire of doing more. But all this is Matter for your own Historians; I am, as <hi>Virgil</hi> says, <hi>Spatiis exclusus iniquis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet not to be wholly silent of all your Charities I must stay a little on one Action, which preferr'd the Relief of Others, to the Consideration of your Self. When, in the Battle of <hi>Landen,</hi> your Heat of Courage (a Fault only pardonable to your Youth) had transported you so far before your Friends, that they were unable to follow, much less to succour you; when you were not only dangerously, but in all appearance mortally wounded, when in that desperate Condition you were made Prisoner, and carried to <hi>Namur</hi> at that time in Possession of the <hi>French;</hi> then it was, my Lord, that you took a considerable Part of what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to you of your own Revenues, and as a memorable Instance of your Heroick Charity, put it into the Hands of Count <hi>Guiscard,</hi> who was Governor of the Place, to be distributed among your Fellow-Prisoners. The <hi>French</hi> Commander, charm'd with the greatness of your Soul, accordingly consign'd it to the Use for which it was intended by the Donor: By which means the Lives of so many miserable Men were sav'd, and a comfortable Provision made for their Subsistance, who had otherwise pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd, had not you been the Companion of their Misfortune: or rather sent by Providence, like another <hi>Joseph,</hi> to keep out Famine from invading those, whom in Humility you call'd your Brethren. How happy was it for those poor Creatures, that your Grace was made their Fellow-Sufferer? And how glorious for You, that you chose to want rather than not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Wants of others? The Heathen Poet, in commending the Charity of <hi>Dido</hi> to the <hi>Trojans,</hi> spoke like a Christian: <hi>Non ignara mali miseris, succurere disco.</hi> All Men, even those of a different Interest, and contrary Principles, must praise this Action, as the most eminent for Piety, not only in this dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Age, but almost in any of the former; when Men were
<pb facs="tcp:58868:6"/>
made <hi>de meliore luto;</hi> when Examples of Charity were frequent, and when there were in being, <hi>Teucri pulcherrima proles, Magnanimi Heroes nati melioribus annis.</hi> No Envy can detract from this; it will shine in History; and like Swans, grow whiter the longer it endures: And the Name of <hi>ORMOND</hi> will be more celebrated in his Captivity, than in his greatest Triumphs.</p>
            <p>But all Actions of your Grace are of a piece; as Waters keep the Tenour of their Fountains: your Compassion is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and has the same Effect as well on Enemies as Friends. 'Tis so much in your Nature to do Good, that your Life is but one continued Act of placing Benesits on many; as the Sun is always carrying his Light to some Part or other of the World: And were it not that your Reason guides you where to give, I might almost say that you could not help bestowing more, than is consisting with the Fortune of a private Man, or with the Will of any but an <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Wonder is it then, that being born for a Blessing to Mankind, your suppos'd Death in that Engagement, was so generally lamented through the Nation? The Concernment for it was as universal as the Loss: And though the Gratitude might be counterfeit in some, yet the Tears of all were real: Where every Man deplor'd his private Part in that Calamity, and even those who had not tasted of your Favours, yet built so much on the Fame of your Beneficence, that they bemoan'd the Loss of their Expectations.</p>
            <p>This brought the untimely Death of your Great Father into fresh remembrance; as if the same Decree had pass'd on two short successive Generations of the Virtuous; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to my self the same Verses, which I had formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to him: <hi>Ostendunt terris hunc tantum fata, nec ultra, esse sinunt.</hi> But to the Joy not only of all good Men, but of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, the unhappy Omen took not place. You are still living to enjoy the Blessings and Applause of all the Good you have perform'd, the Prayers of Multitudes whom you have oblig'd, for your long Prosperity; and that your Power
<pb facs="tcp:58868:7"/>
of doing generous and charitable Actions, may be as extended as your Will; which is by none more zealously desir'd than by</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TIS with a Poet, as with a Man who designs to build, and is very exact, as he supposes, in casting up the Cost beforehand: But, generally speaking, he is mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in his Account, and reckons short of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence he first intended: He alters his Mind as the Work proceeds, and will have this or that Convenience more, of which he had not thought when he began. So has it hapned to me; I have built a House, where I intended but a Lodge: Yet with better Success, than a certain Nobleman, who beginning with a Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennil, never liv'd to finish the Palace he had contriv'd.</p>
            <p>From translating the First of <hi>Homer's Iliads,</hi> (which I intended as an Essay to the whole Work) I proceeded to the Translation of the Twelfth Book of <hi>Ovid's Metamorphoses,</hi> because it contains, among other Things, the Causes, the Beginning, and Ending, of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War: Here I ought in reason to have stopp'd; but the Speeches of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Ulysses</hi> lying next in my way, I could not balk 'em. When I had compass'd them, I was so taken with the former Part of the Fifteenth Book, (which is the Master-piece of the whole <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoses</hi>) that I enjoyn'd my self the pleasing Task of rendring it into <hi>English.</hi> And now I found, by the Number of my Verses, that they began to swell into a little Volume; which gave me an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of looking backward on some Beauties of my Author, in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Books: There occur'd to me the Hunting of the Boar, <hi>Cinyras</hi> and <hi>Myrrha,</hi> the good-natur'd Story of <hi>Baucis</hi> and <hi>Philemon,</hi> with the rest, which I hope I have translated closely enough, and given them the same Turn of Verse, which they had in the Original; and this, I may say without vanity, is not the Talent of every Poet: He who has arriv'd the nearest to it, is the Ingenious and Learned <hi>Sandys,</hi> the best Versifier of the former Age; if I may properly call it by that Name, which was the former Part of this concluding Century. For <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Fairfax</hi> both flourish'd in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> Great Masters in our Language; and who saw much farther into the Beauties of our Numbers, than those who immediately followed them. <hi>Milton</hi> was the Poetical Son of <hi>Spencer,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> of <hi>Fairfax;</hi> for we have our Lineal Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents and Clans, as well as other Families: <hi>Spencer</hi> more than once insinuates, that the Soul of <hi>Chaucer</hi> was transsus'd into his Body; and that he was begotten by him Two hundred years after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease. <hi>Milton</hi> has acknowledg'd to me, that <hi>Spencer</hi> was his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; and many besides my self have heard our famous <hi>Waller</hi> own, that he deriv'd the Harmony of his Numbers from the <hi>Godfrey of Bulloign,</hi> which was turn'd into <hi>English</hi> by Mr. <hi>Fairfax.</hi> But to return: Having done with <hi>Ovid</hi> for this time, it came into my mind, that our old <hi>English</hi> Poet <hi>Chaucer</hi> in many Things resembled
<pb facs="tcp:58868:8"/>
him, and that with no disadvantage on the Side of the Modern Author, as I shall endeavour to prove when I compare them: And as I am, and always have been studious to promote the Honour of my Native Country, so I soon resolv'd to put their Merits to the Trial, by turning some of the <hi>Canterbury</hi> Tales into our Language, as it is now refin'd: For by this Means both the Poets being set in the same Light, and dress'd in the same <hi>English</hi> Habit, Story to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with Story, a certain Judgment may be made betwixt them, by the Reader, without obtruding my Opinion on him: Or if I seem partial to my Country-man, and Predecessor in the Laurel, the Friends of Antiquity are not few: And besides many of the Learn'd, <hi>Ovid</hi> has almost all the <hi>Beaux,</hi> and the whole Fair Sex his declar'd Patrons. Perhaps I have assum'd somewhat more to my self than they allow me; because I have adventur'd to sum up the Evidence: But the Readers are the Jury; and their Privilege remains entire to decide according to the Merits of the Cause: Or, if they please to bring it to another Hearing, before some other Court. In the mean time, to follow the Thrid of my Discourse, (as Thoughts, according to Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> have always some Connexion) so from <hi>Chaucer</hi> I was led to think on <hi>Boccace,</hi> who was not only his Contemporary, but also pursu'd the same Studies; wrote Novels in Prose, and many Works in Verse; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly is said to have invented the Octave Rhyme, or <hi>Stanza</hi> of Eight Lines, which ever since has been maintain'd by the Practice of all <hi>Italian</hi> Writers, who are, or at least assume the Title of <hi>Heroick Poets:</hi> He and <hi>Chaucer,</hi> among other Things, had this in common, that they refin'd their Mother-Tongues; but with this difference, that <hi>Dante</hi> had begun to file their Language, at least in Verse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of <hi>Boccace,</hi> who likewise receiv'd no little Help from his Master <hi>Petrarch:</hi> But the Reformation of their Prose was wholly owing to <hi>Boccace</hi> himself; who is yet the Standard of Purity in the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue; though many of his Phrases are become obsolete, as in process of Time it must needs happen. <hi>Chaucer</hi> (as you have formerly been told by our learn'd Mr. <hi>Rhymer</hi>) first adorn'd and amplified our barren Tongue from the <hi>Provencall,</hi> which was then the most polish'd of all the Modern Languages: But this Subject has been copiously treated by that great Critick, who deserves no little Commendation from us his Countrymen. For these Reasons of Time, and Resemblance of Genius, in <hi>Chaucer</hi> and <hi>Boccace,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to join them in my present Work; to which I have added some Original Papers of my own; which whether they are equal or inferiour to my other Poems, an Author is the most improper Judge; and therefore I leave them wholly to the Mercy of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: I will hope the best, that they will not be condemn'd; but if they should, I have the Excuse of an old Gentleman, who mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Horseback before some Ladies, when I was present, got up somewhat heavily, but desir'd of the Fair Spectators, that they would count Fourscore and eight before they judg'd him. By the Mercy of God, I am already come within Twenty Years of his Number, a Cripple in my Limbs, but what Decays are in my Mind, the Reader must determine. I think my self as vigorous as ever in the Faculties of my Soul, excepting only my Memory, which is
<pb facs="tcp:58868:8"/>
not impair'd to any great degree; and if I lose not more of it, I have no great reason to complain. What Judgment I had, increases rather than diminishes; and Thoughts, such as they are, come crowding in so fast upon me, that my only Difficulty is to chuse or to reject; to run them into Verse, or to give them the other Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Prose, I have so long studied and practis'd both, that they are grown into a Habit, and become familiar to me. In short, though I may lawfully plead some part of the old Gentleman's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse; yet I will reserve it till I think I have greater need, and ask no Grains of Allowance for the Faults of this my present Work, but those which are given of course to Humane Frailty. I will not trouble my Reader with the shortness of Time in which I writ it; or the several Intervals of Sickness: They who think too well of their own Performances, are apt to boast in their Prefaces how little Time their Works have cost them; and what other Business of more importance interfer'd: But the Reader will be as apt to ask the Question, Why they allow'd not a longer Time to make their Works more perfect? and why they had so despicable an Opinion of their Judges, as to thrust their indigested Stuff upon them, as if they deserv'd no better?</p>
            <p>With this Account of my present Undertaking, I conclude the first Part of this Discourse: In the second Part, as at a second Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, though I alter not the Draught, I must touch the same Features over again, and change the Dead-colouring of the Whole. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral I will only say, that I have written nothing which savours of Immorality or Profaneness; at least, I am not conscious to my self of any such Intention. If there happen to be found an irreverent Expression, or a Thought too wanton, they are crept into my Verses through my Inadvertency: If the Searchers find any in the Cargo, let them be stav'd or forfeited, like Counterbanded Goods; at least, let their Authors be answerable for them, as being but imported Merchandise, and not of my own Manufacture. On the other Side, I have endeavour'd to chuse such Fables, both Ancient and Modern, as contain in each of them some instructive Moral, which I could prove by Induction, but the Way is tedious; and they leap foremost into sight, without the Reader's Trouble of looking after them. I wish I could affirm with a safe Conscience, that I had taken the same Care in all my former Writings; for it must be own'd, that supposing Verses are never so beautiful or pleasing, yet if they contain any thing which shocks Religion, or Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they are at best, what <hi>Horace</hi> says of good Numbers without good Sehse, <hi>Versus inopes rerum; nugaeque canorae:</hi> Thus far, I hope, I am Right in Court, without renouncing to my other Right of Self-defence, where I have been wrongfully accus'd, and my Sense wire-drawn into Blasphemy or Bawdry, as it has often been by a Religious Lawyer, in a late Pleading against the Stage; in which he mixes Truth with Falshood, and has not forgotten the old Rule, of calumniating strongly, that something may remain.</p>
            <p>I resume the Thrid of my Discourse with the first of my Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which was the First <hi>Iliad</hi> of <hi>Homer.</hi> If it shall please God to give me longer Life, and moderate Health, my Intentions are to translate the whole <hi>Ilias;</hi> provided still, that I meet with those En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
<pb facs="tcp:58868:9"/>
from the Publick, which may enable me to proceed in my Undertaking with some Chearfulness, And this I dare assure the World before-hand, that I have found by Trial, <hi>Homer</hi> a more pleasing Task than <hi>Virgil,</hi> (though I say not the Translation will be less laborious.) For the <hi>Grecian</hi> is more according to my Genius, than the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet. In the Works of the two Authors we may read their Manners, and natural Inclinations, which are wholly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. <hi>Virgil</hi> was of a quiet, sedate Temper; <hi>Homer</hi> was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, impetuous, and full of Fire. The chief Talent of <hi>Virgil</hi> was Propriety of Thoughts, and Ornament of Words: <hi>Homer</hi> was rapid in his Thoughts, and took all the Liberties both of Numbers, and of Expressions, which his Language, and the Age in which he liv'd allow'd him: <hi>Homer's</hi> Invention was more copious, <hi>Virgil's</hi> more confin'd So that if <hi>Homer</hi> had not led the Way, it was not in <hi>Virgil</hi> to have begun-Heroick Poetry: For, nothing can be more evident, than that the <hi>Roman</hi> Poem is but the Second Part of the <hi>Ilias;</hi> a Continuation of the same Story: And the Persons already form'd: The Manners of <hi>AEneds,</hi> are those of <hi>Hector</hi> superadded to those which <hi>Homer</hi> gave him. The Adventures of <hi>Ulysses</hi> in the <hi>Odysseis,</hi> are imitated in the first Six Books of <hi>Virgil's AEneis:</hi> And though the Accidents are not the same, (which would have argu'd him of a servile, copying, and total Barrenness of Invention) yet the Seas were the same, in which both the <hi>Heroes-wander'd;</hi> and <hi>Dido</hi> cannot be deny'd to be the Poetical Daughter of <hi>Calypso.</hi> The Six latter Books of <hi>Virgil's</hi> Poem, are the Four and twenty <hi>Iliads</hi> contracted: A Quarrel occasion'd by a Lady, a Single Combate, Battels fought, and Town besieg'd. I say not this in derogation to <hi>Virgil,</hi> neither do I contradict any thing which I have formerly said in his just Praise: For his <hi>Episodes</hi> are almost wholly of his own Invention and the Form which he has given to the Telling, makes the Tale his own even though the Original Story had been the same. But this proves, however that <hi>Homer</hi> taught <hi>Virgil</hi> to design: And if Invention be the first Vertue of an Epick Poet, then the <hi>Latin</hi> Poem can only be allow'd the second Place. Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> in the Preface to his own bald Translation of the <hi>Ilias,</hi> (studying Poetry as he did Mathematicks, when it was too late) Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> I say, begins the Praise of <hi>Homer</hi> where he should have ended it. He tells us, that the first Beauty of an Epick Poem consists in Diction, that is, in the Choice of Words, and Harmony of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Now, the Words are the Colouring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Work, which in the Order of Nature is last to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Design, the Disposition, the Manners, and the Thoughts, are all before it: Where any of those are wanting or imperfect, so much wants or is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Imitation of Humane Life; which is in the very Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Poem. Words Indeed, like glaring Colours, are the first Beauties that arise, and strike the Sight; but if the Draught be false or lame, the Figures ill dispos'd, the Manners obscure or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent, or the Thoughts unnatural, then the finest Colours are but Dawbing, and the Piece is a beautiful Monster at the best. Neither <hi>Virgil</hi> nor <hi>Homer</hi> were deficient in any of the former Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but in this last, which is Expression, the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet is at least equal to the <hi>Grecian,</hi> as I have said elsewhere; supplying the
<pb facs="tcp:58868:9"/>
Poverty of his Language, by his Musical Ear, and by his Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. But to return: Our two Great Poets, being so different in their Tempers, one Cholerick and Sanguin, the other Phlegmatick and Melancholick; that which makes them excel in their several Ways, is, that each of them has follow'd his own natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well in Forming the Design, as in the Execution of it. The very <hi>Heroes</hi> shew their Authors: <hi>Achilles</hi> is hot, impatient, revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer, &amp;c. AEnoeas</hi> patient, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate, careful of his People, and merciful to his Enemies; ever submissive to the Will of Heaven, <hi>quo fata trahunt retrahuntque, sequamur.</hi> I could please my self with enlarging on this Subject, but am forc'd to defer it to a fitter Time. From all I have said, I will only draw this Inference, That the Action of <hi>Homer</hi> being more full of Vigour than that of <hi>Virgil,</hi> according to the Temper of the Writer, is of consequence more pleasing to the Reader. One warms you by Degrees; the other sets you on fire all at once, and never intermits his Heat. 'Tis the same Difference which <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi> makes betwixt the Effects of Eloquence in <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> and <hi>Tully.</hi> One persuades; the other commands. You never cool while you read <hi>Homer,</hi> even not in the Second Book, (a graceful Flattery to his Countrymen;) but he hastens from the Ships, and concludes not that Book till he has made you an Amends by the violent play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a new Machine. From thence he hurries on his Action with Variety of Events, and ends it in less Compass than Two Months. This Vehemence of his, I confess, is more suitable to my Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and therefore I have translated his First Book with greater Pleasure than any Part of <hi>Virgil:</hi> But it was not a Pleasure without Pains: The continual Agitations of the Spirits, must needs be a Weakning of any Constitution, especially in Age: and many Pauses are required for Refreshment betwixt the Heats; the <hi>Iliad</hi> of its self being a third part longer than all <hi>Virgil's</hi> Works together.</p>
            <p>This is what I thought needful in this Place to say of <hi>Homer.</hi> I proceed to <hi>Ovid,</hi> and <hi>Chaucer;</hi> considering the former only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the latter. With <hi>Ovid</hi> ended the Golden Age of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Tongue: From <hi>Chaucer</hi> the Purity of the <hi>English</hi> Tongue began. The Manners of the Poets were not unlike: Both of them were well-bred, well-natur'd, amorous, and Libertine, at least in their Writings, it may be also in their Lives. Their Studies were the same, Philosophy, and Philology. Both of them were knowing in Astronomy, of which <hi>Ovid's</hi> Books of the <hi>Roman</hi> Feasts, and <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer's</hi> Treatise of the <hi>Astrolabe,</hi> are sufficient Witnesses. But <hi>Chaucer</hi> was likewise an Astrologer, as were <hi>Virgil, Horace, Persius,</hi> and <hi>Manilius.</hi> Both writ with wonderful Facility and Clearness; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were great Inventors: For <hi>Ovid</hi> only copied the <hi>Grecian</hi> Fables; and most of <hi>Chaucer's</hi> Stories were taken from his <hi>Italian</hi> Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, or their Predecessors: <hi>Boccace</hi> his <hi>Decameron</hi> was first pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd; and from thence our <hi>Englishman</hi> has borrow'd many of his <hi>Canterbury</hi> Tales: Yet that of <hi>Palamon</hi> and <hi>Arcite</hi> was written in all probability by some <hi>Italian</hi> Wit, in a former Age; as I shall prove hereafter: The Tale of <hi>Grizild</hi> was the Invention of <hi>Petrarch;</hi> by him sent to <hi>Boccace;</hi> from whom it came to <hi>Chaucer: Troilus</hi> and <hi>Cressida</hi> was also written by a <hi>Lombard</hi> Author; but much amplified
<pb facs="tcp:58868:10"/>
by our <hi>English</hi> Translatour, as well as beautified; the Genius of our Countrymen in general being rather to improve an Invention, than to invent themselves; as is evident not only in our Poetry, but in many of our Manufactures. I find I have anticipated already, and taken up from <hi>Boccace</hi> before I come to him: But there is so much less behind; and I am of the Temper of most Kings, <hi>who love to be in Debt,</hi> are all for present Money, no matter how they pay it afterwards: Besides, the Nature of a Preface is rambling; never wholly out of the Way, nor in it. This I have learn'd from the Practice of honest <hi>Montaign,</hi> and return at my pleasure to <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Chaucer,</hi> of whom I have little more to say. Both of them built on the Inventions of other Men; yet since <hi>Chaucer</hi> had something of his own, as <hi>The Wife of Baths Tale, The Cock and the Fox,</hi> which I have translated, and some others, I may justly give our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the Precedence in that Part; since I can remember nothing of <hi>Ovid</hi> which was wholly his. Both of them understood the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; under which Name I comprehend the Passions, and, in a larger Sense, the Descriptions of Persons, and their very Habits: For an Example, I see <hi>Baucis</hi> and <hi>Philemon</hi> as perfectly before me, as if some ancient Painter had drawn them; and all the Pilgrims in the <hi>Canterbury</hi> Tales, their Humours, their Features, and the very Dress, as distinctly as if I had supp'd with them at the <hi>Tabard</hi> in <hi>Southwark:</hi> Yet even there too the Figures of <hi>Chaucer</hi> are much more lively, and set in a better Light: Which though I have not time to prove; yet I appeal to the Reader, and am sure he will clear me from Partiality. The Thoughts and Words remain to be consider'd, in the Comparison of the two Poets; and I have sav'd my self one half of that Labour, by owning that <hi>Ovid</hi> liv'd when the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue was in its Meridian; <hi>Chaucer,</hi> in the Dawning of our Language: Therefore that Part of the Comparison stands not on an equal Foot, any more than the Diction of <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Ovid;</hi> or of <hi>Chaucer,</hi> and our present <hi>English.</hi> The Words are given up as a Post not to be defended in our Poet, because he wanted the Modern Art of Fortifying. The Thoughts remain to be consider'd: And they are to be measur'd only by their Propriety; that is, as they flow more or less naturally from the Persons describ'd, on such and such Occasions. The Vulgar Judges, which are Nine Parts in Ten of all Nations, who call Conceits and Jingles Wit, who see <hi>Ovid</hi> full of them, and <hi>Chaucer</hi> altogether without them, will think me little less than mad, for preferring the <hi>Englishman</hi> to the <hi>Roman:</hi> Yet, with their leave, I must presume to say, that the Things they admire are only glittering Trifles, and so far from being Witty, that in a serious Poem they are nauseous, because they are unnatural. Wou'd any Man who is ready to die for Love, describe his Passion like <hi>Narcissus?</hi> Wou'd he think of <hi>inopem me copia fecit,</hi> and a Dozen more of such Expressions, pour'd on the Neck of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and signifying all the same Thing? If this were Wit, was this a Time to be witty, when the poor Wretch was in the Agony of Death? This is just <hi>John Littlewit</hi> in <hi>Bartholomew Fair,</hi> who had a Conceit (as he tells you) left him in his Misery; a miserable Conceit. On these Occasions the Poet shou'd endeavour to raise Pity: But instead of this, <hi>Ovid</hi> is tickling you to laugh. <hi>Virgil</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58868:10"/>
never made use of such Machines, when he was moving you to commiserate the Death of <hi>Dido:</hi> He would not destroy what he was building. <hi>Chaucer</hi> makes <hi>Arcite</hi> violent in his Love, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just in the Pursuit of it: Yet when he came to die, he made him think more reasonably: He repents not of his Love, for that had alter'd his Character; but acknowledges the Injustice of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and resigns <hi>Emilia</hi> to <hi>Palamon.</hi> What would <hi>Ovid</hi> have done on this Occasion? He would certainly have made <hi>Arcite</hi> witty on his Death-bed. He had complain'd he was farther off from Possession, by being so near, and a thousand such Boyisms, which <hi>Chaucer</hi> rejected as below the Dignity of the Subject. They who think otherwise, would by the same Reason prefer <hi>Lucan</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> to <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> to all Four of them. As for the Turn of Words, in which <hi>Ovid</hi> particularly excels all Poets; they are sometimes a Fault, and sometimes a Beauty, as they are us'd properly or improperly; but in strong Passions always to be shunn'd, because Passions are serious, and will admit no Playing. The <hi>French</hi> have a high Value for them; and I confess, they are often what they call Delicate, when they are introduc'd with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but <hi>Chaucer</hi> writ with more Simplicity, and follow'd Nature more closely, than to use them. I have thus far, to the best of my Knowledge, been an upright Judge betwixt the Parties in Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not medling with the Design nor the Disposition of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Design was not their own; and in the disposing of it they were equal. It remains that I say somewhat of <hi>Chaucer</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>In the first place, As he is the Father of <hi>English</hi> Poetry, so I hold him in the same Degree of Veneration as the <hi>Grecians</hi> held <hi>Homer,</hi> or the <hi>Romans Virgil:</hi> He is a perpetual Fountain of good Sense; learn'd in all Sciences; and therefore speaks properly on all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: As he knew what to say, so he knows also when to leave off; a Continence which is practis'd by few Writers, and scarcely by any of the Ancients, excepting <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace.</hi> One of our late great Poets is sunk in his Reputation, because he cou'd never forgive any Conceit which came in his way; but swept like a Drag-net, great and small. There was plenty enough, but the Dishes were ill sorted; whole Pyramids of Sweet-meats, for Boys and Women; but little of solid Meat, for Men: All this proceeded not from any want of Knowledge, but of Judgment; neither did he want that in discerning the Beauties and Faults of other Poets; but only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd himself in the Luxury of Writing; and perhaps knew it was a Fault, but hop'd the Reader would not find it. For this Reason, though he must always be thought a great Poet, he is no longer esteem'd a good Writer: And for Ten Impressions, which his Works have had in so many successive Years, yet at present a hundred Books are scarcely purchas'd once a Twelvemonth: For, as my last Lord <hi>Rochester</hi> said, though somewhat profanely, <hi>Not being of God, he could not stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chaucer</hi> follow'd Nature every where; but was never so bold to go beyond her: And there is a great Difference of being <hi>Poeta</hi> and <hi>nimis Poeta,</hi> if we may believe <hi>Catullus,</hi> as much as betwixt a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Behaviour and Affectation. The Verse of <hi>Chaucer,</hi> I confess,
<pb facs="tcp:58868:11"/>
is not Harmonious to us; but 'tis like the Eloquence of one whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> commends, it was <hi>auribus istius temporis accommodata:</hi> They who liv'd with him, and some time after him, thought it Musical; and it continues so even in our Judgment, if compar'd with the Numbers of <hi>Lidgate</hi> and <hi>Gower</hi> his Contemporaries: There is the rude Sweetness of a <hi>Scotch</hi> Tune in it, which is natural and pleasing, though not perfect. 'Tis true, I cannot go so far as he who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd the last Edition of him; for he would make us believe the Fault is in our Ears, and that there were really Ten Syllables in a Verse where we find but Nine: But this Opinion is not worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing; 'tis so gross and obvious an Errour, that common Sense (which is a Rule in every thing but Matters of Faith and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) must convince the Reader, that Equality of Numbers in every Verse which we call <hi>Heroick,</hi> was either not known, or not always practis'd in <hi>Chaucer's</hi> Age. It were an easie Matter to produce some thousands of his Verses, which are lame for want of half a Foot, and sometimes a whole one, and which no Pronunciation can make otherwise. We can only say, that he liv'd in the Infancy of our Poetry, and that nothing is brought to Perfection at the first. We must be Children before we grow Men. There was an <hi>Ennius,</hi> and in process of Time a <hi>Lucilius,</hi> and a <hi>Lucretius,</hi> before <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace;</hi> even after <hi>Chaucer</hi> there was a <hi>Spencer,</hi> a <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington,</hi> a <hi>Fairfax,</hi> before <hi>Waller</hi> and <hi>Denham</hi> were in being: And our Numbers were in their Nonage till these last appear'd. I need say little of his Parentage, Life, and Fortunes: They are to be found at large in all the Editions of his Works. He was employ'd abroad, and favour'd by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and was Poet, as I suppose, to all Three of them. In <hi>Richard's</hi> Time, I doubt, he was a little dipt in the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the Commons; and being Brother-in-Law to <hi>John of Ghant,</hi> it was no wonder if he follow'd the Fortunes of that Family; and was well with <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth when he had depos'd his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor. Neither is it to be admir'd, that <hi>Henry,</hi> who was a wise as well as a valiant Prince, who claim'd by Succession, and was sensible that his Title was not sound, but was rightfully in <hi>Mortimer,</hi> who had married the Heir of <hi>York;</hi> it was not to be admir'd, I say, if that great Politician should be pleas'd to have the greatest Wit of those Times in his Interests, and to be the Trumpet of his Praises. <hi>Augustus</hi> had given him the Example, by the Advice of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> who recommended <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> to him; whose Praises help'd to make him Popular while he was alive, and after his Death have made him Precious to Posterity. As for the Religion of our Poet, he seems to have some little Byas towards the Opinions of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> after <hi>John of Ghant</hi> his Patron; somewhat of which appears in the Tale of <hi>Piers Plowman:</hi> Yet I cannot blame him for inveighing so sharply against the Vices of the Clergy in his Age: Their Pride, their Ambition, their Pomp, their Avarice, their Worldly Interest, deserv'd the Lashes which he gave them, both in that, and in most of his <hi>Canterbury Tales:</hi> Neither has his Contemporary <hi>Boccace,</hi> spar'd them. Yet both those Poets liv'd in much esteem, with good and holy Men in Orders: For the Scandal which is given by particular Priesls, reflects not on the Sacred Function. <hi>Chaucer's</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58868:11"/>
               <hi>Monk,</hi> his <hi>Chanon,</hi> and his <hi>Fryar,</hi> took not from the Character of his <hi>Good Parson.</hi> A Satyrical Poet is the Check of the Laymen, on bad Priests. We are only to take care, that we involve not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent with the Guilty in the same Condemnation. The Good can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too much honour'd, nor the Bad too coursly us'd: For the Corruption of the Best, becomes the Worst. When a Clergy-man is whipp'd, his Gown is first taken off, by which the Dignity of his Order is secur'd: If he be wrongfully accus'd, he has his Action of Slander; and 'tis at the Poet's Peril, if he transgress the Law. But they will tell us, that all kind of Satire, though never so well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd by particular Priests, yet brings the whole Order into Contempt. Is then the Peerage of <hi>England</hi> any thing dishonour'd, when a Peer suffers for his Treason? If he be libell'd, or any way defam'd, he has his <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> to punish the Offendor. They who use this kind of Argument, seem to be conscious to themselves of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which has deserv'd the Poet's Lash; and are less concern'd for their Publick Capacity, than for their Private: At least, there is Pride at the bottom of their Reasoning. If the Faults of Men in Orders are only to be judg'd among themselves, they are all in some sort Parties: For, since they say the Honour of their Order is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in every Member of it, how can we be sure, that they will be impartial Judges? How far I may be allow'd to speak my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this Case, I know not: But I am sure a Dispute of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture caus'd Mischief in abundance betwixt a King of <hi>England</hi> and an Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> one standing up for the Laws of his Land, and the other for the Honour (as he call'd it) of God's Church; which ended in the Murther of the Prelate, and in the whipping of his Majesty from Post to Pillar for his Penance. The Learn'd and Ingenious Dr. <hi>Drake</hi> has sav'd me the Labour of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the Esteem and Reverence which the Priests have had of old; and I would rather extend than diminish any part of it: Yet I must needs say, that when a Priest provokes me without any Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion given him, I have no Reason, unless it be the Charity of a <hi>Christian,</hi> to forgive him: <hi>Prior loesit</hi> is Justification sufficient in the Civil Law. If I answer him in his own Language, Self-defence, I am sure, must be allow'd me; and if I carry it farther, even to a sharp Recrimination, somewhat may be indulg'd to Humane Frailty. Yet my Resentment has not wrought so far, but that I have follow'd <hi>Chaucer</hi> in his Character of a Holy Man, and have enlarg'd on that Subject with some Pleasure, reserving to my self the Right, if I shall think fit hereafter, to describe another sort of Priests, such as are more easily to be found than the Good Parson; such as have given the last Blow to Christianity in this Age, by a Practice so contrary to their Doctrine. But this will keep cold till another time. In the mean while, I take up <hi>Chaucer</hi> where I left him. He must have been a Man of a most wonderful comprehensive Nature, because, as it has been truly observ'd of him, he has taken into the Compass of his <hi>Canterbury Tales</hi> the various Manners and Humours (as we now call them) of the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation, in his Age. Not a single Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter has escap'd him. All his Pilgrims are severally distinguish'd from each other, and not only in their Inclinations, but in their very Phisiognomies and Persons. <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> could not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
<pb facs="tcp:58868:12"/>
their Natures better, than by the Marks which the Poet gives them. The Matter and Manner of their Tales, and of their Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are so suited to their different Educations, Humours, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, that each of them would be improper in any other Mouth. Even the grave and serious Characters are distinguish'd by their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of Gravity: Their Discourses are such as belong to their Age, their Calling, and their Breeding; such as are becoming of them, and of them only. Some of his Persons are Vicious, and some Vertuous; some are unlearn'd, or (as <hi>Chaucer</hi> calls them) Lewd, and some are Learn'd. Even the Ribaldry of the Low Characters is different: The <hi>Reeve,</hi> the <hi>Miller,</hi> and the <hi>Cook,</hi> are several Men, and distinguish'd from each other, as much as the mincing Lady Prioress, and the broad-speaking gap-tooth'd Wife of <hi>Bathe.</hi> But enough of this: There is such a Variety of Game springing up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, that I am distracted in my Choice, and know not which to follow. 'Tis sufficient to say according to the Proverb, that here is God's Plenty. We have our Fore-fathers and Great Grand-dames all before us, as they were in <hi>Chaucer's</hi> Days; their general Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are still remaining in Mankind, and even in <hi>England,</hi> though they are call'd by other Names than those of <hi>Moncks,</hi> and <hi>Fryars,</hi> and <hi>Chanons,</hi> and <hi>Lady Abbesses,</hi> and <hi>Nuns:</hi> For Mankind is ever the same, and nothing lost out of Nature, though every thing is alter'd. May I have leave to do my self the Justice, (since my Enemies will do me none, and are so far from granting me to be a good Poet, that they will not allow me so much as to be a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, or a Moral Man) may I have leave, I say, to inform my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that I have confin'd my Choice to such Tales of <hi>Chaucer,</hi> as savour nothing of Immodesty. If I had desir'd more to please than to instruct, the <hi>Reve,</hi> the <hi>Miller,</hi> the <hi>Shipman,</hi> the <hi>Merchant,</hi> the <hi>Sumner,</hi> and above all, the <hi>Wife of Bathe,</hi> in the Prologue to her Tale, would have procur'd me as many Friends and Readers, as there are <hi>Beaux</hi> and Ladies of Pleasure in the Town. But I will no more offend against Good Manners: I am sensible as I ought to be of the Scandal I have given by my loose Writings; and make what Reparation I am able, by this Publick Acknowledgment. If any thing of this Nature, or of Profaneness, be crept into these Poems, I am so far from defending it, that I disown it. <hi>Totum hoc indictum volo. Chaucer</hi> makes another manner of Apologie for his broad-speaking, and <hi>Boccace</hi> makes the like; but I will follow nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. Our Country-man, in the end of his Characters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Canterbury Tales,</hi> thus excuses the Ribaldry, which is very gross, in many of his Novels.</p>
            <l>But first, I pray you, of your courtesy,</l>
            <l>That ye ne arrete it nought my villany,</l>
            <l>Though that I plainly speak in this mattere</l>
            <l>To tellen you her words, and eke her chere:</l>
            <l>Ne though I speak her words properly,</l>
            <l>For this ye knowen as well as I,</l>
            <l>Who shall tellen a tale after a man</l>
            <l>He mote rehearse as nye, as ever He can:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:58868:12"/>
Everich word of it been in his charge,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>All speke he, never so rudely, ne large.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Or else he mote tellen his tale untrue,</l>
            <l>Or feine things, or find words new:</l>
            <l>He may not spare, altho he were his brother,</l>
            <l>He mote as well say o word as another.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Christ</hi> spake himself full broad in holy Writ,</l>
            <l>And well I wote no Villany is it.</l>
            <l>Eke <hi>Plato</hi> saith, who so can him rede,</l>
            <l>The words mote been Cousin to the dede.</l>
            <p>Yet if a Man should have enquir'd of <hi>Boccace</hi> or of <hi>Chaucer,</hi> what need they had of introducing such Characters, where obscene Words were proper in their Mouths, but very undecent to be heard; I know not what Answer they could have made: For that Reason, such Tales shall be left untold by me. You have here a <hi>Specimen</hi> of <hi>Chaucer's</hi> Language, which is so obsolete, that his Sense is scarce to be understood; and you have likewise more than one Example of his unequal Numbers, which were mention'd before. Yet many of his Verses consist of Ten Syllables, and the Words not much behind our present <hi>English:</hi> As for Example, these two Lines, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Carpenter's Young Wife:</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Wincing she was, as is a jolly Colt,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Long as a Mast, and upright as a Bolt.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>I have almost done with <hi>Chaucer,</hi> when I have answer'd some Objections relating to my present Work. I find some People are offended that I have turn'd these Tales into modern <hi>English;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they think them unworthy of my Pains, and look on <hi>Chaucer</hi> as a dry, old-fashion'd Wit, not worth receiving. I have often heard the late Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> say, that Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> himself was of that opinion; who having read him over at my Lord's Request, declar'd he had no Taste of him. I dare not advance my Opinion against the Judgment of so great an Author: But I think it fair, however, to leave the Decision to the Publick: Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> was too modest to set up for a Dictatour; and being shock'd perhaps with his old Style, never examin'd into the depth of his good Sense. <hi>Chaucer,</hi> I confess, is a rough Diamond, and must first be polish'd e'er he shines. I deny not likewise, that living in our early Days of Poetry, he writes not always of a piece; but sometimes mingles trivial Things, with those of greater Moment. Sometimes also, though not often, he runs riot, like <hi>Ovid,</hi> and knows not when he has said enough. But there are more great Wits, beside <hi>Chaucer,</hi> whose Fault is their Excess of Conceits, and those ill sorted. An Author is not to write all he can, but only all he ought. Having observ'd this Redundancy in <hi>Chaucer,</hi> (as it is an easie Matter for a Man of ordinary Parts to find a Fault in one of greater) I have not ty'd my self to a Literal Translation; but have often omitted what I judg'd unnecessary, or not of Dignity enough to appear in the Company of better Thoughts. I have presum'd farther in some Places, and added somewhat of my own where I thought my Author
<pb facs="tcp:58868:13"/>
was deficient, and had not given his Thoughts their true Lustre, for want of Words in the Beginning of our Language. And to this I was the more embolden'd, because (if I may be permitted to say it of my self) I found I had a Soul congenial to his, and that I had been conversant in the same Studies. Another Poet, in another Age, may take the same Liberty with my Writings; if at least they live long enough to deserve Correction. It was also necessary sometimes to restore the Sense of <hi>Chaucer,</hi> which was lost or mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Errors of the Press: Let this Example suffice at present in the Story of <hi>Palamon</hi> and <hi>Arcite,</hi> where the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> is describ'd, you find these Verses, in all the Editions of our Author:
<q>
                  <l>There saw I <hi>Danè</hi> turned unto a Tree,</l>
                  <l>I mean not the Goddess <hi>Diane,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>But <hi>Venus</hi> Daughter, which that hight <hi>Danè.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
Which after a little Consideration I knew was to be reform'd into this Sense, that <hi>Daphne</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Peneus</hi> was turn'd into a Tree. I durst not make thus bold with <hi>Ovid,</hi> lest some future <hi>Milbourn</hi> should arise, and say, I varied from my Author, because I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood him not.</p>
            <p>But there are other Judges who think I ought not to have transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Chaucer</hi> into <hi>English,</hi> out of a quite contrary Notion: They suppose there is a certain Veneration due to his old Language; and that it is little less than Profanation and Sacrilege to alter it. They are farther of opinion, that somewhat of his good Sense will suffer in this Transfusion, and much of the Beauty of his Thoughts will infallibly be lost, which appear with more Grace in their old Habit. Of this Opinion was that excellent Person, whom I mention'd, the late Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> who valu'd <hi>Chaucer</hi> as much as Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> despis'd him. My Lord dissuaded me from this Attempt, (for I was thinking of it some Years before his Death) and his Authority pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd so far with me, as to defer my Undertaking while he liv'd, in deference to him: Yet my Reason was not convinc'd with what he urg'd against it. If the first End of a Writer be to be understood, then as his Language grows obsolete, his Thoughts must grow ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, <hi>multa renascuntur quoe nunc cecidere; cadentque quoe nunc sunt in honore vacabula, si volet usus, quem penes arbitrium est &amp; jus &amp; norma loquendi.</hi> When an ancient Word for its Sound and Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy deserves to be reviv'd, I have that reasonable Veneration for Antiquity, to restore it. All beyond this is Superstition. Words are not like Land-marks, so sacred as never to be remov'd: Customs are chang'd, and even Statutes are silently repeal'd, when the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ceases for which they were enacted. As for the other Part of the Argument, that his Thoughts will lose of their original Beauty, by the innovation of Words; in the first place, not only their Beauty, but their Being is lost, where they are no longer understood, which is the present Case. I grant, that something must be lost in all Transfusion, that is, in all Translations; but the Sense will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, which would otherwise be lost, or at least be maim'd, when it is scarce intelligible; and that but to a few. How few are there who can read <hi>Chaucer,</hi> so as to understand him perfectly? And if
<pb facs="tcp:58868:13"/>
imperfectly, then with less Profit, and no Pleasure. 'Tis not for the Use of some old <hi>Saxon</hi> Friends, that I have taken these Pains with him: Let them neglect my Version, because they have no need of it. I made it for their sakes who understand Sense and Poetry, as well as they; when that Poetry and Sense is put into Words which they understand. I will go farther, and dare to add, that what Beauties I lose in some Places, I give to others which had them not originally: But in this I may be partial to my self; let the Reader judge, and I submit to his Decision. Yet I think I have just Occasion to complain of them, who because they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>Chaucer,</hi> would deprive the greater part of their Countrymen of the same Advantage, and hoord him up, as Misers do their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Gold, only to look on it themselves, and hinder others from making use of it. In sum, I seriously protest, that no Man ever had, or can have, a greater Veneration for <hi>Chaucer,</hi> than my self. I have translated some part of his Works, only that I might perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate his Memory, or at least refresh it, amongst my Countrymen. If I have alter'd him any where for the better, I must at the same time acknowledge, that I could have done nothing without him: <hi>Facile est inventis addere,</hi> is no great Commendation; and I am not so vain to think I have deserv'd a greater. I will conclude what I have to say of him singly, with this one Remark: A Lady of my Acquaintance, who keeps a kind of Correspondence with some Authors of the Fair Sex in <hi>France,</hi> has been inform'd by them, that <hi>Mademoiselle de Scudery,</hi> who is as old as <hi>Sibyl,</hi> and inspir'd like her by the same God of Poetry, is at this time translating <hi>Chaucer</hi> into modern <hi>French.</hi> From which I gather, that he has been formerly translated into the old <hi>Provencall,</hi> (for, how she should come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Old <hi>English,</hi> I know not.) But the Matter of Fact being true, it makes me think, that there is something in it like Fatality; that after certain Periods of Time, the Fame and Memory of Great Wits should be renew'd, as <hi>Chaucer</hi> is both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> If this be wholly Chance, 'tis extraordinary; and I dare not call it more, for fear of being tax'd with Superstition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boccace</hi> comes last to be consider'd, who living in the same Age with <hi>Chaucer,</hi> had the same Genius, and follow'd the same Studies: Both writ Novels, and each of them cultivated his Mother-Tongue: But the greatest Resemblance of our two Modern Authors being in their familiar Style, and pleasing way of relating Comical Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I may pass it over, because I have translated nothing from <hi>Boccace</hi> of that Nature. In the serious Part of Poetry, the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is wholly on <hi>Chaucer's</hi> Side; for though the <hi>Englishman</hi> has borrow'd many Tales from the <hi>Italian,</hi> yet it appears, that those of <hi>Boccace</hi> were not generally of his own making, but taken from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of former Ages, and by him only modell'd: So that what there was of Invention in either of them, may be judg'd equal. But <hi>Chaucer</hi> has resin'd on <hi>Boccace,</hi> and has mended the Stories which he has borrow'd, in his way of telling; though Prose allows more Liberty of Thought, and the Expression is more easie, when unconfin'd by Numbers. Our Countryman carries Weight, and yet wins the Race at disadvantage. I desire not the Reader should take my Word; and therefore I will set two of their Discourses on the
<pb facs="tcp:58868:14"/>
same Subject, in the same Light, for every Man to judge betwixt them. I translated <hi>Chaucer</hi> first, and amongst the rest, pitch'd on the Wise of <hi>Bath's</hi> Tale; not daring, as I have said, to adventure on her Prologue; because 'tis too licentious: There <hi>Chaucer</hi> introduces an old Woman of mean Parentage, whom a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Knight of Noble Blood was forc'd to marry, and consequently loath'd her: The Crone being in bed with him on the wedding Night, and finding his Aversion, endeavours to win his Affection by Reason, and speaks a good Word for her self, (as who could blame her?) in hope to mollifie the sullen Bridegroom. She takes her Topiques from the Benefits of Poverty, the Advantages of old Age and Ugliness, the Vanity of Youth, and the silly Pride of Ancestry and Titles without inherent Vertue, which is the true Nobility. When I had clos'd <hi>Chaucer,</hi> I return'd to <hi>Ovid,</hi> and translated some more of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and by this time had so far forgotten the Wise of <hi>Bath's</hi> Tale, that when I took up <hi>Boccace,</hi> unawares I fell on the same Argument of preferring Virtue to Nobility of Blood, and Titles, in the Story of <hi>Sigismonda;</hi> which I had certainly avoided for the Resemblance of the two Discourses, if my Memory had not fail'd me. Let the Reader weigh them both; and if he thinks me partial to <hi>Chaucer,</hi> 'tis in him to right <hi>Boccace.</hi>

            <p>I prefer in our Countryman, far above all his other Stories, the Noble Poem of <hi>Palamon</hi> and <hi>Arcite,</hi> which is of the <hi>Epique</hi> kind, and perhaps not much inferiour to the <hi>Ilias</hi> or the <hi>AEneis:</hi> the Story is more pleasing than either of them, the Manners as perfect, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as poetical, the Learning as deep and various; and the Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion full as artful: only it includes a greater length of time; as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up seven years at least; but <hi>Aristotle</hi> has left undecided the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Action; which yet is easily reduc'd into the Compass of a year, by a Narration of what preceded the Return of <hi>Palamon</hi> to <hi>Athens.</hi> I had thought for the Honour of our Nation, and more particularly for his, whose Laurel, tho' unworthy, I have worn after him, that this Story was of <hi>English</hi> Growth, and <hi>Chaucer's</hi> own: But I was undeceiv'd by <hi>Boccace;</hi> for casually looking on the End of his seventh <hi>Giornata,</hi> I found <hi>Dioneo</hi> (under which name he sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows himself) and <hi>Fiametta</hi> (who represents his Mistress, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Daughter of <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi>) of whom these Words are spoken. <hi>Dioneo e Fiametta gran pezza eantarono insieme d'Arcita, e di Palamone:</hi> by which it appears that this Story was written before the time of <hi>Boccace;</hi> but the Name of its Author being wholly lost, <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> is now become an Original; and I question not but the Poem has receiv'd many Beauties by passing through his Noble Hands. Besides this Tale, there is another of his own Invention, after the manner of the <hi>Provencalls,</hi> call'd <hi>The Flower and the Leaf;</hi> with which I was so particularly pleas'd, both for the Invention and the Moral; that I cannot hinder my self from recommending it to the Reader.</p>
            <p>As a Corollary to this Preface, in which I have done Justice to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I owe somewhat to my self: not that i think it worth my time to enter the Lists with one <hi>M</hi>—,or one <hi>B</hi>—,but barely to take notice, that such Men there are who have written scurrilously against me without any Provocation. <hi>M</hi>—,who is in Orders, pretends amongst the rest this Quarrel to me, that I have fallen soul

on Priesthood; If I have, I am only to ask Pardon of good Priests, and am afraid his part of the Reparation will come to little. Let him be satisfied that he shall not be able to force himself upon me for an Adversary. I contemn him too much to enter into Competition with him. His own Translations of <hi>Virgil</hi> have answer'd his Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms on mine. If (as they say, he has declar'd in Print) he prefers the Version of <hi>Ogilby</hi> to mine, the World has made him the same Compliment: For 'tis agreed on all hands, that he writes even below <hi>Ogilby:</hi> That, you will say, is not easily to be done; but what cannot <hi>M</hi>—bring about? I am satisfy'd however, that while he and I live together, I shall not be thought the worst Poet of the Age. It looks as if I had desir'd him underhand to write so ill against me: But upon my honest Word I have not brib'd him to do me this Service, and am wholly guiltless of his Pamphlet. 'Tis true I should be glad, if I could persuade him to continue his good Offices, and write such another Critique on any thing of mine: For I find by Experience he has a great Stroke with the Reader, when he condemns any of my Poems to make the World have a better Opinion of them. He has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken some Pains with my Poetry; but no body will be persuaded to take the same with his. If I had taken to the Church (as he affirms, but which was never in my Thoughts) I should have had more Sense, if not more Grace, than to have turn'd my self out of my Benefice by writing Libels on my Parishioners. But his Account of my Manners and my Principles, are of a Piece with his Cavils and his Poetry: And so I have done with him for ever.</p>
            <p>As for the City Bard, or Knight Physician, I hear his Quarrel to me is, that I was the Author of <hi>Absalom</hi> and <hi>Architophel,</hi> which he thinks is a little hard on his Fanatique Patrons in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will deal the more civilly with his two Poems, because nothing ill is to be spoken of the Dead: And therefore Peace be to the <hi>Manes</hi> of his <hi>Arthurs.</hi> I will only say that it was not for this Noble Knight that I drew the Plan of an Epick Poem on King <hi>Arthur</hi> in my Preface to the Translation of <hi>Iuvenal.</hi> The Guardian Angels of Kingdoms were Machines too ponderous for him to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; and therefore he rejected them as <hi>Dares</hi> did the Whirl-bats of <hi>Eryx</hi> when they were thrown before him by <hi>Entellus:</hi> Yet from that Preface he plainly took his Hint: For he began immediately upon the Story; though he had the Baseness not to acknowledge his Benefactor; but in Head of it, to traduce me in a Libel.</p>
            <p>I shall say the less of Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> because in many Things he has tax'd me justly; and I have pleaded Guilty to all Thoughts and Expressions of mine, which can be truly argu'd of Obscenity, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness, or Immorality; and retract them. If he be my Enemy, let him triumph; if he be my Friend, as I have given him no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Occasion to be otherwise, he will be glad of my Repentance. It becomes me not to draw my Pen in the Defence of a bad Cause, when I have so often drawn it for a good one. Yet it were not difficult to prove, that in many Places he has perverted my Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Glosles; and interpreted my Words into Blasphemy and Baudry, of which they were not guilty. Besides that, he is too much given to Horse-play in his Raillery; and comes to Battel, like a Dictatour from the Plough. I will not say, <hi>The Zeal of God s</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58868:15"/>
               <hi>House has eaten him up;</hi> but I am sure it has devour'd some Part of his Good Manners and Civility. It might also be doubted, whether it were altogether Zeal, which prompted him to this rough manner of Proceeding; perhaps it became not one of his Function to rake into the Rubbish of Ancient and Modern Plays; a Divine might have employ'd his Pains to better purpose, than in the Nastiness of <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Aristophanes;</hi> whose Examples, as they excuse not me, so it might be possibly suppos'd, that he read them not without some Pleasure. They who have written Commentaries on those Poets, or on <hi>Horace, Juvenal,</hi> and <hi>Martial,</hi> have explain'd some Vices, which without their Interpretation had been unknown to Modern Times. Neither has he judg'd impartially betwixt the former Age and us.</p>
            <p>There is more Baudry in one Play of <hi>Fletcher's,</hi> call'd <hi>The Custom of the Country,</hi> than in all ours together. Yet this has been often acted on the Stage in my remembrance. Are the Times so much more reform'd now, than they were Five and twenty Years ago? If they are, I congratulate the Amendment of our Morals. But I am not to prejudice the Cause of my Fellow-Poets, though I abandon my own Defence: They have some of them answer'd for themselves, and neither they nor I can think Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> so formidable an Enemy, that we should shun him. He has lost Ground at the latter end of the Day, by pursuing his Point too far, like the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Senneph:</hi> From Immoral Plays, to No Plays; <hi>ab abusu ad usum, non valet consequentia.</hi> But being a Party, I am not to erect my self into a Judge. As for the rest of those who have written against me, they are such Scoundrels, that they deserve not the least Notice to be taken of them. <hi>B</hi>—and <hi>M</hi>—are only distinguish'd from the Crowd, by being remember'd to their Infamy.</p>

               <l>Was taught to dream an Herb for <hi>Ptolomee:</hi>
               </l>

               <l>IN Days of old, there liv'd, of mighty Fame</l>
               <l>A valiant Prince; and <hi>Theseus</hi> was his Name:</l>
               <l>A Chief, who more in Feats of Arms excell'd</l>
               <l>The Rising nor the Setting Sun beheld.</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Athens</hi> he was Lord; much Land he won,</l>
               <l>And added Foreign Countrys to his Crown:</l>
               <l>In <hi>Scythia</hi> with the Warriour Queen he strove,</l>
               <l>Whom first by Force he conquer'd, then by Love;</l>
               <l>He brought in Triumph back the beauteous Dame,</l>
               <l>With whom her Sister, fair <hi>Emilia,</hi> came.</l>

With Honour to his Home let <hi>Theseus</hi> ride,</l>
               <l>With Love to Friend, and Fortune for his Guide,</l>
               <l>And his victorious Army at his Side.</l>
               <l>I pass their warlike Pomp, their proud Array,</l>
               <l>Their Shouts, their Songs, their Welcome on the Way:</l>
               <l>But, were it not too long, I would recite</l>
               <l>The Feats of <hi>Amazons,</hi> the fatal Fight</l>
               <l>Betwixt the hardy Queen, and <hi>Heroe</hi> Knight.</l>
               <l>The Town besieg'd, and how much Blood it cost</l>
               <l>The Female Army, and th' <hi>Athenian</hi> Host;</l>
               <l>The Spousals of <hi>Hippolita</hi> the Queen;</l>
               <l>What Tilts, and Turneys at the Feast were seen;</l>
               <l>The Storm at their Return, the Ladies Fear:</l>
               <l>But these and other Things I must forbear.</l>
               <l>The Field is spacious I design to sow,</l>
               <l>With Oxen far unfit to draw the Plow:</l>
               <l>The Remnant of my Tale is of a length</l>
               <l>To tire your Patience, and to waste my Strength;</l>
               <l>And trivial Accidents shall be forborn,</l>
               <l>That others may have time to take their Turn;</l>
               <l>As was at first enjoin'd us by mine Host:</l>
               <l>That he whose Tale is best, and pleases most,</l>

When in his Pomp and utmost of his Pride,</l>
               <l>Marching, he chanc'd to cast his Eye aside,</l>
               <l>And saw a Quire of mourning Dames, who lay</l>
               <l>By Two and Two across the common Way:</l>
               <l>At his Approach they rais'd a rueful Cry,</l>
               <l>And beat their Breasts, and held their Hands on high,</l>
               <l>Creeping and crying, till they seiz'd at last</l>

               <l>Or are you injur'd, and demand Relief?</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The most in Years of all the Mourning Train</l>
               <l>Began; (but sounded first away for Pain)</l>
               <l>Then scarce recover'd, spoke: Nor envy we</l>

               <l>'Tis thine, O King, th' Afflicted to redress,</l>

               <l>We wretched Women sue for that alone,</l>
               <l>Which of thy Goodness is refus'd to none:</l>
               <l>Let fall some Drops of Pity on our Grief,</l>
               <l>If what we beg be just, and we deserve Relief:</l>
               <l>For none of us, who now thy Grace implore,</l>
               <l>But held the Rank of Sovereign Queen before;</l>

Till, thanks to giddy Chance, which never bears</l>
               <l>That Mortal Bliss should last for length of Years,</l>
               <l>She cast us headlong from our high Estate,</l>
               <l>And here in hope of thy Return we wait:</l>
               <l>And long have waited in the Temple nigh,</l>

               <l>I, wretched I, have other Fortune seen,</l>
               <l>The Wife of <hi>Capaneus,</hi> and once a Queen:</l>
               <l>At <hi>Thebes</hi> he fell; curs'd be the fatal Day!</l>
               <l>And all the rest thou seest in this Array,</l>
               <l>To make their moan, their Lords in Battel lost</l>
               <l>Before that Town besieg'd by our Confed'rate Host:</l>
               <l>But <hi>Creon,</hi> old and impious, who commands</l>
               <l>The <hi>Theban</hi> City, and usurps the Lands,</l>
               <l>Denies the Rites of Fun'ral Fires to those</l>
               <l>Whose breathless Bodies yet he calls his Foes.</l>
               <l>Unburn'd, unbury'd, on a Heap they lie;</l>
               <l>Such is their Fate, and such his Tyranny;</l>
               <l>No Friend has leave to bear away the Dead,</l>
               <l>But with their Lifeless Limbs his Hounds are fed:</l>
               <l>At this she skriek'd aloud, the mournful Train</l>
               <l>Echo'd her Grief, and grov'ling on the Plain,</l>
               <l>With Groans, and Hands upheld, to move his Mind,</l>
               <l>Besought his Pity to their helpless Kind!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Prince was touch'd, his Tears began to flow,</l>
               <l>And, as his tender Heart would break in two,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58868:24"/>
He sigh'd; and could not but their Fate deplore,</l>
               <l>So wretched now, so fortunate before.</l>
               <l>Then lightly from his lofty Steed he flew,</l>
               <l>And raising one by one the suppliant Crew,</l>
               <l>To comfort each, full solemnly he swore,</l>
               <l>That by the Faith which Knights to Knighthood bore,</l>
               <l>And what e'er else to Chivalry belongs,</l>
               <l>He would not cease, till he reveng'd their Wrongs:</l>
               <l>That <hi>Greece</hi> shou'd see perform'd what de declar'd,</l>
               <l>And cruel <hi>Creon</hi> find his just Reward.</l>
               <l>He said no more, but shunning all Delay,</l>
               <l>Rode on; nor enter'd <hi>Athens</hi> on his Way:</l>
               <l>But left his Sister and his Queen behind,</l>
               <l>And wav'd his Royal Banner in the Wind:</l>
               <l>Where in an <hi>Argent</hi> Field the God of War</l>
               <l>Was drawn triumphant on his Iron Carr;</l>
               <l>Red was his Sword, and Shield, and whole Attire,</l>
               <l>And all the Godhead seem'd to glow with Fire;</l>
               <l>Ev'n the Ground glitter'd where the Standard flew,</l>
               <l>And the green Grass was dy'd to sanguin Hue.</l>
               <l>High on his pointed Lance his Pennon bore</l>
               <l>His <hi>Cretan</hi> Fight, the conquer'd <hi>Minotaure:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The Soldiers shout around with generous Rage,</l>
               <l>And in that Victory, their own presage.</l>
               <l>He prais'd their Ardour: inly pleas'd to see</l>
               <l>His Host the Flow'r of <hi>Grecian</hi> Chivalry.</l>
               <l>All Day he march'd; and all th' ensuing Night;</l>
               <l>And saw the City with returning Light.</l>
               <l>The Process of the War I need not tell,</l>
               <l>How <hi>Theseus</hi> conquer'd, and how <hi>Creon</hi> fell:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58868:25"/>
Or after, how by Storm the Walls were won,</l>
               <l>Or how the Victor sack'd and burn'd the Town:</l>
               <l>How to the Ladies he restor'd again</l>
               <l>The Bodies of their Lords in Battel slain:</l>
               <l>And with what ancient Rites they were interr'd;</l>
               <l>All these to fitter time shall be deferr'd:</l>
               <l>I spare the Widows Tears, their woful Cries</l>
               <l>And Howling at their Husbands Obsequies;</l>
               <l>How <hi>Theseus</hi> at these Fun'rals did assist,</l>
               <l>And with what Gifts the mourning Dames dismiss'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus when the Victor Chief had <hi>Creon</hi> slain,</l>
               <l>And conquer'd <hi>Thebes,</hi> he pitch'd upon the Plain</l>
               <l>His mighty Camp; and when the Day return'd,</l>
               <l>The Country wasted, and the Hamlets burn'd;</l>
               <l>And left the Pillagers, to Rapine bred,</l>
               <l>Without Controul to strip and spoil the Dead:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There, in a Heap of Slain, among the rest</l>
               <l>Two youthful Knights they found beneath a Load oppress'</l>
               <l>Of slaughter'd Foes, whom first to Death they sent,</l>
               <l>The Trophies of their Strength, a bloody Monument.</l>
               <l>Both fair, and both of Royal Blood they seem'd,</l>
               <l>Whom Kinsmen to the Crown the Heralds deem'd;</l>
               <l>That Day in equal Arms they fought for Fame;</l>
               <l>Their Swords, their Shields, their Surcoats were the same.</l>
               <l>Close by each other laid they press'd the Ground,</l>
               <l>Their manly Bosoms pierc'd with many a griesly Wound;</l>
               <l>Nor well alive, nor wholly dead they were,</l>
               <l>But some faint Signs of feeble Life appear:</l>

The wandring Breath was on the Wing to part,</l>

               <l>Much fam'd in Fields, with valiant <hi>Palamon.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>From These their costly Arms the Spoilers rent,</l>
               <l>And softly both convey'd to <hi>Theseus</hi> Tent;</l>

               <l>He to his City sent as Pris'ners of the War,</l>
               <l>Hopeless of Ransom, and condemn'd to lie</l>

               <l>The Vigils of her Night, and breaks their sluggard Sleep:</l>

In this Remembrance <hi>Emily</hi> e'er Day</l>
               <l>Arose, and dress'd her self in rich Array;</l>
               <l>Fresh as the Month, and as the Morning fair:</l>
               <l>Adown her Shoulders fell her length of Hair:</l>
               <l>A Ribband did the braided Tresses bind,</l>
               <l>The rest was loose, and wanton'd in the Wind:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Aurora</hi> had but newly chas'd the Night,</l>
               <l>And purpl'd o'er the Sky with blushing Light,</l>
               <l>When to the Garden-walk she took her way,</l>
               <l>To sport and trip along in Cool of Day,</l>
               <l>And offer Maiden Vows in honour of the <hi>May.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At ev'ry Turn, she made a little Stand,</l>
               <l>And thrust among the Thorns her Lilly Hand</l>
               <l>To draw the Rose, and ev'ry Rose she drew</l>
               <l>She shook the Stalk, and brush'd away the Dew:</l>
               <l>Then party-colour'd Flow'rs of white and red</l>
               <l>She wove, to make a Garland for her Head:</l>
               <l>This done, she sung and caroll'd out so clear,</l>
               <l>That Men and Angels might rejoice to hear.</l>
               <l>Ev'n wondring <hi>Philomel</hi> forgot to sing;</l>
               <l>And learn'd from Her to welcome in the Spring.</l>
               <l>The Tow'r, of which before was mention made,</l>
               <l>Within whose Keep the captive Knights were laid,</l>
               <l>Built of a large Extent, and strong withal,</l>
               <l>Was one Partition of the Palace Wall:</l>
               <l>The Garden was enclos'd within the Square</l>
               <l>Where young <hi>Emilia</hi> took the Morning-Air.</l>

               <l>It happen'd <hi>Palamon</hi> the Pris'ner Knight,</l>
               <l>Restless for Woe, arose before the Light,</l>
               <l>And with his Jaylor's leave desir'd to breathe</l>
               <l>An Air more wholesom than the Damps beneath.</l>
               <l>This granted, to the Tow'r he took his way,</l>
               <l>Cheer'd with the Promise of a glorious Day:</l>
               <l>Then cast a languishing Regard around,</l>
               <l>And saw with hateful Eyes the Temples crown'd</l>
               <l>With golden Spires, and all the Hostile Ground.</l>
               <l>He sigh'd, and turn'd his Eyes, because he knew</l>
               <l>'Twas but a larger Jayl he had in view:</l>
               <l>Then look'd below, and from the Castles height</l>
               <l>Beheld a nearer and more pleasing Sight:</l>
               <l>The Garden, which before he had not seen,</l>
               <l>In Springs new Livery clad of White and Green,</l>
               <l>Fresh Flow'rs in wide <hi>Parterres,</hi> and shady Walks between.</l>
               <l>This view'd, but not enjoy'd, with Arms across</l>
               <l>He stood, reflecting on his Country's Loss;</l>
               <l>Himself an Object of the Publick Scorn,</l>
               <l>And often wish'd he never had been born.</l>
               <l>At last (for so his Destiny requir'd)</l>
               <l>With-walking giddy, and with thinking tir'd,</l>
               <l>He thro' a little Window cast his Sight,</l>
               <l>Tho' thick of Bars, that gave a scanty Light:</l>
               <l>But ev'n that Glimmering serv'd him to descry</l>

               <l>Scarce had he seen, but seiz'd with sudden Smart,</l>
               <l>Stung to the Quick, he felt it at his Heart;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:58868:27"/>
Struck blind with overpowering Light he stood,</l>
               <l>Then started back amaz'd, and cry'd aloud.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Young <hi>Arcite</hi> heard; and up he ran with haste,</l>
               <l>To help his Friend, and in his Arms embrac'd;</l>
               <l>And ask'd him why he look'd so deadly wan,</l>
               <l>And whence, and how his change of Cheer began?</l>
               <l>Or who had done th' Offence? But if, said he,</l>
               <l>Your Grief alone is hard Captivity;</l>
               <l>For Love of Heav'n, with Patience undergo</l>
               <l>A cureless Ill, since Fate will have it so:</l>
               <l>So stood our <hi>Horoscope</hi> in Chains to lie,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Saturn</hi> in the Dungeon of the Sky,</l>
               <l>Or other baleful Aspect, rul'd our Birth,</l>
               <l>When all the friendly Stars were under Earth:</l>
               <l>Whate'er betides, by Destiny 'tis done;</l>
               <l>And better bear like Men, than vainly seek to shun.</l>
               <l>Nor of my Bonds, said <hi>Palamon</hi> again,</l>
               <l>Nor of unhappy Planets I complain;</l>
               <l>But when my mortal Anguish caus'd my Cry,</l>
               <l>That Moment I was hurt thro' either Eye;</l>
               <l>Pierc'd with a Random-shaft, I faint away</l>
               <l>And perish with insensible Decay:</l>
               <l>A Glance of some new Goddess gave the Wound,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Arcite</hi> on <hi>Emily</hi> had fix'd his Look;</l>
               <l>The fatal Dart a ready Passage found,</l>
               <l>And deep within his Heart infix'd the Wound:</l>
               <l>So that if <hi>Palamon</hi> were wounded sore,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Arcite</hi> was hurt as much as he, or more:</l>
               <l>Then from his inmost Soul he sigh'd, and said,</l>
               <l>The Beauty I behold has struck me dead:</l>
               <l>Unknowingly she strikes; and kills by chance;</l>
               <l>Poyson is in her Eyes, and Death in ev'ry Glance.</l>
               <l>O, I must ask; nor ask alone, but move</l>
               <l>Her Mind to Mercy, or must die for Love.</l>

               <l>Their Faith to break, their Friendship to betray;</l>

               <l>To this before the Gods we gave our Hands,</l>

               <l>Law is to Things which to free Choice relate;</l>
               <l>Love is not in our Choice, but in our Fate:</l>

               <l>Each Day we break the Bond of Humane Laws</l>
               <l>For Love, and vindicate the Common Cause.</l>
               <l>Laws for Defence of Civil Rights are plac'd,</l>
               <l>Love throws the Fences down, and makes a general Waste:</l>

               <l>The sweeping Deluge, Love, comes on, and covers all.</l>
               <l>If then the Laws of Friendship I transgress,</l>
               <l>I keep the Greater, while I break the Less;</l>
               <l>And both are mad alike, since neither can possess.</l>
               <l>Both hopeless to be ransom'd, never more</l>

               <l>Which bound my Friendship to <hi>Perithous</hi> first:</l>
               <l>Had I not known that Prince, I still had been</l>
               <l>In Bondage, and had still <hi>Emilia</hi> seen:</l>
               <l>For tho' I never can her Grace deserve,</l>
               <l>'Tis Recompence enough to see and serve.</l>
               <l>O <hi>Palamon,</hi> my Kinsman and my Friend,</l>
               <l>How much more happy Fates thy Love attend!</l>
               <l>Thine is th' Adventure; thine the Victory:</l>
               <l>Well has thy Fortune turn'd the Dice for thee:</l>
               <l>Thou on that Angels Face maist feed thy Eyes,</l>
               <l>In Prison, no; but blissful Paradise!</l>
               <l>Thou daily seest that Sun of Beauty shine,</l>
               <l>And lov'st at least in Loves extreamest Line.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:58868:30"/>
I mourn in Absence, Loves Eternal Night,</l>
               <l>And who can tell but since thou hast her Sight,</l>
               <l>And art a comely, young, and valiant Knight,</l>
               <l>Fortune (a various Pow'r) may cease to frown,</l>
               <l>And by some Ways unknown thy Wishes crown:</l>
               <l>But I, the most forlorn of Humane Kind,</l>
               <l>Nor Help can hope, nor Remedy can find;</l>
               <l>But doom'd to drag my loathsom Life in Care,</l>
               <l>For my Reward, must end it in Despair.</l>
               <l>Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, and Force of Fates</l>
               <l>That governs all, and Heav'n that all creates,</l>
               <l>Nor Art, nor Natures Hand can ease my Grief,</l>
               <l>Nothing but Death, the Wretches last Relief:</l>
               <l>Then farewel Youth, and all the Joys that dwell</l>
               <l>With Youth and Life, and Life it self farewell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But why, alas! do mortal Men in vain</l>
               <l>Of Fortune, Fate, or Providence complain?</l>
               <l>God gives us what he knows our Wants require,</l>
               <l>And better Things than those which we desire:</l>
               <l>Some pray for Riches; Riches they obtain;</l>
               <l>But watch'd by Robbers, for their Wealth are slain:</l>
               <l>Some pray from Prison to be freed; and come</l>
               <l>When guilty of their Vows, to fall at home;</l>
               <l>Murder'd by those they trusted with their Life,</l>
               <l>A favour'd Servant, or a Bosom Wife.</l>
               <l>Such dear-bought Blessings happen ev'ry Day,</l>
               <l>Because we know not for what Things to pray.</l>
               <l>Like drunken Sots about the Streets we roam;</l>
               <l>Well knows the Sot he has a certain Home;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58868:30"/>
Yet knows not how to find th' uncertain Place,</l>
               <l>And blunders on, and staggers ev'ry Pace.</l>
               <l>Thus all seek Happiness; but few can find,</l>
               <l>For far the greater Part of Men are blind.</l>
               <l>This is my Case, who thought our utmost Good</l>
               <l>Was in one Word of Freedom understood:</l>
               <l>The fatal Blessing came: From Prison free,</l>
               <l>I starve abroad, and lose the Sight of <hi>Emily.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus <hi>Arcite;</hi> but if <hi>Arcite</hi> thus deplore</l>
               <l>His Suff'rings, <hi>Palamon</hi> yet suffers more.</l>
               <l>For when he knew his Rival freed and gone,</l>
               <l>He swells with Wrath; he makes outrageous Moan:</l>
               <l>He frets, he fumes, he stares, he stamps the Ground;</l>
               <l>The hollow Tow'r with Clamours rings around:</l>
               <l>With briny Tears he bath'd his fetter'd Feet,</l>
               <l>And dropp'd all o'er with Agony of Sweat.</l>
               <l>Alas! he cry'd, I Wretch in Prison pine,</l>
               <l>Too happy Rival, while the Fruit is thine:</l>
               <l>Thou liv'st at large, thou draw'st thy Native Air,</l>
               <l>Pleas'd with thy Freedom, proud of my Despair:</l>
               <l>Thou may'st, since thou hast Youth and Courage join'd,</l>
               <l>A sweet Behaviour, and a solid Mind,</l>
               <l>Assemble ours, and all the <hi>Theban</hi> Race,</l>
               <l>To vindicate on <hi>Athens</hi> thy Disgrace.</l>
               <l>And after (by some Treaty made) possess</l>
               <l>Fair <hi>Emily,</hi> the Pledge of lasting Peace.</l>
               <l>So thine shall be the beauteous Prize, while I</l>
               <l>Must languish in Despair, in Prison die.</l>
               <l>

Thus all th' Advantage of the Strife is thine,</l>
               <l>Thy Portion double Joys, and double Sorrows mine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Rage of Jealousie then fir'd his Soul,</l>
               <l>And his Face kindl'd like a burning Coal:</l>
               <l>Now cold Despair, succeeding in her stead,</l>
               <l>To livid Paleness turns the glowing Red.</l>
               <l>His Blood scarce Liquid, creeps within his Veins,</l>
               <l>Like Water, which the freezing Wind constrains.</l>
               <l>Then thus he said; Eternal Deities,</l>
               <l>Who rule the World with absolute Decrees,</l>
               <l>And write whatever Time shall bring to pass</l>
               <l>With Pens of Adamant, on Plates of Brass;</l>
               <l>What is the Race of Humane Kind your Care</l>
               <l>Beyond what all his Fellow-Creatures are?</l>
               <l>He with the rest is liable to Pain,</l>
               <l>And like the Sheep, his Brother-Beast, is slain.</l>
               <l>Cold, Hunger, Prisons, Ills without a Cure,</l>
               <l>All these he must, and guiltless oft, endure:</l>
               <l>Or does your Justice, Pow'r, or Prescience fail,</l>
               <l>When the Good suffer, and the Bad prevail?</l>
               <l>What worse to wretched Vertue could befall,</l>
               <l>If Fate, or giddy Fortune govern'd all?</l>
               <l>Nay, worse than other Beasts is our Estate;</l>
               <l>Them, to pursue their Pleasures you create;</l>
               <l>We, bound by harder Laws, must curb our Will,</l>
               <l>And your Commands, not our Desires fulfil:</l>
               <l>Then when the Creature is unjustly slain,</l>
               <l>Yet after Death at least he feels no Pain;</l>

But Man in Life surcharg'd with Woe before,</l>
               <l>Not freed when dead, is doom'd to suffer more.</l>
               <l>A Serpent shoots his Sting at unaware;</l>

               <l>This let Divines decide; but well I know,</l>

               <l>Dry Sorrow in his stupid Eyes appears,</l>

               <l>His Eye-balls in their hollow Sockets sink,</l>
               <l>Bereft of Sleep; he loaths his Meat and Drink.</l>
               <l>He withers at his Heart, and looks as wan</l>

               <l>That Pale turns Yellow, and his Face receives</l>

               <l>In solitary Groves he makes his Moan,</l>
               <l>Walks early out, and ever is alone.</l>
               <l>Nor mix'd in Mirth, in youthful Pleasure shares,</l>
               <l>But sighs when Songs and Instruments he hears:</l>
               <l>His Spirits are so low, his Voice is drown'd,</l>
               <l>He hears as from afar, or in a Swound,</l>
               <l>Like the deaf Murmurs of a distant Sound:</l>
               <l>Uncomb'd his Locks, and squalid his Attire,</l>
               <l>Unlike the Trim of Love and gay Desire;</l>
               <l>But full of museful Mopings, which presage</l>

            <lg>

That <hi>Hermes</hi> o'er his Head in Air appear'd,</l>

               <l>His Hat, adorn'd with Wings, disclos'd the God,</l>
               <l>And in his Hand he bore the Sleep-compelling Rod:</l>
               <l>Such as he seem'd, when at his Sire's Command</l>

               <l>The World may search in vain with all their Eyes,</l>
               <l>But never penetrate through this Disguise.</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So fair befel him, that for little Gain</l>

               <l>And watchful all Advantages to spy,</l>
               <l>Was still at Hand, and in his Master's Eye;</l>
               <l>And as his Bones were big, and Sinews strong,</l>
               <l>Refus'd no Toil that could to Slaves belong;</l>
               <l>But from deep Wells with Engines Water drew,</l>
               <l>And us'd his Noble Hands the Wood to hew.</l>

               <l>So gentle of Condition was he known,</l>

               <l>For six long Years immur'd, the captive Knight</l>
               <l>Had dragg'd his Chains, and scarcely seen the Light:</l>
               <l>Lost Liberty, and Love at once he bore;</l>
               <l>His Prison pain'd him much, his Passion more:</l>
               <l>Nor dares he hope his Fetters to remove,</l>
               <l>Nor ever wishes to be free from Love.</l>

               <l>But when the sixth revolving Year was run,</l>
               <l>And <hi>May</hi> within the <hi>Twins</hi> receiv'd the Sun,</l>
               <l>Were it by Chance, or forceful Destiny,</l>
               <l>Which forms in Causes first whate'er shall be,</l>
               <l>Assisted by a Friend one Moonless Night,</l>
               <l>This <hi>Palamon</hi> from Prison took his Flight:</l>
               <l>A pleasant Beverage he prepar'd before</l>
               <l>Of Wine and Honey mix'd, with added Store</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Opium;</hi> to his Keeper this he brought,</l>
               <l>Who swallow'd unaware the sleepy Draught,</l>
               <l>And snor'd secure till Morn, his Senses bound</l>
               <l>In Slumber, and in long Oblivion drown'd.</l>
               <l>Short was the Night, and careful <hi>Palamon</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Sought the next Covert e'er the Rising Sun.</l>
               <l>A thick spread Forest near the City lay,</l>
               <l>To this with lengthen'd Strides he took his way,</l>
               <l>(For far he cou'd not fly, and fear'd the Day:)</l>
               <l>Safe from Pursuit, he meant to shun the Light,</l>
               <l>Till the brown Shadows of the friendly Night</l>
               <l>To <hi>Thebes</hi> might favour his intended Flight.</l>
               <l>When to his Country, come, his next Design</l>
               <l>Was all the <hi>Theban</hi> Race in Arms to join,</l>
               <l>And war on <hi>Theseus,</hi> till he lost his Life,</l>
               <l>Or won the Beauteous <hi>Emily</hi> to Wife.</l>
               <l>Thus while his Thoughts the lingring Day beguile,</l>
               <l>To gentle <hi>Arcite</hi> let us turn our Style;</l>
               <l>Who little dreamt how nigh he was to Care,</l>

The Morning-Lark, the Messenger of Day,</l>
               <l>Saluted in her Song the Morning gray;</l>
               <l>And soon the Sun arose with Beams so bright,</l>
               <l>That all th' Horizon laugh'd to see the joyous Sight;</l>
               <l>He with his tepid Rays the Rose renews,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Forth on his fiery Steed betimes he rode,</l>
               <l>That scarcely prints the Turf on which he trod:</l>
               <l>At ease he seem'd, and pransing o'er the Plains,</l>
               <l>Turn'd only to the Grove his Horses Reins,</l>
               <l>The Grove I nam'd before; and lighting there,</l>
               <l>A Woodbind Garland sought to crown his Hair;</l>
               <l>Then turn'd his Face against the rising Day,</l>
               <l>And rais'd his Voice to welcom in the <hi>May.</hi>

               <l>For thee the Graces lead the dancing Hours,</l>

               <l>The sultry Tropick fears, and moves more slowly on.</l>
               <l>So may thy tender Blossoms fear no Blite,</l>

               <l>His Vows address'd, within the Grove he stray'd,</l>

               <l>His Steps where secret <hi>Palamon</hi> was laid.</l>
               <l>Full little thought of him the gentle Knight,</l>

               <l>In Brakes and Brambles hid, and shunning Mortal Sight.</l>
               <l>And less he knew him for his hated Foe,</l>

               <l>But as it has been said of ancient Years,</l>
               <l>That Fields are full of Eyes, and Woods have Ears;</l>
               <l>For this the Wise are ever on their Guard,</l>

               <l>Uncautious <hi>Arcite</hi> thought himself alone,</l>

               <l>A desp'rate Sigh, accusing Heav'n and Fate,</l>

Approach; each other from afar they knew,</l>

               <l>And thinks, Here comes my mortal Enemy,</l>

               <l>But in dumb Surliness, each arm'd with Care</l>
               <l>His Foe profest, as Brother of the War:</l>

               <l>Their Corslets, and the thinnest Parts explore.</l>
               <l>Thus two long Hours in equal Arms they stood,</l>
               <l>And wounded, wound; till both were bath'd in Blood;</l>
               <l>And not a Foot of Ground had either got,</l>

               <l>And by Foresight necessitate the Will.</l>
               <l>In <hi>Theseus</hi> this appears; whose youthful Joy</l>
               <l>Was Beasts of Chase in Forests to destroy;</l>
               <l>This gentle Knight, inspir'd by jolly <hi>May,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Forsook his easie Couch at early Day,</l>
               <l>And to the Wood and Wilds pursu'd his Way.</l>
               <l>Beside him rode <hi>Hippolita</hi> the Queen,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Emily</hi> attir'd in lively Green:</l>
               <l>With Horns, and Hounds, and all the tuneful Cry,</l>
               <l>To hunt a Royal Hart within the Covert nigh:</l>
               <l>And as he follow'd <hi>Mars</hi> before, so now</l>
               <l>He serves the Goddess of the Silver Bow.</l>
               <l>The Way that <hi>Theseus</hi> took was to the Wood</l>
               <l>Where the two Knights in cruel Battel stood:</l>
               <l>The Laund on which they fought; th' appointed Place</l>
               <l>In which th' uncoupl'd Hounds began the Chace.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:58868:39"/>
Thither forth-right he rode to rowse the Prey,</l>
               <l>That shaded by the Fern in Harbour lay;</l>
               <l>And thence dislodg'd, was wont to leave the Wood,</l>
               <l>For open Fields, and cross the Crystal Flood.</l>
               <l>Approach'd, and looking underneath the Sun,</l>
               <l>He saw proud <hi>Arcite,</hi> and fierce <hi>Palamon,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>In mortal Battel doubling Blow on Blow,</l>
               <l>Like Lightning flam'd their Fauchions to and fro,</l>
               <l>And shot a dreadful Gleam; so strong they strook,</l>
               <l>There seem'd less Force requir'd to fell an Oak:</l>
               <l>He gaz'd with Wonder on their equal Might,</l>
               <l>Look'd eager on, but knew not either Knight:</l>
               <l>Resolv'd to learn, he spurr'd his fiery Steed</l>
               <l>With goring Rowels, to provoke his Speed.</l>
               <l>The Minute ended that began the Race.</l>
               <l>So soon he was betwixt 'em on the Place;</l>
               <l>And with his Sword unsheath'd, on pain of Life</l>
               <l>Commands both Combatants to cease their Strife:</l>
               <l>Then with imperious Tone pursues his Threat;</l>
               <l>What are you? Why in Arms together met?</l>
               <l>How dares your Pride presume against my Laws,</l>
               <l>As in a listed Field to fight your Cause?</l>
               <l>Unask'd the Royal Grant; no Marshal by,</l>
               <l>As Knightly Rites require; nor Judge to try?</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Palamon,</hi> with scarce recover'd Breath,</l>
               <l>Thus hasty spoke; We both deserve the Death,</l>
               <l>And both wou'd die; for look the World around,</l>
               <l>A Pair so wretched is not to be found.</l>
               <l>Our Life's a Load; encumber'd with the Charge,</l>
               <l>We long to set th' imprison'd Soul at large.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:58868:39"/>
Now as thou art a Sovereign Judge, decree</l>
               <l>The rightful Doom of Death to him and me,</l>
               <l>Let neither find thy Grace; for Grace is Cruelty.</l>
               <l>Me first, O kill me first; and cure my Woe:</l>
               <l>Then sheath the Sword of Justice on my Foe:</l>
               <l>Or kill him first; for when his Name is heard,</l>
               <l>He foremost will receive his due Reward.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Arcite</hi> of <hi>Thebes</hi> is he; thy mortal Foe,</l>
               <l>On whom thy Grace did Liberty bestow,</l>
               <l>But first contracted, that if ever found</l>
               <l>By Day or Night upon th' <hi>Athenian</hi> Ground,</l>
               <l>His Head should pay the Forfeit: See return'd</l>
               <l>The perjur'd Knight, his Oath and Honour scorn'd.</l>
               <l>For this is he, who with a borrow'd Name</l>
               <l>And profer'd Service, to thy Palace came,</l>
               <l>Now call'd <hi>Philostratus:</hi> retain'd by thee,</l>
               <l>A Traytor trusted, and in high Degree,</l>
               <l>Aspiring to the Bed of beauteous <hi>Emily.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>My Part remains: From <hi>Thebes</hi> my Birth I own,</l>
               <l>And call my self th' unhappy <hi>Palamon.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Think me not like that Man; since no Disgrace</l>
               <l>Can force me to renounce the Honour of my Race.</l>
               <l>Know me for what I am: I broke thy Chain,</l>
               <l>Nor promis'd I thy Pris'ner to remain:</l>
               <l>The Love of Liberty with Life is giv'n,</l>
               <l>And Life it self th' inferiour Gift of Heaven.</l>
               <l>Thus without Crime I fled; but farther know,</l>
               <l>I with this <hi>Arcite</hi> am thy mortal Foe:</l>
               <l>Then give me Death, since I thy Life pursue,</l>
               <l>For Safeguard of thy self, Death is my Due.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:58868:40"/>
More would'st thou know? I love bright <hi>Emily,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And for her Sake, and in her Sight will die:</l>
               <l>But kill my Rival too; for he no less</l>
               <l>Deserves; and I thy righteous Doom will bless,</l>
               <l>Assur'd that what I lose, he never shall possess.</l>
               <l>To this reply'd the stern <hi>Athenian</hi> Prince,</l>
               <l>And sow'rly smild, In owning your Offence</l>
               <l>You judge your self; and I but keep Record</l>
               <l>In place of Law, while you pronounce the Word.</l>
               <l>Take your Desert, the Death you have decreed;</l>
               <l>I seal your Doom, and ratifie the Deed.</l>
               <l>By <hi>Mars,</hi> the Patron of my Arms, you die.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He said; dumb Sorrow seiz'd the Standers by.</l>
               <l>The Queen above the rest, by Nature Good,</l>
               <l>(The Pattern form'd of perfect Womanhood)</l>
               <l>For tender Pity wept: When she began,</l>
               <l>Through the bright Quire th' infectious Vertue ran.</l>
               <l>All dropp'd their Tears, ev'n the contended Maid;</l>
               <l>And thus among themselves they softly said:</l>
               <l>What Eyes can suffer this unworthy Sight!</l>
               <l>Two Youths of Royal Blood, renown'd in Fight,</l>
               <l>The Mastership of Heav'n in Face and Mind,</l>
               <l>And Lovers, far beyond their faithless Kind;</l>
               <l>See their wide streaming Wounds; they neither came</l>
               <l>From Pride of Empire, nor desire of Fame:</l>
               <l>Kings fight for Kingdoms, Madmen for Applause;</l>
               <l>But love for Love alone; that crowns the Lover's Cause.</l>
               <l>This Thought, which ever bribes the beauteous Kind,</l>
               <l>Such Pity wrought in ev'ry Ladies Mind,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:58868:40"/>
They left their Steeds; and prostrate on the Place,</l>
               <l>From the fierce King, implor'd th' Offenders Grace.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He paus'd a while, stood silent in his Mood,</l>
               <l>(For yet, his Rage was boiling in his Blood)</l>
               <l>But soon his tender Mind th' Impression felt,</l>
               <l>(As softest Metals are not slow to melt</l>
               <l>And Pity soonest runs in gentle Minds:)</l>
               <l>Then reasons with himself; and first he finds</l>
               <l>His Passion cast a Mist before his Sense,</l>
               <l>And either made, or magnifi'd th' Offence.</l>
               <l>Offence! of what? to whom? Who judg'd the Cause?</l>
               <l>The Pris'ner freed himself by Natures Laws:</l>
               <l>Born free, he sought his Right: The Man he freed</l>
               <l>Was perjur'd, but his Love excus'd the Deed:</l>
               <l>Thus pond'ring, he look'd under with his Eyes,</l>
               <l>And saw the Womens Tears, and heard their Cries;</l>
               <l>Which mov'd Compassion more: He shook his Head,</l>
               <l>And softly sighing to himself, he said,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Curse on th' unpard'ning Prince, whom Tears can draw</l>
               <l>To no Remorse; who rules by Lions Law;</l>
               <l>And deaf to Pray'rs, by no Submission bow'd,</l>
               <l>Rends all alike; the Penitent, and Proud:</l>
               <l>At this, with Look serene, he rais'd his Head,</l>
               <l>Reason resum'd her Place, and Passion fled:</l>
               <l>Then thus aloud he spoke: The Pow'r of Love,</l>
               <l>In Earth, and Seas, and Air, and Heav'n above,</l>
               <l>Rules, unresisted, with an awful Nod;</l>
               <l>By daily Miracles declar'd a God:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:58868:41"/>
He blinds the Wise, gives Eye-sight to the Blind;</l>
               <l>And moulds and stamps anew the Lover's Mind.</l>
               <l>Behold that <hi>Arcite,</hi> and this <hi>Palamon,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Freed from my Fetters, and in Safety gone,</l>
               <l>What hinder'd either in their Native Soil</l>
               <l>At ease to reap the Harvest of their Toil?</l>
               <l>But Love, their Lord, did otherwise ordain,</l>
               <l>And brought 'em in then own despite again,</l>
               <l>To suffer Death deserv'd; for well they know,</l>
               <l>'Tis in my Pow'r, and I their deadly Foe;</l>
               <l>The Proverb holds, That to be wise and love,</l>
               <l>Is hardly granted to the Gods above.</l>
               <l>See how the Madmen bleed: Behold the Gains</l>
               <l>With which their Master, Love, rewards their Pains:</l>
               <l>For sev'n long Years, on Duty ev'ry Day,</l>
               <l>Lo their Obedience, and their Monarch's Pay:</l>
               <l>Yet, as in Duty bound, they serve him on,</l>
               <l>And ask the Fools, they think it wisely done:</l>
               <l>Nor Ease, nor Wealth, nor Life it self regard,</l>
               <l>For 'tis their Maxim, Love is Love's Reward.</l>
               <l>This is not all; the Fair for whom they strove</l>
               <l>Nor knew before, nor could suspect their Love,</l>
               <l>Nor thought, when she beheld the Fight from far,</l>
               <l>Her Beauty was th' Occasion of the War.</l>
               <l>But sure a gen'ral Doom on Man is past,</l>
               <l>And all are Fools and Lovers, first or last:</l>
               <l>This both by others and my self I know,</l>
               <l>For I have serv'd their Sovereign, long ago.</l>

Oft have been caught within the winding Train</l>
               <l>Of Female Snares, and felt the Lovers Pain,</l>
               <l>And learn'd how far the God can Humane Hearts constrain.</l>
               <l>To this Remembrance, and the Pray'rs of those</l>
               <l>Who for th' offending Warriors interpose,</l>
               <l>I give their forfeit Lives; on this accord,</l>

               <l>This, freely sworn, the Knights their Grace obtain'd;</l>

               <l>Or each, or all, may win a Ladies Grace,</l>
               <l>Then either of you Knights may well deserve</l>
               <l>A Princess born; and such is she you serve:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Emily</hi> is Sister to the Crown,</l>
               <l>And but too well to both her Beauty known:</l>
               <l>But shou'd you combate till you both were dead,</l>
               <l>Two Lovers cannot share a single Bed:</l>
               <l>As therefore both are equal in Degree,</l>
               <l>The Lot of both be left to Destiny.</l>
               <l>Now hear th' Award, and happy may it prove</l>
               <l>To her, and him who best deserves her Love.</l>
               <l>Depart from hence in Peace, and free as Air,</l>
               <l>Search the wide World, and where you please repair;</l>
               <l>But on the Day when this returning Sun</l>
               <l>To the same Point through ev'ry Sign has run,</l>
               <l>Then each of you his Hundred Knights shall bring,</l>

               <l>The vanquish'd Party shall their Claim release,</l>

               <l>And Heav'n of me so judge, as I shall judge aright.</l>
               <l>If both are satisfi'd with this Accord,</l>

               <l>Eastward was built a Gate of Marble white;</l>
               <l>The like adorn'd the Western opposite.</l>
               <l>A nobler Object than this Fabrick was,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> never saw; nor of so vast a Space.</l>
               <l>For, rich with Spoils of many a conquer'd Land,</l>
               <l>All Arts and Artists <hi>Theseus</hi> could command;</l>
               <l>Who sold for Hire, or wrought for better Fame:</l>
               <l>The Master-Painters, and the Carvers came.</l>
               <l>So rose within the Compass of the Year</l>
               <l>An Ages Work, a glorious Theatre.</l>
               <l>Then, o'er its Eastern Gate was rais'd above</l>
               <l>A Temple, sacred to the Queen of Love;</l>
               <l>An Altar stood below: On either Hand</l>
               <l>A Priest with Roses crown'd, who held a Myrtle Wand.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Dome of <hi>Mars</hi> was on the Gate oppos'd,</l>
               <l>And on the North a Turret was enclos'd,</l>

Within the Wall, of Alabaster white,</l>
               <l>And crimson Coral, for the Queen of Night,</l>
               <l>Who takes in Sylvan Sports her chaste Delight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Within these Oratories might you see</l>
               <l>Rich Carvings, Pourtraitures, and Imagery:</l>
               <l>Where ev'ry Figure to the Life express'd</l>
               <l>The Godhead's Pow'r to whom it was address'd.</l>
               <l>In <hi>Venus</hi> Temple, on the Sides were seen</l>
               <l>The broken Slumbers of inamour'd Men:</l>
               <l>Pray'rs that ev'n spoke, and Pity seem'd to call,</l>
               <l>And issuing Sighs that smoak'd along the Wall.</l>
               <l>Complaints, and hot Desires, the Lover's Hell,</l>
               <l>And scalding Tears, that wore a Channel where they fell:</l>
               <l>And all around were Nuptial Bonds, the Ties</l>
               <l>Of Loves Assurance, and a Train of Lies,</l>
               <l>That, made in Lust, conclude in Perjuries.</l>
               <l>Beauty, and Youth, and Wealth, and Luxury,</l>
               <l>And spritely Hope, and short-enduring Joy;</l>
               <l>And Sorceries to raise th' Infernal Pow'rs,</l>
               <l>And Sigils fram'd in Planetary Hours:</l>
               <l>Expence, and After-thought, and idle Care,</l>
               <l>And Doubts of motley Hue, and dark Despair:</l>
               <l>Suspicions, and fantastical Surmise,</l>
               <l>And Jealousie suffus'd, with Jaundice in her Eyes;</l>
               <l>Discolouring all she view'd, in Tawney dress'd;</l>
               <l>Down-look'd, and with a Cuckow on her Fist.</l>
               <l>Oppos'd to her, on t' other Side, advance</l>
               <l>The costly Feast, the Carol, and the Dance,</l>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58868:43"/>
Minstrels, and Musick, Poetry, and Play,</l>
               <l>And Balls by Night, and Turnaments by Day.</l>
               <l>All these were painted on the Wall, and more;</l>
               <l>With Acts, and Monuments of Times before:</l>
               <l>And others added by Prophetick Doom,</l>
               <l>And Lovers yet unborn, and Loves to come:</l>
               <l>For there, th' <hi>Idalian</hi> Mount, and <hi>Citheron,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The Court of <hi>Venus,</hi> was in Colours drawn:</l>
               <l>Before the Palace-gate, in careless Dress,</l>
               <l>And loose Array, sat Portress Idleness:</l>
               <l>There, by the Fount, <hi>Narcissus</hi> pin'd alone;</l>
               <l>There <hi>Samson</hi> was; with wiser <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And all the mighty Names by Love undone:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Medea's</hi> Charms were there, <hi>Circean</hi> Feasts,</l>
               <l>With Bowls that turn'd inamour'd Youth to Beasts.</l>
               <l>Here might be seen, that Beauty, Wealth, and Wit,</l>
               <l>And Prowess, to the Pow'r of Love submit:</l>
               <l>The spreading Snare for all Mankind is laid;</l>
               <l>And Lovers all betray, and are betray'd.</l>
               <l>The Goddess self, some noble Hand had wrought;</l>
               <l>Smiling she seem'd, and full of pleasing Thought:</l>
               <l>From Ocean as she first began to rise,</l>
               <l>And smooth'd the ruffl'd Seas, and clear'd the Skies;</l>
               <l>She trode the Brine all bare below the Breast,</l>
               <l>And the green Waves, but ill conceal'd the rest,</l>
               <l>A Lute she held; and on her Head was seen</l>
               <l>A Wreath of Roses red, and Myrtles green:</l>
               <l>Her Turtles fann'd the buxom Air above;</l>
               <l>And, by his Mother, stood an Infant-Love:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:58868:44"/>
With Wings unfledg'd; his Eyes were banded o'er;</l>
               <l>His Hands a Bow, his Back a Quiver bore,</l>
               <l>Supply'd with Arrows bright and keen, a deadly Store.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But in the Dome of mighty <hi>Mars</hi> the Red,</l>
               <l>With diff'rent Figures all the Sides were spread:</l>
               <l>This Temple, less in Form, with equal Grace</l>
               <l>Was imitative of the first in <hi>Thrace:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For that cold Region was the lov'd Abode,</l>
               <l>And Sov'reign Mansion of the Warriour-God.</l>
               <l>The Landscape was a Forest wide and bare;</l>
               <l>Where neither Beast, nor Humane Kind repair;</l>
               <l>The Fowl, that scent afar, the Borders fly,</l>
               <l>And shun the bitter Blast, and wheel about the Sky.</l>
               <l>A Cake of Scurf lies baking on the Ground,</l>
               <l>And prickly Stubs, instead of Trees, are found;</l>
               <l>Or Woods with Knots, and Knares deform'd and old;</l>
               <l>Headless the most, and hideous to behold:</l>
               <l>A ratling Tempest through the Branches went,</l>
               <l>That stripp'd 'em bare, and one sole way they bent.</l>
               <l>Heav'n froze above, severe, the Clouds congeal,</l>
               <l>And through the Crystal Vault appear'd the standing Hail.</l>
               <l>Such was the Face without, a Mountain stood</l>
               <l>Threatning from high, and overlook'd the Wood:</l>
               <l>Beneath the lowring Brow, and on a Bent,</l>
               <l>The Temple stood of <hi>Mars</hi> Armipotent:</l>
               <l>The Frame of burnish'd Steel, that cast a Glare</l>
               <l>From far, and seem'd to thaw the freezing Air.</l>
               <l>A streight, long Entry, to the Temple led,</l>
               <l>Blind with high Walls; and Horrour over Head:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:58868:44"/>
Thence issu'd such a Blast, and hollow Rore,</l>
               <l>As threaten'd from the Hinge, to heave the Door;</l>
               <l>In, through that Door, a Northern Light there shone;</l>
               <l>'Twas all it had, for Windows there were none.</l>
               <l>The Gate was Adamant; Eternal Frame!</l>
               <l>Which hew'd by <hi>Mars</hi> himself, from <hi>Indian</hi> Quarries came,</l>
               <l>The Labour of a God; and all along</l>
               <l>Tough Iron Plates were clench'd to make it strong.</l>
               <l>A Tun about, was ev'ry Pillar there;</l>
               <l>A polish'd Mirrour shone not half so clear.</l>
               <l>There saw I how the secret Fellon wrought,</l>
               <l>And Treason lab'ring in the Traytor's Thought;</l>
               <l>And Midwife Time the ripen'd Plot to Murder brought.</l>
               <l>There, the Red Anger dar'd the Pallid Fear;</l>
               <l>Next stood Hypocrisie, with holy Lear:</l>
               <l>Soft, smiling, and demurely looking down,</l>
               <l>But hid the Dagger underneath the Gown:</l>
               <l>Th' assassinating Wife, the Houshold Fiend;</l>
               <l>And far the blackest there, the Traytor-Friend.</l>
               <l>On t' other Side there stood Destruction bare;</l>
               <l>Unpunish'd Rapine, and a Waste of War.</l>
               <l>Contest, with sharpen'd Knives in Cloysters drawn,</l>
               <l>And all with Blood bespread the holy Lawn.</l>
               <l>Loud Menaces were heard, and foul Disgrace,</l>
               <l>And bawling Infamy, in Language base;</l>
               <l>Till Sense was lost in Sound, and Silence fled the Place.</l>
               <l>The Slayer of Himself yet saw I there,</l>
               <l>The Gore congeal'd was clotter'd in his Hair:</l>
               <l>With Eyes half clos'd, and gaping Mouth he lay,</l>
               <l>And grim, as when he breath'd his sullen Soul away.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:58868:45"/>
In midst of all the Dome, Misfortune sat,</l>
               <l>And gloomy Discontent, and fell Debate:</l>
               <l>And Madness laughing in his ireful Mood;</l>
               <l>And arm'd Complaint on Theft; and Cries of Blood.</l>
               <l>There was the murder'd Corps, in Covert laid,</l>
               <l>And Violent Death in thousand Shapes display'd:</l>
               <l>The City to the Soldier's Rage resign'd:</l>
               <l>Successless Wars, and Poverty behind:</l>
               <l>Ships burnt in Fight, or forc'd on Rocky Shores,</l>
               <l>And the rash Hunter strangled by the Boars:</l>
               <l>The new-born Babe by Nurses overlaid;</l>
               <l>And the Cook caught within the raging Fire he made.</l>
               <l>All Ills of <hi>Mars</hi> his Nature, Flame and Steel:</l>
               <l>The gasping Charioteer, beneath the Wheel</l>
               <l>Of his own Car; the ruin'd House that falls</l>
               <l>And intercepts her Lord betwixt the Walls:</l>
               <l>The whole Division that to <hi>Mars</hi> pertains,</l>
               <l>All Trades of Death that deal in Steel for Gains,</l>
               <l>Were there: The Butcher, Armourer, and Smith,</l>
               <l>Who forges sharpen'd Fauchions, or the Scythe.</l>
               <l>The scarlet Conquest on a Tow'r was plac'd,</l>
               <l>With Shouts, and Soldiers Acclamations grac'd:</l>
               <l>A pointed Sword hung threatning o'er his Head,</l>
               <l>Sustain'd but by a slender Twine of Thred.</l>
               <l>There saw I <hi>Mars,</hi> his <hi>Ides,</hi> the <hi>Capitol,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The Seer in vain foretelling <hi>Caesar's</hi> Fall,</l>
               <l>The last <hi>Triumvirs,</hi> and the Wars they move,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Antony,</hi> who lost the World for Love.</l>
               <l>These, and a thousand more, the Fane adorn;</l>
               <l>Their Fates were painted e'er the Men were born,</l>

               <l>The Stag <hi>Acteon</hi> in the Stream had spy'd</l>
               <l>The naked Huntress, and, for seeing, dy'd:</l>

               <l>The rest were various Huntings, well design'd,</l>

               <l>THE Day approach'd when Fortune shou'd decide</l>
               <l>Th' important Enterprize, and give the Bride;</l>
               <l>For now, the Rivals round the World had fought,</l>
               <l>And each his Number, well appointed, brought.</l>
               <l>The Nations far and near, contend in Choice,</l>
               <l>And send the Flow'r of War by Publick Voice;</l>
               <l>That after, or before, were never known</l>
               <l>Such Chiefs; as each an Army seem'd alone:</l>
               <l>Beside the Champions; all of high Degree,</l>
               <l>Who Knighthood lov'd, and Deeds of Chivalry,</l>

Throng'd to the Lists, and envy'd to behold</l>
               <l>The Names of others, not their own inroll'd.</l>
               <l>Nor seems it strange for ev'ry Noble Knight,</l>
               <l>Who loves the Fair, and is endu'd with Might,</l>

               <l>A hundred Knights with <hi>Palamon</hi> there came,</l>

               <l>Some for Defence would Leathern Bucklers use,</l>
               <l>Of folded Hides; and others Shields of Pruce.</l>
               <l>One hung a Poleax at his Saddle-bow,</l>
               <l>And one a heavy Mace, to stun the Foe:</l>
               <l>One for his Legs and Knees provided well,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Lycurgus</hi> came, the surly King of <hi>Thrace;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Black was his Beard, and manly was his Face:</l>
               <l>The Balls of his broad Eyes roll'd in his Head,</l>
               <l>And glar'd betwixt a Yellow and a Red:</l>
               <l>He look'd a Lion with a gloomy Stare,</l>
               <l>And o'er his Eye-brows hung his matted Hair:</l>
               <l>Big-bon'd, and large of Limbs, with Sinews strong,</l>
               <l>Broad-shoulder'd, and his Arms were round and long.</l>
               <l>Four Milk-white Bulls (the <hi>Thracian</hi> Use of old)</l>
               <l>Were yok'd to draw his Car of burnish'd Gold.</l>
               <l>Upright he stood, and bore aloft his Shield,</l>
               <l>Conspicuous from afar, and over-look'd the Field.</l>
               <l>His Surcoat was a Bear-skin on his Back;</l>
               <l>His Hair hung long behind, and glossy Raven-black.</l>
               <l>His ample Forehead bore a Coronet</l>
               <l>With sparkling Diamonds, and with Rubies set:</l>
               <l>Ten Brace, and more, of Greyhounds, snowy fair,</l>
               <l>And tall as Stags, ran loose, and cours'd around his Chair,</l>
               <l>A Match for Pards in flight, in grappling, for the Bear:</l>
               <l>With Golden Muzzles all their Mouths were bound,</l>
               <l>And Collars of the same their Necks surround.</l>
               <l>Thus thro' the Fields <hi>Lycurgus</hi> took his way;</l>
               <l>His hundred Knights attend in Pomp and proud Array.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>To match this Monarch, with strong <hi>Arcite</hi> came</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Emetrius</hi> King of <hi>Inde,</hi> a mighty Name,</l>
               <l>On a Bay Courser, goodly to behold,</l>
               <l>The Trappings of his Horse emboss'd with barb'rous Gold.</l>

Not <hi>Mars</hi> bestrode a Steed with greater Grace;</l>
               <l>His Surcoat o'er his Arms was Cloth of <hi>Thrace,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Adorn'd with Pearls, all Orient, round, and great;</l>
               <l>His Saddle was of Gold, with Emeralds set.</l>
               <l>His Shoulders large, a Mantle did attire,</l>
               <l>With Rubies thick, and sparkling as the Fire:</l>
               <l>His Amber-colour'd Locks in Ringlets run,</l>
               <l>With graceful Negligence, and shone against the Sun.</l>
               <l>His Nose was Aquiline, his Eyes were blue,</l>
               <l>Ruddy his Lips, and fresh and fair his Hue:</l>
               <l>Some sprinkled Freckles on his Face were seen,</l>
               <l>Whose Dusk set off the Whiteness of the Skin:</l>
               <l>His awful Presence did the Crowd surprize,</l>
               <l>Nor durst the rash Spectator meet his Eyes,</l>
               <l>Eyes that confess'd him born for Kingly Sway,</l>
               <l>So fierce, they flash'd intolerable Day.</l>
               <l>His Age in Nature's youthful Prime appear'd,</l>
               <l>And just began to bloom his yellow Beard.</l>
               <l>Whene'er he spoke, his Voice was heard around,</l>
               <l>Loud as a Trumpet, with a Silver Sound.</l>
               <l>A Laurel wreath'd his Temples, fresh, and green;</l>
               <l>And Myrtle-springs, the Marks of Love, were mix'd between.</l>
               <l>Upon his Fist he bore, for his Delight,</l>
               <l>An Eagle well reclaim'd, and Lilly-white.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His hundred Knights attend him to the War,</l>
               <l>All arm'd for Battel; save their Heads were bare.</l>
               <l>Words, and Devices blaz'd on ev'ry Shield,</l>
               <l>And pleasing was the Terrour of the Field.</l>

For Kings, and Dukes, and Barons you might see,</l>
               <l>Like sparkling Stars, though diff'rent in Degree,</l>
               <l>All for th' Increase of Arms, and Love of Chivalry.</l>
               <l>Before the King, tame Leopards led the way,</l>
               <l>And Troops of Lions innocently play.</l>
               <l>So <hi>Bacchus</hi> through the conquer'd <hi>Indies</hi> rode,</l>
               <l>And Beasts in Gambols frisk'd before their honest God.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In this Array the War of either Side</l>
               <l>Through <hi>Athens</hi> pass'd with Military Pride.</l>
               <l>At Prime, they enter'd on the <hi>Sunday</hi> Morn;</l>
               <l>Rich Tap'stry spread the Streets, and Flowr's the Pots adorn.</l>
               <l>The Town was all a Jubilee of Feasts;</l>
               <l>So <hi>Theseus</hi> will'd, in Honour of his Guests:</l>
               <l>Himself with open Arms the Kings embrac'd,</l>
               <l>Then all the rest in their Degrees were grac'd.</l>
               <l>No Harbinger was needful for the Night,</l>
               <l>For ev'ry House was proud to lodge a Knight.</l>

               <l>I pass the Royal Treat, nor must relate</l>

               <l>Their Vows, or who was fairest at the Feast;</l>
               <l>Whose Voice, whose graceful Dance did most surprise,</l>
               <l>Soft am'rous Sighs, and silent Love of Eyes.</l>
               <l>The Rivals call my Muse another way,</l>

Promis'd the Sun, e'er Day began to spring</l>
               <l>The tuneful Lark already stretch'd her Wing,</l>

               <l>To <hi>Venus</hi> at her Fane, in her own House to pray.</l>
               <l>There, falling on his Knees before her Shrine,</l>

               <l>Creator <hi>Venus,</hi> Genial Pow'r of Love,</l>
               <l>The Bliss of Men below, and Gods above,</l>

               <l>For thee the Winds their Eastern Blasts forbear,</l>
               <l>Thy Month reveals the Spring, and opens all the Year.</l>
               <l>Thee, Goddess, thee the Storms of Winter fly,</l>
               <l>Earth smiles with Flow'rs renewing; laughs the Sky,</l>

Alas! I have not Words to tell my Grief;</l>
               <l>To vent my Sorrow wou'd be some Relief:</l>
               <l>Light Suff'rings give us leisure to complain;</l>

               <l>O Goddess, Haunter of the Woodland Green,</l>
               <l>To whom both Heav'n and Earth and Seas are seen;</l>
               <l>Queen of the nether Skies, where half the Year</l>
               <l>Thy Silver Beams descend, and light the gloomy Sphere;</l>

               <l>As I desire to live a Virgin-life,</l>
               <l>Nor know the Name of Mother or of Wife.</l>
               <l>Thy Votress from my tender Years I am,</l>

               <l>A lowly Servant, but a lofty Mate.</l>
               <l>Where Love is Duty, on the Female Side;</l>
               <l>On theirs meer sensual Gust, and sought with surly Pride.</l>
               <l>Now by thy triple Shape, as thou art seen</l>
               <l>In Heav'n, Earth, Hell, and ev'ry where a Queen,</l>

Quench their hot Fire, or far from me remove</l>
               <l>The Flame, and turn it on some other Love.</l>
               <l>Or if my frowning Stars have so decreed,</l>
               <l>That one must be rejected, one succeed,</l>
               <l>Make him my Lord within whose faithful Breast</l>
               <l>Is fix'd my Image, and who loves me best.</l>
               <l>But, oh! ev'n that avert! I chuse it not,</l>
               <l>But take it as the least unhappy Lot.</l>
               <l>A Maid I am, and of thy Virgin-Train;</l>

               <l>When lo! the burning Fire that shone so bright,</l>
               <l>Flew off, all sudden, with extinguish'd Light,</l>
               <l>And left one Altar dark, a little space;</l>

               <l>That other Victour-Flame a Moment stood,</l>
               <l>Then fell, and lifeless left th' extinguish'd Wood;</l>
               <l>For ever lost, th' irrevocable Light</l>
               <l>Forsook the blackning Coals, and sunk to Night:</l>
               <l>At either End it whistled as it flew,</l>
               <l>And as the Brands were green, so dropp'd the Dew;</l>
               <l>Infected as it fell with Sweat of Sanguin Hue.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Maid from that ill <hi>Omen</hi> turn'd her Eyes,</l>

Nor knew what signifi'd the boding Sign,</l>
               <l>But found the Pow'rs displeas'd, and fear'd the Wrath Divine.</l>

               <l>The Pow'r, behold! the Pow'r in Glory shone,</l>
               <l>By her bent Bow, and her keen Arrows known:</l>

               <l>More pow'rful Gods have torn thee from my Side,</l>
               <l>Unwilling to resign, and doom'd a Bride:</l>
               <l>The two contending Knights are weigh'd above;</l>
               <l>One <hi>Mars</hi> protects, and one the Queen of Love:</l>

               <l>Foreshews the Love allotted to remain.</l>
               <l>Farewell, she said, and vanish'd from the Place;</l>
               <l>The Sheaf of Arrows shook, and rattl'd in the Case.</l>
               <l>Agast at this, the Royal Virgin stood,</l>

               <l>As at a Signal giv'n, the Streets with Clamours ring:</l>
               <l>At once the Crowd arose; confus'd and high</l>
               <l>Ev'n from the Heav'n was heard a shouting Cry;</l>
               <l>For <hi>Mars</hi> was early up, and rowz'd the Sky.</l>
               <l>The Gods came downward to behold the Wars,</l>
               <l>Sharpning their Sights, and leaning from their Stars.</l>
               <l>The Neighing of the gen'rous Horse was heard,</l>
               <l>For Battel by the busie Groom prepar'd:</l>
               <l>Rustling of Harness, ratling of the Shield,</l>
               <l>Clatt ring of Armour, furbish'd for the Field.</l>
               <l>Crowds to the Castle mounted up the Street,</l>
               <l>Batt'ring the Pavement with their Coursers Feet:</l>
               <l>The greedy Sight might there devour the Gold</l>
               <l>Of glittring Arms, too dazling to behold;</l>
               <l>And polish'd Steel that cast the View aside,</l>
               <l>And Crested Morions, with their Plumy Pride.</l>
               <l>Knights, with a long Retinue of their Squires.</l>
               <l>In gawdy Liv'ries march, and quaint Attires.</l>
               <l>One lac'd the Helm, another held the Lance:</l>
               <l>A third the shining Buckler did advance.</l>
               <l>The Courser paw'd the Ground with restless Feet,</l>
               <l>And snorting foam'd, and champ'd the Golden Bit.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58868:55"/>
The Smiths and Armourers on Palfreys ride,</l>
               <l>Files in their Hands, and Hammers at their Side,</l>
               <l>And Nails for loosen'd Spears, and Thongs for Shields provide.</l>
               <l>The Yeomen guard the Streets, in seemly Bands;</l>
               <l>And Clowns come crowding on, with Cudgels in their Hands.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Trumpets, next the Gate, in order plac'd,</l>
               <l>Attend the Sign to sound the Martial Blast:</l>
               <l>The Palace-yard is fill'd with floating Tides,</l>
               <l>And the last Comers bear the former to the Sides.</l>
               <l>The Throng is in the midst: The common Crew</l>
               <l>Shut out, the Hall admits the better Few.</l>
               <l>In Knots they stand, or in a Rank they walk,</l>
               <l>Serious in Aspect, earnest in their Talk:</l>
               <l>Factious, and fav'ring this or t' other Side,</l>
               <l>As their strong Fancies, and weak Reason, guide:</l>
               <l>Their Wagers back their Wishes: Numbers hold</l>
               <l>With the fair freckl'd King, and Beard of Gold:</l>
               <l>So vig'rous are his Eyes, such Rays they cast,</l>
               <l>So prominent his Eagles Beak is plac'd.</l>
               <l>But most their Looks on the black Monarch bend,</l>
               <l>His rising Muscles, and his Brawn commend;</l>
               <l>His double-biting Ax, and beamy Spear,</l>
               <l>Each asking a Gygantick Force to rear.</l>
               <l>All spoke as partial Favour mov'd the Mind;</l>
               <l>And safe themselves, at others Cost divin'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Wak'd by the Cries, th' <hi>Athenian</hi> Chief arose,</l>
               <l>The Knightly Forms of Combate to dispose;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:58868:55"/>
And passing through th' obsequious Guards, he sate</l>
               <l>Conspicuous on a Throne, sublime in State;</l>
               <l>There, for the two contending Knights he sent:</l>
               <l>Arm'd <hi>Cap-a-pe,</hi> with Rev'rende low they bent;</l>
               <l>He smil'd on both, and with superiour Look</l>
               <l>Alike their offer'd Adoration took.</l>
               <l>The People press on ev'ry Side to see</l>
               <l>Their awful Prince, and hear his high Decree.</l>
               <l>Then signing to the Heralds with his Hand,</l>
               <l>They gave his Orders from their lofty Stand.</l>
               <l>Silence is thrice enjoin'd; then thus aloud</l>
               <l>The King at Arms bespeaks the Knights and listning Crowd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our Sovereign Lord has ponder'd in his Mind</l>
               <l>The Means to spare the Blood of gentle Kind;</l>
               <l>And of his Grace, and in-born Clemency,</l>
               <l>He modifies his first severe Decree;</l>
               <l>The keener Edge of Battel to rebate,</l>
               <l>The Troops for Honour fighting, not for Hate.</l>
               <l>He wills, not Death shou'd terminate their Strife;</l>
               <l>And Wounds, if Wounds ensue, be short of Life.</l>
               <l>But issues, e'er the Fight, his dread Command,</l>
               <l>That Slings afar, and Ponyards Hand to Hand,</l>
               <l>Be banish'd from the Field; that none shall dare</l>
               <l>With shortned Sword to stab in closer War;</l>
               <l>But in fair Combate fight with manly Strength,</l>
               <l>Nor push with biting Point, but strike at length.</l>
               <l>The Turney is allow'd but one Career,</l>
               <l>Of the tough Ash, with the sharp-grinded Spear.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:58868:56"/>
But Knights unhors'd may rise from off the Plain,</l>
               <l>And fight on Foot, their Honour to regain.</l>
               <l>Nor, if at Mischief taken, on the Ground</l>
               <l>Be slain, but Pris'ners to the Pillar bound,</l>
               <l>At either Barrier plac'd; nor (Captives made,)</l>
               <l>Be freed, or arm'd anew the Fight invade.</l>
               <l>The Chief of either Side, bereft of Life,</l>
               <l>Or yielded to his Foe, concludes the Strife.</l>
               <l>Thus dooms the Lord: Now valiant Knights and young,</l>
               <l>Fight each his fill with Swords and Maces long.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Herald ends: The vaulted Firmament</l>
               <l>With loud Acclaims, and vast Applause is rent:</l>
               <l>Heav'n guard a Prince so gracious and so good,</l>
               <l>So just, and yet so provident of Blood!</l>
               <l>This was the gen'ral Cry. The Trumpets sound,</l>
               <l>And Warlike Symphony is heard around.</l>
               <l>The marching Troops through <hi>Athens</hi> take their way,</l>
               <l>The great Earl-Marshal orders their Array.</l>
               <l>The Fair from high the passing Pomp behold;</l>
               <l>A Rain of Flow'rs is from the Windows roll'd.</l>
               <l>The Casements are with Golden Tissue spread,</l>
               <l>And Horses Hoofs, for Earth, on Silken Tap'ftry tread.</l>
               <l>The King goes midmost, and the Rivals ride</l>
               <l>In equal Rank, and close his either Side.</l>
               <l>Next after these, there rode the Royal Wife,</l>
               <l>With <hi>Emily,</hi> the Cause, and the Reward of Strife.</l>
               <l>The following Cavalcade, by Three and Three,</l>
               <l>Proceed by Titles marshall'd in Degree.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:58868:56"/>
Thus through the Southern Gate they take their Way,</l>
               <l>And at the Lists arriv'd e'er Prime of Day.</l>
               <l>There, parting from the King, the Chiefs divide,</l>
               <l>And wheeling East and West, before their Many ride,</l>
               <l>Th' <hi>Athenian</hi> Monarch mounts his Throne on high,</l>
               <l>And after him the Queen, and <hi>Emily:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Next these, the Kindred of the Crown are grac'd</l>
               <l>With nearer Seats, and Lords by Ladies plac'd.</l>
               <l>Scarce were they seated, when with Clamours loud</l>
               <l>In rush'd at once a rude promiscuous Crowd:</l>
               <l>The Guards, and then each other overbare,</l>
               <l>And in a Moment throng the spacious Theatre.</l>
               <l>Now chang'd the jarring Noise to Whispers low,</l>
               <l>As Winds forsaking Seas more softly blow;</l>
               <l>When at the Western Gate, on which the Car</l>
               <l>Is plac'd alost, that bears the God of War,</l>
               <l>Proud <hi>Arcite</hi> entring arm'd before his Train,</l>
               <l>Stops at the Barrier, and divides the Plain.</l>
               <l>Red was his Banner, and display'd abroad,</l>
               <l>The bloody Colours of his Patron God.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At that self-moment enters <hi>Palamon</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The Gate of <hi>Venus,</hi> and the Rising Sun;</l>
               <l>Wav'd by the wanton Winds, his Banner flies,</l>
               <l>All Maiden White, and shares the Peoples Eyes.</l>
               <l>From East to West, look all the World around,</l>
               <l>Two Troops so match'd were never to be found:</l>
               <l>Such Bodies built for Strength, of equal Age,</l>
               <l>In Stature siz'd; so proud an Equipage:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:58868:57"/>
The nicest Eye cou'd no Distinction make,</l>
               <l>Where lay th' Advantage, or what Side to take.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus rang'd, the Herald for the last proclaims</l>
               <l>A Silence, while they answer'd to their Names:</l>
               <l>For so the King decreed, to shun with Care</l>
               <l>The Fraud of Musters false, the common Bane of War.</l>
               <l>The Tale was just, and then the Gates were clos'd;</l>
               <l>And Chief to Chief, and Troop to Troop oppos'd.</l>
               <l>The Heralds last retir'd, and loudly cry'd,</l>
               <l>The Fortune of the Field be fairly try'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At this, the Challenger with fierce Defie</l>
               <l>His Trumpet sounds; the Challeng'd makes Reply:</l>
               <l>With Clangour rings the Field, resounds the vaulted Sky.</l>
               <l>Their Vizors clos'd, their Lances in the Rest,</l>
               <l>Or at the Helmet pointed, or the Crest;</l>
               <l>They vanish from the Barrier, speed the Race,</l>
               <l>And spurring see decrease the middle Space.</l>
               <l>A Cloud of Smoke envellops either Host,</l>
               <l>And all at once the Combatants are lost:</l>
               <l>Darkling they join adverse, and shock unseen,</l>
               <l>Coursers with Coursers justling, Men with Men:</l>
               <l>As lab'ring in Eclipse, a while they stay,</l>
               <l>Till the next Blast of Wind restores the Day.</l>
               <l>They look anew: The beauteous Form of Fight</l>
               <l>Is chang'd, and War appears a grizly Sight.</l>
               <l>Two Troops in fair Array one Moment show'd,</l>
               <l>The next, a Field with fallen Bodies strow'd:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:58868:57"/>
Not half the Number in their Seats are found,</l>
               <l>But Men and Steeds lie grov'ling on the Ground.</l>
               <l>The Points of Spears are stuck within the Shield,</l>
               <l>The Steeds without their Riders scour the Field.</l>
               <l>The Knights unhors'd, on Foot renew the Fight;</l>
               <l>The glitt'ring Fauchions cast a gleaming Light:</l>
               <l>Hauberks and Helms are hew'd with many a Wound;</l>
               <l>Out spins the streaming Blood, and dies the Ground.</l>
               <l>The mighty Maces with such haste descend,</l>
               <l>They break the Bones, and make the solid Armour bend.</l>
               <l>This thrusts amid the Throng with furious Force;</l>
               <l>Down goes, at once, the Horseman and the Horse:</l>
               <l>That Courser stumbles on the fallen Steed,</l>
               <l>And floundring, throws the Rider o'er his Head.</l>
               <l>One rolls along, a Foot-ball to his Foes;</l>
               <l>One with a broken Truncheon deals his Blows.</l>
               <l>This halting, this disabl'd with his Wound,</l>
               <l>In Trumph led, is to the Pillar bound,</l>
               <l>Where by the King's Award he must abide:</l>
               <l>There goes a Captive led on t' other Side.</l>
               <l>By Fits they cease; and leaning on the Lance,</l>
               <l>Take Breath a while, and to new Fight advance.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Full oft the Rivals met, and neither spar'd</l>
               <l>His utmost Force, and each forgot to ward.</l>
               <l>The Head of this was to the Saddle bent,</l>
               <l>That other backward to the Crupper sent:</l>
               <l>Both were by Turns unhors'd; the jealous Blows</l>
               <l>Fall thick and heavy, when on Foot they close.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:58868:58"/>
So deep their Fauchions bite, that ev'ry Stroke</l>
               <l>Pierc'd to the Quick; and equal Wounds they gave and took.</l>
               <l>Born far asunder by the Tides of Men,</l>
               <l>Like Adamant and Steel they meet agen.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So when a Tyger sucks the Bullock's Blood,</l>
               <l>A familh'd Lion issuing from the Wood</l>
               <l>Roars Lordly fierce, and challenges the Food.</l>
               <l>Each claims Possession, neither will obey,</l>
               <l>But both their Paws are fasten'd on the Prey:</l>
               <l>They bite, they tear; and while in vain they strive,</l>
               <l>The Swains come arm'd between, and both to distance drive.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At length, as Fate foredoom'd, and all things tend</l>
               <l>By Course of Time to their appointed End;</l>
               <l>So when the Sun to West was far declin'd,</l>
               <l>And both afresh in mortal Battel join'd,</l>
               <l>The strong <hi>Emetrius</hi> came in <hi>Arcite's</hi> Aid,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Palamon</hi> with Odds was overlaid:</l>
               <l>For turning short, he struck with all his Might</l>
               <l>Full on the Helmet of th' unwary Knight.</l>
               <l>Deep was the Wound; he stagger'd with the Blow,</l>
               <l>And turn'd him to his unexpected Foe;</l>
               <l>Whom with such Force he struck, he fell'd him down,</l>
               <l>And cleft the Circle of his Golden Crown.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Arcite's</hi> Men, who now prevail'd in Fight,</l>

And King <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> while he fought in vain</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Arcite</hi> of <hi>Thebes</hi> has won the beauteous Bride.</l>

                  <hi>Arcite</hi> is own'd ev'n by the Gods above,</l>
               <l>And conqu'ring <hi>Mars</hi> insults the Queen of Love.</l>

               <l>And <hi>Jove's</hi> usurping Arms in Heav'n prevail'd.</l>
               <l>Laugh'd all the Pow'rs who favour Tyranny;</l>
               <l>And all the Standing Army of the Sky.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Venus</hi> with dejected Eyes appears,</l>

               <l>Her Will refus'd, which grieves a Woman most,</l>
               <l>And in her Champion foil'd, the Cause of Love is lost.</l>
               <l>Till <hi>Saturn</hi> said, Fair Daughter, now be still,</l>
               <l>The blustring Fool has satisfi'd his Will:</l>

His Boon is giv'n; his Knight has gain'd the Day,</l>
               <l>But lost the Prize, th' Arrears are yet to pay.</l>
               <l>Thy Hour is come, and mine the Care shall be</l>

               <l>A Miracle (nor less it could be call'd)</l>
               <l>Their Joy with unexpected Sorrow pall'd.</l>
               <l>The Victor Knight had laid his Helm aside,</l>
               <l>Part for his Ease; the greater part for Pride:</l>
               <l>Bare-headed, popularly low he bow'd,</l>
               <l>And paid the Salurations of the Crowd.</l>
               <l>Then spurring at full speed, ran endlong on</l>
               <l>Where <hi>Theseus</hi> sat on his Imperial Throne;</l>
               <l>Furious he drove, and upward cast his Eye,</l>
               <l>Where next the Queen was plac'd his <hi>Emily;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then passing, to the Saddle-bow he bent,</l>
               <l>A sweet Regard the gracious Virgin lent:</l>
               <l>(For Women; to the Brave an easie Prey,</l>
               <l>Still follow Fortune, where she leads the Way:)</l>
               <l>Just then, from Earth sprung out a flashing Fire,</l>
               <l>By <hi>Pluto</hi> sent, at <hi>Saturn's</hi> bad Desire;</l>
               <l>The startling Steed was seiz'd with sudden Fright,</l>
               <l>And, bounding, o'er the Pummel cast the Knight:</l>
               <l>Forward he flew, and pitching on his Head,</l>
               <l>He quiver'd with his Feet, and lay for Dead.</l>
               <l>Black was his Count'nance in a little space,</l>
               <l>For all the Blood was gather'd in his Face.</l>

Help was at Hand; they rear'd him from the Ground,</l>
               <l>And from his cumbrous Arms his Limbs unbound;</l>
               <l>Then lanc'd a Vein, and watch'd returning Breath;</l>
               <l>It came, but clogg'd with Symptoms of his Death.</l>
               <l>The Saddle-bow the Noble Parts had prest,</l>
               <l>All bruis'd and mortifi'd his Manly Breast.</l>
               <l>Him still entranc'd, and in a Litter laid,</l>
               <l>They bore from Field, and to his Bed convey'd.</l>
               <l>At length he wak'd, and with a feeble Cry,</l>
               <l>The Word he first pronounc'd was <hi>Emily.</hi>

               <l>Mean time the King, though inwardly he mourn'd,</l>
               <l>In Pomp triumphant to the Town return'd,</l>
               <l>Attended by the Chiefs, who fought the Field;</l>
               <l>(Now friendly mix'd, and in one Troop compell'd.)</l>
               <l>Compos'd his Looks to counterfeited Cheer,</l>

               <l>But that which gladded all the Warriour Train,</l>
               <l>Though most were sorely wounded, none were slain.</l>
               <l>The Surgeons soon despoil'd 'em of their Arms,</l>
               <l>And some with Salves they cure, and some with Charms.</l>
               <l>Foment the Bruises, and the Pains asswage,</l>
               <l>And heal their inward Hurts with Sov'reign Draughts of Sage.</l>
               <l>The King in Person visits all around,</l>
               <l>Comforts the Sick, congratulates the Sound;</l>
               <l>Honours the Princely Chiefs, rewards the rest,</l>
               <l>And holds for thrice three Days a Royal Feast.</l>
               <l>None was disgrac'd; for Falling is no Shame;</l>
               <l>And Cowardice alone is Loss of Fame.</l>

The vent'rous Knight is from the Saddle thrown;</l>
               <l>But 'tis the Fault of Fortune, not his own.</l>
               <l>If Crowns and Palms the conqu'ring Side adorn,</l>
               <l>The Victor under better Stars was born:</l>
               <l>The brave Man seeks not popular Applause,</l>
               <l>Nor overpow'r'd with Arms, deserts his Cause;</l>
               <l>Unsham'd, though foil'd, he does the best he can;</l>

               <l>And each was set according to his Place.</l>
               <l>With ease were reconcil'd the diff'ring Parts,</l>

               <l>At length they took their Leave, the Time expir'd;</l>

               <l>Swoln is his Breast, his inward Pains increase,</l>
               <l>All Means are us'd, and all without Success.</l>
               <l>The clotted Blood lies heavy on his Heart,</l>
               <l>Corrupts, and there remains in spite of Art:</l>
               <l>Nor breathing Veins, nor Cupping will prevail;</l>
               <l>All outward Remedies and inward fail:</l>

               <l>When 'twas declar'd, all Hope of Life was past,</l>

What greater Curse cou'd envious Fortune give,</l>

               <l>Never, O never more to see the Sun!</l>

               <l>And much I doubt, shou'd Heav'n my Life prolong,</l>

               <l>Among the Laws that pass'd, it was decreed,</l>
               <l>That conquer'd <hi>Thebes</hi> from Bondage shou'd be freed;</l>
               <l>Reserving Homage to th' <hi>Athenian</hi> Throne,</l>
               <l>To which the Sov'reign summon'd <hi>Palamon.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Unknowing of the Cause, he took his Way,</l>
               <l>Mournful in Mind, and still in Black Array.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>Becoming Rev'rence to the Royal Maid.</l>
               <l>And first soft Whispers through th' Assembly went:</l>
               <l>With silent Wonder then they watch'd th' Event:</l>
               <l>All hush'd, the King arose with awful Grace,</l>
               <l>Deep Thought was in his Breast, and Counsel in his Face.</l>
               <l>At length he sigh'd; and having first prepar'd</l>
               <l>Th' attentive Audience, thus his Will declar'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Cause and Spring of Motion, from above</l>
               <l>Hung down on Earth the Golden Chain of Love:</l>
               <l>Great was th' Effect, and high was his Intent,</l>
               <l>When Peace among the jarring Seeds he sent.</l>
               <l>Fire, Flood, and Earth, and Air by this were bound,</l>
               <l>And Love, the common Link, the new Creation crown'd.</l>
               <l>The Chain still holds; for though the Forms decay,</l>
               <l>Eternal Matter never wears away:</l>
               <l>The same First Mover certain Bounds has plac'd,</l>
               <l>How long those perishable Forms shall last;</l>
               <l>Nor can they last beyond the Time assign'd</l>
               <l>By that All seeing, and All making Mind:</l>
               <l>Shorten their Hours they may; for Will is free;</l>
               <l>But never pass th' appointed Destiny.</l>
               <l>So Men oppress'd; when weary of their Breath,</l>
               <l>Throw off the Burden, and subborn their Death.</l>
               <l>Then since those Forms begin, and have their End,</l>
               <l>On some unalter'd Cause they sure depend:</l>
               <l>Parts of the Whole are we; but God the Whole;</l>
               <l>Who gives us Life, and animating Soul.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:58868:65"/>
For Nature cannot from a Part derive</l>
               <l>That Being, which the Whole can only give:</l>
               <l>He perfect, stable; but imperfect We,</l>
               <l>Subject to Change, and diff'rent in Degree.</l>
               <l>Plants, Beasts, and Man; and as our Organs are,</l>
               <l>We more or less of his Perfection share.</l>
               <l>But by a long Descent, th' Etherial Fire</l>
               <l>Corrupts; and Forms, the mortal Part, expire:</l>
               <l>As he withdraws his Vertue, so they pass,</l>
               <l>And the same Matter makes another Mass:</l>
               <l>This Law th' Omniscient Pow'r was pleas'd to give,</l>
               <l>That ev'ry Kind should by Succession live,</l>
               <l>That Individuals die, his Will ordains;</l>
               <l>The propagated Species still remains.</l>
               <l>The Monarch Oak, the Patriarch of the Trees,</l>
               <l>Shoots rising up, and spreads by slow Degrees:</l>
               <l>Three Centuries he grows, and three he stays,</l>
               <l>Supreme in State; and in three more decays:</l>

               <l>And Towns and Tow'rs their fatal Periods meet.</l>
               <l>So Rivers, rapid once, now naked lie,</l>
               <l>Forsaken of their Springs; and leave their Channels dry.</l>
               <l>So Man, at first a Drop, dilates with Heat,</l>
               <l>Then form'd, the little Heart begins to beat;</l>
               <l>Secret he feeds, unknowing in the Cell;</l>
               <l>At length, for Hatching ripe, he breaks the Shell,</l>
               <l>And struggles into Breath, and cries for Aid;</l>
               <l>Then, helpless, in his Mothers Lap is laid.</l>
               <l>He creeps, he walks, and issuing into Man,</l>

               <l>Or call untimely, what the Gods decreed?</l>
               <l>With Grief as just, a Friend may be deplor'd,</l>
               <l>From a foul Prison to free Air restor'd.</l>
               <l>Ought he to thank his Kinsman, or his Wife,</l>
               <l>Cou'd Tears recall him into wretched Life!</l>
               <l>Their Sorrow hurts themselves; on him is lost;</l>
               <l>And worse than both, offends his happy Ghost.</l>
               <l>What then remains, but after past Annoy,</l>
               <l>To take the good Vicissitude of Joy?</l>
               <l>To thank the gracious Gods for what they give,</l>
               <l>Possess our Souls, and while we live, to live?</l>
               <l>Ordain we then two Sorrows to combine,</l>
               <l>And in one Point th' Extremes of Grief to join;</l>
               <l>That thence resulting Joy may be renew'd,</l>
               <l>As jarring Notes in Harmony conclude.</l>
               <l>Then I propose, that <hi>Palamon</hi> shall be</l>

               <l>Long Love to her has born the faithful Knight,</l>
               <l>And well deserv'd, had Fortune done him Right:</l>
               <l>'Tis time to mend her Fault; since <hi>Emily</hi>

               <l>By <hi>Arcite's</hi> Death from former Vows is free:</l>
               <l>If you, Fair Sister, ratifie th' Accord,</l>
               <l>And take him for your Husband, and your Lord.</l>

And were he less, yet Years of Service past</l>

               <l>Pity is Heav'ns and yours: Nor can she find</l>
               <l>A Throne so soft as in a Womans Mind.</l>

               <l>Seem'd to give <hi>Theseus,</hi> what she gave the Knight.</l>
               <l>Then turning to the <hi>Theban,</hi> thus he said;</l>
               <l>Small Arguments are needful to persuade</l>
               <l>Your Temper to comply with my Command;</l>
               <l>And speaking thus, he gave <hi>Emilia's</hi> Hand.</l>
               <l>Smil'd <hi>Venus,</hi> to behold her own true Knight</l>
               <l>Obtain the Conquest, though he lost the Fight,</l>
               <l>And bless'd with Nuptial Bliss the sweet laborious Night.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Eros,</hi> and <hi>Anteros,</hi> on either Side,</l>
               <l>One fir'd the Bridegroom, and one warm'd the Bride;</l>
               <l>And long-attending <hi>Hymen</hi> from above</l>
               <l>Showr'd on the Bed the whole <hi>Idalian</hi> Grove.</l>
               <l>All of a Tenour was their After-Life,</l>
               <l>No Day discolour'd with Domestick Strife;</l>
               <l>No Jealousie, but mutual Truth believ'd,</l>
               <l>Secure Repose, and Kindness undeceiv'd.</l>
               <l>Thus Heavn, beyond the Compass of his Thought,</l>
               <l>Sent him the Blessing he so dearly bought.</l>

               <l>So may the Queen of Love long Duty bless,</l>
               <l>And all true Lovers find the same Success.</l>

               <l>Who studying Peace, and shunning Civil Rage,</l>
               <l>Enjoy'd his Youth, and now enjoys his Age:</l>

Without their Cost, you terminate the Cause;</l>

                  <hi>Nestor</hi> had fail'd the Fall of <hi>Troy</hi> to see,</l>
               <l>But leaning on his Lance, he vaulted on a Tree;</l>
               <l>Then gath'ring up his Feet, look'd down with Fear,</l>
               <l>And thought his monstrous Foe was still too near.</l>
               <l>Against a Stump his Tusk the Monster grinds,</l>
               <l>And in the sharpen'd Edge new Vigour finds;</l>
               <l>Then, trusting to his Arms, young <hi>Othrys</hi> found,</l>
               <l>And ranch'd his Hips with one continu'd Wound.</l>
               <l>Now <hi>Leda's</hi> Twins, the future Stars, appear;</l>
               <l>White were their Habits, white their Horses were:</l>
               <l>Conspicuous both, and both in act to throw,</l>
               <l>Their trembling Lances brandish'd at the Foe:</l>
               <l>Nor had they miss'd; but he to Thickets fled,</l>
               <l>Conceal'd from aiming Spears, not pervious to the Steed.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Telamon</hi> rush'd in, and happ'd to meet</l>
               <l>A rising Root, that held his fastned Feet;</l>
               <l>So down he fell; whom, sprawling on the Ground,</l>

               <l>Beneath his Ear the fastned Arrow stood,</l>
               <l>And from the Wound appear'd the trickling Blood.</l>
               <l>She blush'd for Joy: But <hi>Meleagros</hi> rais'd</l>
               <l>His voice with loud Applause, and the fair Archer prais'd.</l>
               <l>He was the first to see, and first to show</l>

               <l>Nor shall thy Valour want the Praises due,</l>

               <l>And flourishes his double-biting Ax:</l>
               <l>Then forward to his Fate, he took a Stride</l>
               <l>Before the rest, and to his Fellows cry'd,</l>

               <l>On the Boars bristled Back, and deeply drank his Blood.</l>
               <l>Now while the tortur'd Salvage turns around,</l>

               <l>And gazing on the Nymph with ardent Eyes,</l>

               <l>Pale at the sudden Sight, she chang'd her Cheer,</l>

               <l>The Cause, the Manner, and by whom they fell,</l>
               <l>'Twas Grief no more, or Grief and Rage were one</l>
               <l>Within her Soul; at last 'twas Rage alone;</l>

            <lg>
               <l>There lay a Log unlighted on the Hearth:</l>
               <l>When she was lab'ring in the Throws of Birth</l>
               <l>For th' unborn Chief, the Fatal Sisters came,</l>
               <l>And rais'd it up, and toss'd it on the Flame:</l>
               <l>Then on the Rock a scanty Measure place</l>
               <l>Of Vital Flax, and turn'd the Wheel apace;</l>
               <l>And turning sung, To this red Brand and thee,</l>

So vanish'd out of View. The frighted Dame</l>
               <l>Sprung hasty from her Bed, and quench'd the Flame:</l>
               <l>The Log in secret lock'd, she kept with Care,</l>
               <l>And that, while thus preserv'd, preserv'd her Heir.</l>
               <l>This Brand she now produc'd; and first she strows</l>
               <l>The Hearth with Heaps of Chips, and after blows;</l>
               <l>Thrice heav'd her Hand, and heav'd, she thrice repress'd:</l>
               <l>The Sister and the Mother long contest</l>
               <l>Two doubtful Titles in one tender Breast:</l>
               <l>And now her Eyes and Cheeks with Fury glow,</l>
               <l>Now pale her Cheeks, her Eyes with Pity flow:</l>
               <l>Now lowring Looks presage approaching Storms,</l>
               <l>And now prevailing Love her Face reforms:</l>
               <l>Resolv'd, she doubts again; the Tears she dry'd</l>
               <l>With burning Rage, are by new Tears supply'd;</l>
               <l>And as a Ship, which Winds and Waves assail,</l>
               <l>Now with the Current drives, now with the Gale,</l>
               <l>Both opposite, and neither long prevail:</l>
               <l>She feels a double Force, by Turns obeys</l>
               <l>Th'imperious Tempest, and th' impetuous Seas:</l>
               <l>So fares <hi>Althoea's</hi> Mind; she first relents</l>
               <l>With Pity, of that Pity then repents:</l>
               <l>Sister and Mother long the Scales divide,</l>
               <l>But the Beam nodded on the Sisters side.</l>
               <l>Sometimes she softly sigh'd, then roar'd aloud;</l>
               <l>But Sighs were stifl'd in the Cries of Blood.</l>
            </lg>

And when the Fun'ral Flames began to rise,</l>

               <l>And in those absent Flames began to fry:</l>
               <l>The blind Contagion rag'd within his Veins;</l>
               <l>But he with manly Patience bore his Pains:</l>
               <l>He fear'd not Fate, but only griev'd to die</l>
               <l>Without an honest Wound, and by a Death so dry.</l>
               <l>Happy <hi>Ancaeus,</hi> thrice aloud he cry'd,</l>
               <l>With what becoming Fate in Arms he dy'd!</l>
               <l>Then call'd his Brothers, Sisters, Sire, around,</l>
               <l>And her to whom his Nuptial Vows were bound;</l>
               <l>Perhaps his Mother; a long Sigh he drew,</l>
               <l>And his Voice failing, took his last Adieu:</l>
               <l>For as the Flames augment, and as they stay</l>
               <l>At their full Height, then languish to decay,</l>
               <l>They rise, and sink by Fits; at last they soar</l>
               <l>In one bright Blaze, and then descend no more:</l>
               <l>Just so his inward Heats at height, impair,</l>
               <l>Till the last burning Breath shoots out the Soul in Air.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>WHile <hi>Norman Tancred</hi> in <hi>Salerno</hi> reign'd,</l>
               <l>The Title of a Gracious Prince he gain'd;</l>
               <l>Till turn'd a Tyrant in his latter Days,</l>
               <l>He lost the Lustre of his former Praise;</l>
               <l>And from the bright Meridian where he stood,</l>
               <l>Descending, dipp'd his Hands in Lovers Blood.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Prince, of Fortunes Favour long possess'd,</l>
               <l>Yet was with one fair Daughter only bless'd;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:58868:84"/>
And bless'd he might have been with her alone:</l>
               <l>But oh! how much more happy, had he none!</l>
               <l>She was his Care, his Hope, and his Delight,</l>
               <l>Most in his Thought, and ever in his Sight:</l>
               <l>Next, nay beyond his Life, he held her dear;</l>
               <l>She liv'd by him, and now he liv'd in her.</l>
               <l>For this, when ripe for Marriage, he delay'd</l>
               <l>Her Nuptial Bands, and kept her long a Maid,</l>
               <l>As envying any else should share a Part</l>
               <l>Of what was his, and claiming all her Heart.</l>
               <l>At length, as Publick Decency requir'd,</l>
               <l>And all his Vassals eagerly desir'd,</l>
               <l>With Mind averse, he rather underwent</l>
               <l>His Peoples Will, than gave his own Consent:</l>
               <l>So was she torn, as from a Lover's Side,</l>
               <l>And made almost in his despite a Bride.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Short were her Marriage-Joys; for in the Prime,</l>
               <l>Of Youth, her Lord expir'd before his time:</l>
               <l>And to her Father's Court, in little space</l>
               <l>Restor'd anew, she held a higher Place;</l>
               <l>More lov'd, and more exalted into Grace.</l>
               <l>This Princess fresh and young, and fair, and wise,</l>
               <l>The worshipp'd Idol of her Father's Eyes,</l>
               <l>Did all her Sex in ev'ry Grace exceed,</l>
               <l>And had more Wit beside than Women need.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Youth, Health, and Ease, and most an amorous Mind,</l>
               <l>To second Nuptials had her Thoughts inclin'd:</l>
               <l>And former Joys had left a secret Sting behind.</l>

                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:58868:84"/>
But prodigal in ev'ry other Grant,</l>
               <l>Her Sire left unsupply'd her only Want;</l>
               <l>And she, betwixt her Modesty and Pride,</l>
               <l>Her Wishes, which she could not help, would hide.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Resolv'd at last to lose no longer Time,</l>
               <l>And yet to please her self without a Crime,</l>
               <l>She cast her Eyes around the Court, to find</l>
               <l>A worthy Subject suiting to her Mind,</l>
               <l>To him in holy Nuptials to be ty'd,</l>
               <l>A seeming Widow, and a secret Bride.</l>
               <l>Among the Train of Courtiers, one she found</l>
               <l>With all the Gifts of bounteous Nature crown'd,</l>
               <l>Of gentle Blood; but one whose niggard Fate</l>
               <l>Had set him far below her high Estate;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Guiscard</hi> his Name was call'd, of blooming Age,</l>
               <l>Now Squire to <hi>Tancred,</hi> and before his Page:</l>
               <l>To him, the Choice of all the shining Crowd,</l>
               <l>Her Heart the noble <hi>Sigismonda</hi> vow'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet hitherto she kept her Love conceal'd,</l>
               <l>And with close Glances ev'ry Day beheld</l>
               <l>The graceful Youth; and ev'ry Day increas'd</l>
               <l>The raging Fire that burn'd within her Breast:</l>
               <l>Some secret Charm did all his Acts attend,</l>
               <l>And what his Fortune wanted, hers could mend:</l>
               <l>Till, as the Fire will force its outward way,</l>
               <l>Or, in the Prison pent, consume the Prey;</l>
               <l>So long her earnest Eyes on his were set,</l>
               <l>At length their twisted Rays together met;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:58868:85"/>
And he, surpriz'd with humble Joy, survey'd</l>
               <l>One sweet Regard, shot by the Royal Maid:</l>
               <l>Not well assur'd, while doubtful Hopes he nurs'd,</l>
               <l>A second Glance came gliding like the first;</l>
               <l>And he who saw the Sharpness of the Dart,</l>
               <l>Without Defence receiv'd it in his Heart.</l>
               <l>In Publick though their Passion wanted Speech,</l>
               <l>Yet mutual Looks interpreted for each:</l>
               <l>Time, Ways, and Means of Meeting were deny'd;</l>
               <l>But all those Wants ingenious Love supply'd.</l>
               <l>Th' inventive God, who never fails his Part,</l>
               <l>Inspires the Wit, when once he warms the Heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When <hi>Guiscard</hi> next was in the Circle seen,</l>
               <l>Where <hi>Sigismonda</hi> held the Place of Queen,</l>
               <l>A hollow Cane within her Hand she brought,</l>
               <l>But in the Concave had enclos'd a Note:</l>
               <l>With this she seem'd to play, and, as in sport,</l>
               <l>Toss'd to her Love, in presence of the Court;</l>
               <l>Take it, she said; and when your Needs require,</l>
               <l>This little Brand will serve to light your Fire.</l>
               <l>He took it with a Bow, and soon divin'd.</l>
               <l>The seeming Toy was not for nought design'd:</l>
               <l>But when retir'd, so long with curious Eyes</l>
               <l>He view'd the Present, that he found the Prize.</l>
               <l>Much was in little writ; and all convey'd</l>
               <l>With cautious Care, for fear to be betray'd</l>
               <l>By some false Confident, or Fav'rite Maid.</l>
               <l>The Time, the Place, the Manner how to meet,</l>

                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:58868:85"/>
But since a Trust must be, she thought it best</l>
               <l>To put it out of Laymens Pow't at least,</l>
               <l>And for their solemn Vows prepar'd a Priest.</l>

               <l>A Mount of rough Ascent, and thick with Wood;</l>
               <l>Through this a Cave was dug with vast Expence,</l>
               <l>The Work it seem'd of some suspicious Prince,</l>

               <l>A Rift there was, which from the Mountains Height</l>

               <l>Now try'd the Stairs, and wading through the Night,</l>
               <l>Search'd all the deep Recess, and issu'd into Light.</l>
               <l>All this her Letter had so well explain'd,</l>

               <l>But in what Quarter of the Cops it lay,</l>
               <l>His Eye by certain Level could survey:</l>
               <l>Yet (for the Wood perplex'd with Thorns he knew)</l>
               <l>A Frock of Leather o'er his Limbs he drew:</l>

               <l>The Leathern Out-side, boistrous as it was,</l>
               <l>Gave way, and bent beneath her strict Embrace:</l>
               <l>On either Side the Kisses flew so thick,</l>
               <l>That neither he nor she had Breath to speak.</l>
               <l>The holy Man amaz'd at what he saw,</l>
               <l>Made haste to sanctifie the Bliss by Law;</l>
               <l>And mutter'd fast the Matrimony o're,</l>
               <l>For fear committed Sin should get before.</l>
               <l>His Work perform'd, he left the Pair alone,</l>
               <l>Because he knew he could not go too soon;</l>
               <l>His Presence odious, when his Task was done.</l>
               <l>What Thoughts he had, beseems not me to say;</l>
               <l>Though some surmise he went to fast and pray,</l>
               <l>And needed both, to drive the tempting Thoughts away.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Foe once gone, they took their full Delight;</l>
               <l>'Twas restless Rage, and Tempest all the Night:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:58868:87"/>
For greedy Love each Moment would employ,</l>
               <l>And grudg'd the shortest Pauses of their Joy.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus were their Loves auspiciously begun,</l>
               <l>And thus with secret Care were carried on.</l>
               <l>The Stealth it self did Appetite restore,</l>
               <l>And look'd so like a Sin, it pleas'd the more.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Cave was now become a common Way,</l>
               <l>The Wicket often open'd, knew the Key:</l>
               <l>Love rioted secure, and long enjoy'd,</l>
               <l>Was ever eager, and was never cloy'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But as Extremes are short, of Ill and Good,</l>
               <l>And Tides at highest Mark regorge the Flood;</l>
               <l>So Fate, that could no more improve their Joy,</l>
               <l>Took a malicious Pleasure to destroy.</l>

                  <hi>Tancred,</hi> who fondly lov'd, and whose Delight</l>
               <l>Was plac'd in his fair Daughters daily Sight,</l>
               <l>Of Custom, when his State-Affairs were done,</l>
               <l>Would pass his pleasing Hours with her alone:</l>
               <l>And, as a Father's Privilege allow'd,</l>
               <l>Without Attendance of th' officious Crowd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>It happen'd once, that when in Heat of Day</l>
               <l>He try'd to sleep, as was his usual Way,</l>
               <l>The balmy Slumber fled his wakeful Eyes,</l>
               <l>And forc'd him, in his own despite, to rise:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:58868:87"/>
Of Sleep forsaken, to relieve his Care,</l>
               <l>He sought the Conversation of the Fair:</l>
               <l>But with her Train of Damsels she was gone,</l>
               <l>In shady Walks the scorching Heat to shun:</l>
               <l>He would not violate that sweet Recess,</l>
               <l>And found besides a welcome Heaviness</l>
               <l>That seiz'd his Eyes; and Slumber, which forgot</l>
               <l>When call'd before to come, now came unsought.</l>
               <l>From Light retir'd, behind his Daughters Bed,</l>
               <l>He for approaching Sleep compos'd his Head;</l>
               <l>A Chair was ready, for that Use design'd,</l>
               <l>So quilted, that he lay at ease reclin'd;</l>
               <l>The Curtains closely drawn, the Light to skreen,</l>
               <l>As if he had contriv'd to lie unseen:</l>
               <l>Thus cover'd with an artificial Night,</l>
               <l>Sleep did his Office soon, and seal'd his Sight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With Heav'n averse, in this ill-omen'd Hour</l>
               <l>Was <hi>Guiscard</hi> summon'd to the secret Bow'r,</l>
               <l>And the fair Nymph, with Expectation fir'd,</l>
               <l>From her attending Damsels was retir'd:</l>
               <l>For, true to Love, she measur'd Time so right,</l>
               <l>As not to miss one Moment of Delight.</l>
               <l>The Garden, seated on the level Floor,</l>
               <l>She left behind, and locking ev'ry Door,</l>
               <l>Thought all secure; but little did she know,</l>
               <l>Blind to her Fate, she had inclos'd her Foe.</l>
               <l>Attending <hi>Guiscard,</hi> in his Leathern Frock,</l>
               <l>Stood ready, with his thrice-repeated Knock:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:58868:88"/>
Thrice with a doleful Sound the jarring Grate</l>
               <l>Rung deaf, and hollow, and presag'd their Fate.</l>
               <l>The Door unlock'd, to known Delight they haste,</l>

               <l>Rush to the conscious Bed, a mutual Freight,</l>
               <l>And heedless press it with their wonted Weight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The sudden Bound awak'd the sleeping Sire,</l>
               <l>And shew'd a Sight no Parent can desire:</l>
               <l>His opening Eyes at once with odious View</l>
               <l>The Love discover'd, and the Lover knew:</l>
               <l>He would have cry'd; but hoping that he dreamt,</l>
               <l>Amazement ty'd his Tongue, and stopp'd th' Attempt.</l>
               <l>Th' ensuing Moment all the Truth declar'd,</l>
               <l>But now he stood collected, and prepar'd;</l>
               <l>For Malice and Revenge had put him on his Guard.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So, like a Lion that unheeded lay,</l>
               <l>Dissembling Sleep, and watchful to betray,</l>
               <l>With inward Rage he meditates his Prey.</l>
               <l>The thoughtless Pair, indulging their Desires,</l>
               <l>Alternate, kindl'd, and then quench'd their Fires;</l>
               <l>Nor thinking in the Shades of Death they play'd,</l>
               <l>Full of themselves, themselves alone survey'd,</l>
               <l>And, too secure, were by themselves betray'd.</l>
               <l>Long time dissolv'd in Pleasure thus they lay,</l>
               <l>Till Nature could no more suffice their Play;</l>
               <l>Then rose the Youth, and through the Cave again</l>
               <l>Return'd; the Princess mingl'd with her Train.</l>

            <lg>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:58868:88"/>
               <l>Resolv'd his unripe Vengeance to defer</l>
               <l>The Royal Spy, when now the Coast was clear,</l>
               <l>Sought not the Garden, but retir'd unseen,</l>
               <l>To brood in secret on his gather'd Spleen,</l>
               <l>And methodize Revenge: To Death he griev'd;</l>
               <l>And, but he saw the Crime, had scarce believ'd.</l>
               <l>Th' Appointment for th' ensuing Night he heard;</l>
               <l>And therefore in the Cavern had prepar'd</l>
               <l>Two brawny Yeomen of his trusty Guard.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Scarce had unwary <hi>Guiscard</hi> set his Foot</l>
               <l>Within the farmost Entrance of the Grot,</l>
               <l>When these in secret Ambush ready lay,</l>
               <l>And rushing on the sudden seiz'd the Prey:</l>
               <l>Encumber'd with his Frock, without Defence,</l>
               <l>An easie Prize, they led the Pris'ner thence,</l>
               <l>And, as commanded, brought before the Prince.</l>
               <l>The gloomy Sire, too sensible of Wrong</l>
               <l>To vent his Rage in Words, restrain'd his Tongue;</l>
               <l>And only said, Thus Servants are preferr'd,</l>
               <l>And trusted, thus their Sov'reigns they reward.</l>
               <l>Had I not seen, had not these Eyes receiv'd</l>
               <l>Too clear a Proof, I could not have believ'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He paus'd, and choak'd the rest. The Youth, who saw</l>
               <l>His forfeit Life abandon'd to the Law,</l>
               <l>The Judge th' Accuser, and th' Offence to him</l>
               <l>Who had both Pow'r and Will t'avenge the Crime;</l>
               <l>

No vain Defence prepar'd; but thus reply'd,</l>
               <l>The Faults of Love by Love are justifi'd:</l>
               <l>With unresisted Might the Monarch reigns,</l>
               <l>He levels Mountains, and he raises Plains;</l>
               <l>And not regarding Diff'rence of Degree,</l>
               <l>Abas'd your Daughter, and exalted me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This bold Return with seeming Patience heard,</l>
               <l>The Pris'ner was remitted to the Guard.</l>
               <l>The sullen Tyrant slept not all the Night,</l>
               <l>But lonely walking by a winking Light,</l>
               <l>Sobb'd, wept, and groan'd, and beat his wither'd Breast,</l>
               <l>But would not violate his Daughters Rest;</l>
               <l>Who long expecting lay, for Bliss prepar'd,</l>
               <l>Listning for Noise, and griev'd that none she heard;</l>
               <l>Oft rose, and oft in vain employ'd the Key,</l>
               <l>And oft accus'd her Lover of Delay;</l>
               <l>And pass'd the tedious Hours in anxious Thoughts away.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Morrow came; and at his usual Hour</l>
               <l>Old <hi>Tancred</hi> visited his Daughters Bow'r;</l>
               <l>Her Cheek (for such his Custom was) he kiss'd,</l>
               <l>Then bless'd her kneeling, and her Maids dismiss'd.</l>
               <l>The Royal Dignity thus far maintain'd,</l>
               <l>Now left in private, he no longer feign'd;</l>
               <l>But all at once his Grief and Rage appear'd,</l>
               <l>And Floods of Tears ran trickling down his Beard.</l>

               <l>O <hi>Sigismonda,</hi> he began to say:</l>
               <l>Thrice he began, and thrice was forc'd to stay,</l>
               <l>Till Words with often trying found their Way:</l>
               <l>I thought, O <hi>Sigismonda,</hi> (But how blind</l>
               <l>Are Parents Eyes, their Childrens Faults to find!)</l>
               <l>Thy Vertue, Birth, and Breeding were above</l>
               <l>A mean Desire, and vulgar Sense of Love:</l>
               <l>Nor less than Sight and Hearing could convince</l>
               <l>So fond a Father, and so just a Prince,</l>
               <l>Of such an unforeseen, and unbeliev'd Offence.</l>
               <l>Then what indignant Sorrow must I have,</l>
               <l>To see thee lie subjected to my Slave!</l>
               <l>A Man so smelling of the Peoples Lee,</l>
               <l>The Court receiv'd him first for Charity;</l>
               <l>And since with no Degree of Honour grac'd,</l>
               <l>But only suffer'd, where he first was plac'd:</l>
               <l>A grov'ling Infect still; and so design'd</l>
               <l>By Natures Hand, nor born of Noble Kind:</l>
               <l>A Thing, by neither Man nor Woman priz'd,</l>
               <l>And scarcely known enough, to be despis'd.</l>
               <l>To what has Heav'n reserv'd my Age? Ah! why</l>
               <l>Should Man, when Nature calls, not chuse to die,</l>
               <l>Rather than stretch the Span of Life, to find</l>
               <l>Such Ills as Fate has wisely cast behind,</l>
               <l>For those to feel, whom fond Desire to live</l>
               <l>Makes covetous of more than Life can give!</l>
               <l>Each has his Share of Good; and when 'tis gone,</l>
               <l>The Guest, though hungry, cannot rise too soon.</l>

But I, expecting more, in my own wrong</l>

               <l>Hadst thou not lov'd, or loving sav'd the Shame,</l>
               <l>If not the Sin, by some Illustrious Name,</l>

               <l>Thus not the least Excuse is left for thee,</l>

               <l>For such was his Attire, as with Intent</l>
               <l>Of Nature, suited to his mean Descent:</l>
               <l>The harder Question yet remains behind,</l>
               <l>What Pains a Parent and a Prince can find</l>
               <l>To punish an Offence of this degenerate Kind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As I have lov'd, and yet I love thee more</l>
               <l>Than ever Father lov'd a Child before;</l>
               <l>So, that Indulgence draws me to forgive:</l>
               <l>Nature, that gave thee Life, would have thee live.</l>

Fain would I chuse a middle Course to steer;</l>

On him I rested, after long Debate,</l>

               <l>Wag'd against Foes; and, when the Wars are o'er,</l>
               <l>Fit only to maintain Despotick Pow'r:</l>
               <l>Dang'rous to Freedom, and desir'd alone</l>
               <l>By Kings, who seek an Arbitrary Throne:</l>
               <l>Such were these Guards; as ready to have slain</l>
               <l>The Prince himself, allur'd with greater gain:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:58868:95"/>
So was the Charge perform'd with better Will,</l>
               <l>By Men inur'd to Blood, and exercis'd in Ill.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now, though the sullen Sire had eas'd his Mind,</l>
               <l>The Pomp of his Revenge was yet behind,</l>
               <l>A Pomp prepar'd to grace the Present he design'd.</l>
               <l>A Goblet rich with Gems, and rough with Gold,</l>
               <l>Of Depth, and Breadth, the precious Pledge to hold,</l>
               <l>With cruel Care he chose: The hollow Part</l>
               <l>Inclos'd; the Lid conceal'd the Lover's Heart:</l>
               <l>Then of his trusted Mischiefs, one he sent,</l>
               <l>And bad him with these Words the Gift present;</l>
               <l>Thy Father sends thee this, to cheer thy Breast,</l>
               <l>And glad thy Sight with what thou lov'st the best;</l>
               <l>As thou hast pleas'd his Eyes, and joy'd his Mind,</l>
               <l>With what he lov'd the most of Humane Kind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>E'er this the Royal Dame, who well had weigh'd</l>
               <l>The Consequence of what her Sire had said,</l>
               <l>Fix'd on her Fate, against th' expected Hour,</l>
               <l>Procur'd the Means to have it in her Pow'r:</l>
               <l>For this, she had distill'd, with early Care,</l>
               <l>The Juice of Simples, friendly to Despair,</l>
               <l>A Magazine of Death; and thus prepar'd,</l>
               <l>Secure to die, the fatal Message heard:</l>
               <l>Then smil'd severe; nor with a troubl'd Look,</l>
               <l>Or trembling Hand, the Fun'ral Present took;</l>
               <l>Ev'n kept her Count'nance, when the Lid remov'd,</l>
               <l>Disclos'd the Heart, unfortunately lov'd:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:58868:95"/>
She needed not be told within whose Breast</l>
               <l>It lodg'd; the Message had explain'd the rest.</l>
               <l>Or not amaz'd, or hiding her Surprize,</l>
               <l>She sternly on the Bearer fix'd her Eyes:</l>
               <l>Then thus; Tell <hi>Tancred,</hi> on his Daughters part,</l>
               <l>The Gold, though precious, equals not the Heart:</l>
               <l>But he did well to give his best; and I,</l>
               <l>Who wish'd a worthier Urn, forgive his Poverty.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At this, she curb'd a Groan, that else had come,</l>
               <l>And pausing, view'd the Present in the Tomb:</l>
               <l>Then, to the Heart ador'd, devoutly glew'd</l>
               <l>Her Lips, and raising it, her Speech renew'd;</l>
               <l>Ev'n from my Day of Birth, to this, the Bound</l>
               <l>Of my unhappy Being, I have found</l>
               <l>My Father's Care, and Tenderness express'd:</l>
               <l>But this last Act of Love excels the rest:</l>
               <l>For this so dear a Present, bear him back</l>
               <l>The best Return that I can live to make.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Messenger dispatch'd, again she view'd</l>
               <l>The lov'd Remains, and sighing, thus pursu'd;</l>
               <l>Source of my Life, and Lord of my Desires,</l>
               <l>In whom I liv'd, with whom my Soul expires;</l>
               <l>Poor Heart, no more the Spring of Vital Heat,</l>
               <l>Curs'd be the Hands that tore thee from thy Seat!</l>
               <l>The Course is finish'd, which thy Fates decreed,</l>
               <l>And thou, from thy Corporeal Prison freed:</l>
               <l>Soon hast thou reach'd the Goal with mended Pace,</l>
               <l>A World of Woes dispatch'd in little space:</l>
               <l>

Forc'd by thy Worth, thy Foe in Death become</l>
               <l>Thy Friend, has lodg'd thee in a costly Tomb;</l>
               <l>There yet remain'd thy Fun'ral Exequies,</l>
               <l>The weeping Tribute of thy Widows Eyes,</l>
               <l>And those, indulgent Heav'n has found the way</l>
               <l>That I, before my Death, have leave to pay.</l>
               <l>My Father ev'n in Cruelty is kind,</l>
               <l>Or Heav'n has turn'd the Malice of his Mind</l>
               <l>To better Uses than his Hate design'd;</l>
               <l>And made th' Insult which in his Gift appears,</l>
               <l>The Means to mourn thee with my pious Tears;</l>
               <l>Which I will pay thee down, before I go,</l>
               <l>And save my self the Pains to weep below,</l>
               <l>If Souls can weep; though once I meant to meet</l>
               <l>My Fate with Face unmov'd, and Eyes unwet,</l>
               <l>Yet since I have thee here in narrow Room,</l>
               <l>My Tears shall set thee first afloat within thy Tomb:</l>
               <l>Then (as I know thy Spirit hovers nigh)</l>
               <l>Under thy friendly Conduct will I fly</l>
               <l>To Regions unexplor'd, secure to share</l>
               <l>Thy State; nor Hell shall Punishment appear;</l>
               <l>And Heav'n is double Heav'n, if thou art there.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She said: Her brim-full Eyes, that ready stood,</l>
               <l>And only wanted Will to weep a Flood,</l>
               <l>Releas'd their watry Store, and pour'd amain,</l>
               <l>Like Clouds low hung, a sober Show'r of Rain;</l>
               <l>Mute solemn Sorrow, free from Female Noise,</l>
               <l>Such as the Majesty of Grief destroys:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:58868:96"/>
For, bending o'er the Cup, the Tears she shed</l>
               <l>Seem'd by the Posture to discharge her Head,</l>
               <l>O'er-fill'd before; and oft (her Mouth apply'd</l>
               <l>To the cold Heart) she kiss'd at once, and cry'd.</l>
               <l>Her Maids, who stood amaz'd, nor knew the Cause</l>
               <l>Of her Complaining, nor whose Heart it was;</l>
               <l>Yet all due Measures of her Mourning kept,</l>
               <l>Did Office at the Dirge, and by Infection wept;</l>
               <l>And oft enquir'd th' Occasion of her Grief,</l>
               <l>(Unanswer'd but by Sighs) and offer'd vain Relief.</l>
               <l>At length, her Stock of Tears already shed,</l>
               <l>She wip'd her Eyes, she rais'd her drooping Head,</l>
               <l>And thus pursu'd: O ever faithful Heart,</l>
               <l>I have perform'd the Ceremonial Part,</l>
               <l>The Decencies of Grief: It rests behind,</l>
               <l>That as our Bodies were, our Souls be join'd:</l>
               <l>To thy whate'er abode, my Shade convey,</l>
               <l>And as an elder Ghost, direct the way.</l>
               <l>She said; and bad the Vial to be brought,</l>
               <l>Where she before had brew'd the deadly Draught,</l>
               <l>First pouring out the med'cinable Bane,</l>
               <l>The Heart, her Tears had rins'd, she bath'd again;</l>
               <l>Then down her Throat the Death securely throws,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>

Nor farther Word she spoke, but clos'd her Sight,</l>

               <l>Yet, as their Duty was, to <hi>Tancred</hi> sent,</l>
               <l>Who, conscious of th' Occasion, fear'd th' Event.</l>
               <l>Alarm'd, and with presaging Heart he came,</l>
               <l>And drew the Curtains, and expos'd the Dame</l>
               <l>To loathsom Light: then with a late Relief</l>
               <l>Made vain Efforts, to mitigate her Grief.</l>
               <l>She, what she could, excluding Day, her Eyes</l>
               <l>Kept firmly seal'd, and sternly thus replies:</l>

               <l>Two Cushions stuff'd with Straw, the Seat to raise;</l>
               <l>Course, but the best she had; then rakes the Load</l>
               <l>Of Ashes from the Hearth, and spreads abroad</l>
               <l>The living Coals; and, lest they shou'd expire,</l>
               <l>With Leaves and Barks she feeds her Infant-fire:</l>
               <l>It smoaks; and then with trembling Breath she blows,</l>
               <l>Till in a chearful Blaze the Flames arose.</l>
               <l>With Brush-wood and with Chips she strengthens these,</l>
               <l>And adds at last the Boughs of rotten Trees.</l>
               <l>The Fire thus form'd, she sets the Kettle on,</l>
               <l>(Like burnish'd Gold the little Seether shone)</l>
               <l>Next took the Coleworts which her Husband got</l>
               <l>From his own Ground, (a small well-water'd Spot;)</l>
               <l>She stripp'd the Stalks of all their Leaves; the best</l>
               <l>She cull'd, and then with handy-care she dress'd.</l>
               <l>High o'er the Hearth a Chine of Bacon hung;</l>

               <l>The Time between, before the Fire they sat,</l>

               <l>So was the mended Board exactly rear'd:</l>
               <l>Then rubb'd it o'er with newly-gather'd Mint,</l>

               <l>With gilded Horns, the Milk-white Heifers led,</l>
               <l>Slaughter'd before the sacred Altars, bled:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Pygmalion</hi> off'ring, first, approach'd the Shrine,</l>
               <l>And then with Pray'rs implor'd the Pow'rs Divine,</l>

               <l>If all we can require, be yours to grant;</l>

               <l>The Golden Goddess, present at the Pray'r,</l>
               <l>Well knew he meant th' inanimated Fair,</l>
               <l>And gave the Sign of granting his Desire;</l>

               <l>The Youth, returning to his Mistress, hies,</l>
               <l>And impudent in Hope, with ardent Eyes,</l>
               <l>And beating Breast, by the dear Statue lies.</l>
               <l>He kisses her white Lips, renews the Bliss,</l>
               <l>And looks, and thinks they redden at the Kiss;</l>
               <l>He thought them warm before: Nor longer stays,</l>
               <l>But next his Hand on her hard Bosom lays;</l>
               <l>Hard as it was, beginning to relent,</l>
               <l>It seem'd, the Breast beneath his Fingers bent;</l>
               <l>He felt again, his Fingers made a Print,</l>

               <l>The pleasing Task he fails not to renew;</l>

               <l>Like pliant Wax, when chafing Hands reduce</l>
               <l>The former Mass to Form, and frame for Use.</l>
               <l>He would believe, but yet is still in pain,</l>
               <l>And tries his Argument of Sense again,</l>
               <l>Presses the Pulse, and feels the leaping Vein.</l>
               <l>Convinc'd, o'erjoy'd, his studied Thanks and Praise,</l>
               <l>To her who made the Miracle, he pays:</l>
               <l>Then Lips to Lips he join'd; now freed from Fear,</l>
               <l>He found the Savour of the Kiss sincere:</l>
               <l>At this the waken'd Image op'd her Eyes,</l>

Since Nature cou'd behold so dire a Crime,</l>
               <l>I gratulate at least my Native Clime,</l>

               <l>Nor all her od'rous Tears can cleanse her Crime,</l>
               <l>Her Plant alone deforms the happy Olime:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cupid</hi> denies to have inflam'd thy Heart,</l>
               <l>Disowns thy Love, and vindicates his Dart:</l>
               <l>Some Fury gave thee those infernal Pains,</l>
               <l>And shot her venom'd Vipers in thy Veins.</l>
               <l>To hate thy Sire, had meritted a Curse;</l>

               <l>The Neighb'ring Monarchs, by thy Beauty led,</l>

What Tyrant then these envious Laws began,</l>

               <l>The Horse may make his Mother-Mare a Bride;</l>
               <l>What Piety forbids the lusty Ram</l>

               <l>The Hen is free to wed the Chick she bore,</l>

               <l>All Creatures else are of a happier Kind,</l>

               <l>But Man, a Slave of his own making lives;</l>
               <l>The Fool denies himself what Nature gives:</l>

               <l>Where happy Daughters with their Sires are join'd,</l>
               <l>And Piety is doubly paid in Kind.</l>

               <l>His Worth deserves to kindle my Desires,</l>

               <l>If strong Desires thy Mind to Fury move,</l>
               <l>With Charms, and Med'cines, I can cure thy Love:</l>
               <l>If envious Eyes their hurtful Rays have cast,</l>
               <l>More pow'rful Verse shall free thee from the Blast:</l>
               <l>If Heav'n offended sends thee this Disease,</l>
               <l>Offended Heav'n with Pray'rs we can appease.</l>
               <l>What then remains, that can these Cares procure?</l>
               <l>Thy House is flourishing, thy Fortune sure:</l>
               <l>Thy careful Mother yet in Health survives,</l>
               <l>And, to thy Comfort, thy kind Father lives.</l>
               <l>The Virgin started at her Father's Name,</l>
               <l>And sigh'd profoundly, conscious of the Shame:</l>
               <l>Nor yet the Nurse her impious Love divin'd;</l>
               <l>But yet surmis'd, that Love disturb'd her Mind:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:58868:112"/>
Thus thinking, she pursu'd her Point, and laid</l>
               <l>And lull'd within her Lap the mourning Maid;</l>
               <l>Then softly sooth'd her thus, I guess your Grief:</l>
               <l>You love, my Child; your Love shall find Relief.</l>
               <l>My long experienc'd Age shall be your Guide;</l>
               <l>Relie on that, and lay Distrust aside:</l>
               <l>No Breath of Air shall on the Secret blow,</l>
               <l>Nor shall (what most you fear) your Father know.</l>
               <l>Struck once again, as with a Thunder-clap,</l>
               <l>The guilty Virgin bounded from her Lap,</l>
               <l>And threw her Body prostrate on the Bed,</l>
               <l>And, to conctal her Blushes, hid her Head:</l>
               <l>There silent lay, and warn'd her with her Hand</l>
               <l>To go: But she receiv'd not the Command;</l>
               <l>Remaining still importunate to know:</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Myrrha</hi> thus; Or ask no more, or go:</l>
               <l>I prethee go, or staying spare my Shame;</l>
               <l>What thou wou'dst hear, is impious ev'n to name.</l>
               <l>At this, on high the Beldame holds her Hands,</l>
               <l>And trembling, both with Age, and Terrour, stands;</l>
               <l>Adjures, and falling at her Feet intreats,</l>
               <l>Sooths her with Blandishments, and frights with Threats,</l>
               <l>To tell the Crime intended, or disclose</l>
               <l>What Part of it she knew, if she no farther knows.</l>
               <l>And last; if conscious to her Counsel made,</l>
               <l>Confirms anew the Promise of her Aid.</l>
               <l>Now <hi>Myrrha</hi> rais'd her Head; but soon oppress'd</l>
               <l>With Shame, reclin'd it on her Nurses Breast;</l>
               <l>Bath'd it with Tears, and strove to have confess'd;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:58868:112"/>
Twice she began, and stopp'd; again she try'd;</l>
               <l>The falt'ring Tongue its Office still deny'd.</l>
               <l>At last her Veil before her Face she spread,</l>
               <l>And drew a long preluding Sigh, and said,</l>
               <l>O happy Mother, in thy Marriage-bed!</l>
               <l>Then groan'd, and ceas'd; the good Old Woman shook,</l>
               <l>Stiff were her Eyes, and ghastly was her Look:</l>
               <l>Her hoary Hair upright with Horrour stood,</l>
               <l>Made (to her Grief) more knowing than she wou'd:</l>
               <l>Much she reproach'd, and many Things she said,</l>
               <l>To cure the Madness of th' unhappy Maid:</l>
               <l>In vain: For <hi>Myrrha</hi> stood convict of Ill;</l>
               <l>Her Reason vanquish'd, but unchang'd her Will:</l>
               <l>Perverse of Mind, unable to reply;</l>
               <l>She stood resolv'd or to possess, or die.</l>
               <l>At length the Fondness of a Nurse prevail'd</l>
               <l>Against her better Sense, and Vertue fail'd:</l>
               <l>Enjoy, my Child, since such is thy Desire,</l>
               <l>Thy Love, she said; she durst notisay, thy Sire,</l>
               <l>Live, though unhappy, live on any Terms:</l>
               <l>Then with a second Oath her Faith confirms.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Solemn Feast of <hi>Ceres</hi> now was near,</l>
               <l>When long white Linen Stoles the Matrons wear;</l>
               <l>Rank'd in Procession walk the pious Train,</l>
               <l>Off'ring First-fruits, and Spikes of yellow Grain:</l>
               <l>For nine long Nights the Nuptial-Bed they shun,</l>

               <l>Mix'd with the Crowd, the Queen forsook her Lord,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Ceres</hi> Pow'r with secret Rites ador'd:</l>
               <l>The Royal Couch now vacant for a time,</l>
               <l>The crafty Crone, officious in her Crime,</l>
               <l>The curst Occasion took: The King she found</l>
               <l>Easie with Wine, and deep in Pleasures drown'd,</l>
               <l>Prepar'd for Love: The Beldame blew the Flame,</l>
               <l>Confess'd the Passion, but conceal'd the Name.</l>
               <l>Her Form she prais'd; the Monarch ask'd her Years,</l>
               <l>And she reply'd, The same thy <hi>Myrrha</hi> bears.</l>
               <l>Wine and commended Beauty fir'd his Thought;</l>
               <l>Impatient, he commands her to be brought.</l>
               <l>Pleas'd with her Charge perform'd, she hies, her home,</l>
               <l>And gratulates the Nymph, the Task was overcome.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Myrrha</hi> was joy'd the welcom News to hear;</l>
               <l>But clogg'd with Guilt, the Joy was unsincere:</l>
               <l>So various, so discordant is the Mind,</l>
               <l>That in our Will, a diff'rent Will we find.</l>

               <l>'Twas Depth of Night: <hi>Arctophylax</hi> had driv'n</l>

               <l>When <hi>Myrrha</hi> hasten'd to the Crime desir'd,</l>
               <l>The Moon beheld her first, and first retir'd:</l>
               <l>The Stars amaz'd, ran backward from the Sight,</l>
               <l>And (shrunk within their Sockets) lost their Light.</l>

                  <hi>Icarius</hi> first withdraws his holy Flame:</l>

Slides down the Belt, and from her Station flies,</l>
               <l>And Night with Sable Clouds involves the Skies.</l>
               <l>Bold <hi>Myrrha</hi> still pursues her black Intent;</l>
               <l>She stumbl'd thrice, (an Omen of th' Event;)</l>
               <l>Thrice shriek'd the Fun'ral Owl, yet on she went,</l>
               <l>Secure of Shame, because secure of Sight;</l>
               <l>Ev'n bashful Sins are impudent by Night.</l>
               <l>Link'd Hand in Hand, th' Accomplice, and the Dame,</l>
               <l>Their Way exploring, to the Chamber came:</l>
               <l>The Door was ope, they blindly grope their Way,</l>
               <l>Where dark in Bed th' expecting Monarch lay:</l>
               <l>Thus far her Courage held, but here forsakes;</l>
               <l>Her faint Knees knock at ev'ry Step she makes.</l>
               <l>The nearer to her Crime, the more within</l>
               <l>She feels Remorse, and Horrour of her Sin;</l>
               <l>Repents too late her criminal Desire,</l>
               <l>And wishes, that unknown she cou'd retire.</l>
               <l>Her, lingring thus, the Nurse (who fear'd Delay</l>
               <l>The fatal Secret might at length betray)</l>
               <l>Pull'd forward, to compleat the Work begun,</l>
               <l>And said to <hi>Cinyras,</hi> Receive thy own:</l>
               <l>Thus saying, she deliver'd Kind to Kind,</l>
               <l>Accurs'd, and their devoted Bodies join'd.</l>
               <l>The Sire, unknowing of the Crime, admits</l>
               <l>His Bowels, and profanes the hallow'd Sheets;</l>
               <l>He found she trembl'd, but believ'd she strove</l>
               <l>With Maiden Modesty, against her Love,</l>
               <l>And sought with flatt'ring Words vain Fancies to remove.</l>
               <l>Perhaps he said, My Daughter, cease thy Fears,</l>
               <l>(Because the Title suited with her Years;)</l>

And Father, she might whisper him agen,</l>
               <l>That Names might not be wanting to the Sin.</l>
               <l>Full of her Sire, she left th' incestuous Bed,</l>
               <l>And carry'd in her Womb the Crime she bred:</l>
               <l>Another, and another Night she came;</l>
               <l>For frequent Sin had left no Sense of Shame:</l>
               <l>Till <hi>Cinyras</hi> desir'd to see her Face,</l>
               <l>Whose Body he had held in close Embrace,</l>
               <l>And brought a Taper; the Revealer, Light,</l>
               <l>Expos'd both Crime, and Criminal to Sight:</l>
               <l>Grief, Rage, Amazement, cou'd no Speech afford,</l>
               <l>But from the Sheath he drew th' avenging Sword;</l>
               <l>The Guilty fled: The Benefit of Night,</l>
               <l>That favour'd first the Sin, secur'd the Flight.</l>
               <l>Long wandring through the spacious Fields, she bent</l>
               <l>Her Voyage to th' <hi>Arabian</hi> Continent;</l>
               <l>Then pass'd the Region which <hi>Panchaea</hi> join'd,</l>
               <l>And flying left the Palmy Plains behind.</l>
               <l>Nine times the Moon had mew'd her Horns; at length</l>
               <l>With Travel weary, unsupply'd with Strength,</l>
               <l>And with the Burden of her Womb oppress'd,</l>

                  <hi>Sabaean</hi> Fields afford her needful Rest:</l>
               <l>There, loathing Life, and yet of Death afraid,</l>
               <l>In anguish of her Spirit, thus she pray'd.</l>
               <l>Ye Pow'rs, if any so propitious are</l>
               <l>T' accept my Penitence, and hear my Pray'r;</l>
               <l>Your Judgments, I confess, are justly sent;</l>
               <l>Great Sins deserve as great a Punishment:</l>
               <l>Yet since my Life the Living will profane,</l>
               <l>And since my Death the happy Dead will stain,</l>

A middle State your Mercy may bestow,</l>
               <l>Betwixt the Realms above, and those below:</l>
               <l>Some other Form to wretched <hi>Myrrha</hi> give,</l>
               <l>Nor let her wholly die, nor wholly live.</l>
               <l>The Pray'rs of Penitents are never vain;</l>
               <l>At least, she did her last Request obtain:</l>
               <l>For while she spoke, the Ground began to rise,</l>
               <l>And gather'd round her Feet, her Leggs, and Thighs;</l>
               <l>Her Toes in Roots descend, and spreading wide,</l>
               <l>A firm Foundation for the Trunk provide:</l>
               <l>Her solid Bones convert to solid Wood,</l>
               <l>To Pith her Marrow, and to Sap her Blood:</l>
               <l>Her Arms are Boughs, her Fingers change their Kind,</l>
               <l>Her tender Skin is harden'd into Rind.</l>
               <l>And now the rising Tree her Womb invests,</l>
               <l>Now, shooting upwards still, invades her Breasts,</l>
               <l>And shades the Neck; when, weary with Delay,</l>
               <l>She sunk her Head within, and met it half the Way.</l>
               <l>And though with outward Shape she lost her Sense,</l>
               <l>With bitter Tears she wept her last Offence;</l>
               <l>And still she weeps, nor sheds her Tears in vain;</l>
               <l>For still the precious Drops her Name retain.</l>
               <l>Mean time the mis-begotten Infant grows,</l>
               <l>And, ripe for Birth, distends with deadly Throws</l>
               <l>The swelling Rind, with unavailing Strife,</l>
               <l>To leave the wooden Womb, and pushes into Life.</l>
               <l>The Mother-Tree, as if oppress'd with Pain,</l>
               <l>Writhes here and there, to break the Bark, in vain;</l>
               <l>And, like a Lab'ring Woman, wou'd have pray'd,</l>
               <l>But wants a Voice to call <hi>Lucina's</hi> Aid:</l>

The bending Bole sends out a hollow Sound,</l>
               <l>And trickling Tears fall thicker on the Ground.</l>
               <l>The mild <hi>Lucina</hi> came uncall'd, and stood</l>
               <l>Beside the struggling Boughs, and heard the groaning Wood:</l>
               <l>Then reach'd her Midwife-Hand, to speed the Throws,</l>
               <l>And spoke the pow'rful Spells that Babes to Birth disclose.</l>
               <l>The Bark divides, the living Load to free,</l>
               <l>And safe delivers the Convulsive Tree.</l>
               <l>The ready Nymphs receive the crying Child,</l>
               <l>And wash him in the Tears the Parent-Plant distill'd.</l>
               <l>They swath'd him with their Scarfs; beneath him spread</l>
               <l>The Ground with Herbs; with Roses rais'd his Head.</l>
               <l>The lovely Babe was born with ev'ry Grace,</l>
               <l>Ev'n Envy must have prais'd so fair a Face:</l>
               <l>Such was his Form, as Painters when they show</l>
               <l>Their utmost Art, on naked Loves bestow:</l>
               <l>And that their Arms no Diff'rence might betray,</l>
               <l>Give him a Bow, or his from <hi>Cupid</hi> take away.</l>
               <l>Time glides along, with undiscover'd haste,</l>
               <l>The Future but a Length behind the past;</l>
               <l>So swift are Years: The Babe whom just before</l>
               <l>His Grandsire got, and whom his Sister bore;</l>
               <l>The Drop, the Thing which late the Tree inclos'd,</l>
               <l>And late the yawning Bark to Life expos'd;</l>
               <l>A Babe, a Boy, a beauteous Youth appears,</l>
               <l>And lovelier than himself at riper Years.</l>
               <l>Now to the Queen of Love he gave Desires,</l>
               <l>And, with her Pains, reveng'd his Mother's Fires.</l>

The Priest craves Vengeance of his God; who sends a Plague among the <hi>Greeks:</hi> Which occasions <hi>Achilles,</hi> their Great Champion, to summon a Council of the Chief Officers: He encourages <hi>Calchas,</hi> the High Priest and Prophet, to tell the Reason, why the Gods were so much incens'd against them. <hi>Calchas</hi> is fearful of provoking <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> till <hi>Achilles</hi> engages to protect him: Then, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden'd by the <hi>Heroe,</hi> he accuses the General as the Cause of all, by detaining the Fair Captive, and refusing the Presents offer'd for her Ransom. By this Proceeding, <hi>Agamemnon</hi> is oblig'd, against his Will, to restore <hi>Chryseis,</hi> with Gifts, that he might appease the Wrath of <hi>Phoebus;</hi> but, at the same time, to revenge himself on <hi>Achilles,</hi> sends to seize his Slave <hi>Briseis. Achilles,</hi> thus affronted, complains to his Mother <hi>Thetis;</hi> and begs her to revenge his Injury, not only on the General, but on all the Army, by giving Victory to the <hi>Trojans,</hi> till the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful King became sensible of his Injustice. At the same time, he retires from the Camp into his Ships, and withdraws his Aid from his Country-men. <hi>Thetis</hi> prefers her Son's Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who grants her Sute. <hi>Juno</hi> suspects her Errand, and quarrels with her Husband, for his Grant; till <hi>Vulcan</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles his Parents with a Bowl of <hi>Nectar,</hi> and sends them peaceably to Bed.</p>

               <l>Now hear, as thou before my Pray'r hast heard,</l>
               <l>Against the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and their Prince, preferr'd:</l>
               <l>Once thou hast honour'd, honour once again</l>
               <l>Thy Priest; nor let his second Vows be vain.</l>
               <l>But from th' afflicted Host and humbled Prince,</l>
               <l>Avert thy Wrath, and cease thy Pestilence.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> heard, and conquering his Disdain,</l>
               <l>Unbent his Bow and <hi>Greece</hi> respir'd again.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now when the solemn Rites of Pray'r were past,</l>
               <l>Their salted Cakes on crackling Flames they cast.</l>
               <l>Then, turning back, the Sacrifice they sped:</l>
               <l>The fatted Oxen slew, and flea'd the Dead.</l>
               <l>Chop'd off their nervous Thighs, and next prepar'd</l>
               <l>T'involve the lean in Cauls, and mend with Lard.</l>
               <l>Sweet-breads and Collops, were with Skewers prick'd</l>
               <l>About the Sides; inbibing what they deck'd.</l>
               <l>The Priest with holy Hands was seen to tine</l>
               <l>The cloven Wood, and pour the ruddy Wine.</l>
               <l>The Youth approach'd the Fire and as it burn'd</l>
               <l>On five sharp Broachers rank'd, the Roast they turn'd:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:58868:128"/>
These Morsels stay'd their Stomachs; then the rest</l>
               <l>They cut in Legs and Fillets for the Feast;</l>
               <l>Which drawn and serv'd, their Hunger they appease</l>
               <l>With sav'ry Meat, and set their Minds at ease.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now when the rage of Eating was repell'd,</l>
               <l>The Boys with generous Wine the Goblets fill'd.</l>
               <l>The first Libations to the Gods they pour:</l>
               <l>And then with Songs indulge the Genial Hour.</l>
               <l>Holy Debauch! Till Day to Night they bring,</l>
               <l>With Hymns and <hi>Paeans</hi> to the Bowyer King.</l>
               <l>At Sun-set to their Ship they make return,</l>
               <l>And snore secure on Decks, till rosy Morn.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Skies with dawning Day were purpled o'er;</l>
               <l>Awak'd, with lab'ring Oars they leave the Shore:</l>
               <l>The Pow'r appeas'd, with Winds suffic'd the Sail,</l>
               <l>The bellying Canvass strutted with the Gale;</l>
               <l>The Waves indignant roar with surly Pride,</l>
               <l>And press against the Sides, and beaten off divide.</l>
               <l>They cut the foamy way, with Force impell'd</l>
               <l>Superiour, till the <hi>Trojan</hi> Port they held:</l>
               <l>Then hauling on the Strand their Gally Moor,</l>
               <l>And pitch their Tents along the crooked Shore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Mean time the Goddess-born, in secret pin'd;</l>
               <l>Nor visited the Camp, nor in the Council join'd,</l>
               <l>But keeping close, his gnawing Heart he fed</l>
               <l>With hopes of Vengeance on the Tyrant's Head:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:58868:129"/>
And wish'd sor bloody Wars and mortal Wounds,</l>
               <l>And of the <hi>Greeks</hi> oppress'd in Fight, to hear the dying Sounds.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now, when twelve Days compleat had run their Race,</l>
               <l>The Gods bethought them of the Cares belonging to their place.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Jove</hi> at their Head ascending from the Sea,</l>
               <l>A shoal of puny Pow'rs attend his way.</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Thetis</hi> not unmindful of her Son</l>
               <l>Emerging from the Deep; to beg her Boon,</l>
               <l>Pursu'd their Track; and waken'd from his rest,</l>
               <l>Before the Soveraign stood a Morning Guest.</l>
               <l>Him in the Circle but apart, she found:</l>
               <l>The rest at awful distance stood around.</l>
               <l>She bow'd, and e'er she durst her Sute begin,</l>
               <l>One Hand embrac'd his Knees, one prop'd his Chin.</l>
               <l>Then thus. If I, Celestial Sire, in aught</l>
               <l>Have serv'd thy Will, or gratify'd thy Thought,</l>
               <l>One glimpse of Glory to my Issue give;</l>
               <l>Grac'd for the little time he has to live.</l>
               <l>Dishonour'd by the King of Men he stands:</l>
               <l>His rightful Prize is ravish'd from his Hands.</l>
               <l>But thou, O Father, in my Son's Defence,</l>
               <l>Assume thy Pow'r, assert thy Providence.</l>
               <l>Let <hi>Troy</hi> prevail, till <hi>Greece</hi> th' Affront has paid,</l>
               <l>With doubled Honours; and redeem'd his Aid.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She ceas'd, but the consid'ring God was mute:</l>
               <l>'Till she resolv'd to win, renew'd her Sute:</l>
               <l>Nor loos'd her Hold, but forc'd him to reply,</l>

                  <hi>Jove</hi> cannot fear: Then tell me to my Face</l>

               <l>This I can bear: The Cloud-Compeller mourn'd,</l>
               <l>And sighing, first, this Answer he return'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Know'st thou what Clamors will disturb my Reign,</l>
               <l>What my stun'd Ears from <hi>Juno</hi> must sustain?</l>
               <l>In Council she gives Licence to her Tongue,</l>
               <l>Loquacious, Brawling, ever in the wrong.</l>
               <l>And now she will my partial Pow'r upbraid,</l>

               <l>When nodding to thy Sute, he bows the Sky.</l>

               <l>With Terror trembled Heav'ns subsiding Hill:</l>
               <l>And from his shaken Curls Ambrosial Dews distil.</l>
               <l>The Goddess goes exulting from his Sight,</l>
               <l>And seeks the Seas profound; and leaves the Realms of Light.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He moves into his Hall: The Pow'rs resort,</l>

               <l>Nor waiting Summons, nor expecting stood;</l>

               <l>He mounts the Throne; and <hi>Juno</hi> took her place:</l>
               <l>But sullen Discontent sate lowring on her Face.</l>
               <l>

With jealous Eyes, at distance she had seen,</l>
               <l>Whisp'ring with <hi>Jove</hi> the Silver-footed Queen;</l>
               <l>Then, impotent of Tongue (her Silence broke)</l>

               <l>Apart you talk'd, for that's your special care</l>
               <l>The Consort never must the Council share.</l>
               <l>One gracious Word is for a Wife too much:</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then thus the Sire of Gods, and Men below,</l>

               <l>Ev'n Goddesses are Women: And no Wife</l>

               <l>The Knowledge first, of what is fit to hear.</l>
               <l>What I transact with others, or alone,</l>

               <l>When did I search the Secrets of thy Reign,</l>
               <l>Though priviledg'd to know, but priviledg'd in vain?</l>
               <l>But well thou dost, to hide from common Sight</l>
               <l>Thy close Intrigues, too bad to bear the Light.</l>

Nor doubt I, but the Silver-footed Dame,</l>
               <l>Tripping from Sea, on such an Errand came,</l>
               <l>To grace her Issue, at the <hi>Grecians</hi> Cost,</l>

               <l>Pitying, but daring not in thy Defence,</l>

               <l>THere liv'd, as Authors tell, in Days of Yore,</l>
               <l>A Widow somewhat old, and very poor:</l>

               <l>This Dowager, on whom my Tale I found,</l>
               <l>Since last she laid her Husband in the Ground,</l>
               <l>A simple sober Life, in patience led,</l>
               <l>And had but just enough to buy her Bread:</l>
               <l>But Huswifing the little Heav'n had lent,</l>

               <l>A Yard she had with Pales enclos'd about,</l>
               <l>Some high, some low, and a dry Ditch without.</l>
               <l>Within this Homestead, liv'd without a Peer,</l>
               <l>For crowing loud, the noble Chanticleer:</l>
               <l>So hight her Cock, whose singing did surpass</l>
               <l>The merry Notes of Organs at the Mass.</l>
               <l>More certain was the crowing of a Cock</l>
               <l>To number Hours, than is an Abbey-clock;</l>
               <l>And sooner than the Mattin-Bell was rung,</l>
               <l>He clap'd his Wings upon his Roost, and sung:</l>
               <l>For when Degrees fifteen ascended right,</l>
               <l>By sure Instinct he knew 'twas One at Night.</l>
               <l>High was his Comb, and Coral-red withal,</l>
               <l>In dents embattel'd like a Castle-Wall;</l>
               <l>His Bill was Raven-black, and shon like Jet,</l>
               <l>Blue were his Legs, and Orient were his Feet:</l>
               <l>White were his Nails, like Silver to behold,</l>
               <l>His Body glitt'ring like the burnish'd Gold.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This gentle Cock for solace of his Life,</l>
               <l>Six Misses had beside his lawful Wife;</l>
               <l>Scandal that spares no King, tho' ne'er so good,</l>
               <l>Says, they were all of his own Flesh and Blood:</l>
               <l>His Sisters both by Sire, and Mother's side,</l>
               <l>And sure their likeness show'd them near ally'd.</l>
               <l>But make the worst, the Monarch did no more,</l>
               <l>Than all the <hi>Ptolomey's</hi> had done before:</l>
               <l>When Incest is for Int'rest of a Nation,</l>
               <l>'Tis made no Sin by Holy Dispensation.</l>

               <l>But passing this as from our Tale apart,</l>
               <l>Dame Partlet was the Soveraign of his Heart:</l>
               <l>Ardent in Love, outragious in his Play,</l>
               <l>He feather'd her a hundred times a Day:</l>
               <l>And she that was not only passing fair,</l>
               <l>But was withal discreet, and debonair,</l>
               <l>Resolv'd the passive Doctrin to fulfil</l>
               <l>Tho' loath: And let him work his wicked Will.</l>
               <l>At Board and Bed was affable and kind,</l>
               <l>According as their Marriage-Vow did bind,</l>
               <l>And as the Churches Precept had enjoin'd.</l>
               <l>Ev'n since she was a Sennight old, they say</l>
               <l>Was chast, and humble to her dying Day,</l>
               <l>Nor Chick nor Hen was known to disobey.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>By this her Husband's Heart she did obtain,</l>
               <l>What cannot Beauty, join'd with Virtue, gain!</l>
               <l>She was his only Joy, and he her Pride,</l>
               <l>She, when he walk'd, went pecking by his side;</l>
               <l>If spurning up the Ground, he sprung a Corn,</l>
               <l>The Tribute in his Bill to her was born.</l>
               <l>But oh! what Joy it was to hear him sing</l>
               <l>In Summer, when the Day began to spring,</l>
               <l>Stretching his Neck, and warbling in his Throat,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Solus cum Sola,</hi> then was all his Note.</l>
               <l>For in the Days of Yore, the Birds of Parts</l>
               <l>Were bred to Speak, and Sing, and learn the lib'ral Arts.</l>

               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:58868:135"/>
               <l>It happ'd that perching on the Parlor-beam</l>
               <l>Amidst his Wives he had a deadly Dream;</l>
               <l>Just at the Dawn, and sigh'd, and groan'd so fast,</l>
               <l>As ev'ry Breath he drew wou'd be his last.</l>
               <l>Dame Partlet, ever nearest to his Side,</l>
               <l>Heard all his piteous Moan, and how he cry'd</l>
               <l>For Help from Gods and Men: And sore aghast</l>
               <l>She peck'd and pull'd, and waken'd him at last.</l>
               <l>Dear Heart, said she, for Love of Heav'n declare</l>
               <l>Your Pain, and make me Partner of your Care.</l>
               <l>You groan, Sir, ever since the Morning-light,</l>
               <l>As something had disturb'd your noble Spright.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And Madam, well I might, said Chanticleer,</l>
               <l>Never was <hi>Shrovetide-Cock</hi> in such a fear.</l>
               <l>Ev'n still I run all over in a Sweat,</l>
               <l>My Princely Senses not recover'd yet.</l>
               <l>For such a Dream I had of dire Portent,</l>
               <l>That much I fear my Body will be shent:</l>
               <l>It bodes I shall have Wars and woful Strife,</l>
               <l>Or in a loathsom Dungeon end my Life.</l>
               <l>Know Dame, I dreamt within my troubled Breast,</l>
               <l>That in our Yard, I saw a murd'rous Beast,</l>
               <l>That on my Body would have made Arrest.</l>
               <l>With waking Eyes I ne'er beheld his Fellow,</l>
               <l>His Colour was betwixt a Red and Yellow:</l>
               <l>Tipp'd was his Tail, and both his pricking Ears</l>
               <l>With black; and much unlike his other Hairs:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:58868:136"/>
The rest, in shape a Beagle's Whelp throughout,</l>
               <l>With broader Forehead, and a sharper Snout:</l>
               <l>Deep in his Front were sunk his glowing Eyes,</l>
               <l>That yet methinks I see him with Surprize.</l>
               <l>Reach out your Hand, I drop with clammy Sweat,</l>
               <l>And lay it to my Heart, and feel it beat.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now fy for Shame, quoth she, by Heav'n above,</l>
               <l>Thou hast for ever lost thy Ladies Love;</l>
               <l>No Woman can endure a Recreant Knight,</l>
               <l>He must be bold by Day, and free by Night:</l>
               <l>Our Sex desires a Husband or a Friend,</l>
               <l>Who can our Honour and his own defend;</l>
               <l>Wise, Hardy, Secret, lib'ral of his Purse:</l>
               <l>A Fool is nauseous, but a Coward worse:</l>
               <l>No bragging Coxcomb, yet no baffled Knight,</l>
               <l>How dar'st thou talk of Love, and dar'st not Fight?</l>
               <l>How dar'st thou tell thy Dame thou art affer'd,</l>
               <l>Hast thou no manly Heart, and hast a Beard?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If ought from fearful Dreams may be divin'd,</l>
               <l>They signify a Cock of Dunghill-kind.</l>
               <l>All Dreams, as in old <hi>Gallen</hi> I have read,</l>
               <l>Are from Repletion and Complexion bred:</l>
               <l>From rising Fumes of indigested Food,</l>
               <l>And noxious Humors that infect the Blood:</l>
               <l>And sure, my Lord, if I can read aright,</l>
               <l>These foolish Fancies you have had to Night;</l>
               <l>Are certain Symptoms (in the canting Style)</l>
               <l>Of boiling Choler, and abounding Bile:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:58868:136"/>
This yellow Gaul that in your Stomach floats,</l>
               <l>Ingenders all these visionary Thoughts.</l>
               <l>When Choler overflows, then Dreams are bred</l>
               <l>Of Flames and all the Family of Red;</l>
               <l>Red Dragons, and red Beasts in sleep we view;</l>
               <l>For Humors are distinguish'd by their Hue.</l>
               <l>From hence we dream of Wars and Warlike Things,</l>
               <l>And Wasps and Hornets with their double Wings.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Choler adust congeals our Blood with Fear;</l>
               <l>Then black Bulls toss us, and black Devils tear.</l>
               <l>In sanguine airy Dreams aloft we bound,</l>
               <l>With Rhumes oppress'd we sink in Rivers drown'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>More I could say, but thus conclude my Theme,</l>
               <l>The dominating Humour makes the Dream.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cato</hi> was in his time accounted Wise,</l>
               <l>And he condemns them all for empty Lies.</l>
               <l>Take my Advice, and when we fly to Ground</l>
               <l>With Laxatives preserve your Body sound,</l>
               <l>And purge the peccant Humors that abound.</l>
               <l>I should be Ioath to lay you on a Bier;</l>
               <l>And though there lives no 'Pothecary near,</l>
               <l>I dare for once prescribe for your Disease,</l>
               <l>And save long Bills, and a damn'd Doctor's Fees.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Two Soveraign Herbs, which I by practise know,</l>
               <l>And both at Hand, (for in our Yard they grow;)</l>
               <l>On peril of my Soul shall rid you wholly</l>
               <l>Of yellow Choler, and of Melancholy:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:58868:137"/>
You must both Purge, and Vomit; but obey,</l>
               <l>And for the love of Heav'n make no delay.</l>
               <l>Since hot and dry in your Complexion join,</l>
               <l>Beware the Sun when in a vernal Sign;</l>
               <l>For when he mounts exalted in the Ram,</l>
               <l>If then he finds your Body in a Flame,</l>
               <l>Replete with Choler, I dare lay a Groat,</l>
               <l>A Tertian Ague is at least your Lot.</l>
               <l>Perhaps a Fever (which the Gods forefend)</l>
               <l>May bring your Youth to some untimely end.</l>
               <l>And therefore, Sir, as you desire to live,</l>
               <l>A Day or two before your Laxative,</l>
               <l>Take just three Worms, nor over nor above,</l>
               <l>Because the Gods unequal Numbers love.</l>
               <l>These Digestives prepare you for your Purge,</l>
               <l>Of Fumetery, Centaury, and Spurge,</l>
               <l>And of Ground-Ivy add a Leaf, or two,</l>
               <l>All which within our Yard or Garden grow.</l>
               <l>Eat these, and be, my Lord, of better Cheer,</l>
               <l>Your Father's Son was never born to fear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Madam, quoth he, Grammercy for your Care,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Cato,</hi> whom you quoted, you may spare:</l>
               <l>'Tis true, a wise, and worthy Man he seems,</l>
               <l>And (as you say) gave no belief to Dreams:</l>
               <l>But other Men of more Authority,</l>
               <l>And by th'Immortal Pow'rs as wise as He</l>
               <l>Maintain, with sounder Sense, that Dreams forbode;</l>
               <l>For <hi>Homer</hi> plainly says they come from God.</l>

Nor <hi>Cato</hi> said it: But some modern Fool,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Believe me, Madam, Morning Dreams foreshow</l>

               <l>An ancient Author, equal with the best,</l>
               <l>Relates this Tale of Dreams among the rest.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Two Friends, or Brothers, with devout Intent,</l>
               <l>On some far Pilgrimage together went.</l>
               <l>It happen'd so that when the Sun was down,</l>
               <l>They just arriv'd by twilight at a Town;</l>
               <l>That Day had been the baiting of a Bull,</l>
               <l>'Twas at a Feast, and ev'ry Inn so full:</l>
               <l>That no void Room in Chamber, or on Ground,</l>
               <l>And but one sorry Bed was to be found:</l>
               <l>And that so little it would hold but one,</l>
               <l>Though till this Hour they never lay alone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So were they forc'd to part; one stay'd behind,</l>
               <l>His Fellow sought what Lodging he could find:</l>
               <l>At last he found a Stall where Oxen stood,</l>
               <l>And that he rather chose than lie abroad.</l>
               <l>'Twas in a farther Yard without a Door,</l>
               <l>But for his ease, well litter'd was the Floor.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His Fellow, who the narrow Bed had kept,</l>
               <l>Was weary, and without a Rocker slept:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:58868:138"/>
Supine he snor'd; but in the dead of Night,</l>
               <l>He dreamt his Friend appear'd before his Sight,</l>
               <l>Who with a ghastly Look and doleful Cry,</l>
               <l>Said help me Brother, or this Night I die:</l>
               <l>Arise, and help, before all Help be vain,</l>
               <l>Or in an Oxes Stall I shall be slain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Rowz'd from his Rest he waken'd in a start,</l>
               <l>Shiv'ring with Horror; and with aking Heart;</l>
               <l>At length to cure himself by Reason tries;</l>
               <l>'Twas but a Dream, and what are Dreams but Lies?</l>
               <l>So thinking chang'd his Side, and clos'd his Eyes.</l>
               <l>His Dream returns; his Friend appears again,</l>
               <l>The Murd'rers come; now help, or I am slain:</l>
               <l>'Twas but a Vision still, and Visions are but vain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He dreamt the third: But now his Friend appear'd.</l>
               <l>Pale, naked, pierc'd with Wounds, with Blood besmear'd:</l>
               <l>Thrice warn'd awake, said he; Relief is late,</l>
               <l>The Deed is done; but thou revenge my Fate:</l>
               <l>Tardy of Aid, unseal thy heavy Eyes,</l>
               <l>Awake, and with the dawning Day arise:</l>
               <l>Take to the Western Gate thy ready way,</l>
               <l>For by that Passage they my Corps convey:</l>
               <l>My Corpse is in a Tumbril laid; among</l>
               <l>The Filth, and Ordure, and enclos'd with Dung.</l>
               <l>That Cart arrest, and raise a common Cry,</l>
               <l>For sacred hunger of my Gold I die;</l>
               <l>Then shew'd his grisly Wounds; and last he drew</l>
               <l>A piteous Sigh; and took a long Adieu.</l>

            <lg>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:58868:138"/>
               <l>The frighted Friend arose by break of Day,</l>
               <l>And found the Stall where late his Fellow lay.</l>
               <l>Then of his impious Host enquiring more,</l>
               <l>Was answer'd that his Guest was gone before:</l>
               <l>Muttring he went, said he, by Morning-light,</l>
               <l>And much complain'd of his ill Rest by Night.</l>
               <l>This rais'd Suspicion in the Pilgrim's Mind;</l>
               <l>Because all Hosts are of an evil Kind,</l>
               <l>And oft, to share the Spoil, with Robbers join'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His Dream confirm'd his Thought: with troubled Look</l>
               <l>Straight to the Western-Gate his way he took.</l>
               <l>There, as his Dream foretold, a Cart he found,</l>
               <l>That carry'd Composs forth to dung the Ground.</l>
               <l>This, when the Pilgrim saw, he stretch'd his Throat,</l>
               <l>And cry'd out Murther, with a yelling Note.</l>
               <l>My murther'd Fellow in this Cart lies dead,</l>
               <l>Vengeance and Justice on the Villain's Head.</l>
               <l>You, Magistrates, who sacred Laws dispense,</l>

               <l>The Word thus giv'n, within a little space,</l>

               <l>Murther may pass unpunished for a time,</l>
               <l>But tardy Justice will o'ertake the Crime.</l>
               <l>And oft a speedier Pain the Guilty feels;</l>
               <l>The Hue and Cry of Heav'n pursues him at the Heels,</l>

               <l>And in the Page that follows this; I read</l>
               <l>Of two young Merchants, whom the hope of Gain</l>
               <l>Induc'd in Partnership to cross the Main:</l>

               <l>Well pleas'd they went to Rest; and if the Gale</l>
               <l>'Till Morn continu'd, both resolv'd to fail.</l>
               <l>But as together in a Bed they lay,</l>
               <l>The younger had a Dream at break of Day.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:58868:139"/>
A Man, he thought, stood frowning at his side;</l>
               <l>Who warn'd him for his Safety to provide,</l>
               <l>Not put to Sea, but safe on Shore abide.</l>
               <l>I come, thy Genius, to command thy stay;</l>
               <l>Trust not the Winds, for fatal is the Day,</l>
               <l>And Death unhop'd attends the watry way.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Vision said: And vanish'd from his sight,</l>
               <l>The Dreamer waken'd in a mortal Fright:</l>
               <l>Then pull'd his drowzy Neighbour, and declar'd</l>
               <l>What in his Slumber he had seen, and heard.</l>
               <l>His Friend smil'd scornful, and with proud contempt</l>
               <l>Rejects as idle what his Fellow dreamt.</l>
               <l>Stay, who will stay: For me no Fears restrain,</l>
               <l>Who follow <hi>Mercury</hi> the God of Gain:</l>
               <l>Let each Man do as to his Fancy seems,</l>
               <l>I wait, not I, till you have better Dreams.</l>
               <l>Dreams are but Interludes, which Fancy makes,</l>
               <l>When Monarch-Reason sleeps, this Mimick wakes:</l>
               <l>Compounds a Medley of disjointed Things,</l>
               <l>A Mob of Coblers, and a Court of Kings:</l>
               <l>Light Fumes are merry, grosser Fumes are sad;</l>
               <l>Both are the reasonable Soul run mad:</l>
               <l>And many monstrous Forms in sleep we see,</l>
               <l>That neither were, nor are, nor e'er can be.</l>
               <l>Sometimes, forgotten Things long cast behind</l>
               <l>Rush forward in the Brain, and come to mind.</l>
               <l>The Nurses Legends are for Truths receiv'd,</l>
               <l>And the Man dreams but what the Boy believ'd.</l>

               <l>Sometimes we but rehearse a former Play,</l>
               <l>The Night restores our Actions done by Day;</l>
               <l>As Hounds in sleep will open for their Prey.</l>
               <l>In short, the Farce of Dreams is of a piece,</l>
               <l>Chimera's all; and more absurd, or less:</l>
               <l>You, who believe in Tales, abide alone,</l>
               <l>What e'er I get this Voyage is my own.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus while he spoke he heard the shouting Crew</l>
               <l>That call'd aboard, and took his last adieu.</l>
               <l>The Vessel went before a merry Gale,</l>
               <l>And for quick Passage put on ev'ry Sail:</l>
               <l>But when least fear'd, and ev'n in open Day,</l>
               <l>The Mischief overtook her in the way:</l>
               <l>Whether she sprung a Leak, I cannot find,</l>
               <l>Or whether she was overset with Wind;</l>
               <l>Or that some Rock below, her bottom rent,</l>
               <l>But down at once with all her Crew she went;</l>
               <l>Her Fellow Ships from far her Loss descry'd;</l>
               <l>But only she was sunk, and all were safe beside.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>By this Example you are taught again,</l>
               <l>That Dreams and Visions are not always vain:</l>
               <l>But if, dear Partlet, you are yet in doubt,</l>
               <l>Another Tale shall make the former out.</l>

Warn'd, in a Dream, his Murther did foretel</l>

               <l>From Treason counsell'd him to guard his Life:</l>
               <l>But close to keep the Secret in his Mind,</l>
               <l>For a Boy's Vision small Belief would find.</l>
               <l>The pious Child, by Promise bound, obey'd,</l>

               <l>Both Month, and Day, and Hour he measur'd right;</l>
               <l>And told more truly, than th'Ephemeris,</l>

               <l>How the pale Primrose, and blue Violet spring,</l>

               <l>Man strutting on two Legs, and aping me!</l>
               <l>An unfledg'd Creature, of a lumpish frame,</l>

               <l>As <hi>Tristram</hi> is, and <hi>Launcelot</hi> of the Lake:</l>
               <l>Which all our Ladies in such rev'rence hold,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A Fox full fraught with seeming Sanctity,</l>
               <l>That fear'd an Oath, but like the Devil, would lie,</l>
               <l>Who look'd like Lent; and had the holy Leer,</l>
               <l>And dust not sin before he say'd his Pray'r:</l>
               <l>This pious Cheat that never suck'd the Blood,</l>
               <l>Nor chaw'd the Flesh of Lambs but when he cou'd,</l>
               <l>Had pass'd three Summers in the neighb'ring Wood;</l>
               <l>And musing long, whom next to circumvent,</l>
               <l>On Chanticleer his wicked Fancy bent:</l>
               <l>And in his high Imagination cast,</l>
               <l>By Stratagem to gratify his Tast.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Plot contriv'd, before the break of Day,</l>

The Pale was next, but proudly with a bound</l>
               <l>He lept the Fence of the forbidden Ground:</l>
               <l>Yet fearing to be seen, within a Bed</l>
               <l>Of Colworts he conceal'd his wily Head;</l>
               <l>There sculk'd till Afternoon, and watch'd his time,</l>
               <l>(As Murd'rers use) to perpetrare his Crime.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O Hypocrite, ingenious to destroy,</l>
               <l>O Traytor, worse than <hi>Sinon</hi> was to <hi>Troy;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>O vile Subverter of the <hi>Gallick</hi> Reign,</l>

               </l>
               <l>O Chanticleer, in an unhappy Hour</l>
               <l>Did'st thou forsake the Safety of thy Bow'r:</l>
               <l>Better for Thee thou had'st believ'd thy Dream,</l>
               <l>And not that Day descended from the Beam!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But here the Doctors eagerly dispute:</l>
               <l>Some hold Predestination absolute:</l>
               <l>Some Clerks maintain that Heav'n at first foresees,</l>
               <l>And in the virtue of Foresight decrees.</l>
               <l>If this be so, then Prescience binds the Will,</l>
               <l>And Mortals are not free to Good or Ill:</l>
               <l>For what he first foresaw, he must ordain,</l>
               <l>Or its eternal Prescience may be vain:</l>
               <l>As bad for us as Prescience had not bin:</l>
               <l>For first, or last, he's Author of the Sin.</l>
               <l>And who says that, let the blaspheming Man</l>
               <l>Say worse ev'n of the Devil, if he can.</l>
               <l>For how can that Eternal Pow'r be just</l>
               <l>To punish Man, who Sins because lie must?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:58868:143"/>
Or, how can He reward a vertuous Deed,</l>
               <l>Which is not done by us; but first decreed?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I cannot boult this Matter to the Bran,</l>
               <l>As <hi>Bradwardin</hi> and holy <hi>Austin</hi> can:</l>
               <l>If Prescience can determine Actions so</l>
               <l>That we must do, because he did foreknow.</l>
               <l>Or that foreknowing, yet our choice is free,</l>
               <l>Not forc'd to Sin by strict necessity:</l>
               <l>This strict necessity they simple call,</l>
               <l>Another sort there is conditional.</l>
               <l>The first so binds the Will, that Things foreknown</l>
               <l>By Spontaneity, not Choice, are done.</l>
               <l>Thus Galley-Slaves tug willing, at their Oar,</l>
               <l>Consent to work, in prospect of the Shore;</l>
               <l>But wou'd not work at all, if not constrain'd before.</l>
               <l>That other does not Liberty constrain,</l>
               <l>But Man may either act, or may refrain.</l>
               <l>Heav'n made us Agents free to Good or Ill,</l>
               <l>And forc'd it not, tho' he foresaw the Will.</l>
               <l>Freedom was first bestow'd on human Race,</l>
               <l>And Prescience only held the second place.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If he could make such Agents wholly free,</l>
               <l>I not dispute; the Point's too high for me;</l>
               <l>For Heav'n's unfathom'd Pow'r what Man can sound,</l>
               <l>Or put to his Omnipotence a Bound?</l>
               <l>He made us to his Image all agree;</l>
               <l>That Image is the Soul, and that must be,</l>
               <l>Or not the Maker's Image, or be free.</l>

               <l>But whether it were better Man had been</l>
               <l>By Nature bound to Good, not free to Sin,</l>

               <l>The Tale I tell is only of a Cock;</l>

               <l>Pervert, with bad Advice, our better Mind.</l>
               <l>A Woman's Counsel brought us first to Woe,</l>
               <l>And made her Man his Paradice forego,</l>
               <l>Where at Heart's ease he liv'd; and might have bin</l>
               <l>As free from Sorrow as he was from Sin.</l>
               <l>For what the Devil had their Sex to do,</l>
               <l>That, born to Folly, they prefum'd to know,</l>
               <l>And could not see the Serpent in the Grass?</l>

               <l>Silence in times of Suff'ring is the best,</l>

Breast-high in Sand: Her Sisters in a row,</l>
               <l>Enjoy'd the Beams above, the Warmth below.</l>
               <l>The Cock that of his Flesh was ever free,</l>
               <l>Sung merrier than the Mermaid in the Sea:</l>
               <l>And so befel, that as he cast his Eye,</l>
               <l>Among the Colworts on a Butterfly,</l>
               <l>He saw false <hi>Reynard</hi> where he lay full low,</l>
               <l>I need not swear he had no list to Crow:</l>
               <l>But cry'd Cock, Cock, and gave a suddain start,</l>
               <l>As sore dismaid and frighted at his Heart.</l>
               <l>For Birds and Beasts, inform'd by Nature, know</l>
               <l>Kinds opposite to theirs, and fly their Foe.</l>
               <l>So, Chanticleer, who never saw a Fox,</l>

               <l>Had Orphans sung it in the neather Sphere,</l>

               <l>And thought they heard the merry Organ play.</l>
               <l>And he to raise his Voice with artful Care,</l>
               <l>(What will not Beaux attempt to please the Fair?)</l>
               <l>On Tiptoe stood to sing with greater Strength,</l>
               <l>And stretch'd his comely Neck at all the length:</l>
               <l>And while he pain'd his Voice to pierce the Skies,</l>
               <l>As Saints in Raptures use, would shut his Eyes,</l>
               <l>That the sound striving through the narrow Throat,</l>
               <l>His winking might avail, to mend the Note.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Hard, you may think it was, to give consent,</l>
               <l>But, struggling with his own Desires, he went:</l>
               <l>With large Expence, and with a pompous Train,</l>
               <l>Provided, as to visit <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or for some distant Voyage o'er the Main.</l>
               <l>But Love had clipp'd his Wings, and cut him short,</l>
               <l>Confin'd within the purlieus of his Court:</l>
               <l>Three Miles he went, nor farther could retreat;</l>
               <l>His Travels ended at his Country-Seat:</l>
               <l>To <hi>Chassis</hi> pleasing Plains he took his way,</l>
               <l>There pitch'd his Tents, and there resolv'd to stay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Spring was in the Prime; the neighb'ring Grove,</l>
               <l>Supply'd with Birds, the Choristers of Love:</l>
               <l>Musick unbought, that minister'd Delight,</l>
               <l>To Morning-walks, and lull'd his Cares by Night:</l>
               <l>There he discharg'd his Friends; but not th' Expence</l>
               <l>Of frequent Treats, and proud Magnificence.</l>
               <l>He liv'd as Kings retire, though more at large,</l>
               <l>From publick Business, yet with equal Charge;</l>
               <l>With House, and Heart still open to receive;</l>
               <l>As well content, as Love would give him leave:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:58868:152"/>
He would have liv'd more free; but many a Guest,</l>
               <l>Who could forsake the Friend, pursu'd the Feast.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>It happ'd one Morning, as his Fancy led,</l>
               <l>Before his usual Hour, he left his Bed;</l>
               <l>To walk within a lonely Lawn, that stood</l>
               <l>On ev'ry side, surrounded by the Wood:</l>
               <l>Alone he walk'd, to please his pensive Mind,</l>
               <l>And sought the deepest Solitude to find:</l>
               <l>'Twas in a Grove of spreading Pines he stray'd;</l>
               <l>The Winds, within the quiv'ring Branches plaid,</l>
               <l>And Dancing-Trees a mournful Musick made.</l>
               <l>The Place it self was suiting to his Care,</l>
               <l>Uncouth, and Salvage, as the cruel Fair.</l>
               <l>He wander'd on, unknowing where he went,</l>
               <l>Lost in the Wood, and all on Love intent:</l>
               <l>The Day already half his Race had run,</l>
               <l>And summon'd him to due Repast at Noon,</l>
               <l>But Love could feel no Hunger but his own.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While list'ning to the murm'ring Leaves he stood,</l>
               <l>More than a Mile immers'd within the Wood,</l>
               <l>At once the Wind was laid; the whisp'ring sound</l>
               <l>Was dumb; a rising Earthquake rock'd the Ground:</l>
               <l>With deeper Brown the Grove was overspred:</l>
               <l>A suddain Horror seiz'd his giddy Head,</l>
               <l>And his Ears tinckled, and his Colour fled.</l>
               <l>Nature was in alarm; some Danger nigh</l>
               <l>Seem'd threaten'd, though unseen to mortal Eye:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:58868:152"/>
Unus'd to fear, he summon'd all his Soul</l>
               <l>And stood collected in himself, and whole;</l>
               <l>Not long: For soon a Whirlwind rose around,</l>
               <l>And from afar he heard a screaming sound,</l>
               <l>As of a Dame distress'd, who cry'd for Aid,</l>
               <l>And fill'd with loud Laments the secret Shade.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A Thicket close beside the Grove there stood</l>
               <l>With Breers, and Brambles choak'd, and dwarfish Wood:</l>
               <l>From thence the Noise: Which now approaching near</l>
               <l>With more distinguish'd Notes invades his Ear:</l>
               <l>He rais'd his Head, and saw a beauteous Maid,</l>
               <l>With Hair dishevell'd, issuing through the Shade;</l>
               <l>Stripp'd of her Cloaths, and e'en those Parts reveal'd,</l>
               <l>Which modest Nature keeps from Sight conceal'd.</l>
               <l>Her Face, her Hands, her naked Limbs were torn,</l>
               <l>With passing through the Brakes, and prickly Thorn:</l>
               <l>Two Mastiffs gaunt and grim, her Flight pursu'd,</l>
               <l>And oft their fasten'd Fangs in Blood embru'd:</l>
               <l>Oft they came up and pinch'd her tender Side,</l>
               <l>Mercy, O Mercy, Heav'n, she ran, and cry'd;</l>
               <l>When Heav'n was nam'd they loos'd their Hold again,</l>
               <l>Then sprung she forth, they follow'd her amain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Not far behind, a Knight of swarthy Face,</l>
               <l>High on a Coal-black Steed pursu'd the Chace;</l>
               <l>With flashing Flames his ardent Eyes were fill'd,</l>
               <l>And in his Hands a naked Sword he held:</l>
               <l>He chear'd the Dogs to follow her who fled,</l>
               <l>And vow'd Revenge on her devoted Head.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:58868:153"/>
               <l>As <hi>Theodore</hi> was born of noble Kind,</l>
               <l>The brutal Action rowz'd his manly Mind:</l>
               <l>Mov'd with unworthy Usage of the Maid,</l>
               <l>He, though unarm'd, resolv'd to give her Aid.</l>
               <l>A Saplin Pine he wrench'd from out the Ground,</l>
               <l>The readiest Weapon that his Fury found.</l>
               <l>Thus furnish'd for Offence, he cross'd the way</l>
               <l>Betwixt the graceless Villain, and his Prey.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Knight came thund'ring on, but from afar</l>
               <l>Thus in imperious Tone forbad the War:</l>
               <l>Cease, <hi>Theodore,</hi> to proffer vain Relief,</l>
               <l>Nor stop the vengeance of so just a Grief;</l>
               <l>But give me leave to seize my destin'd Prey,</l>
               <l>And let eternal Justice take the way:</l>
               <l>I but revenge my Fate; disdain'd, betray'd,</l>
               <l>And suff'ring Death for this ungrateful Maid.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He say'd; at once dismounting from the Steed;</l>
               <l>For now the Hell-hounds with superiour Speed</l>
               <l>Had reach'd the Dame, and fast'ning on her Side,</l>
               <l>The Ground with issuing Streams of Purple dy'd.</l>
               <l>Stood <hi>Theodore</hi> surpriz'd in deadly Fright,</l>
               <l>With chatt'ring Teeth and bristling Hair upright;</l>
               <l>Yet arm'd with inborn Worth, What e'er, said he,</l>
               <l>Thou art, who know'st me better than I thee;</l>
               <l>Or prove thy rightful Cause, or be defy'd:</l>
               <l>The Spectre, fiercely staring, thus reply'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>Know, <hi>Theodore,</hi> thy Ancestry I claim,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Guido Cavalcanti</hi> was my Name.</l>
               <l>One common Sire our Fathers did beget,</l>
               <l>My Name and Story some remember yet:</l>
               <l>Thee, then a Boy, within my Arms I laid,</l>
               <l>When for my Sins I lov'd this haughty Maid;</l>
               <l>Not less ador'd in Life, nor serv'd by Me,</l>
               <l>Than proud <hi>Honoria</hi> now is lov'd by Thee.</l>
               <l>What did I not her stubborn Heart to gain?</l>
               <l>But all my Vows were answer'd with Disdain;</l>
               <l>She scorn'd my Sorrows, and despis'd my Pain.</l>
               <l>Long time I dragg'd my Days in fruitless Care,</l>
               <l>Then loathing Life, and plung'd in deep Despair,</l>
               <l>To finish my unhappy Life, I fell</l>
               <l>On this sharp Sword, and now am damn'd in Hell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Short was her Joy; for soon th' insulting Maid</l>
               <l>By Heav'n's Decree in the cold Grave was laid,</l>
               <l>And as in unrepenting Sin she dy'd,</l>
               <l>Doom'd to the same bad Place, is punish'd for her Pride;</l>
               <l>Because she deem'd I well deserv'd to die,</l>
               <l>And made a Merit of her Cruelty.</l>
               <l>There, then, we met; both try'd and both were cast,</l>
               <l>And this irrevocable Sentence pass'd;</l>
               <l>That she whom I so long pursu'd in vain,</l>
               <l>Should suffer from my Hands a lingring Pain:</l>
               <l>Renew'd to Life, that she might daily die,</l>
               <l>I daily doom'd to follow, she to fly;</l>

No more a Lover but a mortal Foe,</l>
               <l>I seek her Life (for Love is none below:)</l>
               <l>As often as my Dogs with better speed</l>
               <l>Arrest her Flight, is she to Death decreed.</l>
               <l>Then with this fatal Sword on which I dy'd,</l>
               <l>I pierce her open'd Back or tender Side,</l>
               <l>And tear that harden'd Heart from out her Breast,</l>
               <l>Which, with her Entrails, makes my hungry Hounds a Feast.</l>
               <l>Nor lies she long, but as her Fates ordain,</l>
               <l>Springs up to Life, and fresh to second Pain,</l>
               <l>Is sav'd to Day, to Morrow to be slain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This, vers'd in Death, th' infernal Knight relates,</l>
               <l>And then for Proof fulfill'd their common Fates;</l>
               <l>Her Heart and Bowels through her Back he drew,</l>
               <l>And fed the Hounds that help'd him to pursue.</l>
               <l>Stern'd look'd the Fiend, as frustrate of his Will</l>
               <l>Not half suffic'd, and greedy yet to kill.</l>
               <l>And now the Soul expiring through the Wound,</l>
               <l>Had left the Body breathless on the Ground,</l>
               <l>When thus the grisly Spectre spoke again:</l>
               <l>Behold the Fruit of ill-rewarded Pain:</l>
               <l>As many Months as I sustain'd her Hate,</l>
               <l>So many Years is she condemn'd by Fate</l>
               <l>To daily Death; and ev'ry several Place,</l>
               <l>Conscious of her Disdain, and my Disgrace,</l>
               <l>Must witness her just Punishment; and be</l>
               <l>A Scene of Triumph and Revenge to me.</l>
               <l>As in this Grove I took my last Farewel,</l>
               <l>As on this very spot of Earth I fell,</l>

As <hi>Friday</hi> saw me die, so she my Prey</l>
               <l>Becomes ev'n here, on this revolving Day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus while he spoke, the Virgin from the Ground</l>
               <l>Upstarted fresh, already clos'd the Wound,</l>
               <l>And unconcern'd for all she felt before</l>
               <l>Precipitates her Flight along the Shore:</l>
               <l>The Hell-hounds, as ungorg'd with Flesh and Blood</l>
               <l>Pursue their Prey, and seek their wonted Food:</l>
               <l>The Fiend remounts his Courser; mends his Pace,</l>
               <l>And all the Vision vanish'd from the Place.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Long stood the noble Youth oppress'd with Awe,</l>
               <l>And stupid at the wond'rous Things he saw</l>
               <l>Surpassing common Faith; transgressing Nature's Law.</l>
               <l>He would have been asleep, and wish'd to wake,</l>
               <l>But Dreams, he knew, no long Impression make,</l>
               <l>Though strong at first: If Vision, to what end,</l>
               <l>But such as must his future State portend?</l>
               <l>His Love the Damsel, and himself the Fiend.</l>
               <l>But yet reflecting that it could not be</l>
               <l>From Heav'n, which cannot impious Acts decree,</l>
               <l>Resolv'd within himself to shun the Snare</l>
               <l>Which Hell for his Distruction did prepare;</l>
               <l>And as his better Genius should direct</l>

But of his Train a trusty Servant sent;</l>
               <l>To call his Friends together at his Tent.</l>
               <l>They came, and usual Salutations paid,</l>
               <l>With Words premeditated thus he said:</l>
               <l>What you have often counsell'd, to remove</l>
               <l>My vain pursuit of unreguarded Love;</l>
               <l>By Thrift my sinking Fortune to repair,</l>
               <l>Tho' late, yet is at last become my Care:</l>
               <l>My Heart shall be my own; my vast Expence</l>
               <l>Reduc'd to bounds, by timely Providence:</l>
               <l>This only I require; invite for me</l>

                  <hi>Honoria,</hi> with her Father's Family,</l>
               <l>Her Friends, and mine; the Cause I shall display,</l>
               <l>On <hi>Friday</hi> next, for that's th'appointed Day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Well pleas'd were all his Friends, the Task was light;</l>
               <l>The Father, Mother, Daughter, they invite;</l>
               <l>Hardly the Dame was drawn to this repast;</l>

               <l>A Feast prepar'd with riotons Expence,</l>
               <l>Much Cost, more Care, and most Magnificence.</l>
               <l>The Place ordain'd was in that haunted Grove,</l>
               <l>Where the revenging Ghost pursu'd his Love:</l>
               <l>The Tables in a proud Pavilion spred,</l>
               <l>With Flow'rs below, and Tissue overhead:</l>

The Feast was serv'd; the time so well forecast,</l>
               <l>That just when the Dessert, and Fruits were plac'd,</l>

               <l>Of one distress'd, and Mastiffs mingled Cries;</l>
               <l>And first the Dame came rushing through the Wood,</l>
               <l>And next the famish'd Hounds that sought their Food</l>
               <l>And grip'd her Flanks, and oft essay'd their Jaws in Blood:</l>
               <l>Last came the Fellon on the Sable Steed,</l>
               <l>Arm'd with his naked Sword, and urg'd his Dogs to speed:</l>
               <l>She ran, and cry'd; her Flight directly bent,</l>
               <l>(A Guest unbidden) to the fatal Tent,</l>
               <l>The Scene of Death, and Place ordain'd for Punishment.</l>
               <l>Loud was the Noise, aghast was every Guest,</l>
               <l>The Women shriek'd, the Men forsook the Feast;</l>
               <l>The Hounds at nearer distance hoarsly bay'd;</l>
               <l>The Hunter clos'd pursu'd the visionary Maid,</l>
               <l>She rent the Heav'n with loud Laments, imploring Aid.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>The Gallants to protect the Ladies right,</l>
               <l>Their Fauchions brandish'd at the grisly Spright;</l>
               <l>High on his Stirups, he provok'd the Fight.</l>
               <l>Then on the Crowd he cast a furious Look,</l>
               <l>And wither'd all their Strength before he strook:</l>
               <l>Back on your Lives; let be, said he, my Prey,</l>
               <l>And let my Vengeance take the destin'd way.</l>

Vain are your Arms, and vainer your Defence,</l>
               <l>Against th' eternal Doom of Providence:</l>
               <l>Mine is th' ungrateful Maid by Heav'n design'd:</l>
               <l>Mercy she would hot give, nor Mercy shall she find.</l>
               <l>At this the former Tale again he told</l>
               <l>With thund'ring Tone, and dreadful to behold:</l>
               <l>Sunk were their Hearts with Horror of the Crime,</l>
               <l>Nor needed to be warn'd a second time,</l>
               <l>But bore each other back; some knew the Face,</l>
               <l>And all had heard the much lamented Case,</l>
               <l>Of him who fell for Love, and this the fatal Place.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And now th' infernal Minister advanc'd,</l>
               <l>Seiz'd the due Victim, and with Fury lanch'd</l>
               <l>Her Back, and piercing through her inmost Heart,</l>
               <l>Drew backward, as before, th' offending part.</l>
               <l>The reeking Entrails next he tore away,</l>
               <l>And to his meagre Mastiffs made a Prey:</l>
               <l>The pale Assistants, on each other star'd</l>
               <l>With gaping Mouths for issuing Words prepar'd;</l>
               <l>The still born founds upon the Palate hung,</l>
               <l>And dy'd imperfect on the faltring Tongue.</l>
               <l>The Fright was general; but the Female Band</l>
               <l>(A helpless Train) in more Confusion stand;</l>
               <l>With Horror shuddring, on a heap they run,</l>
               <l>Sick at the sight of hateful Justice done;</l>
               <l>For Conscience rung th' Alarm, and made the Case their own.</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But most the proud <hi>Honoria</hi> fear'd th' event,</l>
               <l>And thought to her alone the Vision sent.</l>
               <l>Her Guilt presents to her distracted Mind</l>
               <l>Heav'ns Justice, <hi>Theodore's</hi> revengeful Kind,</l>
               <l>And the same Fate to the same Sin assign'd;</l>
               <l>Already sees her self the Monster's Prey,</l>

               <l>The Knight, and hungry Mastiffs stood around,</l>
               <l>The mangled Dame lay breathless on the Ground:</l>
               <l>When on a suddain reinspired with Breath,</l>
               <l>Again she rose, again to suffer Death;</l>
               <l>Nor stay'd the Hell-hounds, nor the Hunter stay'd,</l>
               <l>But follow'd, as before, the flying Maid:</l>
               <l>Th' Avenger took from Earth th' avenging Sword,</l>
               <l>And mounting light as Air, his Sable Steed he spurr'd:</l>
               <l>The Clouds dispell'd, the Sky resum'd her Light,</l>
               <l>And Nature stood recover'd of her Fright.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But Fear, the last of Ills, remain'd behind,</l>

She thought her self the trembling Dame who fled,</l>
               <l>And him the grisly Ghost that spurr'd th' infernal Steed:</l>
               <l>The more dismay'd, for when the Guests withdrew</l>
               <l>Their courteous Host saluting all the Crew,</l>
               <l>Regardless pass'd her o'er; nor grac'd with kind adieu.</l>
               <l>That Sting infix'd within her haughty Mind,</l>
               <l>The downfal of her Empire she divin'd;</l>
               <l>And her proud Heart with secret Sorrow pin'd.</l>
               <l>Home as they went, the sad Discourse renew'd</l>
               <l>Of the relentless Dame to Death pursu'd,</l>
               <l>And of the Sight obscene so lately view'd.</l>
               <l>None durst arraign the righteous Doom she bore,</l>
               <l>Ev'n they who pity'd most yet blam'd her more:</l>
               <l>The Parallel they needed not to name,</l>
               <l>But in the Dead they damn'd the living Dame.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At ev'ry little Noise she look'd behind,</l>
               <l>For still the Knight was present to her Mind:</l>
               <l>And anxious oft she started on the way,</l>
               <l>And thought the Horseman-Ghost came thundring for his Prey.</l>
               <l>Return'd, she took her Bed, with little Rest,</l>
               <l>But in short Slumbers dreamt the Funeral Feast:</l>
               <l>Awak'd, she turn'd her Side; and slept again,</l>
               <l>The same black Vapors mounted in her Brain,</l>
               <l>And the same Dreams return'd with double Pain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now forc'd to wake because afraid to sleep</l>
               <l>Her Blood all Fever'd, with a furious Leap</l>
               <l>She sprung from Bed, distracted in her Mind,</l>
               <l>And fear'd, at ev'ry Step, a twitching Spright behind.</l>

Darkling and desp'rate with a stagg'ring pace,</l>
               <l>Of Death afraid, and conscious of Disgrace;</l>
               <l>Fear, Pride, Remorse, at once her Heart assail'd,</l>
               <l>Pride put Remorse to flight, but Fear prevail'd.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Friday,</hi> the fatal Day, when next it came,</l>
               <l>Her Soul forethought the Fiend would change his Game,</l>
               <l>And her pursue, or <hi>Theodore</hi> be slain,</l>
               <l>And two Ghosts join their Packs to hunt her o'er the Plain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This dreadful Image so possess'd her Mind,</l>
               <l>That desp'rate any Succour else to find,</l>
               <l>She ceas'd all farther hope; and now began</l>
               <l>To make reflection on th' unhappy Man.</l>
               <l>Rich, Brave, and Young, who past expression lov'd,</l>
               <l>Proof to Disdain; and not to be remov'd:</l>
               <l>Of all the Men respected, and admir'd,</l>
               <l>Of all the Dames, except her self, desir'd.</l>
               <l>Why not of her? Preferr'd above the rest</l>
               <l>By him with Knightly Deeds, and open Love profess'd?</l>
               <l>So had another been; where he his Vows address'd.</l>
               <l>This quell'd her Pride, yet other Doubts remain'd,</l>
               <l>That once disdaining she might be disdain'd:</l>
               <l>The Fear was just, but greater Fear prevail'd,</l>
               <l>Fear of her Life by hellish Hounds assail'd:</l>
               <l>He took a low'ring leave; but who can tell,</l>
               <l>What outward Hate, might inward Love conceal?</l>
               <l>Her Sexes Arts she knew, and why not then,</l>
               <l>Might deep dissembling have a place in Men?</l>
               <l>Here Hope began to dawn; resolv'd to try,</l>
               <l>She fix'd on this her utmost Remedy;</l>
               <l>Death was behind, but hard it was to die.</l>

Twas time enough at last on Death to call,</l>
               <l>The Precipice in sight: A Shrub was all,</l>

               <l>She with no winding turns the Truth conceal'd,</l>

               <l>THESE Prodigies afflict the pious Prince,</l>

Her faded Cheeks are chang'd to Boxen Hue,</l>
               <l>And in her Eyes the Tears are ever new:</l>
               <l>She thrice assay'd to Speak; her Accents hung</l>
               <l>And faltring dy'd unfinish'd on her Tongue,</l>
               <l>Or vanish'd into Sighs: With long delay</l>

               <l>Can <hi>Ceyx</hi> then sustain to leave his Wife,</l>
               <l>And unconcern'd forsake the Sweets of Life?</l>
               <l>What can thy Mind to this long Journey move,</l>

               <l>Yet, if thou go'st by Land, tho' Grief possess</l>
               <l>My Soul ev'n then, my Fears will be the less.</l>

               <l>The Face is frightful of the stormy Sea.</l>
               <l>For late I saw a-drift disjointed Planks,</l>

               <l>Nor let false Hopes to trust betray thy Mind,</l>

               <l>They fear his Whistle, and forsake the Seas;</l>
               <l>Not so, for once indulg'd, they sweep the Main;</l>
               <l>Deaf to the Call, or hearing hear in vain;</l>
               <l>But bent on Mischief bear the Waves before,</l>
               <l>And not content with Seas insult the Shoar,</l>

At once the clashing Clouds to Battle move,</l>

               <l>Then o'er the bounding Billows shall we fly,</l>
               <l>Secure to live together, or to die.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>These Reasons mov'd her starlike Husband's Heart,</l>
               <l>But still he held his Purpose to depart:</l>
               <l>For as he lov'd her equal to his Life,</l>
               <l>He wou'd not to the Seas expose his Wife;</l>
               <l>Nor cou'd be wrought his Voyage to refrain,</l>
               <l>But sought by Arguments to sooth her Pain:</l>
               <l>Nor these avail'd; at length he lights on one,</l>
               <l>With which, so difficult a Cause he won:</l>
               <l>My Love, so short an absence cease to fear,</l>
               <l>For by my Father's holy Flame, I swear,</l>
               <l>Before two Moons their Orb with Light adorn,</l>
               <l>If Heav'n allow me Life, I will return.</l>

               <l>This Promise of so short a stay prevails;</l>
               <l>He soon equips the Ship, supplies the Sails,</l>
               <l>And gives the Word to launch; she trembling views</l>
               <l>This pomp of Death, and parting Tears renews:</l>
               <l>Last with a Kiss, she took a long farewel,</l>
               <l>Sigh'd, with a sad Presage, and swooning fell:</l>
               <l>While <hi>Ceyx</hi> seeks Delays, the lusty Crew</l>
               <l>Rais'd on their Banks their Oars in order drew,</l>
               <l>To their broad Breasts, the Ship with fury flew.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Queen recover'd rears her humid Eyes,</l>
               <l>And first her Husband on the Poop espies</l>
               <l>Shaking his Hand at distance on the Main;</l>
               <l>She took the Sign; and shook her Hand again.</l>
               <l>Still as the Ground recedes, contracts her View</l>
               <l>With sharpen'd Sight, till she no longer knew</l>
               <l>The much-lov'd Face; that Comfort lost supplies</l>
               <l>With less, and with the Galley feeds her Eyes;</l>
               <l>The Galley born from view by rising Gales</l>
               <l>She follow'd with her Sight the flying Sails:</l>
               <l>When ev'n the flying Sails were seen no more</l>
               <l>Forsaken of all Sight, she left the Shoar.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then on her Bridal-Bed her Body throws,</l>
               <l>And sought in sleep her weary'd Eyes to close:</l>
               <l>Her Husband's Pillow, and the Widow'd part</l>
               <l>Which once he press'd, renew'd the former Smart.</l>

               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:58868:160"/>
               <l>And now a Breeze from Shoar began to blow,</l>
               <l>The Sailors ship their Oars, and cease to row;</l>
               <l>Then hoist their Yards a-trip, and all their Sails</l>
               <l>Let fall, to court the Wind, and catch the Gales:</l>
               <l>By this the Vessel half her Course had run,</l>
               <l>And as much rested till the rising Sun;</l>
               <l>Both Shores were lost to Sight, when at the close</l>
               <l>Of Day, a stiffer Gale at East arose:</l>
               <l>The Sea grew White, the rowling Waves from far</l>
               <l>Like Heralds first denounce, the Wat'ry War.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This seen, the Master soon began to cry,</l>
               <l>Strike, strike the Top-sail; let the Main-sheet fly,</l>
               <l>And furl your Sails: The Winds repel the sound,</l>
               <l>And in the Speaker's Mouth the Speech is drown'd.</l>
               <l>Yet of their own accord, as Danger taught</l>
               <l>Each in his way, officiously they wrought;</l>
               <l>Some stow their Oars, or stop the leaky Sides,</l>
               <l>Another bolder yet the Yard bestrides,</l>
               <l>And folds the Sails; a fourth with Labour, laves,</l>
               <l>Th' intruding Seas, and Waves ejects on Waves.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In this Confusion while their Work they ply,</l>
               <l>The Winds augment the Winter of the Sky,</l>
               <l>And wage intestine Wars; the suff'ring Seas</l>
               <l>Are toss'd, and mingled as their Tyrants please.</l>
               <l>The Master wou'd command, but in despair</l>
               <l>Of Safety, stands amaz'd with stupid Care,</l>

Nor what to bid, or what forbid he knows,</l>
               <l>Th' ungovern'd Tempest to such Fury grows:</l>
               <l>Vain is his Force, and vainer is his Skill;</l>
               <l>With such a Concourse comes the Flood of Ill:</l>
               <l>The Cries of Men are mix'd with rattling Shrowds;</l>
               <l>Seas dash on Seas, and Clouds encounter Clouds:</l>
               <l>At once from East to West, from Pole to Pole,</l>
               <l>The forky Lightnings flash, the roaring Thunders roul.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now Waves on Waves ascending scale the Skies,</l>
               <l>And in the Fires above, the Water fries:</l>
               <l>When yellow Sands are sifted from below,</l>
               <l>The glitt'ring Billows give a golden Show:</l>
               <l>And when the fouler bottom spews the Black,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Stygian</hi> Dye the tainted Waters take:</l>
               <l>Then frothy White appear the flatted Seas,</l>
               <l>And change their Colour, changing their Disease.</l>
               <l>Like various Fits the <hi>Trachin</hi> Vessel finds,</l>
               <l>And now sublime, she rides upon the Winds;</l>
               <l>As from a lofty Summet looks from high,</l>
               <l>And from the Clouds beholds the neather Sky;</l>
               <l>Now from the depth of Hell they lift their Sight,</l>
               <l>And at a distance see superiour Light:</l>
               <l>The lashing Billows make a loud report</l>
               <l>And beat her Sides, as batt'ring Rams, a Fort:</l>
               <l>Or as a Lyon, bounding in his way</l>
               <l>With Force augmented bears against his Prey;</l>
               <l>Sidelong to seize; or unappal'd with fear</l>

So Seas impell'd by Winds with added Pow'r</l>

               <l>The roaring Waters with a hostile Tide</l>
               <l>Rush through the Ruins of her gaping Side.</l>
               <l>Mean time in Sheets of Rain the Sky descends,</l>
               <l>And Ocean swell'd with Waters upwards tends,</l>
               <l>One rising, falling one, the Heav'ns, and Sea</l>
               <l>Meet at their Confines, in the middle Way:</l>
               <l>The Sails are drunk with Show'rs, and drop with Rain,</l>
               <l>Sweet Waters mingle with the briny Main.</l>
               <l>No Star appears to lend his friendly Light:</l>
               <l>Darkness and Tempest make a double Night.</l>
               <l>But flashing Fires disclose the Deep by turns,</l>
               <l>And while the Light'nings blaze, the Water burns.</l>

               <l>Now all the Waves, their scatter'd Force unite,</l>
               <l>And as a Soldier, foremost in the Fight</l>
               <l>Makes way for others: And an Host alone</l>
               <l>Still presses on, and urging gains the Town;</l>

               <l>But both obnoxious to their former Fate.</l>
               <l>Their conjugal Affection still is ty'd,</l>
               <l>And still the mournful Race is multiply'd:</l>
               <l>They bill, they tread; <hi>Alcyone</hi> compress'd</l>
               <l>Sev'n Days sits brooding on her floating Nest:</l>
               <l>A wintry Queen: Her Sire at length is kind,</l>
               <l>Calms ev'ry Storm, and hushes ev'ry Wind;</l>
               <l>Prepares his Empire for his Daughter's Ease,</l>
               <l>And for his hatching Nephews smooths the Seas.</l>

               <l>His Course exalted through the Ram had run:</l>
               <l>And whirling up the Skies, his Chariot drove</l>

            <lg>
               <l>In that sweet Season, as in Bed I lay,</l>
               <l>And sought in Sleep to pass the Night away,</l>
               <l>I turn'd my weary Side, but still in vain,</l>
               <l>Tho' full of youthful Health, and void of Pain:</l>
               <l>Cares I had none, to keep me from my Rest,</l>
               <l>For Love had never enter'd in my Breast;</l>
               <l>I wanted nothing Fortune could supply,</l>
               <l>Nor did she Slumber till that hour deny:</l>
               <l>I wonder'd then, but after found it true,</l>
               <l>Much Joy had dry'd away the balmy Dew:</l>
               <l>Sea's wou'd be Pools, without the brushing Air,</l>
               <l>To curl the Waves; and sure some little Care</l>
               <l>Shou'd weary Nature so, to make her want repair.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When Chaunticleer the second Watch had sung,</l>
               <l>Scorning the Scorner Sleep from Bed I sprung.</l>
               <l>And dressing, by the Moon, in loose Array,</l>
               <l>Pass'd out in open Air, preventing Day,</l>

Strait as a Line in beauteous Order stood</l>
               <l>Of Oaks unshorn a venerable Wood;</l>
               <l>Fresh was the Grass beneath, and ev'ry Tree</l>
               <l>At distance planted in a due degree,</l>
               <l>Their branching Arms in Air with equal space</l>
               <l>Stretch'd to their Neighbours with a long Embrace:</l>
               <l>And the new Leaves on ev'ry Bough were seen,</l>
               <l>Some ruddy-colour'd, some of lighter green.</l>
               <l>The painted Birds, Companions of the Spring,</l>
               <l>Hopping from Spray to Spray, were heard to sing;</l>
               <l>Both Eyes and Ears receiv'd a like Delight,</l>
               <l>Enchanting Musick, and a charming Sight.</l>
               <l>On <hi>Philomel</hi> I fix'd my whole Desire;</l>

               <l>Fain would I hear her heav'nly Voice to sing;</l>
               <l>And wanted yet an Omen to the Spring.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Attending long in vain; I took the way,</l>
               <l>Which through a Path, but scarcely printed, lay;</l>
               <l>In narrow Mazes oft it seem'd to meet,</l>
               <l>And look'd, as lightly press'd, by Fairy Feet.</l>
               <l>Wandring I walk'd alone, for still methought</l>
               <l>To some strange End so strange a Path was wrought:</l>
               <l>At last it led me where an Arbour stood,</l>
               <l>The sacred Receptacle of the Wood:</l>
               <l>This Place unmark'd though oft I walk'd the Green,</l>
               <l>In all my Progress I had never seen:</l>
               <l>And seiz'd at once with Wonder and Delight,</l>
               <l>Gaz'd all arround me, new to the transporting Sight.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:58868:171"/>
'Twas bench'd with Turf, and goodly to be seen,</l>
               <l>The thick young Grass arose in fresher Green:</l>
               <l>The Mound was newly made, no Sight cou'd pass</l>
               <l>Betwixt the nice Partitions of the Grass;</l>
               <l>The well-united Sods so closely lay;</l>
               <l>And all arround the Shades defended it from Day.</l>
               <l>For Sycamours with Eglantine were spread,</l>
               <l>A Hedge about the Sides, a Covering over Head.</l>
               <l>And so the fragrant Brier was wove between,</l>
               <l>The Sycamour and Flow'rs were mix'd with Green.</l>
               <l>That Nature seem'd to vary the Delight;</l>
               <l>And satisfy'd at once the Smell and Sight.</l>
               <l>The Master Work-man of the Bow'r was known</l>
               <l>Through Fairy-Lands, and built for <hi>Oberon;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who twining Leaves with such Proportion drew,</l>
               <l>They rose by Measure, and by Rule they grew:</l>
               <l>No mortal Tongue can half the Beauty tell;</l>
               <l>For none but Hands divine could work so well.</l>
               <l>Both Roof and Sides were like a Parlour made,</l>
               <l>A soft Recess, and a cool Summer shade;</l>
               <l>The Hedge was set so thick, no Foreign Eye</l>
               <l>The Persons plac'd within it could espy:</l>
               <l>But all that pass'd without with Ease was seen,</l>
               <l>As if nor Fence nor Tree was plac'd between.</l>
               <l>'Twas border'd with a Field; and some was plain</l>
               <l>With Grass; and some was sow'd with rising Grain.</l>
               <l>That (now the Dew with Spangles deck'd the Ground:)</l>
               <l>A sweeter spot of Earth was never found.</l>
               <l>I look'd, and look'd, and still with new Delight;</l>
               <l>Such Joy my Soul, such Pleasures fill'd my Sight:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:58868:171"/>
And the fresh Eglantine exhal'd a Breath;</l>
               <l>Whose Odours were of Pow'r to raise from Death:</l>
               <l>Nor sullen Discontent, nor anxious Care,</l>
               <l>Ev'n tho' brought thither, could inhabit there:</l>
               <l>But thence they fled as from their mortal Foe;</l>
               <l>For this sweet Place cou'd only Pleasure know.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus, as I mus'd, I cast aside my Eye</l>
               <l>And saw a Medlar-Tree was planted nigh;</l>
               <l>The spreading Branches made a goodly Show,</l>
               <l>And full of opening Blooms was ev'ry Bough:</l>
               <l>A Goldfinch there I saw with gawdy Pride</l>
               <l>Of painted Plumes, that hopp'd from side to side,</l>
               <l>Still pecking as she pass'd; and still she drew</l>
               <l>The Sweets from ev'ry Flow'r, and suck'd the Dew:</l>
               <l>Suffic'd at length, she warbled in her Throat,</l>
               <l>And tun'd her Voice to many a merry Note,</l>
               <l>But indistinct, and neither Sweet nor Clear,</l>
               <l>Yet such as sooth'd my Soul, and pleas'd my Ear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Her short Performance was no sooner try'd,</l>
               <l>When she I sought, the Nightingale reply'd:</l>
               <l>So sweet, so shrill, so variously she sung,</l>
               <l>That the Grove eccho'd, and the Valleys rung:</l>
               <l>And I so ravish'd with her heav'nly Note</l>
               <l>I stood intranc'd, and had. no room for Thought.</l>
               <l>But all o'er-pou'r'd with Extasy of Bliss,</l>
               <l>Was in a pleasing Dream of Paradice;</l>
               <l>At length I wak'd; and looking round the Bow'r</l>
               <l>Search'd ev'ry Tree, and pry'd on ev'ry Flow'r,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:58868:172"/>
If any where by chance I might espy</l>
               <l>The rural Poet of the Melody:</l>
               <l>For still methought she sung not far away;</l>
               <l>At last I found her on a Lawrel Spray,</l>
               <l>Close by my Side she sate, and fair in Sight,</l>
               <l>Full in a Line, against her opposite;</l>
               <l>Where stood with Eglantine the Lawrel twin'd:</l>
               <l>And both their native Sweets were well conjoin'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>On the green Bank I sat, and listen'd long;</l>
               <l>(Sitting was more convenient for the Song!)</l>
               <l>Nor till her Lay was ended could I move,</l>
               <l>But wish'd to dwell for ever in the Grove.</l>
               <l>Only methought the time too swiftly pass'd,</l>
               <l>And ev'ry Note I fear'd wou'd be the last.</l>
               <l>My Sight, and Smell, and Hearing were employ'd,</l>
               <l>And all three Senses in full Gust enjoy'd.</l>
               <l>And what alone did all the rest surpass,</l>
               <l>The sweet Possession of the Fairy Place;</l>
               <l>Single, and conscious to my Self alone,</l>
               <l>Of Pleasures to th' excluded World unknown.</l>
               <l>Pleasures which no where else, were to be found,</l>
               <l>And all <hi>Elysium</hi> in a spot of Ground.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus while I sat intent to see and hear,</l>
               <l>And drew Perfumes of more than vital Air,</l>
               <l>All suddenly I heard th'approaching sound</l>
               <l>Of vocal Musick, on th'enchanted Ground:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:58868:172"/>
An Host of Saints it seem'd, so full the Quire;</l>
               <l>As if the Bless'd above did all conspire,</l>
               <l>To join their Voices, and neglect the Lyre.</l>
               <l>At length there issu'd from the Grove behind</l>
               <l>A fair Assembly of the Female Kind:</l>
               <l>A Train less fair, as ancient Fathers tell,</l>
               <l>Seduc'd the Sons of Heaven to rebel.</l>
               <l>I pass their Forms, and ev'ry charming Grace,</l>
               <l>Less than an Angel wou'd their Worth debase:</l>
               <l>But their Attire like Liveries of a kind,</l>
               <l>All rich and rare is fresh within my Mind.</l>
               <l>In Velvet white as Snow the Troop was gown'd,</l>
               <l>The Seams with sparkling Emeralds, set around;</l>
               <l>Their Hoods and Sleeves the same: And purfled o'er</l>
               <l>With Diamonds, Pearls, and all the shining store</l>
               <l>Of Eastern Pomp: Their long descending Train</l>
               <l>With Rubies edg'd, and Saphires, swept the Plain:</l>
               <l>High on their Heads, with Jewels richly set</l>
               <l>Each Lady wore a radiant Coronet.</l>
               <l>Beneath the Circles, all the Quire was grac'd</l>
               <l>With Chaplets green on their fair Foreheads plac'd.</l>
               <l>Of Lawrel some, of Woodbine many more;</l>
               <l>And Wreaths of <hi>Agnus castus,</hi> others bore:</l>
               <l>These last who with those Virgin Crowns were dress'd,</l>
               <l>Appear'd in higher Honour than the rest.</l>
               <l>They danc'd around, but in the midst was seen</l>
               <l>A Lady of a more majestique Mien;</l>
               <l>By Stature, and by Beauty mark'd their Sovereign Queen.</l>

               <l>Her Servants Eyes were fix'd upon her Face:</l>
               <l>And as she mov'd or turn'd her Motions view'd,</l>
               <l>Her Measures kept, and Step by Step pursu'd.</l>
               <l>Methought she trod the Ground with greater Grace,</l>
               <l>With more of Godhead shining in her Face;</l>
               <l>And as in Beauty she surpass'd the Quire,</l>
               <l>So, nobler than the rest, was her Attire.</l>
               <l>A Crown of ruddy Gold inclos'd her Brow,</l>
               <l>Plain without Pomp, and Rich without a Show:</l>
               <l>A Branch of <hi>Agnus castus</hi> in her Hand,</l>
               <l>She bore aloft (her Scepter of Command;)</l>
               <l>Admir'd, ador'd by all the circling Crowd,</l>
               <l>For wheresoe'er she turn'd her Face, they bow'd:</l>
               <l>And as she danc'd, a Roundelay she sung,</l>
               <l>In honour of the Lawrel, ever young:</l>
               <l>She rais'd her Voice on high, and sung so clear,</l>
               <l>The Fawns came scudding from the Groves to hear:</l>
               <l>And all the bending Forest lent an Ear.</l>
               <l>At ev'ry Close she made, th' attending Throng</l>
               <l>Reply'd, and bore the Burden of the Song:</l>
               <l>So just, so small, yet in so sweet a Note,</l>
               <l>It seem'd the Musick melted in the Throat.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus dancing on, and singing as they danc'd,</l>
               <l>They to the middle of the Mead advanc'd:</l>
               <l>Till round my Arbour, a new Ring they made,</l>
               <l>And footed it about the secret Shade:</l>

O'erjoy'd to see the jolly Troop so near,</l>

               <l>Yet not so much, but that I noted well</l>

               <l>The neighing Coursers, and the Soldiers cry,</l>
               <l>And sounding Trumps that seem'd to tear the Sky:</l>
               <l>I saw soon after this, behind the Grove</l>
               <l>From whence the Ladies did in order move,</l>
               <l>Come issuing out in Arms a Warrior-Train,</l>
               <l>That like a Deluge pour'd upon the Plain:</l>
               <l>On barbed Steeds they rode in proud Array,</l>
               <l>Thick as the College of the Bees in <hi>May,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>When swarming o'er the dusky Fields they fly,</l>
               <l>New to the Flow'rs, and intercept the Sky.</l>
               <l>So fierce they drove, their Coursers were so fleet,</l>
               <l>That the Turf trembled underneath their Feet.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To tell their costly Furniture were long,</l>
               <l>The Summers Day wou'd end before the Song:</l>
               <l>To purchase but the Tenth of all their Store,</l>
               <l>Would make the mighty <hi>Persian</hi> Monarch poor.</l>
               <l>Yet what I can, I will; before the rest</l>
               <l>The Trumpets issu'd in white Mantles dress'd:</l>
               <l>A numerous Troop, and all their Heads around</l>
               <l>With Chaplets green of Cerrial-Oak were crown'd,</l>
               <l>And at each Trumpet was a Banner bound;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:58868:174"/>
Which waving in the Wind display'd at large</l>
               <l>Their Master's Coat of Arms, and Knightly Charge.</l>
               <l>Broad were the Banners, and of snowy Hue,</l>
               <l>A purer Web the Silk-worm never drew.</l>
               <l>The chief about their Necks, the Scutcheons wore,</l>
               <l>With Orient Pearls and Jewels pouder'd o'er:</l>
               <l>Broad were their Collars too, and ev'ry one</l>
               <l>Was set about with many a costly Stone.</l>
               <l>Next these of Kings at Arms a goodly Train,</l>
               <l>In proud Array came prancing o'er the Plain:</l>
               <l>Their Cloaks were Cloth of Silver mix'd with Gold,</l>
               <l>And Garlands green arround their Temples roll'd:</l>
               <l>Rich Crowns were on their royal Scutcheons plac'd</l>
               <l>With Saphires, Diamonds, and with Rubies grac'd.</l>
               <l>And as the Trumpets their appearance made,</l>
               <l>So these in Habits were alike array'd;</l>
               <l>But with a Pace more sober, and more slow:</l>
               <l>And twenty, Rank in Rank, they rode a-row.</l>
               <l>The Pursevants came next in number more;</l>
               <l>And like the Heralds each his Scutcheon bore:</l>
               <l>Clad in white Velvet all their Troop they led,</l>
               <l>With each an Oaken Chaplet on his Head.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nine royal Knights in equal Rank succeed,</l>
               <l>Each Warrior mounted on a fiery Steed:</l>
               <l>In golden Armour glorious to behold;</l>
               <l>The Rivets of their Arms were nail'd with Gold.</l>
               <l>Their Surcoats of white Ermin-Fur were made;</l>
               <l>With Cloth of Gold between that cast a glitt'ring Shade.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:58868:174"/>
The Trappings of their Steeds were of the same;</l>
               <l>The golden Fringe ev'n set the Ground on flame;</l>
               <l>And drew a precious Trail: A Crown divine</l>
               <l>Of Lawrel did about their Temples twine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Three Henchmen were for ev'ry Knight assign'd,</l>
               <l>All in rich Livery clad, and of a kind:</l>
               <l>White Velvet, but unshorn, for Cloaks they wore,</l>
               <l>And each within his Hand a Truncheon bore:</l>
               <l>The foremost held a Helm of rare Device;</l>
               <l>A Prince's Ransom wou'd not pay the Price.</l>
               <l>The second bore the Buckler of his Knight,</l>
               <l>The third of Cornel-Wood a Spear upright,</l>
               <l>Headed with piercing Steel, and polish'd bright.</l>
               <l>Like to their Lords their Equipage was seen,</l>
               <l>And all their Foreheads crown'd with Garlands green.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And after these came arm'd with Spear and Shield</l>
               <l>An Host so great, as cover'd all the Field:</l>
               <l>And all their Foreheads, like the Knights before,</l>
               <l>With Lawrels ever green were shaded o'er,</l>
               <l>Or Oak, or other Leaves of lasting kind,</l>
               <l>Tenacious of the Stem and firm against the Wind.</l>
               <l>Some in their Hands besides the Lance and Shield,</l>
               <l>The Boughs of Woodbind or of Hauthorn held,</l>
               <l>Or Branches for their mistique Emblems took,</l>
               <l>Of Palm, of Lawrel, or of Cerrial Oak.</l>

               <l>Thus marching to the Trumpets lofty sound</l>
               <l>Drawn in two Lines adverse they wheel'd around,</l>
               <l>And in the middle Meadow took their Ground.</l>
               <l>Among themselves the Turney they divide,</l>
               <l>In equal Squadrons, rang'd on either side.</l>
               <l>Then turn'd their Horses Heads, and Man to Man,</l>
               <l>And Steed to Steed oppos'd, the Justs began.</l>
               <l>They lightly set their Lances in the rest,</l>
               <l>And, at the Sign, against each other press'd:</l>
               <l>They met, I sitting at my Ease beheld</l>
               <l>The mix'd Events, and Fortunes of the Field.</l>
               <l>Some broke their Spears, some tumbled Horse and Man,</l>
               <l>And round the Fields the lighten'd Courses ran.</l>
               <l>An Hour and more like Tides, in equal sway</l>
               <l>They rush'd, and won by turns, and lost the Day:</l>
               <l>At length the Nine (who still together held)</l>
               <l>Their fainting Foes to shameful Fight compell'd,</l>
               <l>And with resistless Force, o'er-ran the Field.</l>
               <l>Thus, to their Fame, when finish'd was the Fight,</l>
               <l>The Victors from their lofty Steeds alight:</l>
               <l>Like them dismounted all the Warlike Train,</l>
               <l>And two by two proceeded o'er the Plain:</l>
               <l>Till to the fair Assembly they advanc'd,</l>
               <l>Who near the secret Arbour sung and danc'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Ladies left their Measures at the Sight,</l>
               <l>To meet the Chiefs returning from the Fight,</l>
               <l>And each with open Arms embrac'd her chosen Knight.</l>

Amid the Plain a spreading Lawrel stood,</l>
               <l>The Grace and Ornament of all the Wood:</l>
               <l>That pleasing Shade they sought, a soft retreat,</l>
               <l>From suddain <hi>April</hi> Show'rs, a Shelter from the Heat.</l>
               <l>Her leavy Arms with such extent were spread,</l>
               <l>So near the Clouds was her aspiring Head,</l>
               <l>That Hosts of Birds, that wing the liquid Air,</l>
               <l>Perch'd in the Boughs, had nightly Lodging there.</l>
               <l>And Flocks of Sheep beneath the Shade from far</l>
               <l>Might hear the ratling Hail, and wintry War;</l>
               <l>From Heav'ns Inclemency here found retreat,</l>
               <l>Enjoy'd the cool, and shun'd the scorching Heat:</l>
               <l>A hundred Knights might there at Ease abide;</l>
               <l>And ev'ry Knight a Lady by his side:</l>
               <l>The Trunk it self such Odours did bequeath,</l>
               <l>That a Moluccan Breeze to these was common Breath.</l>
               <l>The Lords, and Ladies here approaching, paid</l>
               <l>Their Homage, with a low Obeisance made:</l>
               <l>And seem'd to venerate the sacred Shade.</l>
               <l>These Rites perform'd, their Pleasures they pursue,</l>
               <l>With Songs of Love, and mix with Measures new;</l>
               <l>Around the holy Tree their Dance they frame,</l>
               <l>And ev'ry Champion leads his chosen Dame.</l>

               <l>I cast my Sight upon the farther Field,</l>
               <l>And a fresh Object of Delight beheld:</l>
               <l>For from the Region of the West I heard</l>
               <l>New Musick sound, and a new Troop appear'd;</l>
               <l>Of Knights, and Ladies mix'd a jolly Band,</l>
               <l>But all on Foot they march'd, and Hand in Hand.</l>

               <l>The Ladies dress'd in rich Symarrs were seen</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Florence</hi> Satten, flow'r'd with White and Green,</l>
               <l>And for a Shade betwixt the bloomy Gridelin.</l>
               <l>The Borders of their Petticoats below</l>
               <l>Were guarded thick with Rubies on a-row;</l>
               <l>And ev'ry Damsel wore upon her Head</l>
               <l>Of Flow'rs a Garland blended White and Red.</l>
               <l>Attir'd in Mantles all the Knights were seen,</l>
               <l>That gratify'd the View with chearful Green:</l>
               <l>Their Chaplets of their Ladies Colours were</l>
               <l>Compos'd of White and Red to shade their shining Hair.</l>
               <l>Before the merry Troop the Minstrels play'd,</l>
               <l>All in their Master's Liveries were array'd:</l>
               <l>And clad in Green, and on their Temples wore,</l>
               <l>The Chaplets White and Red their Ladies bore.</l>
               <l>Their Instruments were various in their kind,</l>
               <l>Some for the Bow, and some for breathing Wind:</l>
               <l>The Sawtry, Pipe, and Hautbois noisy band,</l>
               <l>And the soft Lute trembling beneath the touching Hand.</l>
               <l>A Tuft of Dasies on a flow'ry Lay</l>
               <l>They saw, and thitherward they bent their way:</l>
               <l>To this both Knights and Dames their Homage made,</l>
               <l>And due Obeisance to the Daisy paid.</l>
               <l>And then the Band of Flutes began to play,</l>
               <l>To which a Lady sung a Virelay;</l>

               <l>Then droop'd the fading Flow'rs (their Beauty fled)</l>
               <l>And clos'd their sickly Eyes, and hung the Head;</l>

               <l>The Ladies gasp'd, and scarcely could respire;</l>
               <l>The Breath they drew, no longer Air, but Fire;</l>

               <l>The Sun was set; and Vesper to supply</l>

               <l>When <hi>Philomel,</hi> officious all the Day</l>
               <l>To sing the Service of th' ensuing <hi>May,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Fled from her Lawrel Shade, and wing'd her Flight</l>
               <l>Directly to the Queen array'd in White:</l>
               <l>And hopping sate familiar on her Hand,</l>
               <l>A new Musitian, and increas'd the Band.</l>

               <l>The Goldfinch, who to shun the scalding Heat,</l>

               <l>And hid in Bushes scap'd the bitter Show'r,</l>
               <l>Now perch'd upon the Lady of the Flow'r;</l>
               <l>And either Songster holding out their Throats,</l>
               <l>And folding up their Wings renew'd their Notes:</l>
               <l>As if all Day, preluding to the Fight,</l>

The Banquet ended, and the Battle done,</l>
               <l>They danc'd by Star-light and the friendly Moon:</l>
               <l>And when they were to part, the Laureat Queen,</l>
               <l>Supply'd with Steeds the Lady of the Green.</l>
               <l>Her, and her Train conducting on the way</l>

               <l>Some Nymph to satisfy my longing Mind:</l>
               <l>And as my fair Adventure fell, I found</l>
               <l>A Lady all in White with Lawrel crown'd</l>
               <l>Who clos'd the Rear, and softly pac'd along,</l>
               <l>Repeating to her self the former Song.</l>
               <l>With due respect my Body I inclin'd,</l>
               <l>As to some Being of Superiour Kind,</l>
               <l>And made my Court, according to the Day,</l>

               <l>Great Thanks my Daughter, with a gracious Bow</l>

               <l>And all those airy Shapes you now behold</l>
               <l>Were humane Bodies once, and cloath'd with earthly Mold:</l>

The Soveraign Lady of our Land is She,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Diana</hi> call'd, the Queen of Chastity:</l>
               <l>And, for the spotless Name of Maid she bears,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Agnus castus</hi> in her Hand appears:</l>
               <l>And all her Train with leavy Chaplets crown'd</l>
               <l>Were for unblam'd Virginity renown'd:</l>
               <l>But those the chief and highest in Command</l>
               <l>Who bear those holy Branches in their Hand:</l>
               <l>The Knights adorn'd with Lawrel-Crowns, are they</l>
               <l>Whom Death nor Danger ever cou'd dismay,</l>
               <l>Victorious Names, who made the World obey:</l>
               <l>Who while they liv'd, in Deeds of Arms excell'd,</l>
               <l>And after Death for Deities were held.</l>
               <l>But those who wear the Woodbine on their Brow</l>
               <l>Were Knights of Love, who never broke their Vow:</l>
               <l>Firm to their plighted Faith, and ever free</l>
               <l>From Fears and fickle Chance, and Jealousy.</l>
               <l>The Lords and Ladies, who the Woodbine bear,</l>
               <l>As true as <hi>Tristram,</hi> and <hi>Isotta</hi> were.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But what are those said I, th' unconquer'd Nine</l>
               <l>Who crown'd with Lawrel-Wreaths in golden Armour shine?</l>
               <l>And who the Knights in Green, and what the Train</l>
               <l>Of Ladies dress'd with Daisies on the Plain?</l>
               <l>Why both the Bands in Worship disagree,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Just is your Suit, fair Daughter, said the Dame,</l>
               <l>Those lawrell'd Chiefs were Men of mighty Fame;</l>

Nine Worthies were they call'd of diff'rent Rites,</l>
               <l>Three Jews, three Pagans, and three Christian Knights.</l>
               <l>These, as you see, ride foremost in the Field,</l>
               <l>As they the foremost Rank of Honour held,</l>
               <l>And all in Deeds of Chivalry excell'd.</l>
               <l>Their Temples wreath'd with Leafs, that still renew;</l>
               <l>For deathless Lawrel is the Victor's due:</l>
               <l>Who bear the Bows were Knights in <hi>Arthur's</hi> Reign,</l>
               <l>Twelve they, and twelve the Peers of <hi>Charlemain:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For Bows the Strength of brawny Arms imply,</l>
               <l>Emblems of Valour, and of Victory.</l>
               <l>Behold an Order yet of newer Date</l>
               <l>Doubling their Number, equal in their State;</l>
               <l>Our <hi>England's</hi> Ornament, the Crown's Defence,</l>
               <l>In Battle brave, Protectors of their Prince.</l>
               <l>Unchang'd by Fortune, to their Soveraign true,</l>
               <l>For which their manly Legs are bound with Blue.</l>
               <l>These, of the Garter call'd, of Faith unstain'd,</l>
               <l>In fighting Fields the Lawrel have obtain'd,</l>
               <l>And well repaid those Honours which they gain'd.</l>
               <l>The Lawrel-Wreaths were first by <hi>Caesar</hi> worn,</l>
               <l>And still they <hi>Caesar's</hi> Successors adorn:</l>
               <l>One Leaf of this is Immortality,</l>
               <l>And more of Worth, than all the World can buy.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>One Doubt remains, said I, the Dames in Green,</l>
               <l>What were their Qualities, and who their Queen?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Flora</hi> commands, said she, those Nymphs and Knights,</l>
               <l>Who liv'd in slothful Ease, and loose Delights:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:58868:180"/>
Who never Acts of Honour durst pursue,</l>
               <l>The Men inglorious Knights, the Ladies all untrue:</l>
               <l>Who nurs'd in Idleness, and train'd in Courts,</l>
               <l>Pass'd all their precious Hours in Plays, and Sports,</l>
               <l>Till Death behind came stalking on, unseen,</l>
               <l>And wither'd (like the Storm) the freshness of their Green.</l>
               <l>These, and their Mates, enjoy the present Hour,</l>
               <l>And therefore pay their Homage to the Flow'r.</l>
               <l>But Knights in Knightly Deeds should persevere,</l>
               <l>And still continue what at first they were;</l>
               <l>Continue, and proceed in Honours fair Career.</l>
               <l>No room for Cowardise, or dull delay;</l>
               <l>From Good to Better they should urge their way.</l>
               <l>For this with golden Spurs the Chiefs are grac'd,</l>
               <l>With pointed Rowels arm'd to mend their haste;</l>
               <l>For this with lasting Leaves their Brows are bound;</l>
               <l>For Lawrel is the Sign of Labour crown'd;</l>
               <l>Which bears the bitter Blast, nor shaken falls to Ground:</l>
               <l>From Winter-Winds it suffers no decay,</l>
               <l>For ever fresh and fair, and ev'ry Month is <hi>May.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Ev'n when the vital Sap retreats below,</l>
               <l>Ev'n when the hoary Head is hid in Snow;</l>
               <l>The Life is in the Leaf, and still between</l>
               <l>The Fits of falling Snows, appears the streaky Green.</l>
               <l>Not so the Flow'r which lasts for little space</l>
               <l>A short-liv'd Good, and an uncertain Grace;</l>
               <l>This way and that the feeble Stem is driv'n,</l>
               <l>Weak to sustain the Storms, and Injuries of Heav'n.</l>

Prop'd by the Spring, it lifts aloft, the Head,</l>
               <l>But of a sickly Beauty, soon to shed;</l>
               <l>In Summer living, and in Winter dead.</l>
               <l>For Things of tender Kind for Pleasure made</l>
               <l>Shoot up with swift Increase, and suddain are decay'd.</l>

               <l>With humble Words, the wisest I could frame,</l>
               <l>And profer'd Service I repaid the Dame:</l>
               <l>That of her Grace she gave her Maid to know</l>
               <l>The secret meaning of this moral Show.</l>
               <l>And she to prove what Profit I had made,</l>
               <l>Of mystique Truth, in Fables first convey'd,</l>
               <l>Demanded, till the next returning <hi>May,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Whether the Leaf or Flow'r I would obey?</l>
               <l>I chose the Leaf; she smil'd with sober Chear,</l>
               <l>And wish'd me fair Adventure for the Year.</l>
               <l>And gave me Charms and Sigils, for Defence</l>
               <l>Against ill Tongues that scandal Innocence:</l>
               <l>But I, said she, my Fellows must pursue,</l>
               <l>Already past the Plain, and out of view.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>We parted thus; I homeward sped my way,</l>
               <l>Bewilder'd in the Wood till Dawn of Day:</l>
               <l>And met the merry Crew who danc'd about the <hi>May.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then late refresh'd with Sleep I rose to write</l>

                  <hi>Caenis</hi> the bright, was born to high Command;</l>
               <l>A Princess; and a Native of thy Land,</l>
               <l>Divine <hi>Achilles;</hi> every Tongue proclaim'd</l>
               <l>Her Beauty; and her Eyes all Hearts inflam'd.</l>

                  <hi>Peleus,</hi> thy Sire, perhaps had sought her Bed;</l>
               <l>Among the rest; but he had either led</l>
               <l>Thy Mother then; or was by Promise ty'd:</l>
               <l>But she to him, and all alike her Love deny'd.</l>

               <l>It was her Fortune once, to take her way</l>

               <l>One Gift for all: She said; and while she spoke,</l>
               <l>A stern, majestick, manly Tone she took.</l>
               <l>A Man she was: And as the Godhead swore,</l>

               <l>The Cloud-begotten Race half Men, half Beast,</l>

               <l>Proud of his Helm, and <hi>Macedonian</hi> Lance;</l>
               <l>And rode the Ring around; that either Hoast</l>
               <l>Might hear him, while he made this empty Boast.</l>
               <l>And from a Strumpet shall we suffer Shame,</l>
               <l>For <hi>Caenis</hi> still, not <hi>Caeneus</hi> is thy Name:</l>
               <l>And still the Native Softness of thy Kind</l>
               <l>Prevails; and leaves the Woman in thy Mind?</l>
               <l>Remember what thou wert; what Price was paid</l>
               <l>To change thy Sex: To make thee not a Maid;</l>
               <l>And but a Man in shew: Go, Card and Spin;</l>
               <l>And leave the Business of the War to Men.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While thus the Boaster exercis'd his Pride,</l>
               <l>The fatal Spear of <hi>Caeneus</hi> reach'd his Side:</l>
               <l>Just in the mixture of the Kinds it ran;</l>
               <l>Betwixt the neather Breast, and upper Man:</l>
               <l>The Monster mad with Rage, and stung with Smart,</l>
               <l>His Lance directed at the Hero's Heart:</l>
               <l>It strook: But bounded from his harden'd Breast,</l>
               <l>Like Hail from Tiles, which the safe House invest.</l>

                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:58868:199"/>
Nor seem'd the Stroke with more effect to come,</l>
               <l>Than a small Pebble falling on a Drum.</l>
               <l>He next his Fauchion try'd, in closer Fight;</l>
               <l>But the keen Fauchion, had no Pow'r to bite.</l>
               <l>He thrust; the blunted Point return'd again:</l>
               <l>Since downright Blows, he cry'd, and Thrusts are vain,</l>
               <l>I'll prove his Side: In strong Embraces held</l>
               <l>He prov'd his Side; his Side the Sword repell'd:</l>
               <l>His hollow Belly eccho'd to the Stroke;</l>
               <l>Untouch'd his Body, as a solid Rock;</l>
               <l>Aim'd at his Neck at last, the Blade in Shivers broke.</l>

               <l>Th' Impassive Knight stood Idle, to deride</l>
               <l>His Rage, and offer'd oft his naked Side:</l>
               <l>At length, Now Monster, in thy turn he cry'd</l>
               <l>Try thou the Strength of <hi>Caeneus:</hi> At the Word</l>
               <l>He thrust; and in his Shoulder plung'd the Sword.</l>
               <l>Then writh'd his Hand; and as he drove it down,</l>
               <l>Deep in his Breast, made many Wounds in one.</l>

               <l>The Centaurs saw inrag'd, th' unhop'd Success;</l>

               <l>Repuls'd they from his fated Body flew.</l>
               <l>Amaz'd they stood; till <hi>Monychus</hi> began,</l>

               <l>A Woman-Man; yet more a Man is He,</l>

               <l>THE Chiefs were set; the Soldiers crown'd the Field:</l>
               <l>To these the Master of the sevenfold Shield,</l>
               <l>Upstarted fierce: And kindled with Disdain</l>
               <l>Eager to speak, unable to contain</l>
               <l>His boiling Rage, he rowl'd his Eyes around</l>
               <l>The Shore, and <hi>Grecian</hi> Gallies hall'd a-ground.</l>
               <l>Then stretching out his Hands, O <hi>Iove,</hi> he cry'd,</l>
               <l>Must then our Cause before the Fleet be try'd?</l>

And dares <hi>Ulysses</hi> for the Prize contend,</l>
               <l>In sight of what he durst not once defend?</l>
               <l>But basely fled that memorable Day,</l>
               <l>When I from <hi>Hector's</hi> Hands redeem'd the flaming Prey.</l>
               <l>So much 'tis safer at the noisy Bar</l>
               <l>With Words to flourish than ingage in War.</l>
               <l>By different Methods we maintain our Right,</l>

               <l>Nor need I speak my Deeds, for those you see,</l>

               <l>Great is the Prize demanded, I confess,</l>

               <l>Losing he wins, because his Name will be</l>

               <l>To fight uncall'd, a voluntary Name,</l>
               <l>Nor shun'd the Cause, but offer'd you my Aid,</l>
               <l>While he long lurking was to War betray'd:</l>
               <l>Forc'd to the Field he came, but in the Reer;</l>
               <l>And feign'd Distraction to conceal his Fear:</l>
               <l>Till one more cunning caught him in the Snare;</l>
               <l>(Ill for himself) and drag'd him into War.</l>
               <l>Now let a Hero's Arms a Coward vest,</l>

               <l>Rob'd of my Kinsman's Arms, who first appear'd in Fight.</l>

               <l>Nor <hi>Philoctetes</hi> had been left inclos'd</l>
               <l>In a bare Isle to Wants and Pains expos'd,</l>

Now he with us to <hi>Troy's</hi> Destruction sworn</l>
               <l>Our Brother of the War, by whom are born</l>

               <l>Against the Birds the Shafts due to the Fate of <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Yet still he lives, and lives from Treason free,</l>
               <l>Because he left <hi>Vlysses</hi> Company:</l>
               <l>Poor <hi>Palamede</hi> might wish, so void of Aid,</l>
               <l>Rather to have been left, than so to Death betray'd:</l>
               <l>The Coward bore the Man immortal Spight,</l>
               <l>Who sham'd him out of Madness into Fight:</l>
               <l>Nor daring otherwise to vent his Hate</l>
               <l>Accus'd him first of Treason to the State,</l>
               <l>And then for proof produc'd the golden Store;</l>
               <l>Himself had hidden in his Tent before:</l>
               <l>Thus of two Champions he depriv'd our Hoast,</l>
               <l>By Exile one, and one by Treason lost.</l>
               <l>Thus fights <hi>Vlysses,</hi> thus his Fame extends,</l>
               <l>A formidable Man, but to his Friends:</l>
               <l>Great, for what Greatness is in Words and Sound,</l>
               <l>Ev'n faithful <hi>Nestor</hi> less in both is found:</l>
               <l>But that he might without a Rival reign,</l>
               <l>He left this faithful <hi>Nestor</hi> on the Plain;</l>
               <l>Forsook his Friend ev'n at his utmost Need,</l>
               <l>Who tir'd, and tardy with his wounded Steed</l>
               <l>Cry'd out for Aid, and call'd him by his Name;</l>
               <l>But Cowardice has neither Ears nor Shame:</l>
               <l>Thus fled the good old Man, bereft of Aid,</l>
               <l>And for as much as lay in him, betray'd:</l>

That this is not a Fable forg'd by me,</l>

               <l>I vouch ev'n <hi>Diomede,</hi> who tho' his Friend</l>
               <l>Cannot that Act excuse, much less defend:</l>
               <l>He call'd him back aloud, and tax'd his Fear;</l>
               <l>And fure enough he heard, but durst not hear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Gods with equal Eyes on Mortals look,</l>
               <l>He justly was forsaken, who forsook:</l>
               <l>Wanted that Succour he refused to lend,</l>
               <l>Found ev'ry Fellow such another Friend:</l>
               <l>No wonder, if he roar'd that all might hear;</l>
               <l>His Elocution was increas'd by fear:</l>
               <l>I heard, I ran, I found him out of Breath,</l>
               <l>Pale, trembling, and half dead, with fear of Death.</l>
               <l>Though he had judg'd himself by his own Laws,</l>
               <l>And stood condemn'd, I help'd the common Cause:</l>
               <l>With my broad Buckler hid him from the Foe;</l>
               <l>(Ev'n the Shield trembled as he lay below;)</l>
               <l>And from impending Fate the Coward freed:</l>
               <l>Good Heav'n forgive me for so bad a Deed!</l>
               <l>If still he will persist, and urge the Strife,</l>
               <l>First let him give me back his forfeit Life:</l>
               <l>Let him return to that opprobrious Field;</l>
               <l>Again creep under my protecting Shield:</l>
               <l>Let him lie wounded, let the Foe be near,</l>
               <l>And let his quiv'ring Heart confess his Fear;</l>
               <l>There put him in the very Jaws of Fate;</l>
               <l>And let him plead his Cause in that Estate:</l>

And yet when snatch'd from Death, when from below</l>
               <l>My lifted Shield I loos'd, and let him go:</l>
               <l>Good Heav'ns how light he rose, with what a bound</l>
               <l>He sprung from Earth, forgetful of his Wound;</l>
               <l>How fresh, how eager then his Feet to ply,</l>
               <l>Who had not Strength to stand, had Speed to fly!</l>

                  <hi>Hector</hi> came on, and brought the Gods along;</l>
               <l>Fear seiz'd alike the Feeble and the Strong:</l>
               <l>Each <hi>Greek</hi> was an <hi>Vlysses;</hi> such a Dread</l>
               <l>Th' approach, and ev'n the sound of <hi>Hector</hi> bred:</l>
               <l>Him, flesh'd with Slaughter, and with Conquest crown'd,</l>
               <l>I met, and over-turn'd him to the Ground;</l>
               <l>When after, matchless as he deem'd, in Might,</l>
               <l>He challeng'd all our Hoast to single Fight;</l>
               <l>All Eyes were fix'd on me: The Lots were thrown;</l>
               <l>But for your Champion I was wish'd alone:</l>

               <l>With <hi>Jove</hi> to friend th' insulting <hi>Trojan</hi> came,</l>
               <l>And menac'd us with Force, our Fleet with Flame:</l>
               <l>Was it the Strength of this Tongue-valiant Lord,</l>
               <l>In that black Hour, that sav'd you from the Sword?</l>
               <l>Or was my Breast expos'd alone, to brave</l>
               <l>A thousand Swords, a thousand Ships to save?</l>
               <l>The hopes of your return! And can you yield,</l>
               <l>For a sav'd Fleet, less than a single Shield?</l>
               <l>Think it no Boast, O <hi>Grecians,</hi> if I deem</l>

               <l>Will he compare my Courage with his Slight?</l>
               <l>As well he may compare the Day with Night.</l>
               <l>Night is indeed the Province of his Reign:</l>

               <l>Pond'rous with precious Weight, and rough with Cost</l>

Above the rest our <hi>Britain</hi> held they dear,</l>
               <l>More solemnly they kept their Sabbaths here,</l>

               <l>And where they plaid their merry Pranks before,</l>
               <l>Have sprinkled Holy Water on the Floor:</l>

               <l>Resort to Farmers rich, and bless their Halls</l>

               <l>This makes the Fairy Quires forsake the Place,</l>
               <l>When once 'tis hallow'd with the Rites of Grace:</l>

            <lg>
               <l>It so befel in this King <hi>Arthur's</hi> Reign,</l>
               <l>A lusty Knight was pricking o'er the Plain;</l>
               <l>A Batchelor he was, and of the courtly Train.</l>
               <l>It happen'd as he rode, a Damsel gay</l>
               <l>In Russet-Robes to Market took her way;</l>
               <l>Soon on the Girl he cast an amorous Eye,</l>
               <l>So strait she walk'd, and on her Pasterns high:</l>
               <l>If seeing her behind he lik'd her Pace,</l>
               <l>Now turning short he better lik'd her Face:</l>
               <l>He lights in hast, and full of Youthful Fire,</l>
               <l>By Force accomplish'd his obscene Desire:</l>
               <l>This done away he rode, not unespy'd,</l>
               <l>For swarming at his Back the Country cry'd;</l>
               <l>And once in view they never lost the Sight,</l>
               <l>But seiz'd, and pinion'd brought to court the Knight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then Courts of Kings were held in high Renown,</l>
               <l>E'er made the common Brothels of the Town:</l>
               <l>There, Virgins honourable Vows receiv'd,</l>
               <l>But chast as Maids in Monasteries liv'd:</l>
               <l>The King himself to Nuptial Ties a Slave,</l>
               <l>No bad Example to his Poets gave:</l>
               <l>And they not bad, but in a vicious Age</l>

               <l>Now what shou'd <hi>Arthur</hi> do? He lov'd the Knight,</l>
               <l>But Soveraign Monarchs are the Source of Right:</l>
               <l>Mov'd by the Damsels Tears and common Cry,</l>
               <l>He doom'd the brutal Ravisher to die.</l>
               <l>But fair <hi>Geneura</hi> rose in his Defence,</l>
               <l>And pray'd so hard for Mercy from the Prince;</l>
               <l>That to his Queen the King th'Offender gave,</l>
               <l>And left it in her Pow'r to Kill or Save:</l>
               <l>This gracious Act the Ladies all approve,</l>
               <l>Who thought it much a Man should die for Love.</l>

               <l>Sir Knight, tho' I have ask'd thy Life, yet still</l>
               <l>Thy Destiny depends upon my Will:</l>
               <l>Nor hast thou other Surety than the Grace</l>
               <l>Not due to thee from our offended Race.</l>
               <l>But as our Kind is of a softer Mold,</l>
               <l>And cannot Blood without a Sigh behold,</l>
               <l>I grant thee Life; reserving still the Pow'r</l>
               <l>To take the Forfeit when I see my Hour:</l>
               <l>Unless thy Answer to my next Demand</l>

The Question, whose Solution I require,</l>
               <l>Is what the Sex of Women most desire?</l>
               <l>In this Dispute thy Judges are at Strife;</l>
               <l>Beware; for on thy Wit depends thy Life.</l>
               <l>Yet (lest surpriz'd, unknowing what to say</l>
               <l>Thou damn thy self) we give thee farther Day:</l>
               <l>A Year is thine to wander at thy Will;</l>
               <l>And learn from others if thou want'st the Skill.</l>
               <l>But, not to hold our Proffer in Scorn,</l>
               <l>Good Sureties will we have for thy return;</l>
               <l>That at the time prefix'd thou shalt obey,</l>
               <l>And at thy Pledges Peril keep thy Day.</l>

               <l>Woe was the Knight at this severe Command!</l>
               <l>But well he knew 'twas bootless to withstand:</l>
               <l>The Terms accepted as the Fair ordain,</l>
               <l>He put in Bail for his return again.</l>
               <l>And promis'd Answer at the Day assign'd,</l>
               <l>The best, with Heav'ns Assistance, he could find.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His Leave thus taken, on his Way he went</l>
               <l>With heavy Heart, and full of Discontent,</l>
               <l>Misdoubting much, and fearful of th'Event.</l>
               <l>'Twas hard the Truth of such a Point to find,</l>
               <l>As was not yet agreed among the Kind.</l>
               <l>Thus on he went; still anxious more and more,</l>
               <l>Ask'd all he met; and knock'd at ev'ry Door;</l>
               <l>Enquir'd of Men; but made his chief Request</l>
               <l>To learn from Women what they lov'd the best.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:58868:220"/>
They answer'd each according to her Mind;</l>
               <l>To please her self, not all the Female Kind.</l>
               <l>One was for Wealth, another was for Place:</l>
               <l>Crones old and ugly, wish'd a better Face.</l>
               <l>The Widow's Wish was oftentimes to Wed;</l>
               <l>The wanton Maids were all for Sport a Bed.</l>
               <l>Some said the Sex were pleas'd with handsom Lies,</l>
               <l>And some gross Flatt'ry lov'd without disguise:</l>
               <l>Truth is, says one, he seldom fails to win</l>
               <l>Who Flatters well, for that's our darling Sin.</l>
               <l>But long Attendance, and a duteous Mind,</l>
               <l>Will work ev'n with the wisest of the Kind.</l>
               <l>One thought the Sexes prime Felicity</l>
               <l>Was from the Bonds of Wedlock to be free:</l>
               <l>Their Pleasures, Hours, and Actions all their own,</l>
               <l>And uncontroll'd to give Account to none.</l>
               <l>Some wish a Husband-Fool; but such are curst,</l>
               <l>For Fools perverse, of Husbands are the worst:</l>
               <l>All Women wou'd be counted Chast and Wise,</l>
               <l>Nor should our Spouses see, but with our Eyes;</l>
               <l>For Fools will prate; and tho' they want the Wit</l>
               <l>To find close Faults, yet open Blots will hit:</l>
               <l>Tho' better for their Ease to hold their Tongue,</l>
               <l>For Womankind was never in the Wrong.</l>
               <l>So Noise ensues, and Quarrels last for Life;</l>
               <l>The Wife abhors the Fool, the Fool the Wife.</l>
               <l>And some Men say that great Delight have we,</l>
               <l>To be for Truth extoll'd, and Secrecy:</l>
               <l>And constant in one Purpose still to dwell;</l>
               <l>And not our Husband's Counsels to reveal</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:58868:220"/>
But that's a Fable; for our Sex is frail,</l>
               <l>Inventing rather than not tell a Tale.</l>
               <l>Like leaky Sives no Secrets we can hold:</l>

               <l>(As Monarch's Vices must not be reveal'd)</l>
               <l>For fear the People have 'em in the Wind,</l>
               <l>Who long ago were neither Dumb nor Blind;</l>
               <l>Nor apt to think from Heav'n their Title springs,</l>
               <l>Since <hi>Jove</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> left off begetting Kings.</l>
               <l>This <hi>Midas</hi> knew; and durst communicate</l>
               <l>To none but to his Wife, his Ears of State:</l>
               <l>One must be trusted, and he thought her fit,</l>
               <l>As passing prudent; and a parlous Wit.</l>
               <l>To this sagacious Confessor he went,</l>
               <l>And told her what a Gift the Gods had sent:</l>
               <l>Bur told it under Matrimonial Seal,</l>
               <l>With strict Injunction never to reveal.</l>
               <l>The Secret heard she plighted him her Troth,</l>

               <l>But she must burst, or blab; and no pretence</l>

               <l>A marshy Ground commodiously was near,</l>
               <l>Thither she ran, and held her Breath for fear,</l>
               <l>Lest if a Word she spoke of any Thing,</l>

               <l>Thus full of Counsel to the Fen she went,</l>

               <l>Arriv'd, by pure Necessity compell'd,</l>
               <l>On her majestick mary-bones she kneel'd:</l>

               <l>And, as a Bittour bumps within a Reed,</l>
               <l>To thee alone, O Lake, she said, I tell</l>

               <l>Beneath his Locks the King my Husband wears</l>
               <l>A goodly Royal pair of Asses Ears:</l>

               <l>One Day was only left to solve the Doubt,</l>
               <l>Yet knew no more than when he first set out.</l>
               <l>But home he must: And as th' Award had been</l>
               <l>Yield up his Body Captive to the Queen.</l>
               <l>In this despairing State he hap'd to ride</l>
               <l>As Fortune led him, by a Forest-side:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:58868:221"/>
Lonely the Vale, and full of Horror stood</l>
               <l>Brown with the shade of a religious Wood:</l>
               <l>When full before him at the Noon of night,</l>
               <l>(The Moon was up and shot a gleamy Light)</l>
               <l>He saw a Quire of Ladies in a round,</l>
               <l>That featly footing seem'd to skim the Ground:</l>
               <l>Thus dancing Hand in Hand, so light they were,</l>
               <l>He knew not where they trod, on Earth or Air.</l>
               <l>At speed he drove, and came a suddain Guest,</l>
               <l>In hope where many Women were, at least,</l>
               <l>Some one by chance might answer his Request.</l>
               <l>But faster than his Horse the Ladies flew,</l>

My Life must with to Morrow's Light expire,</l>
               <l>Unless I tell, what Women most desire:</l>
               <l>Now cou'd you help me at this hard Essay,</l>
               <l>Or for your inborn Goodness, or for Pay:</l>
               <l>Yours is my Life, redeem'd by your Advice,</l>
               <l>Ask what you please, and I will pay the Price:</l>
               <l>The proudest Kerchief of the Court shall rest</l>
               <l>Well satisfy'd of what they love the best.</l>
               <l>Plight me thy Faith, quoth she: That what I ask</l>
               <l>Thy Danger over, and perform'd the Task;</l>
               <l>That shalt thou give for Hire of thy Demand,</l>
               <l>Here take thy Oath; and seal it on my Hand;</l>
               <l>I warrant thee on Peril of my Life,</l>
               <l>Thy Words shall please both Widow, Maid and Wife.</l>

               <l>More Words there needed not to move the Knight</l>
               <l>To take her Offer, and his Truth to plight.</l>
               <l>With that she spread her Mantle on the Gronnd,</l>
               <l>And first enquiring whether he was bound,</l>
               <l>Bade him not fear, tho' long and rough the Way,</l>
               <l>At Court he should arrive e'er break of Day:</l>
               <l>His Horse should find the way without a Guide,</l>
               <l>She said: With Fury they began to ride,</l>
               <l>He on the midst, the Beldam at his Side.</l>
               <l>The Horse, what Devil drove I cannot tell,</l>
               <l>But only this, they sped their Journey well:</l>
               <l>And all the way the Crone inform'd the Knight,</l>
               <l>How he should answer the Demand aright.</l>

            <lg>

               <l>To Court they came: The News was quickly spread</l>
               <l>Of his returning to redeem his Head.</l>
               <l>The Female Senate was assembled soon,</l>
               <l>With all the Mob of Women in the Town:</l>
               <l>The Queen sate Lord Chief Justice of the Hall,</l>
               <l>And bad the Cryer cite the Criminal.</l>
               <l>The Knight appear'd; and Silence they proclaim,</l>
               <l>Then first the <hi>Culprit</hi> answer'd to his Name:</l>
               <l>And after Forms of Laws, was last requir'd</l>
               <l>To name the Thing that Women most desir'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Th' Offender, taught his Lesson by the way,</l>
               <l>And by his Counsel order'd what to say,</l>
               <l>Thus bold began; My Lady Liege, said he,</l>
               <l>What all your Sex desire is <hi>Soveraignty.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The Wife affects her Husband to command,</l>
               <l>All must be hers, both Mony, House, and Land.</l>
               <l>The Maids are Mistresses ev'n in their Name;</l>
               <l>And of their Servants full Dominion claim.</l>
               <l>This, at the Peril of my Head, I say</l>
               <l>A blunt plain Truth, the Sex aspires to sway,</l>
               <l>You to rule all; while we, like Slaves, obey.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There was not one or Widow, Maid, or Wife,</l>
               <l>But said the Knight had well deserv'd his Life.</l>
               <l>Ev'n fair <hi>Geneura,</hi> with a Blush confess'd,</l>
               <l>The Man had found what Women love the best.</l>

               <l>Upstarts the Beldam, who was there unseen,</l>
               <l>And Reverence made, accosted thus the Queen.</l>
               <l>My Liege, said she, before the Court arise,</l>
               <l>May I poor Wretch find Favour in your Eyes:</l>
               <l>To grant my just Request: 'Twas I who taught</l>
               <l>The Knight this Answer, and inspir'd his Thought.</l>
               <l>None but a Woman could a Man direct</l>
               <l>To tell us Women, what we most affect.</l>
               <l>But first I swore him on his Knightly Troth,</l>
               <l>(And here demand performance of his Oath)</l>
               <l>To grant the Boon that next I should desire;</l>
               <l>He gave his Faith, and I expect my Hire:</l>
               <l>My Promise is fulfill'd: I sav'd his Life,</l>
               <l>And claim his Debt to take me for his Wife.</l>
               <l>The Knight was ask'd, nor cou'd his Oath deny,</l>
               <l>But hop'd they would not force him to comply.</l>
               <l>The Women, who would rather wrest the Laws,</l>
               <l>Than let a Sister-Plantiff lofe the Cause,</l>
               <l>(As Judges on the Bench more gracious are,</l>
               <l>And more attent to Brothers of the Bar)</l>
               <l>Cry'd one, and all, the Suppliant should have Right,</l>
               <l>And to the Grandame-Hag adjudg'd the Knight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In vain he sigh'd, and oft with Tears desir'd,</l>
               <l>Some reasonable Sute, might be requir'd.</l>
               <l>But still the Crone was constant to her Note;</l>
               <l>The more he spoke, the more she stretch'd her Throat.</l>
               <l>In vain he proffer'd all his Goods, to save</l>
               <l>His Body, destin'd to that living Grave.</l>

The liquorish Hag rejects the Pelf with scorn:</l>
               <l>And nothing but the Man would serve her turn.</l>
               <l>Not all the Wealth of Eastern Kings, said she,</l>
               <l>Have Pow'r to part my plighted Love, and me:</l>
               <l>And Old, and Ugly as I am, and Poor;</l>
               <l>Yet never will I break the Faith I swore;</l>
               <l>For mine thou art by Promise, during Life,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My Love! Nay rather my Damnation Thou,</l>
               <l>Said he: Nor am I bound to keep my Vow:</l>
               <l>The Fiend thy Sire has sent thee from below,</l>
               <l>Else how cou'dst thou my secret Sorrows know?</l>
               <l>Avaunt old Witch, for I renounce thy Bed:</l>
               <l>The Queen may take the Forfeit of my Head,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Both heard, the Judge pronounc'd against the Knight;</l>
               <l>So was he Marry'd in his own despight;</l>
               <l>And all Day after hid him as an Owl,</l>
               <l>Not able to sustain a Sight so foul.</l>
               <l>Perhaps the Reader thinks I do him wrong</l>
               <l>To pass the Marriage-Feast, and Nuptial Song:</l>
               <l>Mirth there was none, the Man was <hi>a-la-mort:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And little Courage had to make his Court.</l>
               <l>To Bed they went, the Bridegroom and the Bride:</l>
               <l>Was never such an ill-pair'd Couple ty'd.</l>
               <l>Restless he toss'd and tumbled to and fro,</l>
               <l>And rowl'd, and wriggled further off; for woe.</l>

The good old Wife lay smiling by his Side,</l>
               <l>And caught him in her quiv'ring Arms, and cry'd,</l>
               <l>When you my ravish'd Predecessor saw,</l>
               <l>You were not then become this Man of Straw;</l>
               <l>Had you been such, you might have scap'd the Law.</l>
               <l>Is this the Custom of King <hi>Arthur's</hi> Court?</l>
               <l>Are all Round-Table Knights of such a sort?</l>
               <l>Remember I am she who sav'd your Life,</l>
               <l>Your loving, lawful, and complying Wife:</l>
               <l>Not thus you swore in your unhappy Hour,</l>
               <l>Nor I for this return employ'd my Pow'r.</l>
               <l>In time of Need I was your faithful Friend;</l>
               <l>Nor did I since, nor ever will offend.</l>
               <l>Believe me my lov'd Lord, 'tis much unkind;</l>
               <l>What Fury has possess'd your alter'd Mind?</l>
               <l>Thus on my Wedding-night—Without Pretence—</l>
               <l>Come turn this way, or tell me my Offence.</l>
               <l>If not your Wife, let Reasons Rule persuade,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Amends! Nay that's impossible, said he,</l>
               <l>What change of Age, or Ugliness can be!</l>
               <l>Or, could <hi>Medea's</hi> Magick mend thy Face,</l>
               <l>Thou art descended from so mean a Race,</l>

Ah <hi>Benedicite,</hi> reply'd the Crone:</l>
               <l>Then cause of just Complaining have you none.</l>
               <l>The Remedy to this were soon apply'd,</l>
               <l>Wou'd you be like the Bridegroom to the Bride.</l>
               <l>But, for you say a long descended Race,</l>
               <l>And Wealth, and Dignity, and Pow'r, and Place,</l>
               <l>Make Gentlemen, and that your high Degree</l>
               <l>Is much disparag'd to be match'd with me;</l>
               <l>Know this, my Lord, Nobility of Blood</l>
               <l>Is but a glitt'ring, and fallacious Good:</l>
               <l>The Nobleman is he whose noble Mind</l>
               <l>Is fill'd with inborn Worth, unborrow'd from his Kind.</l>
               <l>The King of Heav'n was in a Manger laid;</l>
               <l>And took his Earth but from an humble Maid:</l>
               <l>Then what can Birth, or mortal Men bestow,</l>
               <l>Since Floods no higher than their Fountains flow.</l>
               <l>We who for Name, and empty Honour strive,</l>
               <l>Our true Nobility from him derive.</l>
               <l>Your Ancestors who puff your Mind with Pride,</l>
               <l>And vast Estates to mighty Titles ty'd,</l>
               <l>Did not your Honour, but their own advance,</l>
               <l>For Virtue comes not by Inheritance.</l>
               <l>If you tralineate from your Father's Mind,</l>
               <l>What are you else but of a Bastard-kind?</l>
               <l>Do, as your great Progenitors have done,</l>
               <l>And by their Virtues prove your self their Son.</l>
               <l>No Father can infuse, or Wit, or Grace,</l>
               <l>A Mother comes across, and marrs the Race.</l>
               <l>A Grandfire, or a Grandame taints the Blood;</l>
               <l>And seldom three Descents continue Good.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:58868:225"/>
Were Virtue by Descent, a noble Name</l>
               <l>Cou'd never villanize his Father's Fame:</l>
               <l>But as the first the last of all the Line,</l>
               <l>Wou'd like the Sun ev'n in Descending shine.</l>
               <l>Take Fire; and bear it to the darkest House,</l>
               <l>Betwixt King <hi>Arthur's</hi> Court and <hi>Caucasus,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>If you depart, the Flame shall still remain,</l>
               <l>And the bright Blaze enlighten all the Plain:</l>
               <l>Nor, till the Fewel perish, can decay,</l>
               <l>By Nature form'd on Things combustible to prey,</l>
               <l>Such is not Man, who mixing better Seed</l>
               <l>With worse, begets a base, degenerate Breed:</l>
               <l>The Bad corrupts the Good, and leaves behind</l>
               <l>No trace of all the great Begetter's Mind.</l>
               <l>The Father sinks within his Son, we see,</l>
               <l>And often rises in the third Degree;</l>
               <l>'If better Luck, a better Mother give:</l>
               <l>Chance gave us being, and by Chance we live.</l>
               <l>Such as our Atoms were, ev'n such are we,</l>
               <l>Or call it Chance, or strong Necessity.</l>
               <l>Thus, loaded with dead weight, the Will is free.</l>
               <l>And thus it needs must be: For Seed conjoin'd</l>
               <l>Let's into Nature's Work th' imperfect Kind:</l>
               <l>But Fire, th' enliv'ner of the general Frame</l>
               <l>Is one, its Operation still the same.</l>
               <l>Its Principle is in it self: While ours</l>
               <l>Works as Confederate's War, with mingled Pow'rs:</l>
               <l>Or Man, or Woman, which soever fails:</l>
               <l>And, oft, the Vigour of the Worse prevails.</l>
               <l>

                  <hi>AEther</hi> with Sulphur blended, alters hue,</l>
               <l>And casts a dusky gleam of <hi>Sodom</hi> blue.</l>
               <l>Thus in a Brute, their ancient Honour ends,</l>
               <l>And the fair Mermaid in a Fish descends:</l>
               <l>The Line is gone; no longer Duke or Earl;</l>
               <l>But by himself degraded turns a Churl.</l>
               <l>Nobility of Blood is but Renown</l>
               <l>Of thy great Fathers by their Virtue known,</l>
               <l>And a long trail of Light, to thee descending down.</l>
               <l>If in thy Smoke it ends: Their Glories shine;</l>
               <l>But Infamy and Villanage are thine.</l>
               <l>Then what I said before, is plainly show'd,</l>
               <l>That true Nobility proceeds from God:</l>
               <l>Not left us by Inheritance, but giv'n</l>
               <l>By Bounty of our Stars, and Grace of Heav'n.</l>
               <l>Thus from a Captive <hi>Servius Tullus</hi> rose,</l>
               <l>Whom for his Virtues, the first <hi>Romans</hi> chose:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fabritius</hi> from their Walls repell'd the Foe,</l>
               <l>Whose noble Hands had exercis'd the Plough.</l>
               <l>From hence, my Lord, and Love, I thus conclude,</l>
               <l>That tho' my homely Ancestors, were rude,</l>
               <l>Mean as I am, yet I may have the Grace,</l>
               <l>To make you Father of a generous Race:</l>
               <l>And Noble then am I, when I begin</l>
               <l>In Virtue cloath'd, to cast the Rags of Sin:</l>
               <l>If Poverty be my upbraided Crime,</l>
               <l>And you believe in Heav'n; there was a time,</l>
               <l>When He, the great Controller of our Fate</l>
               <l>Deign'd to be Man; and liv'd in low Estate:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:58868:226"/>
Which he who had the World at his dispose,</l>
               <l>If Poverty were Vice, wou'd never choose.</l>
               <l>Philosophers have said, and Poets sing,</l>
               <l>That a glad Poverty's an honest Thing.</l>
               <l>Content is Wealth, the Riches of the Mind;</l>
               <l>And happy He who can that Treasure find.</l>
               <l>But the base Miser starves amidst his Store,</l>
               <l>Broods on his Gold, and griping still at more</l>
               <l>Sits sadly pining, and believes he's Poor.</l>
               <l>The ragged Beggar, tho' he wants Relief,</l>
               <l>Has not to lose, and sings before the Thief.</l>
               <l>Want is a bitter, and a hateful Good,</l>
               <l>Because its Virtues are not understood:</l>
               <l>Yet many Things impossible to Thought</l>
               <l>Have been by Need to full Perfection brought:</l>
               <l>The daring of the Soul proceeds from thence,</l>
               <l>Sharpness of Wit, and active Diligence:</l>
               <l>Prudence at once, and Fortitude it gives,</l>
               <l>And if in patience taken mends our Lives;</l>
               <l>For ev'n that Indigence that brings me low</l>
               <l>Makes me my self; and Him above to know.</l>
               <l>A Good which none would challenge, few would choose,</l>
               <l>A fair Possession, which Mankind refuse.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If we from Wealth to Poverty descend,</l>
               <l>Want gives to know the Flatt'rer from the Friend.</l>
               <l>If I am Old, and Ugly, well for you,</l>
               <l>No leud Adult'rer will my Love pursue.</l>

               <l>A careful, tender and obedient Wife,</l>

               <l>Temptations are in Beauty, and in Youth,</l>
               <l>And how can you depend upon my Truth?</l>
               <l>Now weigh the Danger, with the doubtful Bliss,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Alemon's</hi> Son, at <hi>Argos</hi> had his Birth:</l>

               <l>What feels the Body when the Soul expires,</l>
               <l>By time corrupted, or consum'd by Fires?</l>
               <l>Nor dies the Spirit, but new Life repeats</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ev'n I, who these mysterious Truths declare,</l>

My Name and Lineage I remember well,</l>
               <l>And how in Fight by <hi>Sparta's</hi> King I fell.</l>
               <l>In <hi>Argive Juno's</hi> Fane I late beheld,</l>
               <l>My Buckler hung on high, and own'd my former Shield.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then, Death, so call'd, is but old Matter dress'd</l>
               <l>In some new Figure, and a vary'd Vest:</l>
               <l>Thus all Things are but alter'd, nothing dies;</l>
               <l>And here and there th' unbodied Spirit flies,</l>
               <l>By Time, or Force, or Sickness dispossest,</l>
               <l>And lodges, where it lights, in Man or Beast;</l>
               <l>Or hunts without, till ready Limbs it find,</l>
               <l>And actuates those according to their kind;</l>
               <l>From Tenement to Tenement is toss'd;</l>
               <l>The Soul is still the same, the Figure only lost:</l>
               <l>And, as the soften'd Wax new Seals receives,</l>
               <l>This Face assumes, and that Impression leaves;</l>
               <l>Now call'd by one, now by another Name;</l>
               <l>The Form is only chang'd, the Wax is still the same:</l>
               <l>So Death, so call'd, can but the Form deface,</l>
               <l>Th' immortal Soul flies out in empty space;</l>

               <l>Then let not Piety be put to flight,</l>
               <l>To please the tast of Glutton-Appetite;</l>
               <l>But suffer inmate Souls secure to dwell,</l>
               <l>Lest from their Seats your Parents you expel;</l>
               <l>With rabid Hunger feed upon your kind,</l>
               <l>Or from a Beast dislodge a Brother's Mind.</l>

               <l>And since, like <hi>Tiphys</hi> parting from the Shore,</l>
               <l>In ample Seas I sail, and Depths untry'd before,</l>
               <l>This let me further add, that Nature knows</l>
               <l>No stedfast Station, but, or Ebbs, or Flows:</l>
               <l>Ever in motion; she destroys her old,</l>
               <l>And casts new Figures in another Mold.</l>
               <l>Ev'n Times are in perpetual Flux; and run</l>
               <l>Like Rivers from their Fountain rowling on;</l>
               <l>For Time no more than Streams, is at a stay:</l>
               <l>The flying Hour is ever on her way;</l>
               <l>And as the Fountain still supplies her store,</l>
               <l>The Wave behind impels the Wave before;</l>
               <l>Thus in successive Course the Minutes run,</l>
               <l>And urge their Predecessor Minutes on,</l>
               <l>Still moving, ever new: For former Things</l>
               <l>Are set aside, like abdicated Kings:</l>
               <l>And every moment alters what is done,</l>
               <l>And innovates some Act till then unknown.</l>

               <l>Now sapless on the verge of Death he stands,</l>
               <l>Contemplating his former Feet, and Hands;</l>
               <l>And <hi>Milo-like,</hi> his slacken'd Sinews sees,</l>
               <l>And wither'd Arms, once fit to cope with <hi>Hercules,</hi>

               <l>So <hi>Helen</hi> wept when her too faithful Glass</l>
               <l>Reflected to her Eyes the ruins of her Face:</l>
               <l>Wondring what Charms her Ravishers cou'd spy,</l>
               <l>To force her twice, or ev'n but once enjoy!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thy Teeth, devouring Time, thine, envious Age,</l>
               <l>On Things below still exercise your Rage:</l>
               <l>With venom'd Grinders you corrupt your Meat,</l>
               <l>And then at lingring Meals, the Morsels eat.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nor those, which Elements we call, abide,</l>
               <l>Nor to this Figure, nor to that are ty'd:</l>
               <l>For this eternal World is said of Old</l>
               <l>But four prolifick Principles to hold,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="517" facs="tcp:58868:236"/>
Four different Bodies; two to Heaven ascend,</l>
               <l>And other two down to the Center tend:</l>
               <l>Fire first with Wings expanded mounts on high,</l>
               <l>Pure, void of weight, and dwells in upper Sky;</l>
               <l>Then Air, because unclogg'd in empty space</l>
               <l>Flies after Fire, and claims the second Place:</l>
               <l>But weighty Water as her Nature guides,</l>
               <l>Lies on the lap of Earth; and Mother Earth subsides.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>All Things are mix'd of these, which all contain,</l>
               <l>And into these are all resolv'd again:</l>
               <l>Earth rarifies to Dew, expanded more,</l>
               <l>The subtil Dew in Air begins to soar;</l>
               <l>Spreads as she flies, and weary of her Name</l>
               <l>Extenuates still, and changes into Flame;</l>
               <l>Thus having by degrees Perfection won,</l>
               <l>Restless they soon untwist the Web they spun,</l>
               <l>And Fire begins to lose her radiant Hue,</l>
               <l>Mix'd with gross Air, and Air descends to Dew:</l>
               <l>And Dew condensing, does her Form forego,</l>
               <l>And sinks, a heavy lump of Earth below.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus are their Figures never at a stand,</l>
               <l>But chang'd by Nature's innovating Hand;</l>
               <l>All Things are alter'd, nothing is destroy'd,</l>
               <l>The shifted Scene, for some new Show employ'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then to be born, is to begin to be</l>
               <l>Some other Thing we were not formerly:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="518" facs="tcp:58868:237"/>
And what we call to Die, is not t'appear,</l>
               <l>Or be the Thing that formerly we were.</l>
               <l>Those very Elements which we partake,</l>
               <l>Alive, when Dead some other Bodies make:</l>
               <l>Translated grow, have Sense, or can Discourse,</l>
               <l>But Death on deathless Substance has no force.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>That Forms are chang'd I grant; that nothing can</l>
               <l>Continue in the Figure it began:</l>
               <l>The Golden Age, to Silver was debas'd:</l>
               <l>To Copper that; our Mettal came at last.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Face of Places, and their Forms decay;</l>
               <l>And that is solid Earth, that once was Sea:</l>
               <l>Seas in their turn retreating from the Shore,</l>
               <l>Make solid Land, what Ocean was before;</l>
               <l>And far from Strands are Shells of Fishes found,</l>
               <l>And rusty Anchors fix'd on Mountain-Ground:</l>
               <l>And what were Fields before, now wash'd and worn</l>
               <l>By falling Floods from high, to Valleys turn,</l>
               <l>And crumbling still descend to level Lands;</l>
               <l>And Lakes, and trembling Bogs are barren Sands:</l>
               <l>And the parch'd Desart floats in Streams unknown;</l>
               <l>Wondring to drink of Waters not her own.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Here Nature living Fountains ope's; and there</l>
               <l>Seals up the Wombs where living Fountains were;</l>
               <l>Or Earthquakes stop their ancient Course, and bring</l>
               <l>Diverted Streams to feed a distant Spring.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="519" facs="tcp:58868:237"/>
So <hi>Lycus,</hi> swallow'd up, is seen no more,</l>
               <l>But far from thence knocks out anorher Door.</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>Erasinus</hi> dives; and blind in Earth</l>
               <l>Runs on, and gropes his way to second Birth,</l>
               <l>Starts up in <hi>Argos</hi> Meads, and shakes his Locks,</l>
               <l>Around the Fields, and fattens all the Flocks.</l>
               <l>So <hi>Mysus</hi> by another way is led,</l>
               <l>And, grown a River now disdains his Head:</l>
               <l>Forgets his humble Birth, his Name forsakes,</l>
               <l>And the proud Title of <hi>Caicus</hi> takes.</l>
               <l>Large <hi>Amenane,</hi> impure with yellow Sands,</l>
               <l>Runs rapid often, and as often stands,</l>
               <l>And here he threats the drunken Fields to drown;</l>
               <l>And there his Dugs deny to give their Liquor down.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Anigros</hi> once did wholsome Draughts afford,</l>
               <l>But now his deadly Waters are abhorr'd:</l>
               <l>Since, hurt by <hi>Hercules,</hi> as Fame resounds,</l>
               <l>The Centaurs, in his current wash'd their Wounds.</l>
               <l>The Streams of <hi>Hypanis</hi> are sweet no more,</l>
               <l>But brackish lose the tast they had before.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Antissa, Pharos, Tyre,</hi> in Seas were pent,</l>

               <l>A Parish-Priest, was of the Pilgrim-Train:</l>
               <l>An Awful, Reverend, and Religious Man.</l>
               <l>His Eyes diffus'd a venerable Grace,</l>
               <l>And Charity it self was in his Face.</l>
               <l>Rich was his Soul, though his Attire was poor;</l>
               <l>(As God had cloath'd his own Embassador;)</l>
               <l>For such, on Earth, his bless'd Redeemer bore.</l>
               <l>Of Sixty Years he seem'd; and well might last</l>

Refin'd himself to Soul, to curb the Sense;</l>
               <l>And made almost a Sin of Abstinence.</l>
               <l>Yet, had his Aspect nothing of severe,</l>
               <l>But such a Face as promis'd him sincere.</l>
               <l>Nothing reserv'd or sullen was to see:</l>
               <l>But sweet Regards; and pleasing Sanctity:</l>
               <l>Mild was his Accent, and his Action free.</l>
               <l>With Eloquence innate his Tongue was arm'd;</l>
               <l>Tho' harsh the Precept, yet the Preacher charm'd.</l>
               <l>For, letting down the golden Chain from high,</l>
               <l>He drew his Audience upward to the Sky:</l>

               <l>(A Musick more melodious than the Spheres.)</l>
               <l>For <hi>David</hi> left him, when he went to rest,</l>
               <l>His Lyre; and after him, he sung the best.</l>
               <l>He bore his great Commission in his Look:</l>
               <l>But sweetly temper'd Awe; and soften'd all he spoke.</l>
               <l>He preach'd the Joys of Heav'n, and Pains of Hell;</l>
               <l>And warn'd the Sinner with becoming Zeal;</l>
               <l>But on Eternal Mercy lov'd to dwell.</l>
               <l>He taught the Gospel rather than the Law:</l>
               <l>And forc'd himself to drive; but lov'd to draw.</l>
               <l>For Fear but freezes Minds; but Love, like Heat,</l>
               <l>Exhales the Soul sublime, to seek her Native Seat.</l>

               <l>All this, the good old Man, perform'd alone,</l>

Patience in Want, and Poverty of Mind,</l>

The senseless Plea of Right by Providence,</l>

               <l>Much to himself he thought; but little spoke:</l>

               <l>Thus to the Wilds the sturdy <hi>Cymon</hi> went,</l>
               <l>A Squire among the Swains, and pleas'd with Banishment.</l>
               <l>His Corn, and Cattle, were his only Care,</l>
               <l>And his supreme Delight a Country-Fair.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>It happen'd on a Summers Holiday,</l>
               <l>That to the Greenwood-shade he took his way;</l>
               <l>For <hi>Cymon</hi> shun'd the Church, and us'd not much to Pray.</l>
               <l>His Quarter-Staff, which he cou'd ne'er forsake,</l>
               <l>Hung half before, and half behind his Back.</l>
               <l>He trudg'd along unknowing what he sought,</l>
               <l>And whistled as he went, for want of Thought.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>By Chance conducted, or by Thirst constrain'd,</l>
               <l>The deep Recesses of the Grove he gain'd;</l>
               <l>Where in a Plain, defended by the Wood,</l>
               <l>Crept through the matted Grass a Chrystal Flood,</l>
               <l>By which an Alablaster Fountain stood:</l>
               <l>And on the Margin of the Fount was laid</l>
               <l>(Attended by her Slaves) a sleeping Maid.</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Dian,</hi> and her Nymphs, when tir'd with Sport,</l>
               <l>To rest by cool <hi>Eurotas</hi> they resort:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="545" facs="tcp:58868:250"/>
The Dame herself the Goddess well express'd;</l>
               <l>Not more distinguish'd by her Purple Vest,</l>
               <l>Than by the charming Features of her Face,</l>
               <l>And ev'n in Slumber a superiour Grace:</l>
               <l>Her comely Limbs compos'd with decent Care,</l>
               <l>Her Body shaded with a slight Cymarr;</l>
               <l>Her Bosom to the view was only bare:</l>
               <l>Where two beginning Paps were scarcely spy'd,</l>
               <l>For yet their Places were but signify'd:</l>
               <l>The fanning Wind upon her Bosom blows,</l>
               <l>To meet the fanning Wind the Bosom rose;</l>
               <l>The fanning Wind, and purling Streams continue her repose.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Fool of Nature, stood with stupid Eyes</l>
               <l>And gaping Mouth, that testify'd Surprize,</l>
               <l>Fix'd on her Face, nor cou'd remove his Sight,</l>
               <l>New as he was to Love, and Novice in Delight:</l>
               <l>Long mute he stood, and leaning on his Staff,</l>
               <l>His Wonder witness'd with an Ideot laugh;</l>
               <l>Then would have spoke, but by his glimmering Sense</l>
               <l>First found his want of Words, and fear'd Offence:</l>
               <l>Doubted for what he was he should be known,</l>
               <l>By his Clown-Accent, and his Country-Tone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Through the rude Chaos thus the running Light</l>
               <l>Shot the first Ray that pierc'd the Native Night:</l>
               <l>Then Day and Darkness in the Mass were mix'd,</l>
               <l>Till gather'd in a Globe, the Beams were fix'd:</l>
               <l>Last shon the Sun who radiant in his Sphere</l>
               <l>Illumin'd Heav'n, and Earth, and rowl'd around the Year.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:58868:251"/>
So Reason in this Brutal Soul began:</l>
               <l>Love made him first suspect he was a Man;</l>
               <l>Love made him doubt his broad barbarian Sound,</l>
               <l>By Love his want of Words, and Wit he found:</l>
               <l>That sense of want prepar'd the future way</l>
               <l>To Knowledge, and discols'd the promise of a Day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What not his Father's Care, nor Tutor's Art</l>
               <l>Cou'd plant with Pains in his unpolish'd Heart,</l>
               <l>The best Instructor Love at once inspir'd,</l>
               <l>As barren Grounds to Fruitfulness are fir'd:</l>
               <l>Love taught him Shame, and Shame with Love at Strife</l>
               <l>Soon taught the sweet Civilities of Life;</l>
               <l>His gross material Soul at once could find</l>
               <l>Somewhat in her excelling all her Kind:</l>
               <l>Exciting a Desire till then unknown,</l>
               <l>Somewhat unfound, or found in her alone.</l>
               <l>This made the first Impression in his Mind,</l>
               <l>Above, but just above the Brutal Kind.</l>
               <l>For Beasts can like, but not distinguish too,</l>
               <l>Nor their own liking by reflection know;</l>
               <l>Nor why they like or this, or t'other Face,</l>
               <l>Or judge of this or that peculiar Grace,</l>
               <l>But love in gross, and stupidly admire;</l>
               <l>As Flies allur'd by Light, approach the Fire.</l>
               <l>Thus our Man-Beast advancing by degrees</l>
               <l>First likes the whole, than sep'rates what he sees;</l>
               <l>On sev'ral Parts a sev'ral Praise bestows,</l>
               <l>The ruby Lips, the well-proportion'd Nose,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="547" facs="tcp:58868:251"/>
The snowy Skin, the Raven-glossy Hair,</l>
               <l>The dimpled Cheek, the Forehead rising fair,</l>
               <l>And ev'n in Sleep it self a smiling Air.</l>
               <l>From thence his Eyes descending view'd the rest,</l>
               <l>Her plump round Arms, white Hands, and heaving Breast.</l>
               <l>Long on the last he dwelt, though ev'ry part</l>
               <l>A pointed Arrow sped to pierce his Heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus in a trice a Judge of Beauty grown,</l>
               <l>(A Judge erected from a Country-Clown)</l>
               <l>He long'd to see her Eyes in Slumber bid;</l>
               <l>And wish'd his own cou'd pierce within the Lid:</l>
               <l>He wou'd have wak'd her, but restrain'd his Thought,</l>
               <l>And Love new-born the first good Manners taught.</l>
               <l>An awful Fear his ardent Wish withstood,</l>
               <l>Nor durst disturb the Goddess of the Wood;</l>
               <l>For such she seem'd by her celestial Face,</l>
               <l>Excelling all the rest of human Race:</l>
               <l>And Things divine by common Sense he knew,</l>
               <l>Must be devoutly seen at distant view:</l>
               <l>So checking his Desire, with trembling Heart</l>
               <l>Gazing he stood, nor would, nor could depart;</l>
               <l>Fix'd as a Pilgrim wilder'd in his way,</l>
               <l>Who dares not stir by Night for fear to stray,</l>
               <l>But stands with awful Eyes to watch the dawn of Day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At length awaking, <hi>Iphigene</hi> the Fair</l>

               <l>Unclos'd her Eyes, and double Day reveal'd,</l>

               <l>The slavering Cudden prop'd upon his Staff,</l>
               <l>Stood ready gaping with a grinning Laugh,</l>
               <l>To welcome her awake, nor durst begin</l>
               <l>To speak, but wisely kept the Fool within.</l>
               <l>Then she; What make you <hi>Cymon</hi> here alone?</l>
               <l>(For <hi>Cymon's</hi> Name was round the Country known</l>
               <l>Because descended of a noble Race,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But still the Sot stood silent with Surprize,</l>
               <l>With fix'd regard on her new open'd Eyes,</l>
               <l>And in his Breast receiv'd th' invenom'd Dart,</l>
               <l>A tickling Pain that pleas'd amid the Smart.</l>
               <l>But conscious of her Form, with quick distrust</l>
               <l>She saw his sparkling Eyes, and fear'd his brutal Lust:</l>
               <l>This to prevent she wak'd her sleepy Crew,</l>
               <l>And rising hasty took a short Adieu.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <hi>Cymon</hi> first his rustick Voice essay'd,</l>
               <l>With proffer'd Service to the parting Maid</l>

               <l>So <hi>Cymon</hi> led her home, and leaving there</l>
               <l>No more wou'd to his Country Clowns repair,</l>
               <l>But sought his Father's House with better Mind,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The Father wonder'd at the Son's return,</l>

But doubtfully receiv'd; expecting still</l>
               <l>To learn the secret Causes of his alter'd Will.</l>
               <l>Nor was he long delay'd; the first Request</l>
               <l>He made, was, like his Brothers to be dress'd,</l>
               <l>And, as his Birth requir'd, above the rest.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With ease his Sute was granted by his Syre,</l>
               <l>Distinguishing his Heir by rich Attire:</l>
               <l>His Body thus adorn'd, he next design'd</l>
               <l>With lib'ral Arts to cultivate his Mind:</l>
               <l>He sought a Tutor of his own accord,</l>

               <l>That in short time his Equals he surpass'd:</l>
               <l>His brutal Manners from his Breast exil'd,</l>
               <l>His Mien he fashion'd, and his Tongue he fil'd;</l>
               <l>In ev'ry Exercise of all admir'd,</l>
               <l>He seem'd, nor only seem'd, but was inspir'd:</l>
               <l>Inspir'd by Love, whose Business is to please;</l>
               <l>He Rode, he Fenc'd, he mov'd with graceful Ease,</l>
               <l>More fam'd for Sense, for courtly Carriage more,</l>
               <l>Than for his brutal Folly known before.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>A Load too heavy for his Soul to move,</l>
               <l>Was upward blown below, and brush'd away by Love?</l>
               <l>Love made an active Progress through his Mind,</l>

               <l>Whom thus he chear'd: O <hi>Rhodian</hi> Youth, I fought</l>
               <l>For Love alone, nor other Booty sought;</l>
               <l>Your Lives are safe; your Vessel I resign,</l>

               <l>In <hi>Iphigene</hi> I claim my rightful Due,</l>

               <l>Or if he cou'd, my Love disdains the Laws,</l>
               <l>And like a King by Conquest gains his Cause:</l>
               <l>Where Arms take place, all other Pleas are vain,</l>
               <l>Love taught me Force, and Force shall Love maintain.</l>
               <l>You, what by Strength you could not keep, release,</l>

               <l>While to his Arms the blushing Bride he took;</l>

               <l>And, for she wept, he wip'd her falling Tears,</l>

               <l>Thus far they try'd you, and by Proof they found</l>
               <l>The Grain intrusted in a grateful Ground:</l>

Restor'd it soon will be; the Means prepar'd,</l>

               <l>Be but your self, the Care to me resign,</l>

               <l>And Love our Fortunes in one Band has join'd:</l>
               <l>Two Brothers are our Foes; <hi>Ormisda</hi> mine,</l>
               <l>As much declar'd, as <hi>Pasimond</hi> is thine:</l>
               <l>To Morrow must their common Vows be ty'd;</l>
               <l>With Love to Friend and Fortune for our Guide,</l>

               <l>We with the Fair will sail before the Wind,</l>
               <l>If they are griev'd, I leave the Laws behind.</l>

               <l>Despair in Prison, and abandon Hope;</l>
               <l>But if thou dar'st in Arms thy Love regain,</l>

               <l>Then second my Design to seize the Prey,</l>

For from the first, when Love had fir'd my Mind,</l>
               <l>Resolv'd I left the Care of Life behind.</l>

               <l>Be ready at my Call, my chosen few</l>
               <l>With Arms administer'd shall aid thy Crew.</l>

               </l>
               <l>That one may se his lady day by day,</l>
               <l>But in prison mote he dwell alway,</l>
               <l>That other where him list may ride or go,</l>

               <l>Now deemeth as ye list, ye that can,</l>
               <l>For I woll tell forth my tale, as I began.</l>
               <l>¶ Whan that <hi>Arcite</hi> to <hi>Thebes</hi> comen was,</l>
               <l>Full ofte a day he swelte, and said alas,</l>
               <l>For sene his lady shall he neuer mo;</l>
               <l>And shortely to conclude all his wo,</l>
               <l>So mikell sorowe made neuer creature</l>
               <l>That is or shal be while the world may dure:</l>
               <l>His slepe, his meat, his drinke is him byraft,</l>
               <l>That lean he waxeth, and drye as a shaft:</l>
               <l>His eyen hollow, and grifly to behold,</l>
               <l>His hewe pale, and falowe as asshen colde:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="577" facs="tcp:58868:266"/>
And solitary he was, and euer alone,</l>
               <l>And wailing all the night, making mone;</l>
               <l>And if he heard song or instrument,</l>
               <l>Then would he wepe, he might not stent:</l>
               <l>So feble were his spirites, and so lowe,</l>
               <l>And chaunged so, that no man coude him know:</l>
               <l>His speech, ne his voice, though men it herde,</l>
               <l>As in his gyre, for all the world it ferde.</l>
               <l>Nought comly like to louers malady</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Of heroes, but rather like many</l>
               <l>Engendred of humours melancholike,</l>
               <l>Beforne his fell fantastike:</l>
               <l>And shortely was turned all vp so doun</l>
               <l>Bothe habite and disposicion:</l>
               <l>Of him, this woful louer <hi>Arcite,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What shulde I all day of his wo endite?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whan he endured had a yere or two</l>
               <l>This cruel torment, and this paine and wo</l>
               <l>At <hi>Thebes</hi> in his countre, as I saide,</l>
               <l>Upon a night in slepe as he him laide,</l>
               <l>Him thought how that the winged <hi>Mercury</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Beforne him stode, and bad him be mery:</l>
               <l>His slepy yerde in hande he bare vpright,</l>
               <l>An hatte he wered upon his heares bright,</l>
               <l>Irayed was this god, as he toke kepe</l>
               <l>As he was, whan <hi>Argus</hi> toke his slepe:</l>
               <l>And said him thus, To <hi>Athens</hi> shalt thou wend,</l>
               <l>There is the shapen of thy wo an end.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And with that word <hi>Arcite</hi> awoke and stert;</l>
               <l>Now truly how sore that me smert,</l>
               <l>Quod he: to <hi>Athens</hi> right now woll I fare,</l>
               <l>Ne for no drede of death shall I spare</l>
               <l>To se my lady, that I loue and serue,</l>
               <l>In her presence recke I not to sterue.</l>
               <l>And with that word he caught a great mirror,</l>
               <l>And sawe that chaunged was all his colour,</l>
               <l>And saw his visage all in another kinde:</l>
               <l>And right anon it ran him in his mind,</l>
               <l>That sith his face was so disfigured</l>
               <l>Of malady, the which he had indured,</l>
               <l>He might well, if that he bare him low</l>
               <l>Liue in <hi>Athenes</hi> euermore vnknow,</l>
               <l>And sene his lady welnigh day by day.</l>
               <l>And right anon he chaunged his aray,</l>
               <l>And clad him as a poore labourer,</l>
               <l>And all alone (saue only a squier</l>
               <l>That knew his priuitie and all his caas,</l>
               <l>Which was disgised porely as he was)</l>
               <l>To <hi>Athenes</hi> is he gon the next way,</l>
               <l>And to the court he went upon a day,</l>
               <l>And at the gate he profered his seruice,</l>
               <l>To drugge and draw what men would deuise:</l>
               <l>

And shortly of this matter for to sayne,</l>
               <l>He fell in office with a chamberlayne,</l>
               <l>The which was dwelling with <hi>Emely;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For he was wise, and soon couth espye</l>

               <l>Well couth he hewen wood, and water bere,</l>
               <l>For he was young and mighty for the nones,</l>
               <l>And, therto he was strong and bigge of bones</l>
               <l>To done that any wight gan him deuise:</l>
               <l>A yere or two he was in this seruice,</l>
               <l>Page of the chamber of <hi>Emelye</hi> the bright,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Philostrate</hi> he saied that he hight:</l>
               <l>But halfe so welbeloued man as he</l>
               <l>Ne was there none in court of his degre</l>
               <l>He was so gentill of condition,</l>
               <l>That through all the court was his renon:</l>
               <l>Thei said that it were a charitie</l>
               <l>That <hi>Theseus</hi> wold enhauncen his degre,</l>
               <l>And put him in a wurshipfull seruice,</l>
               <l>There as he might his vertue exercise:</l>
               <l>And thus within a while his name is sprong</l>
               <l>Both of his dedes, and of his good tong;</l>
               <l>That <hi>Theseus</hi> hath taken him so nere,</l>
               <l>That of his chamber he made him squiere;</l>
               <l>And yaue him gold to maintain his degre;</l>
               <l>And eke men brought him out of his contre</l>
               <l>Fro yere to yere full priuely his rent;</l>
               <l>But honestly and slyly he it spent,</l>
               <l>That no man wondered how he it had,</l>
               <l>And thre yere in this wise his life he lade;</l>
               <l>And bare him so in peace and eke in were,</l>
               <l>There was no man that <hi>Theseus</hi> hath der.</l>

               </l>
               <l>The third night, as olde bokes sayne,</l>

               <l>That soon after midnight, <hi>Palamon</hi>

And fleeth the cite as falt as he may go,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The night was short, and fast by the daie,</l>

               </l>
               <l>For shortly this was his opinion,</l>
               <l>That in the groue he would him hide al daie,</l>
               <l>And in the night than wold he take his waie</l>

               <l>On <hi>Theseus</hi> to helpe him to warrie:</l>

               <l>For gentilmen thei were of great estate,</l>
               <l>And nothing but for loue was this debate</l>

               <l>And although his ire her gilt accused,</l>
               <l>Yet in his reason he hem both excused:</l>
               <l>As thus: he thought well that euery man</l>
               <l>Woll helpe himselfe in loue all that he can,</l>
               <l>And eke deliuer himself out of prison;</l>

               <l>And in his gentle hert he thought anone</l>
               <l>And soft vnto himselfe he saied, fie</l>
               <l>Upon a lorde that woll haue no mercie,</l>
               <l>But be a Lion both in worde and deede</l>
               <l>To hem that been in repentance and dreede,</l>
               <l>As well as to a proud dispitous man</l>
               <l>That will maintain that he first began:</l>
               <l>That lorde hath little of discrecion</l>
               <l>That in soch case can no diffinicion,</l>

He came at his commaundement on hie,</l>

               <p>A Gentlewoman out of an Arbor in a Grove, seeth a great company of Knights and Ladies in a Dance upon the green Grass: the which being ended, they all kneel down, and do honour to the Daisre, some to the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and some to the Leaf. Afterward this Gentlewoman learneth by one of these Ladies the meaning hereof, which is this: They which honour the Flower, a thing fading with every Blast, are such as look after Beauty and worldly Pleasure: but they that honour the Leaf, which abideth with the Root, notwithstanding the Frosts and Winter Storms, are they which follow Vertue and during Qualities, without regard of worldly Respects.</p>

                  <hi>Juuenal</hi> saith of pouert merily:</l>
               <l>The poore man, whan he goeth by the way</l>
               <l>Biforne theues he may sing and play.</l>
               <l>Pouert is hatefull good: and as I gesse,</l>
               <l>A full great bringer out of businesse:</l>
               <l>A great amender eke of sapience,</l>
               <l>To him that taketh it in pacience.</l>
               <l>Pouert is, although it seme elenge,</l>
               <l>Possession, that no wight wol challenge.</l>
               <l>Pouerte ful often whan a man is lowe,</l>
               <l>Maketh his god, and eke himselfe to knowe.</l>
               <l>Pouert a spectacle is, as thinketh me,</l>
               <l>Through which one may his very frends se.</l>
               <l>And therefore sin that I you not greue,</l>
               <l>Of my pouert, no more me repreue.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>And certes sir, though none autorite</l>
               <l>Were in no boke, ye gentils of honour,</l>
               <l>Saine, that men shuld an old wight honour,</l>
               <l>And clepe hem father for her gentilnesse.</l>
               <l>And autours shal I finde as I gesse.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now there as ye sain, that I am foule and olde,</l>
               <l>Than drede you not to ben a coke wolde.</l>

               <l>Ben great wardeins vpon chastite.</l>
               <l>But natheles, sin I know your delite,</l>
               <l>I shal fulfill your worldly appetite:</l>
            </lg>

               <l>But at the last he saith in manere:</l>

               <l>For as you liketh it suffiseth me.</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>But I to you be also good and trewe,</l>
               <l>As euer was wife, sithen the world was newe:</l>

               <l>That she so faire was, and so yong therto,</l>
               <l>For ioye he hent her in his armes two:</l>

               <l>That mought done him pleasure or liking.</l>
               <l>And thus they liued vnto her liues ende</l>
