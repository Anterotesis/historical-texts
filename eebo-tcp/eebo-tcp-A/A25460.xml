            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>There were two noysome weeds with which the Garden of the Lord, which is his Church, was then overspread, men being (as if the last
<pb facs="tcp:104618:3"/>
times had been come,) <hi>lovers of themselves: and having</hi> (to colour that) <hi>a form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> which to pluck up so far as I was able was my purpose and resolution at my entry.</p>
            <p>What was done in order to the form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>op, my affections leading me still for the good of that people, whose teacher, in those days of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and darknesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by Gods designment was, and whose attention to the truth of what was then taught, did generally appear unto my comfort, and (I hope) their own good by their conforming thereunto, though contrary to the practise of that age, wherein these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doctrines were delivered, men generally giving up themselves to be shaken to and fro by every wind of doctrine, speaking evil of, &amp; devising devises against those that either stood to, or taught the truth <hi>of the good old way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which last made your honor once merrily shew me, <hi>that if I continued so preaching,</hi> I <hi>should get the whole country about my eares; but,</hi> Sir, <hi>you know</hi> I <hi>did and still do continue so preaching,</hi> that is preaching down the sins of the times; and
<pb facs="tcp:104618:3"/>
my eares, though sometimes they have glowed, are yet untouched, for I never feared, nor valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tongues of men, and against their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Kings laws protected me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> My design was to maintain the power, dignity and purity of these three grand ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, the <hi>Word, Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> which were trod underfoot by the unreasonable men of that age, who like swine rooted up all things though establish'd of God, that were but tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to order, decency or uniformity, that their own opinions, though contrary to all Scripture and their own practises, though contrary to all Saints, might alone be nourished and followed; so highly did they love themselves.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the word was throughly handled, and also that of the Sacraments, though here it be impres'd with some addition; Prayer was not at all touched upon, God casting me providentially upon subjects of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, untill I gave a farewell to your honour and that people.</p>
            <p>Knowing with what the inhabitants of that place was most affected, I was zealous, after three years divertisment, to fall upon that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb facs="tcp:104618:4"/>
of prayer, and more largely in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars go through the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to publish all unto the world. And since Epistles Dedicatory in this kind are usual, unto whose patronage can I better come then unto your Worships, being assured alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of your good will, both to the Doctrine taught, and to the Teacher of it, as appeared by those many noble favours which your bounty was pleased to throw upon him.</p>
            <p>Accept then, Right Honourable, into your hand, what for the most part you heard by the ear, for should I say all, I am perswaded your Honor would not believe me, here are only the main pillars upon which the doctrine stood, with some small addition in the questions, the rest are enlargments as they dropped from my pen in my <hi>Christmas</hi> and <hi>Lent</hi> meditations.</p>
            <p>Hoping for your Honours acceptance, I close this Epistle, assuring your Honor that he is not unmindful when he is before God of your self and family, who once was and still desires to be,</p>

                  <p>Every Heretick stands confident in his errour, and each se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer pleads for a belief of his Doctrine, by imposing the name Church upon those whom they have so seduced and made Proselytes to their Hereticall Tenets, by which means the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fabtick of the Catholick Church is like a lodge in a Garden of Cucumbers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sleighted and disesteemed of many; we shall stand therefore a short season upon this holy ground,

Her hasty departure occasion'd betwixt Love and fear, longing to be with her beloved, and fearing to be devoured by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and unreasonable men, who like Foxes have encompassed her about, purposing to tear her in pieces, from whom that she may be delivered, she assumes the wings of a great Eagle, and maketh her nest above the stars.</p>
                  <p>For her breadth or Latitude, by my Creed I see her of an infinite and inconceiveable extension. I believe that the Church is catholick; she is as broad as the World, as old as the Creation; her age you may suppose to be attended with weaknesse, but it is not; the last visit that Christ her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band made her, renewed her strength like an Eagle, so that shee walks and is not weary, she runs yet is not faint, holds pace with eternity it self.

                  <p>By the same Perspective or Fiduciary Optick Nerve, I see her of a comely and beautifull proportion, and holy uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I believe that the Catholick Church is holy. The Kings Daughter is glorious within, Christ her Spouse is ravished with the beauty of her eyes. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4 9.

<list>
                                 <item>1. The efficient cause, Gods <hi>Eternal decree.</hi> There are none made members of the Church by chance, nor by their own care and industry; who by taking thought can adde one Cubit to his Stature; and he is high with a witnesse, who hath his head above the clouds. None shall sit in the Kingdome of God. but they for whom it is prepared of the Father. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.23. And it is prepared for them before the Foundation of the World. God by his decree must separate Believers from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104618:15"/>
among<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men or faith shall never purifie the hearts of men, and Election must precede Vocation. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15. The least blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of true holinesse will never grow, nor never was seen to bloom upon that stem whose root was not Predestination. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4, 5.</item>
                                 <item>2. The Instrumentall cause, which is their Call, by the Word of the Lord: this is the means used for the bringing of many Sons and Daughters into glory. It is the charge of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to the Apostles, to hear his Son. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.5. It is the charge of the Son, that the Apostles preach to the World. <hi>Matthew</hi> 28.18, 19. And by the benediction of the Spirit, by that there is added to the Church dayly such as shal be saved <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47. None shall be glorified but such as are called with a holy calling: we must hear the joyfull sound of his Word, before we can see the glory of his countenance: for whom he glorifieth he justifieth, and whom he justifieth them he also calls. <hi>Rom,</hi> 8.30. This Call is so necessary to the Churches being, that the Greek Word for Church comes from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                                       <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                    </gap> from their being called: and indeed none shall be crowned with the Lamb, but such as fight with him, and none shall fight under him, but such as are called, chosen and faithfull. <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.14.
<p>We have those that pretend a call in this generation, but we have cause to suspect it is not by the word of the Lord; for if so, they would be holy without blame before him in love, <hi>Ephesians</hi> 1.4. They would be full of love (were they full of the Spirit) and of joy, peace, long-suffering, gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith, <hi>Galathians</hi> 5.22. Bitternesse, wrath, anger, clamor, and evill speaking should be far from them with all malice. <hi>Ephesians</hi> 1.31. The word of Christ we are to look after, if we seek to obtain glory; for that leads unto it. <hi>Revelations</hi> 22.7. And we are to entertain it in our hearts if we would have that to shine upon our heads; the same Doctrine is taught us by the Church of England, <hi>Art.</hi> 17.</p>
                                    <p>Yet we must understand this calling of or by the word, to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104618:15"/>
be onely necessary, First, when God is pleased to give the word. Secondly, to those persons, who are of years, wit or discretion, to understand the word; or Thirdly, where God hath given the naturall meanes for the hearing or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his word.</p>
                                 </item>
                                 <item>3. The formal cause, remotely described, <hi>Separated from amongst the rest of mankind</hi>; by consequence, these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have a union among themselves, by which they are constituted a Church; for in that union (of which more shall be spoken afterwards) that they have among themselves, and that conjunction that they have with Christ, cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>sts the formality of their so being. Let the world or reprobate be doing what they please, they are doing good works which God hath ordained they should walk in, knowing that they are created in Christ Jesus for that very end and purpose. <hi>Ephesians</hi> 2.10. As <hi>Mathew</hi> was called from the receipt of custome, so God by his word calls this elected company from all other; and they denying all ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, live soberly towards themselves, righteously towards their neighbours, and holily towards God, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.12. doing for him, suffering for him, and by all opportunities bringing glory to his name, which brings us to the last branch of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.

he came into the world; for this end did the Apostles preach to the world; nay for this end did God create the world, for this end he preserveth the world, and for this end he shall put an end to the world,</p>
                  <p>This world shall remain no longer, at least as to its Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall use, then this glorious company is gathering together; when they are all met, then Christ himself resignes the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Mediatorship, and delivers up the power that is called authority into the hands of the Father. 1. <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 15.24.

Then shall John the Baptist see his penitents, Peter his converts, Paul his followers, the prophets of the Lord see all the Lords people. Then shal the Angles see their Wards, God all his sons, and Christ all his members. What a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearance will there be, what a ravishing heavenly Quire, what an Anthem shall there harmoniously be sung when the gates of Heaven shall as it were be shut (their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more to enter,) and these be made welcome by the mutual, admirable and ineffable embracements of God and Christ; me thinks I see Christ and his believers like Joseph and Benjamin, falling upon each others necks, not weeping but shouting for joy; and what will the Cherubines and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phines those ministers of God, who pitched their Tents about the Saints, think and say, when the glorious company of the Apostles, the goodly fellowship of the prophets, the whole Army of Martyrs, the holy Church throughout all the world, with palmes in their hands, and crowns on their heads, going to fill those seats prepared for them, and to raign as Kings with the Lamb for ever and ever! Hallelujah Hallelujah.</p>
                  <div type="part">

                     <head>Further this holy Church is usually divided into the Church Triumphant and Church Militant,</head>
                     <p>First, Triumphant; the Prophets, do they live (that is on earth) for ever? no they are gone to Heaven before us; they have run their race and finished their course, and they are gone to receive, yea they have already obtained their Crown, 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 4.7. They have been called, they have fought, they have conquered, and now they triumph. They have suffered, they have laboured, they hoped, and now they have received their inheritance. They have run and have not been wearied, they have heard and never doubted, they have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and never discontented, and now they have received the kingdome promised.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Militant; some part of the Church is yet upon the earth; there is a party yet singhing, praying, watching against spiritual wickednesse in high places. And yet these two are but one Church, differing as one part of an Army that has conquered, routed, and shouted, doth from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, yet in the valley, fighting, striving, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending.</p>
                     <p>Again, this Militant Church, that is yet under the crosse and fighting against Principalities and Powers, is either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible or visible.</p>
                     <p>First, Invisible; and this comprehends the whole number of them who are not onely outwardly called but inwardly qualified for Heaven; they have true faith that none can see, they have that new name that none knowes but he that hath it. <hi>Revelations</hi> 2.17. They are redeemed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, though they dwell with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are become the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb, <hi>Revelations</hi> 14.4. Their bodyes are Temples of the holy Ghost, and from the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104618:17"/>
altar of their broken hearts, they are offering Sacrifices to God alway; these are they whose names are in the Book of life, <hi>Revelations</hi> 20.12. known onely to him that knoweth all things, yea the hidden things of the heart.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Visible; and this comprehends those who are outwardly called to the Lambs Supper, by the sounding of the Gospel in their ears, and own it in their profession, believes what the word holds out, and embrace the Sacraments it commands, expecting salvation from Christ, the substance of the Law and Prophets, that Christ hath ascended up on high and led Captivity Captive, having received gifts for men, that he might give gifts to men, <hi>Ephesians</hi> 48. which gift of God through Jesus Christ, he hopes shall lead him to eternal life. <hi>Romans</hi> 6.23.</p>
                     <p>Now this visible Church is either personall, or nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall.</p>
                     <p>First personall, and so it signifies one that professeth the most holy faith, disowning all Heathenish and Jewish wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, (so far as it is abolished) desiring to dye; as for the present, he lives in that Faith given to the Saints, and so eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Christian is a personal Church, and in that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduality is the Lambs Spouse.</p>
                     <p>Secondly National, and so it comprehends all Believers living in such a Country, Place, or Province, holding up the profession of the Gospel, by holy Laws, as a City set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Hill, that they that are like to turn into the flocks of the companions, may know whether to turn and sets up the light of the Gospel, that all may know what God it is that they worship, and may learn by their order to believe in the same Christ. To this kind of Church did the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> write most of his Epistles, to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and as in the text to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> that is to the company of believers that lived in and about those Cities and Countries, called to be Saints. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2.</p>
                     <p>This National Church as the case now stands with us, and for the better understanding of some things hereafter to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, must be divided into the Romish Church and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104618:17"/>
First, The Romish Church: by this we understand all those Christians that hold the new invented Doctrine of the Church of Rome, that believe as that Church believes, and in all points conform thereunto, either in point of practice or in point of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The reformed Church: by this we understand those believers whether Nationall or Provinciall, that have forsaken the Church of Rome, so far as she hath forsaken the truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and cleave to the Ancient Doctrin taught in the Catholick Church, whether by the Lord or by his Apostles or by Ministers sent from them, whether taught at Jerusalem, Antioch, Athens, or at Rome it selfe, disowning the Doctrine of Purgatory, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead, worshiping of Saints, or what ever as is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to true Doctrine, such are the reformed Churches of France, Helvetia, Basil, Bohemia, Belgie, Auspurge: Wittemburge, Saxony, Scotland, or England, whose Doctrine in these and such other points opposing Rome, as may be seen in their publick confessions.</p>
                     <p>Now know that all these together are but one and the same Church diversly considered, for as the great Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is dangerous, to make it the ground of my faith, of which I have no surer testimony then he or they sayes so.
<p>The Popes we know have sinfully erred, whom they would make the Church virtual, &amp; Councels have erred whom they would make the Church representative; the Councels of <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Constance</hi> cannot both be true. <hi>Peter</hi> erred, <hi>Demas</hi> may fall back, <hi>Laodicea</hi> may lose her first love: Its hard to make a sound Christian believe he shall be damned for not doing that, or not believing that, which God hath nowhere commanded, or spoken of.

The Catholick Church calls upon her members not to do that, and good reason too; the Son of God would not (though he might urge his own authority) plead for a beliefe but upon a Scripture account, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. and <hi>Paul</hi> desires to be followed no further than he follows Christ: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. and those <hi>Bereans</hi> are made noble for searching the Scriptures, whether the things that were spoken by <hi>Paul</hi> were true or no, <hi>Acts</hi> 17 11.

Art. 20. of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Art. 1. of the Church of <hi>Bohem,</hi> In which Article there are two reasons given for this truth: 1. because the Scriptures were inspired and taught by the holy Ghost, confirmed by heavenly testimonies, which spirit discovers to men how it ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; for Prophecie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Besides the Lord himself saieth Search the Scriptures, And again, <hi>Ye are deceived not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Because that is a true and sure testimony, and a clear proof of Gods favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good-will which he hath revealed concerning himself, such things as are necessary to doctrine, to discipline and government of the holy Church, are all fully and absolutely so comprehended, then which no Angel can bring any thing more certain, and if he should, he ought not to be believed. For which cause saies that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in our Churches, the Scriptures are rehearsed to the hearers in the vulgar tongue, and especially (according to the ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Church,) those portions of the Gospel in Scripture, which are wont to be read on solemn daies out of the Evangelists and Apostles writings, and are usually called the Epistles and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels: The whole stream of the confessions of reformed Churches runs against <hi>Rome</hi> in this.</item>

Men should by this never be assured of their Salvation, nor of their good estare; it might be necessary for thy Salvation to do that this day, which might not be done if I would be saved the next; for as the Rulers of the Church uttered their judgments upon the light of reason, I must judge my self in a happy or in a forlorn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; which is contrary to that Catholick doctrine: Make your calling and Election sure: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. which could never be done, did it lye upon the fine flourishes of an Oratour, or distinction of a Canonist sitting in counsell. And indeed this may be one cause why the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> denies the possibility of a firm assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of future glory, contrary to the text above named.</item>

Now from this very action, we may conclude the truth of that position now under defence; for by the prohibition of the one it should seem to be practised, and by enjoyning the other it should seem to be neglected. The former might seem a needlesse ceremony: what matter were it whether women are covered or no? the other might be thought in some sence hurtfull, that they might not speak with those tongues which God by his Spirit (that bloweth where and when it listeth) did furnish them withall in the Church: but the Apostles had power, and they give the Officers of the Church power to rectifie that errour, or in any other that in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should have a tendency to the robbing of the Church of that order that ought to be in it.

There are generall precepts given to the Officers of the Churches, which are gravidated with this power, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates that they have a commission to impose such ceremonies as they shall think fit, for the good of that Church whereof they are Governours. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> not knowing what should befall him at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whether he was going from <hi>Miletus,</hi> sent for the Elders of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and charges them (when he was gone) <hi>to take heed to the Flock, over which the Holy Ghost had made them O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseers</hi>; soreseeing that grievous Wolves should enter the flock. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.

From the liberty therefore that was given to the Jewish Tabernacle, Synagogue, or Temple (for we may judge, there were after Ceremonies brought in, as there occurred necessity or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency) we may argue the power of the Christian Church (even in reference to ceremonies) whose liberty is by Christs death more large then theirs, in all respects, and surely not diminished in this.</item>

                        <p>For the opening of this Question, we must note, that when the Church is said to compell, it is neither to imprison nor to fine, those being altogether out of their Verge and dominion, excep you imply that the Church-Officer be likewise in civill authority, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise Jurisdiction in that capacity; or if you consider the civill Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer a Church member, and in that sence the Church some way may be said to do it. We shall consider the Church-Officer abstractly as no civill Officer, but in that capacity that he bears toward the the Church; and by compelling we hold out or mean no other thing then the utmost of the Churches power and largest extent, and the execution of that highest Act of Justice, wherein her Lord and Husband hath invested her, to free both him and herself from contempt, by which she hath authority to command and to punish those who wilfully absent themselves from her service, without such reasons as the Church her self shall be satisfied withal; for who ever went to hell without a reason?</p>
                        <p>And let none quarrel with the word Compel, to omit the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of it, which holds out the sence before spoken of, we finde in the great Supper, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.6. the Master giving a charge to his servants to call his Guests; some excused themselves, yea all gave reasons for their absence, to flesh and blood satisfactory. Then they were to go to the Streets and Lines of the City, chief places possibly affording Guests sufficient for the filling up of the House, and eating of the Supper, for it was now ready, and yet the Table was not filled. (I dare say the Son of <hi>Ieffes</hi> place was not empty; None who is like Gods own heart but will appear f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Probably many might excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or pretend other businesse at this invitation; but the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants could not help it, onely rold their Lord that what had been concluded of him, was performed by them. The Master being
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104618:25"/>
herewith provoked, charges the Servants the third time, to go to the High-wayes and Hedges and compell them; they had bidden and invited, and exhorted, and perswaded them before, now they must take no excuse but <hi>Compell,</hi> and by some circumstances in the text, he that wanted a wedding garment, appears to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber so forced; and by this was the house filled, and the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. The guests were clean, but not all, one was found unfitted for such a table, he is charged with it: He had nothing to say for himself, he knew that the servants told him they must do it, and that by their Lords direction, and therefore he urges not their compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as a reason of his own unpreparation; they were to bring him in, but he must fit himself for so noble a company, and plentifull entertainment.</p>
                        <p>Now that the Master here is the Lord Jesus or Christ the Kings Son, and that the feast are those ways and Ordinances by which Christ feeds both Jew, Gentil, them were first bidden, and them that lay in the lanes and hedges, and that the servants are the Ministers of the Church, by whose Preaching and Doctrine they are called to come to the Lord Christ for Salvation, is granted almost by all, and how often the man without the wedding garment, in chains, is set at the Chancel door, to perswade Communicants to a worthy receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords Supper, is knovvn to all. So that there is no need to quarrel with the Word, but rather fear the thing, and not put the Church to compulsion; which denotes the utmost of her power (of which afterward) to reduce her members, family or children to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and compell them to come in to her Ordinances.

Let us now come to the point; and that the Church hath power to compell any that is of her body, (I mean such as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were cast out by her, for all others are, their own Apostacy from her, takes not away her relation from them) to come to her Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, seems to be true doctrine by these Arguments follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                        <p>It may be easily foreseen that the man who thus separates himself, will pretend conscience for his separation. The mixt congregation possibly will defile his holy heart, and his conscience perswades him that the doctrin generally approved by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is not according to Godliness; and he verily believes, that our Churches being builded by Papists are Dens of theives.

What disorders fell upon the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> when their Kings and Princes took no notice of it, is clear. How God was worshipped, is known, and what in our days will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall her, if Magistrates act, not is easily to be conjectured.

<p>It were dangerous to leave all men to their own practices and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in matters of Religion; Heresie might passe for Divinity, and the doctrine of Divells might passe for that of God; And how could it be restrained?

There is no such power in the Word <hi>Presbytery</hi> so met (that I know off) as to ham-string any man from entering the Pulpit, or Tongue-tye him when he is in it: so that either the civill Magistrate must be medling, or there will be no obeying.</p>

The Church hath Noble Titles given her in Scripture, and good Laws, wil give her in the sight of men dignity thereunto: there is honourable mention made of all the Ordinances of the Church, and through faith they have got a good report: it is fitting that their mouths be stopped that would defaine them, and do slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in the face of her own people.

<p>It is plain, that the wisdom of Hereticks aims at this point; and taking away, or preaching down such things as put an outward Majesty upon the face of Religion, it brings them to be hail fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows with God, to be of no Religion; and he that is once so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, will easily expel all thoughts of reverence to him whom God hath made his Lord, and revolt from their King with as little reluctation as they turned from God; and what may be the issue of these things, is not much to be questioned; even every man to do that that is right in his own eyes.

For this reason the hands of Kings are at this day kissed, by which their Subjects declare their subjection; that they shall be ready to wait upon him, at the putting out of his hand; and by it they tacitely promise, to be as faithfull to him as his own

right arm. To <hi>kiss the Son</hi> therefore, is, to acknowledge subjection to him, that they owe and hold their Crowns of him, and withall to be faithfull to his Crown and Service; and that in their publick as well as private capacity; not onely as he is a Christian, but as he is a King; that as a Master in his House, and as a Father over his Children, by his Authority to keep his Subjects in subjection to the King of Kings.
<p>Now what more immediate way can the Son be honoured than by taking care of his Spouse for to preserve her in Honor, and maintain her in the full enjoyment and free possession of those things which her Husband left her, <hi>until the second coming</hi>? for the Church is the Lambs Wife.

It is not for a show onely that Kings wear Crosses upon the top of their Crowns; but signifies that the Honour of him that died upon the Cross, is to be maintained by him that wears it. In a word, let's abhor and excommunicate the thoughts, even deliver them over unto Sathan, that would make a distinction between a Kings publick and private capacity; when it is done to smite him with the tongue, and divest him of that power, which as King is given him of God; especially since we know what cursed acts, and blasphemous words were the consequences of them in late years.</p>

                        <p>And <hi>Timothy</hi> who was Ordained by the same Apostle, the First Bishop of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> had a charge in the Epistle sent unto him, to commit the Doctrine to faithful men, that they might be able to teach others. 2.

                        <p>Now let us go to the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and ask those Elders or Presbyters that were in every City, what power and Authority they have to dispense the Word and Sacraments, &amp;c? Since there is a Church constituted, by what Authority therefore do you, you, you? The Answer will be, I had it from such a one; he from him, and he from him, and he from him, and he from such a one, and he from <hi>Timothy,</hi> and he from the Presbytery, where <hi>Paul</hi> was present.</p>
                        <p>But now we call to mind, What Authority had <hi>Paul</hi> to ordain? for Christ ordained none but his Disciples; could <hi>Paul</hi> therefore give that Power to another, which he never had himself? Is not <hi>Paul</hi> in this irregular, presuming to ordain <hi>Timothy</hi> a Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, he having no such power given unto him by Christ? For the understanding of this, cast your eye upon <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2. in which place we finde, that after <hi>Saul,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> hath given good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the truth of his conversion (for the Church was at first afraid of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.26.) we finde a meeting of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and as they were ministring to the Lord, or exercising their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry (let it be in preaching and praying, for the Text will hold it out) the holy Ghost calls, saying, <hi>Separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away,</hi> &amp;c. These two were called before by God for the Work of the Ministry, that the holy Ghost witnesseth in these words, <hi>for the work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I have called them.</hi> In a word, qualified they were for that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104618:36"/>
work, and of their Abilities the Church had sufficient experience; but now that that order might not be subverted, which in the Church by Christ and his Apostles had been constituted, <hi>Separation,</hi> that is, a solemn setting of them apart from all other Members, by consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting them Church-officers, is required by the holy Ghost, that in their going thorow the World, they might have power to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute others; and also be looked upon by the Church, as men sent of God in an authoritative way, for preaching of the Word, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Sacraments, and exercising the power of the Keys, not onely by their inward Qualification, but by external Ordination, that Law being established. When a gifted-Brother, who boasts of an inward Call, can give as good testimony to the Church as <hi>Paul</hi> is able to do touching his power, none but beasts will move their tongues against them; and when they can shew their Abilities to the Church to be deserving, I dare promise to any, that they may have Ordination; which <hi>Paul</hi> (though I suppose as well qualified as they) after trial received and had, and that by especial order (the Church it seems being backward, by reason of his former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a persecutor, and desirous of further trial) from God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent irregularity, or any breach (though in so eminently a gifted person) of that Law, which Christ had appointed in his Church. Thus <hi>Timothy</hi> can make good his Ordination to be Apostolical in each part. Bring this line down again; By the Ministers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of <hi>Antioch</hi> was <hi>Paul</hi> ordained; he ordains <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> again gave this power to other faithfull men, sometimes ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Deacons, and sometimes Priests; and so throughout the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> though afterward it languished, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9. and whether <hi>Timothy</hi> be the Angel that that Epistle is sent unto, is uncertain; but certain, that all the Presbyters and Deacons in the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> are able to produce their power as Church-officers from the Apostles; who were, as before was said, the Masters of our <hi>Israel</hi>; and he that would be owned a Church-officer, shall be owned by me, producing his power from them, or deducing that power from them to himself, according to that Apostolical way constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Church of Christ, and in all the Churches of the Saints. But of Ordination, by Gods help we shall speak more at large, when we come to that Ordinance in particular.</p>

Or ought they to receive that power from the People? For from the beginning the Church had never such power given to her. Ordination is an act of Authority; and the power of ruling was never in the People, but in her Officers.

                        <p>In one thing <hi>Micha</hi> is to have his due applause, he would have none to offer Sacrifice in his House (a priestly Office) before he were consecrated, <hi>i.e.</hi> before he were ordained Priest; he had read in the Law what Sacrifices &amp; Duties were appointed in the designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men into that Office; his Son, nor the Levites not being of that line, unto whom by a natural succession the Office belonged, he saw a necessity of making them Priests; for he must worship God; and if they be Priests, they must be consecrated; he knows nor how or where to procure another; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Why did they not inform the Church, that though God was pleased to receive the Children of the Jews so far into his favour, as to give them the outward sign of his Covenant with the Fathers, <hi>viz.</hi> by circumcision, yet would not have the Children of Christians to receive the outward sign of his Covenant with their Fathers, <hi>viz.</hi> by Baptism? Why did they not inform us that there were none baptized, nor none should account themselves baptized, except they were plunged or dipped in a River? And that any member of the Church might do that: why did he not tell us that it was and would be a sin for one to teach his child to say the Lords Prayer or call God father, since they had no faith in Christ? Why do they not shew us that to be in a place hearing his word, with those that were not all holy, was a great sin before God and that there should be a parity in the Church of God; That no civill Magistrate hath any power at all, to be command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to be done in the Church of God; and that no Christian ought to pray in a set form; and therefore that the Lords prayer was not to be used, yea was as abominable unto God as Swines flesh unto a Jew (as I have read, some of them do) however we know it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used by them all.

But what am I doing? If these be true Churches, and this Doctrine true Gospel, the Apostles have been faithlesse and unjust, (I speak it trembling) for no such thing did they ever teach, but the contrary; we finde them often times in the Scripture, handling those very points and laies down contrary conclusions; particularly <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. speaking of Priest-hood in generall, and of Christs in particular (who is the high Priest of the Gospel,) saies, <hi>no man taketh this honour to himself but he that is called, as was Aaron.</hi> And that <hi>Aaron</hi> had an outward call for that Office, and was deputed, and set apart for that function in a publick way, is clear from <hi>Ex.</hi> 29. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 9.</p>

And truly, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants should dye, having no sin, since death is the wages of sin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 23. is a Doctrine that either charges God with unjustice, or St. <hi>Paul</hi> with a falshood, or at least a grosse mistake.</p>

                        <p>The sin of Separation is so infectious, that in Scripture we are to separate from them that so do. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. There is a Rule in Divinity, that wil make the sin of separation to be great; it is this; Those sins are the greatest, which are most contrary to, and do most oppose the greatest of Christian vertues or graces. Now they are recorded, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. Now abideth <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> but the greatest of these three is Charity: Now by the Rule, distrust in Gods promises, or in his power, is a great sin, it being a sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hope. Heresie or a stout persisting in an errour, is a far greater sin; for it is a sin against faith, and seeks to cover, conceal, if not to destroy the truth. Now Charity is greater then either of these; that follows therefore that that sin that destroys the peace of the Church, &amp; untyes the Ligatures by which the whole body is compact together is the greatest: but this doth the sin of Separation, a thing by this age of no account; yet they wil find it of great moment in the day of their Account.</p>
                        <p>It is a sin generally accompanied with the other lusts of the flesh, <hi>viz.</hi> Hatred, Varience, Emulations, Strife, Wrath, which seldome lurks long in a Corner, but in time appears in the field, in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and acts of Murtherers, Ravishers, Traytors, and all with the voyce of <hi>Iacob,</hi> pretending Godlinesse and conscience, as Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do abundantly show. But to answer the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</p>
                        <p>So long as a Church makes no separation from Christ, no separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be made from it, but to keep in it is the duty and safety, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and happinesse of him that would enjoy the Communion of Saints, the forgivenesse of sins, the Resurrection of the body unto life Everlasting.</p>
                        <p>A Church separates from Christ two ways.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When she overthrows the foundation of that Doctrine that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104618:51"/>
is laid by Christ: the foundation of all truth is already laid; and he that goes to overthrow that, may be said to turn from it. Do we see a society of men, whether Nationally or Domestically, whether openly or secretly, going in that road that thwarteth the foundation or fundamental points of Religion? there must be a separation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. whether it be in the adding to these fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, as if they were not sufficient; or taking from them, as if they were redundant, or superfluous: This made the Reformed Churches beyond Sea, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> to separate from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath both taken from, and added to those fundamental Truths, whereupon the Church was by the Lord and his Apostles erected and builded. Having to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures added some Books, as the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> makes the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be an imperfect Rule, and must have Traditions to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it: That the sense and meaning of the Scripture depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Churches authority; That in all matters of Controversie, not the Scriptures, but the Church must be the Judge. They have made five Sacraments more then Christ made. They have clearly blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out the whole body of the second Commandment out of the first Table of the Law in several Books. That Infants that die without Baptism, are eternally separate from God, except they be as it were martyred; by which martyrdom they are baptized <hi>Baptismo sanguinis,</hi> with their own blood. They teach that men are not justified by Faith alone before God. They make Saints and holy men departed, assistant in the work of reconciling us to God, and therefore maintain they must be prayed unto. That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Purgatory must be believed, if we would be saved. That the efficacy of the Sacraments, depends upon the worthiness or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the giver. That Baptism totally abolisheth Original sin. That the real fleshly body of Christ is in the Bread at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as soon as the Priest pronounceth the words, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> this is my body; if he should say, <hi>Corpus mea,</hi> it were no Sacrament: They take the Wine, or keep the Cup from the Laity in that Sacrament. That the wine in that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance must be mingled with water; that that Sacrament is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable not only for the living, but for the dead. The Priest is not to bless a second marriage. They baptize Bells with the very words
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104618:52"/>
of Baptism, and by that they teach Devils are drove from the Church (O <hi>Romanists,</hi> great is your Faith!) and give them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names.

                        <p>What <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>Timothy</hi> in this place to do, he practiseth himself in another, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.9. yet probably in one and the same City, was it both done by <hi>Paul,</hi> and to be done by <hi>Timothy</hi>: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> some there were that believed his word, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not, but hardened their heart, speaking evil of him, and of the Gospel. After he had preached three moneths, and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the things concerning the Kingdom of God, he separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Disciples; he would not have those Believers that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Truth, to be in any Church-fellowship with those that spoke against it.</p>

                        <p>Not that there is a separation to be made from all the Doctrine of <hi>Rome</hi>; for she holds many great mysteries of Divinity purely and soundly, wherein we must, and do all agree with her as Christians; but he that is a true member of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it now

stands, he must believe that the least coal in Purgatory is very near as hot as hell; he must believe the least point of Reliques with as strong a faith as the greatest mysteries of the God-head; and if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any of the former, he is no lesse an Heretick then if he had denied the latter; and he that believes not the Churches tradition to be as necessary to be believed as the Epistles of Paul, he cannot be saved. Indeed there is not an Article of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is Catholick, wherein reformed Churches differ from her: but in those Articles that are but of Yesterday, such as those above mentioned, they stand at a distance praying for her, but loth to touch her, she being not sick of a small Ague, but hath running sores, Ulcers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Pestilential humours within her; which makes them write over her, as if she were visited, <hi>Lord have mercy upon her,</hi> but dare not make themselves one body with her.</p>

                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:104618:53"/>Neither must we take things indifferent for doctrine, nor every blemish for fundamentall Heresie. It is an errour in our age to take Circumstances and outward Ceremonies for essentiall parts of worship. There was much corruption in the Church of the Jews in our Saviours time: and much false glosses put upon the Law: yet in regard the fundamentals were not razed, he commanded his disciples to hear even the Pharisees, (who yet were thieves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, being none of those appointed to expound the Law, which justified not their manner of teaching, but the truth of the doctrine taught) who sate in <hi>Moses</hi> chair. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.1, 2, 3. but gives them a Caveat to beware of the practices, and leven of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, that is hearken and obey to those truths and fundamental pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, that they give out &amp; teach to be in my Fathers Law, first taught by <hi>Moses,</hi> as cirumcision, the way and manner of the Sacrifices, which in the Jewish Church were necessary points; but refuse those things they lay down as from tradition, as <hi>Corban,</hi> washing of cups; for not these but the other are commanded you to do.</p>
                        <p>Moreover you must be sure not to separate your selves from those who possibly are ignorant of the depths of Sathan in that particular doctrine delivered: for Christ pities such, and speaks comfortably to them. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.4. nor from others whom you can perceive in the least to disown that corrupted doctrine though privately, being troubled at the razeing out of necessary principles. How many poor souls are led away from the truth, by those that creep into houses in our days, that are ignorant possibly of the designes of their prime Teachers, following them as much as the people followed <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> (viz.) in the simplicity of their heart! these giving great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to those that so teach, makes them bolder to go on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the unity of the faith: showing the Number of their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, loving to hear those Doctrines that either add to or take from the infallible and unalterable rule of the Word, in both which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is erroneous, and therefore the separation from her justifiable,</p>

                        <p>In the opening of this Question, knowing the times wherein I live, and the fewnesse of my years, I will not shew you my opinion, but you shall hear the Judgement of a Master in our <hi>Israel,</hi> that was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered with gray hairs to his Fathers, and lately fell asleep.</p>
                        <p>One Religion is to be Tolerated, and no more to be publickly taught then one.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. As there is but one truth, so there ought to be but one Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; for false Religions either teach to worship false Gods, or else in a false way and manner to worship the true God; which made God himself in constituting the Church of the Jews, in a strict manner to give charge touching that: and in his constituting the Church of the Christians to do the same, by commanding them
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104618:55"/>
to stone that Prophet that taught otherwise, and us to curse that Angel that should teach other Doctrine then he did then by <hi>Moses,</hi> and now to us by his Son, give, teach, command and appoint, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There is but one Church, which is the ground and pillar of truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. and one Spirit to lead that Church in the way of truth; and therefore there ought to be but one Religion, which is the Doctrine of that one Truth.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is but one way to heaven, and eternal Life, in which way few, through ignorance and errour, walk or find; and ways to Hell and destruction, which many, through corrupted nature, fall in and run in: It is dangerous to have, or to suffer any to stand. at the head of that way to call in Passengers from that road which leadeth unto life, since men of themselves are apt and prone enough to turn from it, and go in the contrary path.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Religion is the foundation of States and Kingdoms; and diversity of foundations will never keep up long a building; herein we find those States in Scripture to stand surest, whose Kings feared God; and they that feared, put down all false worship.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Religion is the band and cord by which the unity of the State is preserved: if there be heard diversities of Doctrine, and the unity of Faith broken, either the people are divided in their affections, or among themselves, and against their Princes or their Governours. Hence proceed burnings, emulations, strifes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, malice, sedition, faction, Rebellion, Innovation, treachery and disobedience, and infinite more mischiefs.

                        <p>It is observable, that the Angels of the Church are reproved for bearing with, or suffering them so to do; and they were the Church Officers, Ministers, or Bishops; by which it seems they had power and authority to restrain and controul them, to pull them out of their pulpits, and to stop their mouths. Whether they were Lords or no, let their power and authority speak; to do this was Lord-like in my apprehension; and not to do it was a ground of Gods accusation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.19, 20.</p>
                        <p>This Authority, was it from heaven, or of men? If from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then Church Officers have power to controul, and put down both <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Iezabel,</hi> and to stop their mouths, and yet not to be accused for Factious. If of men, then Church-Officers ought to put their power in execution, and resist and stop the proceedings of lawless persons, command that none hear <hi>Iezabel,</hi> and stop the mouths of all irregular and presumptuous Teachers, and not to be accused as busie-bodies; and though they be, yet let rather men accuse them for performing, then God should accuse them for not doing their duty.</p>
                        <p>Yet if the Religions be such as do not overthrow the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Truth, or such as disturb not the Government establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in that State, Church, or Kingdom, wherein they be; and that the Professor of those Religions be not factious, ambitious, or pertinarious; having no other end in holding their opinions, but Gods glory, and the satisfaction of their own consciences, and willing to be taught and be convinced of their errors: diversities of Religions may be tolerated, but in private only; time may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a reno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Quest.</hi> 11. Whether the Elect only be the true Members of the Church?</head>
                        <p>Before this question be directly answered, it is expedient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise these three distinctions: 1. of the Church, 2. of the persons, 3. of judgement.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Of the Church; here we must call to mind that division a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove made, of the Church visible and invisible: That wicked men, Hypocrites, &amp;c. are members of the visible Church in common with the Elect, is not to be denied. The invisible Church is here meant (a distinction the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot well digest) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Church of the first born, <hi>Heb,</hi> 12.23.</item>
                           <item>2. Of Persons, there are some that are in the Church by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profession, and because they hear the word, own Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacraments, may and must pass for Members: Others are in it by inward resignation, in giving up their hearts to God, called a reasonable service, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.</item>
                           <item>3. Of Judgement; there is a judgement of Gods decree, by which he knows who are his; and there is a judgement of humane charity: By the former, we know none so as to point him out; and he that holds one or more of fundamental truths, untill he be cast out, must be judged a Member of the Church: Yet those only that are by the decree elected and called, are only members of the Church. For,

                                 <item>1. The Elect draw only life and nourishment from Christ, they commonly act faith; the other are barren branches, and though up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet not properly of his body.

                                 <item>2. It is they alone that are established and builded upon him; he is the Rock they stand by, while the other chooseth a sandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation (sticks possibly at his profession, imagining that will save him) their house shall stand when the others are falling, and they under them; Christ shall laugh at the one, and mock when their fear cometh; but rejoyce over the other with singing, to behold them cloathed upon.</item>
                                 <item>
                                    <pb n="94" facs="tcp:104618:60"/>3. The Elect only are to their power obedient to him, <hi>they are his sheep only that hear his voice</hi>; and by this it appears that they follow him; they will go with him from a feast to the garden, from that to the Crosse, from that to the Grave: They will contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly for the Faith once given them, were it unto blood; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will forsake him, and love their lives better then to die.</item>
                                 <item>4. They only truly and cordially honour him. O how pretious is Christ to such as believe! they that name his name in this socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, depart from all iniquity: others draw but nigh him with their lips, they draw out their souls to him for his goodness sake, &amp; their sheaves to the hungry for his mercies sake; they bow the knee, and their tongues confess him: the other bows, and with their lips mocks him; the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <item>5. They are the only persons that are called, justified, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by him; one that is truly a Member of Christs body, must not be supposed to be eternally separated from his glory; its the dead branches only that are cut down and burned; such as draw sap, and bring forth fruit, these shall not be fuel for that everlasting fire; the Hypocrites may Prophesie in his name, and cast out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and the devils know them, yet Christ shall acknowledge he nere knew them: the devils may come out of the possessed, and depart at their call, and they shall go with the devils and depart at his command.
<p>I would not have it here thought that the perfection of the Saints is intended, or that before the Elect are effectually called, this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, or that it is sufficient for a Christian to say he is of this invisible Church; for though every one that are members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, are not of the body of the invisible Church, yet he is not of the invisible, that acknowledgeth not himself a member of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: he that hath God for his Father, hath the visible Catholick Church for his only mother, and must have her if he would be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. She is like the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi>; as all without that, was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; so all without this, is damned.</p>
                                    <p>In the judgement of Charity we must indeed suppose, that God
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104618:60"/>
hath his own among the heathen; and by working upon them by his Spirit, in an extraordinary secret and hidden way, brings them unto the knowledge of his Son, by which they are ingrafted into his body, and so made members of the Catholick Church; for as before, out of it there is no salvation; the reason is, out of it, is to be out of Christ; for that is his body; and to be out of Christ, is to be without God; and to be without him, is to be without eternal life. <hi>For this is eternal life, to know thee to be the only true God, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi>

The word preached by many that are not men in Sex, nor Ministers in Office; prayer being preached down, and preaching only to be heard from men of their own principles; teaching for Doctrine, not Traditions, but fancies, blasphemies; affirming the nullity of Apostolical Ordination, &amp;c.

The Sacrament of the

Lords Supper being either preached down altogether, or grosly abused in nature. Its vertue depends upon his goodness that gives it; a sin to receive it with any that we conceit not to be holy, or know him to be prophane, though he be never admonished by them; and if he were, yet he is not to be eaten withal, least I eat and drink damnation to my self, through his sin; the Elements not consecrated, through which that only is an Ordinance; and the body or blood of the Lord, they are not consecrated; for he that often attempts to do it, hath no power so to do, wanting Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> Ordination.</item>
                              <item>3. That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a true Church, as it is now constituted; her Doctrine being pure, she holds nothing, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns nothing upon her members in matters of salvation, by way of precept, neither doth she add to, nor take any thing from the nature of the Sacraments, that the Lord Christ hath left behinde him in the Church; by way of practice she doth, and may injoyn; and she hath power to ordain several Ceremonies, to be performed in the receiving of them, which in themselves being not contrary to the Scriptures, nor taught by her as necessary for salvation, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged only as edifying for their meaning, and decent for the service performing, her Members may, and they do give her all due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and their obedience is justifiable.
<p>You need not here be put in minde of that caution formerly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>viz.</hi> not to take manners for doctrine: it is a high errour to conceit the vertue, power, efficacy of an Ordinance, to consist in, or depend upon the goodness of him that doth administer the same. A prophane person, a known Swearer, may purely dispense the Sacraments; for that lies not (as God forbid it did) in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any mans conversation, but in the pure adhering to our Lords Institution. The pure preaching of the word hangeth not upon the purity of him that speaketh, but in the purity of the word spoken of. The purity of Doctrine lies in the agreement of it unto Scripture, and not in the agreement of a mans life unto the word; if so, how many had Christ converted? what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people had <hi>Paul</hi> brought to the knowledge of the truth, more then he did?</p>

In regard of the publication, and promulgation of them; whatever was spoken, was spoken in the name of the Lord; all was preached in the name of Christ; they desired to know nothing more then Christ; they called upon men to believe in Christ; they baptized in the name of Christ; not by their own power or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but in the name of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> did they work their miracles, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.6.</item>

                     <p>It follows then, that the whole Scriptures in what way soever delivered, whether by vision, inspiration, dreams, by signs, by voice, by writing, by Urim and Thummim, by men or by Angels, by Prophets or Apostles; for God spoke divers ways to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. All of it, and every part of that All, is the word of Christ, which we must have to dwell in us; for the words are Imperative, <hi>Imperativo praceptionis</hi>; a duty that we are to avoid then, and shun him that would seek to turn us from the Faith of that word here enjoyned.</p>

these things were written, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. but now since he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to the studie of the word of Christ, he foresees and knows that by the word of Christ, they shall learn that all those Ceremonies were but as shadows; and since Christ is come, not binding; for which cause he chooseth rather to call it the word of Christ, that those Hereticks might not take any advantage to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them, which they might have done, if he had said the word of God.</p>
                     <p>From this we might draw many inferences; we shall at this time collect two; one concerning the Ministers of Christ; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to all the Professors of Christ.</p>

                        <item>1. Concerning the Ministers of Christ. Let them not hereafter be afraid of man, nor of the son of man; let them be bold to say to any offender, <hi>Non licet tibi,</hi> with <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist, It is not lawfull for thee,</hi> Mat. 14.4. Let their faces be strong against the faces of men, their foreheads strong against their foreheads, that they be not dismayed at their looks, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 3.8, 9. the word is not theirs, but the Lords; Let the word of God be spoken with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.31. Christ speaks as one that had authority, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.29. and he hath given authority and power to his servants, to charge men to their duty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. where God threatens sin, they must not be afraid to pronounce punishment: <hi>The Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesie</hi>? Amos 2.8.
<p>As they are to preach it with Authority, so let them study it constantly; where shall the Ambassadors of the most High, know the will of their great Master, but here? Till Christ come, let them give attendance to reading: A Minister must be a man apt to teach, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24. And its this alone, that can fit him for that function. In these lyeth the substance, and matter of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; therefore they must be looked into, studied upon.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Let none of them trust, believe, or depend upon any new or immediate Revelation for his happiness; there are in this Age many that trust to those raptures of the Spirit, as they call them, and will have no other word dwell in them, then that word that the Spirit within suggests within, casting aside, and refusing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104618:69"/>
the Scriptures, as useless and unnecessary, because a word without: But I hope you have not so learned Christ.</p>
                     <p>We shall carry a small time upon the search of that Spirit, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, trying it by the Scriptures, the touchstone of truth, and we shall see if those breathings of the Spirit be different from the blasts of the Prince of the power of the Ayr, that rules in the children of disobedience.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It doth not those things that the Spirit of God should do; not to insist upon particulars; there were three general Acts, that Christ promised his Spirit at his coming, should perform unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and this Spirit that goes abroad in this Age performs none of them, as may appear by a rehearsal of the severall acts themselves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Was to bring to remembrance what ever Christ had spoken,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26. This was to be his work then, and his work with all believers is the same now; what Christ hath taught, what Christ hath spoken, is the Spirit to bring to remembrance, which he will send. That Spirit therefore that teacheth, and puts that in the minds of men which Christ never spoke, cannot be that spirit sent of him; but such doth the spirit that in this Age is pretended: It calls down prayer, it will not be guided by Scripture, not live of the Gospel, nor according to Law, they will have no ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, they will not own Magistrates, thrust Sacraments out of the Church, make Ordinances in their power depend upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men, take singing out of our Christian Temples, preaching up new revelations, and that they only are the Saints that heed least the Scriptures; that it is only formal or Antichristian to crave a blessing before meat; that none are baptized, but such as are dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; to curse, revile, slander those that are set apart by Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tradition, for the preaching of the Gospel, &amp;c. This is that that Christ never taught, and therefore it is not his Spirit that brings them to our remembrance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Holy Spirit of God was to glorifie Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.14. that Christ that was then with his Discsples, that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that Christ that was to suffer at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was he to make glorious; that Spirit now amongst us, casts contumelies, and scornfully speaks of that Christ, under the notion of a Christ
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104618:70"/>
without us: Its seeks its own glory, and bears witness of it self; its whole aym is to invert the Divine dispensations, by slighting that Christ crucified, upon the account of being without.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He was to shed abroad the love of God in the hearts of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. that is, the apprehension of the love of God, a sense of it, a feeling of it, from whence comes love, joy, and peace. Now the spirit that some pretenders have, is a contradistinct spirit from this; for by their trembling, quaking, foaming, it appears that the sense of the love of God is not shed abroad in their hearts, but of his wrath; those strange and monstrous actings, proceed rather from wrath, indignation and anguish; and indeed if gnashing of teeth be a picture, or fruit of Hell, we may know whence that spirit comes that carries men forth into those distempers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God is a Spirit of Union, and of Agreement, that ever speaks and agrees with it self. In no place doth it really oppose or contradict it self; it leads all men into one kind and way of truth, how distant soever they be from one another; but this spirit that goes abroad in our Age, never appears in one shape, it speaks this in this mans mouth, and contradicts is again next day: In this mans mouth, it threatens hell; in that mans mouth, it says there is no hell; it says that it is a decent thing for a woman to preach, the same spirit calls down all preaching in another; here it throws aside the Law, there it throws away the Gospel; there it throws away both; here it is for a Christ within, there it affirms there is no Christ at all: by its cloven foot, you may discern whence it came.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Spirit of God teacheth honourable and glorious Doctrine; such Doctrine as made the highest in the earth bow their necks to receive the same; the whole Army of the <hi>Philist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104618:70"/>
of his Church, but never gave him all his chain to destroy. Their Doctrine was never on a Candlestick, their house was never on a mountain, to bring all Nations in into it. God kept it under, that it never yet said, So would I have it. How hath the same Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel we teach run over the world, and that without garments rolled in blood, and hath been beautifull and glorious! But this spirit hath attempted indeed, but stopped, tryed, condemned, cast out: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there a Kingdom, Country, Parish, nay scarce a house, that this spirits Doctrine, or Doctrines rather, was ever received in. These things considered, let not the Professors of Christ depend upon those seducing revelations, but to the Scriptures, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles: But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, be the word of Christ, let none of the people sleight it: it is that which Christ hath spoken to be the Rule of their lives, tryers of their thoughts, and measure of their actions: if thou be of the houshold of faith, thou art upon that foundation whereof Jesus Christ is the chief Corner-stone. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. All you that build must be squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, fitted, and proportionated to this Corner stone, which can only be done by this Word of Christ, and therefore it is not to be slighted. Now the Scripture may be slighted divers ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When it is regardlessely heard: when Gods message is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the good of a mans soul by Gods servant thereunto appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to have an irreverend or unseemly carriage, shows they put no high valuation upon it; to be drowzy or sleepy when God is holding forth our duty, or his own greatnesse, our sins and his Justice, is a great sign of irreverence, and may provoke him to thrust us out of his presence: for it is not a slighting or contemning of man who reads it or speaks it, but of God who made it and enjoyned it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When it is scoffingly used; when men make Scripture to be the bottome of Jests and Jears, the Subject of their profanenesse, or Object of their mirth. When the Prophet called the Burthen of the Lord, the people answered him in scorn, the Burthen of the Lord, the Burthen of the Lord. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.33, 34, 35. or as <hi>Iulian</hi> that would smite a Christian on the one cheek, und then bid him turn the other, as his Lord and Master directed. The Scriptures were not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104618:71"/>
written to make men laugh but to make men wise unto salvation. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. they were sent into the word by God to instruct men how to demean themselvs without offence towards God &amp; man. <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. &amp; it ought only to be imployed to that end. It is not safe jesting with edged Tools; so neither is it safe to sport with the two edged sword of the word of God.

We ought to look on the things of others: there is a publick teaching proper to the Gospel Ministry, and there is a private Teaching common to the holy Priesthood. Come Children, heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord, is a Saints Dialect. <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.11. Teaching according to some, is instruction in matters of faith, not done because not known; and admonition hath reference to matter of fact, known but not done; of both these at large afterward we must speak; for the present we may know that these duties are mutuall, <hi>Teaching and admonishing one another</hi>; he that now teacheth, must by and by be a hearer; and he that admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth this day, must not be offended if he be reproved by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to morrow.</p>

                        <hi>LEt the Word of Christ dwel richly in you, in all wisedome, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and admonishing one another in Psalms, Hymns and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Songs, &amp;c.</hi> There are some that will rise early to follow after Strong-drink; these wil hollow and roar over their Cups, they will make a gracelesse as well as an unseemly noise, and these by singing or rather howling, expresse their delight in the Acts of drunkenness. Our Apostle would have these believers to expresse their joy in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall singing for their Christian Conferences.</p>
                     <p>How these three differ, cannot be easily determined, since there are variety of judgements equally probable; or if they do differ at all, is by many questioned. It shall be left to the choice of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by laying before him two or three of the chief Opinions.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Some by Psalms understand those Songs or Psalms of <hi>David</hi> that were sung in the Temple, and plaid upon by Instruments, as those Psalms that were played upon the Organs, Lute, Harps, Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls, or any other Instruments: and Hymns and Songs to be such as were only by voyce sung in the Jewish Temple, or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houses: an instance of the first we have, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.10. of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30.</item>
                        <item>2. Others by Psalms understand the whole Book of Psalmes, whereof <hi>David</hi> was the principal, if not the only Author, wherein we have an Epitome and an abridgement of the whole Word of God. By Hymns they understand those Songs that were penned by <hi>Moses, Deborah, Hezekiah,</hi> wherein properly the praises of God are contained, as of his power, mercy, greatnesse: or in a word, any song in Scripture whereof <hi>David</hi> was not the Author, but other holy men. By Songs they understand any Godly Religious Song, used or composed by good men, which though not proceeding from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit of God, yet might advance godlinesse in the hearts of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104618:76"/>
the pious users of them; such as at this day is our Lamentation of a sinner, or the like.</item>
                        <item>3. Others there are who understand these three to signifie all one and the self-fame thing (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Psalms of <hi>David</hi>; Hymns and Spirituall songs being only a variation of the phrase and holding out those Songs that that sweet Psalmist of <hi>Israel</hi> did compose for the benefit of that Church, over which God had made him a Feeder or a Keeper; where of some are Eucharistical, spending themselves in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, some Penitential, washing themselves in tears, and some Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary. The Hebrews give generally those names, and that promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to the whole book of Psalmes, as it is Composed in our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>But the Apostle is careful that the Psalm, Hymn or Song be wel tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; he would have them sing with grace within their hearts; he would not have them to have any inclination to pride, when they sing, <hi>Lord, I am not pusst up in mind. When</hi> Mary <hi>sung, her soul did magnifie the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is known that the Heathens in their meetings, sang and did sing Songs of praises to their Gods and Goddesses, for their supposed goodnesse and greatnesse. Here Christians are exhorted to sing, but not to such: we ought to sing, but it's with <hi>Grace in our hearts to the Lord</hi>; <hi>Sursum Corda,</hi> to the Lord let us lift them up.</p>
                     <p>He gives a particular direction in this place, touching singing of Psalms in a more especiall manner then of other duties; but we are to know
<list>
                           <item>1. That he restrains not all Scripture to Psalms; for there are Precepts, Histories, Prophesies, Epistles in holy Writ, which must be entertained as wel as Psalms. Nor</item>
                           <item>2. That he would have other parts of Scripture put from their true and proper inheritance which in all ages they have had, as to be looked upon and received as the word of Christ; which other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is as well as the Psalms, But</item>
                           <item>3. Because of all Scripture the Psalms are of most generall use, as having in them the greatest variety of doctrine, the most fervent and working motives to godlinesse and piety; and</item>
                           <item>4. Because of all the Scripture, they were usually most (if not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104618:76"/>
only) sung; they were in a special way chanted by the Saints, and sung by the holy men under the Law, which (besides the Spirit of God who by <hi>David</hi> did compose those Psalms, suitable to be sung) was occasioned from those holy raptures that by experience believers felt in themselves in the using of them, arising upon the variety of Doctrine that was naturally perceived to be in them, and flow from them; but of these things more at large, when vve come to handle that Ordinance of singing in particular.</item>

                  <p>HAving opened the Text, we shall now by the assistance of him whose word is to be spoken of, come to the drawing out of such truths, as shall and may serve for firm pillars whereby the true Christian and sober Saint may stand upright against, and in despite of the storms and blasts of all contrary Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Our purpose is to speak of the nature of, and to defend the Churches practise in those effectual and grand Ordinances, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word, Sacraments and Prayer, the Conduit Pipes to convey the water of life to the languishing and thirsty soul, though some in this Age (surfeiting through plenty) account them but as puddle, and to be shunned by men. As a foundation and ground to the whole Discourse, we shall therefore handle this point of Doctrine from the words in generall:
<q>
                        <p>That it is a Duty incumbent upon all persons, to have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, and to be well acquainted with the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The word of Christ is the <hi>unum necessarium</hi>; that one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a Christian in this earth, and in his passing or travelling toward heaven indispensably necessary as a guide to direct him,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104618:77"/>
as light to comfort him, and as armour to defend him, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.105. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.7.</p>
                  <p>In the opening of this doctrine we shall observe this method.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Show what knowledge it is that lies upon all Christians as a Duty.</item>
                     <item>2. What it is to be well acquainted with the Scriptures.</item>
                     <item>3. Give other Scriptures for the proof of the point.</item>
                     <item>4. Demonstrate the truth of it, by reasons drawn from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</item>

                        <hi>VVHen Christ had ascended up on high, and led captivity captive, he gave gifts to men,</hi> Ephes. 4.8. which gifts did vary, and were more or less, according to the good pleasure of him that ruleth all things. Every man hath not knowledge alike, and no man knoweth all things; <hi>he that knoweth most, knoweth but in part,</hi> 1 Cor, 13.12. According to the Order God puts men in, he will give five, two, or but one talent, and no more; some things lie hid from the wisest, and other things God will have the lowest of men find out; he hath given his word universally to all, that by it all may know their duty: and he is a wise man which knoweth that. There are three things that every Christian must indispensably know in Scripture.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. All necessary truths: God will be offended, if they know not how to be good Christians; not if we be not good Disputants. We
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104618:77"/>
are to know that God is a Spirit, <hi>And they that worship him, must worship him in Spirit and in truth,</hi> John 4.24. that <hi>he is a hater and punisher of sin,</hi> Rom. 1.18. that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. &amp;c. From the knowledge of these, and the like things, there are none excepted; they are indeed the ground work of all Religion, and God will be angry if men know them not.</item>
                        <item>2. All profitable truths: It is necessary for men in health, strength, and wealth, to lay up some comfortable provision against the days come wherein they shall say, I have no pleasure in them. Texts that can mitigate sickness, suppress doubts, and keep off despair, conduce much to a Christians being, and his well being also. The mysteries of <hi>Daniel</hi> will not afford so much comfort to a drooping soul, as the great <hi>mysterie of godliness.</hi> What time thou art afraid trust in God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 56.3. Remember, <hi>Happy is he</hi> (what case soever befals him) <hi>that hath the God of Iacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God,</hi> Psal. 146.5. <hi>God may bring thee through the fire, and refine thee as silver is refined, and try thee as Gold is tryed,</hi> Zach. 13.9. <hi>Meditate therefore upon the Faith and patience of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 13.10. and <hi>upon the end of the Lord,</hi> Jam. 5.11.</item>
                        <item>3. All Relative truths, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) to know those things that God hath given a man in charge in reference to that particular calling or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that God hath given to him, or put him in. A Father must know his Duty; for he shall answer for his failings in that particular: the Magistrate his: the Minister his: the people theirs. God will punish <hi>Eli</hi> for his failings as a Father, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Saul</hi> for his as a Magistrate, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> for theirs as Priests, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.2. The people for theirs, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10. <hi>Eonus Civis, sed malus homo:</hi> it is one thing to be a good Christian, and another to be a good Father: be both; or if thou be not, thou mayst be saved, yet so as by fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. that is, as a man that hath his house and his goods burned, may yet escape with his life: so thou mayst be brought to heaven, but not in that comfortable and joyfull condition which thou mightest, hadst thou filled up all thy Relations, according to the duties enjoyned thee by the word.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>But of these there may be, and is a twofold knowledge.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. A speculative, or a head knowledge; a knowledge that goeth

The word of Christ may be in a mans brain, and there it will speed no better then the seed that was sown in stony ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.5. wanting depth of earth. A head-knowledge will but encrease our guilt, and that will increase our misery: for <hi>he that knoweth his Masters will, and doth it not, shall be beaten with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stripes.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. An affective or heart-knowledge: <hi>Theologia est scientia af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiva, directiva,</hi> which goes down to the affections, and causes a man to walk and to do according to that which he knows: <hi>Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophesie of this Book,</hi> Rev. 22.7. This is to receive the seed upon good ground: thus to know is only Life eternal: he that thus knoweth, shall no longer be called a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but a <hi>Brother, a Sister, and a Mother to Christ Iesus,</hi> Matth. 12.50.</item>

There is such a Majesty in the word, that we are to esteem the very feet of him beautifull that brings it: when the voice of God soundeth in our ears, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discern the Royaltie that is in it, we are not like to esteem it as we ought, or as God requires.</item>
                              <item>2. We cannot otherwise believe it as we ought; by not knowing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104618:78"/>
it we may be drawn to doubt of the truth of it: in discourses while men are dehorting from this or that vice, or exhorting to this or that duty, and intermingling either threats or promises, the truth of both may be doubted, either to the hardening of men in their sin, or to cool their affections to the duty.</item>

There is a knowledge must be had which all the Creation cannot give: the Creatures in heaven and in the Earth may show that there is a God; but how to know God, they are silent: one of them could say, <hi>Deum colit qui novit,</hi> but understood he what he said? The wisest of men did worship an unknown God. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.23. The Scriptures only teach us, and do only show us what God is; that he is a spirit, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.24. Infinite, Eternal, Immutable, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Preserver of all things; mercifull, gracious, long-suffering, a God that heareth prayer, a hater of all sin, one in nature, three in persons. This no book in the World holds out but this; and he that knew most of the nature, and best knew in the secrets of art, had read far and much in the large volume of the Creatures, yet could not <hi>know that which is Eternal life, to know him to be the only true God, and Iesus Christ he had sent.</hi>

<list>
                           <item>1 Curiosity: We have <hi>Athenians</hi> that give their mind to hearken after some new and curious thing in Religion, that studie more the knowledge of such things as God hath locked up in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Cabinet of his own bosome, or in the secret place of the Stairs of dark and hidden prophesies, rather then plain and revealed truth, because plain and revealed; picking out of the Scripture some dark passages, and with them storing their brain, conceit themselves to be rich by empty and vain questions, such oftentimes as bring the very entity of God in an Atheisticall way into a Question and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and in the mean time go empty away of those truths that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to peace and holinesse, without which no man shall see the Lord. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.</item>
                           <item>2. Coveteousnesse. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22. The Word of God cannot grow nor bring forth fruit, where the thorns and cares of the World are nourished; that fils the heart of man so much, that there is no Room for the knowledge of Sacred Scripture. He that had great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssessions, when he was to part with all for Eternall life, went away sorrowful. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.22. and we never read he returned. Give him Earth enough any man shall have heaven. Let him be rich in this Worlds goods, he misses not the knowledge of the riches of Gods grace shining through, Jesus Christ in the Word. He knoweth Earth so much, and is acquainted with it so wel, and troubleth himselfe so much about it, he forgets that one thing necessary, and becomes unfruitfull in good works.</item>

Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and acquaintance of the holy Scriptures, is not obtained but by industry and pains: sluggishnesse wil have a man to loyter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot be rich in that.
<p>Were it possible to see the soul of the Sluggard, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saw his Vineyard, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.31. we should see it without either Order or Fence, and overgrown with all kind of noysome and filthy Weeds.

                        <head>Quest. 1. Whether the Scripture be the word of God?</head>
                        <p>By Scripture here is meant the whole word of God, contained wholly and onely in the Canonicall bookes of the old and new Testament; for though the word Scripture, signifies only a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or a book, and may be attributed to any book, scrole, or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the world; yet use and custome which is the rule of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath wrought this word Scripture to signifie that writing of the Holy Ghost contained in the Book of God, and not any other book.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the excellency that it hath above all other, it is called the Scripture, that is <hi>the Book</hi>; as if there were none deserved that name but it; hence the book of <hi>Canticles</hi> is called the Song of Songs, that is the most excellent of Songs, so this, <hi>the Book,</hi> that is, the book of books.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From that necessity that lies upon men to have this book, above all other. If all the learning of all the most famous Libraries could be contracted into one book; and that one book digested into one mans Head, yet he would call for <hi>thee Book,</hi> that book that his life, his comforts, his salvation stood upon; this book was made to mend all other books; and the light that all other Learning could afford, without this, would but make Hell so much the darker: when all Books are shown him, yet as <hi>David</hi> said of <hi>Goliahs</hi> sword; there is no Book like <hi>that,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.9. or as <hi>Rachel</hi> said to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Give me</hi> that <hi>or else I die,</hi> Gen. 30.1.</p>
                        <p>The like might be said of the word <hi>Bible,</hi> that signifying also a Book; and properly any Book of the world might be called a Bible; but customarily its given only to that Book, that contains the word, or that Book written by the Spirit of God.</p>
                        <p>Now that the Scripture, or the Books of the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, are the words of God, and written by none but God; that they are from heaven, and not of men, may appear by these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reasons.</p>

                        <p>There are many that pretend to new Revelations, &amp; new lights, walking according to, and going a whoring after their own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but that the Scriptures are to be our only rule, these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Arguments may declare.</p>

                           <item>1. It is the only infallible and unalterable Rule: Many Rules and Laws have there been in the world, which time hath altered, and experience hath made to appear not good; but the Scriptures of God remain the same, no addition to them, no dimunition of them: to Kings and people they are now what they ever were, and they shall be what for the present they are to all generations: <hi>For ever, O Lord, thy word is setled in heaven,</hi> Psal. 119.89. All other Rules have, and may still deceive, but this hath never deceived nor failed, and is the same for ever and ever.</item>

The Churches of Christ had never any other Rule: the word of God, the Scriptures of God, was ever the Rule of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in matters of Faith: The Rule of their lives in matters of fact; <hi>Malachy</hi> that ends the Old Testament, commands them to <hi>Remember the Law of</hi> Moses; and <hi>Iohn</hi> that concludes the new, pronounceth him <hi>Blessed that keepeth the Prophesie of the sayings of this Book, Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>And whoever speaks not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</hi> Christ himself appeals to the Scriptures, to be the Tryers of his Doctrine, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39.</item>

Hence it is that the

Scriptures are called Canonical, because they contain and give a perfect Rule of all things conducing to salvation.</item>
                           <item>4. God hath now ceased to repeat any new matter to his Church, or for giving them any other Rule: <hi>We must know that God, who at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in Times past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, Heb.</hi> 1.1.

                           <item>5. By this Rule only can the soul be satisfied, and peace secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: when this Rule is left, what Rule can man have to walk by? nay how many Rules shall he presume to settle himself by, when this is laid aside? All other are so full of uncertainties, so loaded with doubtings, so liable to exceptions, so uncomfortable in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, so various in their natures, that like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.9. the creature can get no rest for the feet of its soul, untill it pitch upon this again: When he that is builded (that is ruled and fitted to) <hi>upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ being the chief corner stone, groweth unto a holy Temple,</hi> &amp;c.

                           <item>6.

And this is one way to see if it speak according to the teaching of Jesus Christ, or not, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26.

                        <p>This Question arises from the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who teacheth her Members, that the Scriptures are not perfect, that is, that the Word of God contained in the Scriptures, is not of it self sufficient for salvation, and therefore they help it out with their Traditions: yet the Catholick Church in all Ages reputed the word in it self absolutely perfect. For

The Scripture it self acknowledges perfection to be in it. 2 Tim. 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Correction, for instruction in Righteousnesse, that the man of God may be perfect throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished unto all good workes.</hi> Now what Spiritual occasion can there be devised, or what Act of Religion can a soul intend; but what in

one of these ways the Scripture is profitable, and able to make him perfect of it self without any addition to it. Its profitable for <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> that is for all truths necessary for salvation. For <hi>Reproof,</hi> that is, for confutations of all errors.

And all this is that the <hi>Man of God may be perfect,</hi> or that he might be a perfect man of God, <hi>throughly furnished unto all good works.</hi> This discovers the Scriptures largenesse. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is written that the <hi>Soul may be full of joy.</hi> The water of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition need not be mixed with the <hi>Wine</hi> of the Scripture; it can give fulnesse of joy without them. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.4.</item>
                              <item>2. They are the Rules whereby the perfection of all other doctrine must be tryed; we must bring all other to this Touch-stone: we must weigh all weights in this ballance: all Rules must be ruled by this, and therefore it ought to be straight it self. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. the truth of <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine appears by it's conformity to this. Nay Christ himself in whom was no errour appeals to it. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39.</item>
                              <item>3. The whole and full will of God touching his Church to the end of the World is contained in it. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26. There is no new thing to be done, nor no new truth now to be taught. The Acts of the Spirit are but remembrancers of that Doctrine formerly taught by Christ. <hi>He shall bring to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you</hi>: so that no new thing nor any other thing is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but what he did speak unto them, <hi>even all things that he had heard of his Father,</hi> John 15.15. so that the will of God being by the Scriptures fully known, they are to be acknowledged perfect.

                           <hi>Quest.</hi> 6. What may perswade one that doubts to believe the truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</head>
                        <p>By doubting of the Scriptures here is understood a calling in question out of pure ignorance the very truth of the History of the Bible: he doubts if <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> did compose <hi>Psalms</hi>; and doubts that the Lord is not round about them that fear him, as the Mountains are about <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: He doubts that the Apostles being ignorant men and by Trade Fisher-men most, could convert Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not a few. In a word, he questions the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> of the Psalms, Prophets, Evangelists and Apostles, not all out of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, nor malice, but by simplicity and ignorance.</p>
                        <p>By beliefe is not meant a saving beliefe, or such a faith as may save him, but to cause him behold the Bible as a true History, not a fiction now this beliefe may be wrought in such a one by these and the like Argument.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 From the Churches tradition, in all ages, and through all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were the books of Moses received and owned to be his, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> to be his, yea they were by the whole consent of the Church owned as the very word of God, spoken in the mouths of men. Now as he believes the books going under the name of <hi>Ovid</hi> to be his: and of <hi>Virgil,</hi> to be his, of <hi>Cicero</hi> to be his because that former generations, yea that age they lived in then gave them down to the next as theirs and they to the next, untill it comes to us; so he may be brought to a Historical beleiving of these books to be true and not Supposititious.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The nature of the men that made it. They were good just and upright in their generation. As <hi>Moses Samuell, David, Solomon, Esaiah, &amp;c.</hi> who, would not have took pains to have cheated the

                        <p n="3">3 The miseries that the writers of the Scriptures went through is a proof of some concernment; if men would cheat, it would be for some profit; but what honour or preferment had <hi>Paul</hi> for his preaching: or for his writing? The Apostles in general might have lived at home in ease, and not go abroad to the hazzard of their lives as they did. What could their policy or reason suggest to them by being at so much trouble to themselves purely to cheat others? What needed or what could provoke Ieremy to undergo such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as he did, purely to cheat the world? We know they were in Jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy every hour for writting and preaching of it; Which in reas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shews that they had no purpose to delude.</p>

                        <p>For the dispatching this Question, we must distinguish
<list>
                              <item>1. Between the Scripture it self, and the persons who writ; it is not necessary to salvation to believe that <hi>Matthew</hi> writ that Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell that goes under his Name: nor that <hi>Peter</hi> writ his: to believe what is spoken or written, is one thing; and to believe that <hi>David</hi> writ it, is another thing.</item>
                              <item>2. Between the writing it self, and the time when, or the place whence it was written. It is one thing to believe the truth of those Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> and another thing to believe that they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from <hi>Corinthus,</hi> as that to the <hi>Romans</hi>; or that from <hi>Athens,</hi> as that to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi>; or from <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> was brought the second time before <hi>Nero,</hi> as that last Epistle to <hi>Timothy.</hi>

                              <item>3. Between the Words written, and the meaning, or sence of the thing writ. It is one thing to believe that <hi>Paul</hi> writ the words of his Epistles, in that order, method, place, as we have them in our Bibles ordered and placed; and another thing, to believe the sence and the meaning of the thing so written; we shall find the writers of the Scriptures, in citing of places deviate from the naturall order of the Words given them by the first Author: which shews that we are not bound to believe that. For instance, <hi>David</hi> declares, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.8. I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved: which Text <hi>Peter</hi> having occasion to use <hi>Act.</hi> 2.25. reads it thus (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>I foresaw the Lord always before my face; he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.</hi> The words being clearly varied, but the sence and meaning being the same, we are tyed to the one and not to the other
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104618:96"/>
which alteration is evident in many places; particularly the very next verse both of that Psalm and this Chapter.</item>
                              <item>4. Between an Historical and a saving faith; we are to believe all that the Scripture contains and set down; that is, the sence and meaning of it to be no other then the very will, purpose, mind and Law of God, which we must believe if we would be saved. And that it was written by <hi>David,</hi> and sent to the chief Musitian: by <hi>Matthew,</hi> by <hi>Paul,</hi> and sent to them from <hi>Corinthus</hi> that the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>Timothy</hi> Ordained the first Bishop of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> was written from <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> was brought the Second time before <hi>Nero</hi> (as his second Epistle at the close declares) ought to be believed by an Historical faith: that not being written by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible spirit of God, but by the Churches Tradition, of whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in an Historical way it is but presumption in any man to doubt.</item>

                           <item>3. Another Argument against that grosse conceit, may be drawn from those prohibitions, so often urged by <hi>Moses</hi> against the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, making any Image of God. Deut. 1.12. <hi>Ye heard the voyce of the Words, but saw no similitude, only ye heard a voyce.</hi> And again, v. 15. <hi>Take ye therefore good heed unto your selves</hi> (<hi>for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake to you in</hi> Horeb, <hi>out of the midst of the fire</hi>) <hi>lest you corrupt your selves, and make you a graven Image: the liknesse of Male or Female.</hi> If our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphites had heard this Law, the Argument had not been strong enough to keep away Images: they themselves being made after Gods Image, and by their Logick the Picture of a man might have been a sufficient representation of God.

                           <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. Whether there be but one God?</head>
                        <p n="1">1. That there is but one God; the Scripture in no point is more clear. For instance, <hi>Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts; I am the first and I am the last, and besides me there is no God,</hi> Isai. 44.6. <hi>And I am the Lord, and oheré is none else, there is no God besides me,</hi> Isai. 45.5. <hi>so</hi> Deut. 32.39. 1 Cor. 8.4, 5, 6. Deut. 6.4.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There can be but one Omnipotent. Omnipotency is to have all power, might and strength: there is power, and there is Omnipotency. Power may do much, but Omnipotency can do all: power may be suppressed by a greater power, but Omnipotency knows no opposition. It hath no difficulties nor Lets: it works free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perfectly without co-workers or Materialls: if at any time it uses any, it at no time needs either, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> therefore there can be no other God but he. For suppose another, there must follow a Contest who should be most worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, most feared, most magnified; one must yield to the other, which denotes impotency, which is a denying of a deity.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There can be but one Infinite. To be Infinite, is to be fully, constantly in all places. It is to be without bounds to be unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable, to exceed reason or capacity: it hath respect to time, place, power, wisdome, Justice, mercy. God is infinite in time, being Eternall, Infinite in place, filling Heaven and Earth in power: he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104618:104"/>
do all things in wisdome: he knows all things past, present and to come. In Justice: who can dwell with everlasting burnings? in mercy, for the Righteous go into life Eternal. <hi>Do not I fill Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, saith the Lord.</hi> Jer. 23.24. There is therefore no place, no time left for another God. Suppose one &amp; you must at the same instant give him a Vacuum to Reign in, which to affirm would but argue emptinesse of Wisdome, and shallowness of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There can be but one recipient. We are commanded to love God with all our strength, soul and mind. Deut. 6.4, 5. there is no part of our love, service, fear, worship to be given to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then one: therefore there is but one.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Therre can be but one Efficient. There are many things in the World depending upon each other, as the lincks of a chains: which if we measure and count, we shal come to the first, which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of all: the greatest number hath it's Original from a Unite.

                        <p>That they are personally distinct from each other appears by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Texts, chiefly these, Prov. 8.25. <hi>The Son speaking of himself, shews us, that when there was no depths I were brought forth, when there were no Fountaine abounding with water, before the Mountains were setled, before the Hils was I brought forth, &amp;c. When he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the Heavens, I was there; when he established the clouds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, when he gave to the Sea his decree, then was I by him, as one brought up with him, &amp;c.</hi> In which speech it appears, that he that was begotten by the Father was a distinct person from him that esta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blished the clouds, which was the Lord Gen. 1.</p>
                        <p>Again, Psal. 33.6. <hi>we read, that by the word of the Lord, were the Heavens made, and all the Hoasts of them by the breath of his Mouth.</hi> Here are the three persons differenced, Christ the word, the Lord God, the Breath of his mouth, the Spirit, which appears by comparing this Text with. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.1. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2.</p>
                        <p>Also, Gen. 1.26. <hi>One says Let us make Man in our image, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our likeness,</hi> he that sayes these words, must be one that can create and make Man; to whom are these words spoken, not to a Creature, not to an Angel, for man was not made after the image of an Angel, (as some that denies this truth, makes Christ to be) it must be God. Why is it said let us? note that there are more Gods, as hath been before proved; but the word <hi>Us,</hi> denotes the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Persons, for the next words show God created man in his own Image. It must be therefore God the Father, that sayes to the other persons the same God with him, <hi>let us make man in our own image, that is in the image of God.</hi> not of any created, being moreover. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16, <hi>We finde Iesus the second Person in the water, the Spirit of God descending like a Dove upon him,</hi> and the Father calling down from Heaven, this is my well beloved Son, &amp;c. where we clearly see the three Persons, in different places, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different acts, which proves that they are different persons,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104618:106"/>
which place being clear for the distinguishing of three, we may say to our new Atrians, or Antiteinitarians, what I read Athamasius said to the old ones, who denyed the three Persons, <hi>Abi ad Iordanem &amp; vibebis,</hi> go to the River of Jordan, and thou should see the truth of it.</p>
                        <p>Though they be different in persons, as is so clear in Scripture, that it is to be wondred what impudent devil possesseth so many in our dayes to deny it; yet it is not to be concluded there; there are three Gods, for these three personally make but one God essentially, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.7 which brings us to the second part of the question; how these three persons do agree,</p>
                        <p>This being such a mystery, if any be too curious about this point, let them shew me how they are framed, figured in the wombe, how they grow upon Earth, how their own Soul animates their Body; and by that time something more may be thought on for the further clearing of these insearch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<p>To suppose now the Father, and the Son to be one from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and not also the Spirit; is to suppose that God was without his Spirit; which were Blasphemy in Divinity, since he was alwayes a living God; and absurd in reason, yea equally ridiculous, as to imagine a man to live, move, and have a beeing without a Soul.

                        <p>The Law Ceremonial, which consists of Types and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, as Washings, Shavings, and Offerings, of Sacrifices, Shedding of blood, Sprinkling, &amp;c. some may think to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse under the Gospel; but they erre, a Beleever may reap much profit by them.</p>

He is the scape-goat that taketh the sins of men into the Wildernesse of Oblivion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By them we may take notice of Gods offence at sin he wil have the blood of man or of beasts, to satisfie his Justice in respect of sin, willing to spare men, untill the Son of man come, the blood of Buls and goats shall serve to the purifying of the flesh.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. By them believers may be excited to love Christ the more for freeing them from the burthen of that Law. It was a yoke that the Jews were not able to bear. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. By Christ, the Believer is freed from it: he is not now tyed to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he needs not go there to worship: neither need he kill his beast for Sacrifice: but offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pure hands without wrath and doubring makes him accepted in the beloved.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. By that Law we see that there is but one Saviour for Jew and Gentile which may be the ground of many a fervent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the Jews Conversion, that they might effectually have the blood upon their hearts for the pardon of their sins, whose blood typically they shed for the remmitting of their offences. Poor souls whose Fathers saw his blood in the killing of their beasts, &amp; yet their seed to be killed through their not believing in his blood now that it is poured forth. <hi>Return O Lord to thee many thousands of Israel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Believers by that may see how carefull God is of his Worship: in his making such strict Laws, Statues and Judgements, and the least of them to be fulfilled under the pain of being cut off.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. They may fear to sin the more against the gospel, if it was dangerous under so dark a Ministration, what now? if it was death to break the Law delivered by <hi>Moses,</hi> what then to sin against the Law given by Christ? if these escaped not that broke the Law, because they were delivered from <hi>Egypts</hi> thraldome. <hi>How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation.</hi> Heb. 10.2, 3.

                        <p>The ground of it, is the determination of that first and famous Counsell of the Church. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.

                           <item>1. The occasion of that Epistles writing. A Church being plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Antioch,</hi> by the conversion of many Gentiles to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, some Jewish Preachers, yet believers, taught unto them the necessity of keeping the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> Act. 15.1. <hi>if they would be saved</hi>

                              <hi>Barnabas</hi> and others; some of both opinions are sent to the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to know their minds, vers. 2. At their arrival there is a Councel called: great controversy and much disputing there was the law of <hi>Moses</hi> must be kept, if they would be saved, ver. 5.6.7. <hi>Peter</hi> rises, (so great is the difference) Appeals to the Councel if among them whom God appointed to Preach, he had not made choice of him, to Preach to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the gospel of Christ that they might be saved, from whom as if he had said I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no such commission; as to preach the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision or the like: Takes God to witness that all times, God had testified of his content sufficiently; and was satisfyed in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> beleiving, without their keeping of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> by giving them faith and the holy Ghost, vers. 7.8.9. Maintains further that they tempt God that reach the contrary doctrine, and hinder or may hinder the progress of the Gospell, by putting on that yoake (<hi>viz</hi> of the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moses</hi>) <hi>on the necks of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> which neither we nor our Fathers were able to bear by which he holds forth that the law of <hi>Moses</hi> obligeth not the Church under the Gospel, And therefore is to be taught by none and is any do, they tempt God.
<p>At this Argument the mouths of all opponents are stopped. <hi>Peter</hi> had been an eye witness of our Lords death and resurrection. He got a special tripled comission to feed the sheep of Christ; And at Gods Appointment did preach to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the gospel, and not the Law; that God had blessed his preaching by giving the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Faith and the holy Ghost. Though the Law was never taught nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, their conscience now tells them this their doctrine is not of God: they remained silent, no disputing, no arguing more, vers. 10, 11.12.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> takeing occasion by this argument of <hi>Peters,</hi> declares unto the Councel, what works God had done by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without the observance of the Law, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same conclusion Implicitely, that <hi>Peter</hi> made from the same Premisses. (<hi>viz</hi>) God owning their Preaching by faith and miracles, and therefore as they taught at <hi>Antioch,</hi> so they teach now (being both here and there guided by the infalliable Spirit of God) that the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was not to be Preached; was not to be kept: in the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:104618:115"/>
mouth of these three Witnesses guided by the Holy ghost: let this truth be justified, that no part of the Ceremonial Law is to be taught, obliging now, and by consequence, eating of blood is no gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell precept, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
                              <p>Again, there is silence, the whole Councel being convinced of the truth of the Arguments urged by <hi>Peter,</hi> confirmed by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>However being met, something must and ought to be done for the peace of the Church, yet nothing contrary to the meaning of the Holy ghost. It is a sin and a high one, to think that either <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Barnabas</hi> in this taught false Doctrine, which must be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if any part of the ceremonial Law be obliging. <hi>Iames</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (who was Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) demands attention: main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that to be true which <hi>Peter, Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had said: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it from the Words of the Prophet <hi>Amos, Am.</hi> 9.11, 12. So that by <hi>Iames</hi> also, (This is a fourth witnesse) guided by the Spirit of God, the Ceremonial Law it not now obliging. <hi>Iames</hi> by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Argument seems to apply, that the teaching of it might hinder the gospell, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and gives it as his sentence; so that still even by these eating of blood is not forbidden under the gospel, being a part of that Law which they all consent not to be binding.</p>

<list>
                              <item>1. Something Ceremoniall, as to abstain from things strangled, and from blood. Here call to mind the Reasons given above for the prohibiting of blood; things strangled may have some relation to them, the blood not being out of them, and therefore that sort of meat might be unhealthy: and if this were a sin (<hi>viz.</hi>) to eat blood it behoved every man to assure himself of a good Cook: Nay we
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104618:116"/>
question whether ever he would eat meat. We are sure the Mysticall use of blood is gone <hi>viz.</hi> to make an Atonement for the soul: what vse it is prohibited now for hath not yet been discovered.</item>
                              <item>2. Something there is indifferent (viz.) to abstain from meats sacrificed to Idolls, now we know that is not in it self unlawful, for an Idol is nothing. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. The Apostle there speaking of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it not as a sin, but only if weak Brothers be offended at it, it is forborn, for the peace of the Church; if it were absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary here: it would never be indifferent there.</item>
                              <item>3. Something is morall, necessary and binding (<hi>viz.</hi>) to abstain from Fornication, looked upon among the Gentiles as a thing of no great concernment: the <hi>Corinthians</hi> though called, were very guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, and one in a high measure. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. &amp; 6.</item>

                        <p>Now says the Canon. <hi>It seemed good unto the Holy Ghost and to us.</hi> The Holy ghost of old and new, commands to abstain from fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it seems good to us gathered together by the Holy ghost filled and guided by the Holy ghost (<hi>viz.</hi>) Us Apostles, Elders &amp;c. that you should abstain from meats sacrificed to Idols, and from blood, &amp;c. for no otherwise are we to read the words, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that <hi>Peter, Paul &amp; Barnabas</hi> did oppose every part of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, yet in regard that <hi>Moses</hi> is read, &amp;c. it seems good to us that these things be done.</p>
                        <p>They are called necessary things. For

                              <item>1. Fornication is necessary to be abstained. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.</item>
                              <item>And 2. That of Idols, if it be taken for pollution with Idols, as <hi>Iames</hi> sentence is. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.20. then it is absolutely necessary, if it be taken for eating meats offered to Idols, as the Canon of the Councill is, then it is necessary <hi>secundum quid</hi> only, as abstaining from blood and strangled, that is, they are necessary now in respect of procuring peace to the Church, for the taking away of the cause of offence; for again remember that three Apostles opposed every part of that Law that was given by <hi>Moses.</hi>

for neither if <hi>we eat, are we the better, neither if we eat not are we the worse</hi>; a plain demonstration that that Law is not obliging; yet he would have them to abstain, not as from the Law, but for the conscience of him that was offended; so that onely in respect of giving cause of offence to others, is things sacrificed to idols not to be eaten; and by consequence eating of blood is no more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, the cause therefore of that forbearance being removed (<hi>viz.</hi>) the reading of <hi>Moses</hi> Law; and the tenderness or ignorance of new converted <hi>Iews,</hi> through the establishment of the gospel being also taken away, that the consciences of few or none that are Christians are wounded for useing our liberty in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, we may without sinning against our own souls, eat blood, as safely as ever the <hi>Corinthians</hi> might eat things sacrificed to idols, or in an idols Temple; since both these by the Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were esteemed necessary, not in themselves, but in respect of weak consciences &amp; peace of the Church, which now in these two particulars, is in no danger for had things sacrificed to idols been in it self necessary to prevent sinning against a mans own soul, then <hi>meat had commended us unto God,</hi> which it doth not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8.

But why must not one judge another, in eating or not eating meats forbidden in the Law? the Reason he gives, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>I know and am perswaded by the Lord Iesus, that there is nothing unclean of it self, but to him that estesmeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean</hi>; the Apostle is speaking of meats, of which not by <hi>Moses, but by the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, he knows none unclean in it self, therefore not blood; but if a man be conceited through ignorance, or conscience, to that man any thing, were it bread, it is unclean</hi>: He perswades therefore that though
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:104618:118"/>
men by Christ may eat any thing <hi>yet if any Brother be grieved, for his eating any meat</hi> forbidden by the Law, he would not have him cause his Brother to sin. <hi>For the kingdom of God is not in meat and drink, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. For he that in these things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by him.</hi> Now if it were so that that Law touching eating of blood were necessary, then a part of the kingdom of God should consist in meat; and though we followed after peace &amp; righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet could we not, neither should we be acceptable to God without abstaining from meats, or something that were in it self edible: for what is such, is meat. What ever therefore is forbidden as eating of blood is not to be forborn upon any account, but onely upon the weak consciences of our brethren, and in eating or forbearing none ought to judge the other, for God hath received both him that eats: and him that eateth not, <hi>vers.</hi> 3.

The time is expired: and he that under the Gospel preacheth up the use of forbearing meat, as a point of Doctrine, binding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men, under what seeming purity soever, is but a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of Sathan, and his doctrine the doctrine of Devils, &amp;c.

are in themselves good, yet for us to eat them, it is a sin, and a part of unholiness? No says the Apostle, <hi>Every creaturo is good, &amp; none is to be refused, for it is sanctified by the Word of God and Prayer,</hi> v. 5. Suppose S. <hi>Paul</hi> to have blood before him, he is not afraid to eat: he hath cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a blessing, by which it is Sanctified, and he wil eat: for no creature is to be refused: and these things if <hi>Timothy</hi> teach, he shall be a good Minister of Iesus Christ, v. 6. He is not a Minister of the Law, and therefore he is not to look to that, but of Christ, and what the Word of God and Prayer hath sanctified, (and they sanctifie every creature,) let no man call it impure unlawfull, and if they do (as what will not some men do) we are to avoid them, they are sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Spirits, and teachers of lyes: not apprehending the Law of the Counsel, and the reason of that Law, nor comparing it also with other Scriptures, makes the ignorant and unlearned wrest this, as wel as other Scriptures to their own hurt and the Churches distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, making this not eating blood to be a standing law in the Gospel, upon the account of sin, when by the Apostles themselves, it is made no more necessary, then that of not eating what was Sacrificed to Idols, a thing by that faithfull Labourer in the Gospel, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in it self lawful enough to be done, but to be forhorn, for the sake of the consciences of others; and yet that very forbearance but for a time, till ignorance did turn to perverseness, and the <hi>Iiws</hi> weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness became stubornness, then other doctrine was taught. but still having a regard to the peace of the Church, the ground of <hi>Iames</hi> his determination, which otherwise in point of Doctrine, did agree to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> in opposing every part of the Ceremonial Law, yet it seemed good in regard the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in a great measure were not yet unchurched, nor wholy cast off, for their sakes to forbear meats in themselves lawful enough, as blood was since Christs was shed.

death, was the Paschal sabbath feast, on which the <hi>Iews</hi> rested, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.5.6. Now from the keeping of the passeover, or from the Paschal sabbath feast, (for at our Saviours death that feast happened on the sabbath &amp; the preparation was not so much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of it, as in regard of the sabbath, as, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.14. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 23.5, 6. and <hi>Mark</hi> 15.42.) is just fifty days, the fiftieth day from the passeover must be the feast of Pentecost, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.15, 16. which feast shall fall on the sabbath.

An argument made use of by <hi>Peter</hi> to prove that neither he nor his fellow Apostles were drunk as was supposed; many such circumstances fully shew that the sabbath was passed, and the day of the feast fully come, that is, compleated and ended.
<p>God therefore chusing this day to inspire his servants with his own spirit, to imbolden them in the preaching of his word; and they preaching upon that day, baptizing upon that day, taking no notice of the Jewish sabbath, is an argument of its change God giving them the spirit of doctrine, not on the Jewish resting day, but on the first day of the week: in regard that not that but this was the day wherein God appointed men should be taught in a more solemn way the wonderful works of God, of Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, and of salvation to all those that believe in his name.</p>

                     <p>The keeping of the Christian sabbath, or the observing of the first day of the week for the day of rest in the Church of Christ, whence was it? from heaven or of men? it is answered, from heaven; by Heavens great Trumpeter we are freed from any duty to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish feasts or sabbaths: from Heaven therefore doth our liberty come: but whether first appointed by Gods Son, or by Christs Apostles, the Scripture is silent: but that it was done by the spirit of God in one of them, is certain.</p>
                     <p>We read that Christ carried forty dayes with his Disciples after his resurrection, <hi>speaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</hi> What things conduced to the honour and glory of God; how the Church should be ruled, ordered and guided, did our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour without question speak of: there is written enough for us to believe: but all that he spoke, is not written, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.30. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those things this circumstance of time for publick worship might be treated on and spoken off. <hi>Christ is Lord of the sabbath,</hi> and he might remove it from the last unto the first day of the week.</p>
                     <p>If not changed by him, then without doubt by his Apostles who were in points of such high concernment guided by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible spirit of God: they durst not of their own accord teach any thing to any nation, but what he gave them a commandement for, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.18. And in this case, what he spoke to them in the closet, they might reveale on the house top: and by their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, administring the sacraments, Laws touching gathering of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections upon the first day, we are to conclude; that that spirit that led them into all truth, led them also to this practice: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them in this hath the Church of Christ directly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, holily set apart the first day of the week for the worship, not by its own authority, it being not in the power of the Church, Men or Angels to alter the day, but in him only who is Lord of it, or them who are immediately and infallibly guided by the spirit sent from him; but by example &amp; from the practise of the Holy Apostles this day (<hi>viz.</hi>) the first of the week is kept for the Lords service, and because of that not unfitly called now, as it was of old, the Lords

Now by this there is a root of prophaneness planted, and it may go from generation to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; he that is allowed or can allow himself any part of the sabbath to sport in, may in time take half the day, and afterward the whole Day, he may not value the fourth Commandement, and that may make him break the third, which may provoke him to break the sixth, and by a strange progression, doibling his sins, he may grow a Devil incarnate.
<p>It is easie to be observed that the Apostacy of this age usually begins at the sabbath: they often quarrel with this first, doubting of its Authority; they are in time resolved: then they doubt of the Assembly, then of the place of worship, then of the parts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; then of the God who is worshipped, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us therefore of our spending the sabbath have care, and serious thoughts, that sin and iniquity grow not upon us, and the root of prophaneness over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread not our families.</p>

that, might in violating the Law it self, Command his beast to do so to, which this precept prevents, and will not have his beast to work; he therefore that labours commits a double sin in forcing the beast and working himself, yet the poor creature being forced against its will, and against the Law, man must at the bar of Justice Answer for the offence; yea he may fear that his beast, though no body should know it, should rise up in judgement against him and condemn him, for violating the Law himself, and compelling it to do so likewise: to send therefore Horse and Cart to and fro upon the Lords Day, is a most wicked custome, and will have a smarting recompence in the end.</item>

                              <item>2. There is less in nature to teach us the keeping of this precept, then in any other of the Commandements: nature teacheth us that there is a God, to worship this God, to honour the name of that God whom we worship, to honour parents; and though the <hi>Barbarian</hi> know no body seeth him, none can accuse him, none can judge him, though he escape dangers by sea, and perils by land, yet he dare not murder for fear of VENGEANCE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to set aside one whole day in seven, precisely one in seven, and that not a part, but the whole of a day, and this not for, thy self alone, but thy cattle and thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants must rest as much as thy selfe, as long as thy self, and that not at thy conveniency or times of leasure, but in the thickest of thy imployments, and not at thy pleasure, but still one day in seven; of this we say nature teacheth nothing, and therefore there is a special <hi>memento</hi> put upon it.</item>

There is more in nature that may allure us to the breach of this precept, then there is to the breaking of any other of the Commandements. It is onely the Fool that will say there is no God: and if he do, it is but in his heart; every man hath something of that natural principle to do as he would be done by: but the Sabbaths being Gods property, we are apt to catch hold of some part of it through the ignorance of God that is in us: the day is clear, and the streets are clean, and such a thing is doing, or may be done, and profit will follow, we shall gain by it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this might tend to the prophanation of the Sabbath, and therefore God gives a strict charge particularly for that.</item>

The Jews are said to eat nothing upon the Sabbath day untill they had performed their devotion, which was about the sixth hour, which began at nine of the clock. We find also and know that many godly people will neither eat nor drink upon the Sabbath day morning, finding meat an hindrance to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten siveness of devotion, that they desire to be acted by, and also many will take the holy communion fasting. At which ordinance, as God requires pure hearts and hands, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to come with clear heads and empty stomacks, that they may so much the more be like the Angels of God, quitted from the loads and burdens; I had almost said bonds of the flesh.</item>

                        <p n="1">1 The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes fasting to be meritorious: they suppose they merit something at the hand of God for their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence, that is deserve somthing at his hands, not so the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, she teacheth that when we have done all, we are to acknowledge our selves unprofitable servants.</p>

                           <pb n="250" facs="tcp:104618:146"/>2 They prescribe certain times as necessary to be keept upon the account of salvation, what ever dayes the Church appoints for annuall Fasts it is necessary if they would be save to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them accordingly, hence it is that the neglectd of it as a breach of the third (though according to God of the fourth,) commandement must of necessity be confessed, to the priest, that such penance may be injoyned as is sutable to that high offence for the expiation of its guilt. Now the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, appoints, neither knows she any time to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as necessary but what God and his Son appointed in his word.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They abstain from meals of this or that fort, as being for the time (prescribed for the fast) altogether uncleane, their consciences will be defiled if they should eat them, that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out authority. Now the Catholick Church though she injoyne a fast, yet by the Lord Jesus she knows no meat unclean of it self, and he that teacheth otherwise is not of God but of Sathan, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 43.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> looks upon her fasting as a part of Gods worship, her very abstaining from meat or from this or that meat, is taught to be points of worship, the Church Catholick teacheth that Fasting in it self is of no use, nor no part of worship, But as a fit meanes and as it serves to the uses aforesaid, so she requires it, not otherwise.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That some fast, particularly lent, is of Apostlical insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and out of religion and conscience to be observed, the Catholick Church knowes no such law, and therefore she keeps not lent, upon that account, but for other ends and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causes, as shall by and by be shown.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That outward Fasting is of it selfe sufficient without the inward, and indeed if fasting that is abstaining from meats or meals be of it selfe a point or part of worship it may be so: but the Catholick Church pleads for an Inward fasting or abstaining from sin, and for a soul to afflict it selfe for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, without which the outward fasting is not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

They are foully belyed by many Authors if good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would not take the Fasts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be great feasts, through the variety of dainties, and plenty of wines therein fed upon, by which it is not to be called a fast, which makes us that for the present we need not show the difference between this and the Fast of the Church Catholick.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>For benefits and mercies received</hi>: It is thankfulness that keeps Gods hand open; he that would come to God suing for new favours, must come with <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren, with double money in his hands; thanks for the former, and faith to procure future favours. The Church possibly sees her enemy, that wicked <hi>Haman</hi> fall before her; blame her not, if there be joy in all her Cities, <hi>Ester</hi> 9.18. She fasts to procure them, and gives thanks at the receiving of them, hence it is called a Feast-day; It is a time wherein the Church invites her Nobles to a Banquet of Wine, puts on her royal apparrel, and shows what God hath done for her and her people.</p>

and from among his sons, purposes to get himself a name, and establish to him self a Church; he near <hi>Bethel,</hi> builds an altar and there he worshipped God, not for a day only but as long as he and his family lived there, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.8. by reason of a famine <hi>Abraham</hi> is forced to dwell in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who comeing thence when God had visited <hi>Canaan</hi> with bread, <hi>came to the place of the altar which he had made there at the first, and called upon the name of the Lord</hi>; Gen. 13.3, 4. that is at <hi>Bethel,</hi> whose name of old was <hi>Beersheba, Gen.</hi> 20.10, 19.

<p>When they began, the Scripture gives no particular account, however in regard that the Temple was a great distance from most of the people, and the Sabbaths were to be observed: Its probable they were erected in the days of <hi>Iosuah</hi> after the Lord had given the people rest: That they were in <hi>Davids</hi> time is clear, <hi>Psalm</hi> 74.8.

                     <list>
                        <item>1. From the nature of the precepts: there are commands in Scripture for the keeping of a Sabbath; for the peoples hearing of the Law, for the Prophets teaching, and for the peoples gathering together; all which in their own nature im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie the necessity of having a proper and publick place to do these things in.</item>
                        <item>2. From the practise of all Nations; we see no Nation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most throughout the habitable world, but hath places set apart for the worship of their false Idol gods, and it hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that the Saints of old had places, (not to say build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for they were not from the beginning) where they erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Altars, and worshipped the Lord, and inquired of him, touching doubtfull cases, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.22. shall Christians then be
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:104618:164"/>
backward, and want places of worship for to serve their Lord and Master.</item>
                        <item>3. From the confusion that would upon the want of them, ensue: if every one might worship God in what place he pleased, or every family in what place they pleased: We may without the Spirit of Prophecy, foresee as by a vision that thereupon would follow nothing but disorder, confusion, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, sedition, destruction, and it were to be feared damnation.</item>
                        <item>4. From that ease it gives to Ministers. In those places one Sermon may feed five, yea ten thousand, which could not be done were he to go to every particular company in what place they thought best, so he should no where be sure of a Congregation, and while he were teaching one, the other might be without instruction, and he not able through weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to preach any more, some must want, which in time would make the people heap to themselves Teachers contrary to the practise of good people and sober Christians, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3.</item>
                        <item>5. From that care that it puts upon Ministers: These publick places and solemn meetings puts a certain awe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Preacher, that he dare not utter that but what he is able to defend, and what he knows to be truth, in regard it cannot be recalled without some stain, nor denyed without abundance of sin, in regard of the multitude that hears, which private meetings and corner-assemblies, and brew-house or kitchin Sermons clearly takes away, it being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to preach to recal, and deny that to one of them which he uttered in another: and to speak truly, the Kitchin or Barn is a good shelter both against Ignorance, Heresie and Falshood.</item>
                        <item>6. From that honour they bring to religion: Is it not more honourable for Christ to be worshipped by his Disciples in large, decent, comely structures, the very walls of which hath a certain holiness in them, to put an awful respect into the soul of him that enters, &amp; to see a number of Christians praising the Lord with one breath in this house, then to see the same num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber meeting in a Washouse, Warehouse, Backhouse, or any other outhouse, worshipping God. When the Turk hath starely Temples, the Jews clean Synagouges to perform that service their ignorance and infidelity leads them to.</item>

Now is it not therefore as proper, that that house in a parish builded for the Lord, have its sacred dedication, and separated by some holy service for that end and purpose; which may put a kind of sham upon any that would out of cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or wickedness alienate it from its proper use: but this bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen sacred age hath quitted shame, and our upstart noble men and Gentlemen, would be loath to have their grooms litter, or curry their horses in their Halls, yet these sacrilegious and prophane Saints, could approve, ye command them to do it in Churches.

                     <p>Let us now see unto whom this ordination is to be given, and who it is that ought to be thus separated in a solemn way for the service of God, what persons they be that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Creet</hi> must ordain, is told us in their Epistles: some notes of them are essential, and some of them are accidental; some are for their being, some for their well-being; some shew their carriage without, and some their deportment within the <hi>Pulpit</hi>; we shall see only the chief of them.</p>
                     <p>In a Minister there is required, 1. Courage, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.15. 2. Sobriety, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. 3. Liberality. 4. Docibility, or aptness to teach. 5. Temperance. 6. Patience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. 7. A Lover of good things, and of good men. 8. Holiness. 9. Justice, 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 7.8.</p>
                     <p>We must note, that some of these cannot be known by the quickest eye. No Bishop is omniscient to know the heart, and therefore may ordain a man that wants many of these; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we must observe, that a person may come for ordination, with many, or all of these and yet may backslide, which takes not away the force of ordination. The Angel of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> fell from his first purity and love, yet was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel still, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4, 5. he may loose his patience, his tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, his holiness, yet a Minister still, and the power of preaching and administring the Sacraments, and exercising the keys, abide with him, these ordinances not depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the quality of him that doth administer them, more then the force of the Broad Seal of <hi>England,</hi> depends upon the merits of my Lord Chancellour, as shall God willing be proved in its own place.</p>
                     <p>To all these qualifications above named must be joyned competency of knowledge. It is not every man that is just, holy or patient must be ordained, he must be of understanding competent for the work, which competency appears in these particulars from <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9 (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>

                     <p n="2">2. In his ability to teach, and that soundly for the edification of the Church, according to that truth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In his dexterity in maintaining of that truth, stopping the mouth of Gainsayers; he that is so qualified cannot be refused ordination.</p>

                     <p>Let us see who they are that must thus ordain, whose hands they be, that by their laying on the person is qualified in an external way for the publick preaching of the word.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Not their own, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. It is against the practise of the whole Church of God in all ages, for any man, though never so well gifted, to separate himself, or ordain himself, as is clear in the examples of <hi>Stephen, Nicanor,</hi> &amp;c. Nay if it were in a mans own power to separate himself for the work of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Paul</hi> needed not to have left <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Creet,</hi> to ordain Elders in every City, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. It is a practice beyond a president in the Church of Christ, for one to ordain himself. We read indeed how <hi>Frederick</hi> the second upon Easter day (through necessity) crowned himself with his own hands King of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; but that ever man made himself a Priest in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> save <hi>Saul, Ieroboam,</hi> and such prophane Wretches whom God did curse even for so doing we read not. Neither in old or new Testament, is there any instance of one who set himself apart for holy functions, or that thought himself qualified in an authoritative way to reach the Gospel upon the sufficiency of gifts, as Courage, Holiness, Knowledge, and the like; if so, <hi>Stephen, Philip, Prochorus,</hi> &amp;c. needed never have been ordained Deacons, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. Nor <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> Apostle or Evangelist, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2. nor <hi>Timothy</hi> a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop or E'der, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Not the multitude: Never did God give the power of

Presumptuous are they therefore that will take ordination from them, impudent before the Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they that will presume to give that authority in matters of so great concernment (as the word and Sacraments) to any of their own body.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Only Church officers, or the Apostles successors; they are only to teach and to baptize unto the end of the world: <hi>Paul</hi> and the Presbytery ordains <hi>Timothy</hi>: he ordains others, and they others: and so by a moral succession from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, is the Ministerial office upheld; but of this we have spoken.</p>
                     <p>It were too great a task for me to offer to wade into that troublesome discourse touching Episcopal or Presbyterial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, least I should drown my self, being but of small standing in the Church of Christ: yet by vertue of that <hi>Proverb, It is good to be sure.</hi> Episcopacy is much to be preferred, that being the most ancient way since, if not before the Apostles departure from the world; and albeit it hath some ruptures or breaches in some of the reformed Churches, yet the Acts and Lawes of <hi>England</hi> make no ordination valid, but what origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally is Episcopal.</p>

It is an odinance of God alwayes practised in his Church, it may appear at the first sight to the carnal Christian, but a low and poor device to gather some men together, and pray, and lay their hands upon anothers head, to make a man an Ambassador of Jesus Christ, to make him a steward of the Mysteries of God, a Planter, a Waterer, a Builder, and a Watchman to the Church: by the same kind of Logick the other ordinances of God might be abused: What force (may the same Creature say) hath a Morsel of bread, and draught of wine, in the Sacramnnt of the Lords Supper to assure men of heaven, to foagive their sins, to confirm faith, to qucken hope, to preserve love, and so contemn that. We ought in those cases to look to the institution and approbation of God, and practise of the Apostles; and to keep and hold up Gods ordinances in purity, is a means of being ever happy.

                           <p n="3">3 Preaching is of most general concernment, there are sins of the age and times, wherein the Catechist may faile, but preaching disclaiming these, detecting those, is most profitable: there are providences some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time sad, and sometimes cheerfull, which is to be observed, and noted, and people taught accordingly: these oftentimes may not fall under the cognisance of a Catechist; and if they should, he would put a block in his own way, and give occasion of stumbling to them for whose sake Catechizing is most u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="4">4 It puts a greater chearfullnesse in the spirits of the most knowing, to come to Gods service, when Christians have been in the days of their minority trained up in that way by question and answer. To be kept continualy to it might flat their appetite, and blunt the edge of their devotion, especially in publick places, where, by relation, in former times, when Catechizing swallowed up preaching, halfe the sabbath was loosly, not to say prophanely kept and spent, the Ministers gifts may not be for that service, nor his parts though otherwise eminent, for such teaching, which may in time breed a slighting of him, among his own people, what gifts God gives to teachers, by which they may most advance the end of teaching which is the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church, those ought to be most exercised by them, and by this rule men may know what is best to be done.</p>

That sinne might be discovered more convinceingly, the whole Law or Word of God reproves and holds out sin, but preaching by mustering and collecting all Gods threatnings together, and laying them in the sinners sight, holding them to his face, seems to make him startle, and really to tremble, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5.</item>
                        <item>2. That they may be condemned more inexcusably. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might plead their ignorance at the barr of Justice, and excuse their sin, in regard of the Scriptures deepness. God therefore to clear himself from the least imputation of injustice, stirs up his servants to open, expound, reveal and apply his Word, giving by them unto his people line upon line, precept upon precept, shewing them their sin, and making them know their transgression, whereby their condemnation is the more just, and their ignorance the less inexcusable.</item>
                        <item>3. To set out the freeness of Gods grace the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the grace of God appears in every line of the Scripture, and each line may lead us to admiration, yet this of preaching

                        <item>4. To set home the cross of Christ more powerfully: In reading the history of our Saviours passion, what soul can but be affected, yet when the Preacher cloathed with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission overshadowed by a divine ray in the congregation, and his tongue made like the pen of a ready Writer, declares his agony in its order, time, causes, parts, nature, greatness and effects, what heart can be so rocky as not to break.</item>

The false Apostles in that City glorying that they preached the gospel freely (the same which our Hereticks do now,) which the Apostles of Christ did not, made <hi>Paul</hi> in that City to take a way the occasion of their so glorying by his free teaching, which is no rule for them to follow unto whom God and the laws hath given a certaine maintainence, and yet for his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was despised of those false Apostles, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. so desirous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways are those that are not true teachers, to find something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that are.
<p>Another reason of his so doing is the <hi>Corinthians</hi> covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; If he had but took from them so much as would have maintained him, the gospel had been hindered, and <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine by reason of charges had been neglected, and therefore is not to be brought as a rule for the ministry of the Gospel, now since Church rents are setled and Christianity esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</p>

                              <item>3 It gives too much liberty to passion, no face so fair but there may be found some blemish, no heart so holy but may have some lust, no man so upright but sometimes may halt, no preacher so sound but may preach errours.

                        <p n="3">3. From the Laws of the land: if the King, who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of honour, put such a peece of Honour, whether by Patent, or otherwise upon any Church-officer, there is there is nothing in the Scripture that contradicts the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of its receiving.

Them that are against that sinless practise, they are such as would be very well pleased, if there were no Church-officer to be called a Lord, that they might lord it over their lands and tenements, yea, would never be angry at the title, if they could obtain it themselves; and they who would not have them to be called Masters, are such as would have them trod under foot, and be Masters of their Pulpits: considering

this denial of theirs, or anger of theirs against these titles, is the less with wise men to be regarded.</p>
                        <p>Touching that place of Scripture against exercising Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.42. As it takes not away authority, out of the King of the Gentiles hands, so neither doth it make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for a Church-Officer to be called Lord, so he lords it not in a tyrannical and oppressive way; that Text purely teaching humility and love: and yet we know of late dayes, none was more tyrannical, none more exercised unlawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor lorded it over the Clergy, then those meek Lambs, (yet wild foxes) that refused to be called Lords.</p>
                        <p>As for that place urged against a Ministers being called Master, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8, 9, 10. where our Saviour condemns the Scribes and Pharisees for using of it, who were not worthy of it in regard it blew them up with pride: when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand those words going before, <hi>Call no man Father,</hi> they are able to know their error in this particular, <hi>Be ye not called Masters,</hi> both being equally a sin, and equally reproved and forbidden by our Saviour.</p>

                  <p>This we call conference, and hath two parts, <hi>Teaching and Admonishing</hi>: touching their difference we have in part spoken before.

                     <hi>Teaching one another,</hi> (i.e.) in the matters of faith, as touching the doctrine of creation, redemption, of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scriptures, the union of God and man in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our Mediator, the necessity of the Sacraments of the new Testament: of the publick worship of God, of the slate of the dead, and of eternal judgement. All which is profitable to be done at convenient times, and in convenient places, where and when Christians meet together.</p>
                  <p>Seeing it is the duty of all Christians, at all convenient times to teach and instruct each other about the things of God, to press this, is within the compass of our undertakings, and therefore touching it we shall consider

From that practise of Christians conferring each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about worldly affaires, may we draw an argument inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duty now pleaded for. Men will be apt to discourse of that mans nature, of the others neglecting of his person, of anothers bad husbandry, of his health and of his estate, and give their opinions, judgements and counsels accordingly.

                        <item>6. Grace naturally will be doing, and it ought not to be stifled, as the kingdome of heaven is like <hi>leaven,</hi> so is the kigdome of grace. It will endeavour to dilate, extend and inlarge it self, it will as fire be striving to bring every thing to its own nature: Grace in the religious soul will beger grace in anothers, and true godliness will be satisfied though it walk towards heaven, desiring still to have companions in a holy course. The meetings of Christians ought to be Christian
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:104618:195"/>
meetings, in building up each other in their most holy faith, and true grace will take an opportunity to insinuate it self into the bosomes of others, that God may be all in all: yet in this beware of these three mistakes.

It is but labour in vain to point out the way of heaven in heat of blood, to him that is in thy presence, he hath reason to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that fury not zeale makes thee a teacher, and upon that flight the doctrine taught. Love like a small and thick shour can open the ground of the heart, and soften it whilest passion like great shoury drops, hardens it, and causes it only to become the more hard, whereby the thing taught slides off, and is not received into the bosome of him that is reached, and so becomes ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to his edification.</item>

                        <hi>They are holy and visible signs ordained by God, as seals of his promises, representing that inward grace and goodness which he bears towards, and intends to shew unto his people through the Lord Iesus.</hi>

Therefore they are called Holy figures, Marks, Badges, Prints, Forms, Patterns, Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Memorials, Symbols, Seals, or Signs, Evidently holding forth Christ and all his merits, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Ordained by God</hi>] Sacraments are in themselves not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial, but essential parts of Gods worship; and therefore he onely is to be the giver of them: none ought to inrrude that as a part of worship unto which God hath not given his consent.

God must give the grace, gift or mercy signified by that sign: therefore it is fit he appoint the sign himself; he appointed circumcision under the Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. and baptisme under the Gospel, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.33.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>As seals of his promises</hi>] God hath declared in his word that <hi>he will forgive his peoples iniquity, and remember their sins no more, Ier.</hi> 31.34. and hath appointed the Sacraments as seals to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and all others of the like nature.</p>
                     <p>The Sacraments may be considered in a three fold manner, and usually are:

                     <p>THe parts of a Sacrament are these two: <hi>viz.</hi> the sign, and the thing signified.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The sign, that is the outward visible and natural Element, sanctified and set apart by God (the onely Lawgiver to the Church) to be used in that ordinance for such an end and purpose. Thus
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:104618:218"/>
water, and bread and wine are appointed, and instituted to be memorials, representations, tokens, signs and Elements in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Gospel, as circumcision and the Paschal Lamb were of the Law, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.</item>
                        <item>2. The thing signified, that is the inward, invisible and spiritual thing, which is mystically reprsented to the faithful receiver by the natural Element thereunto sanctified and set apart, which is Christ, who in presenting of the Elements is proffered, and in the receiving of them is applied by the believer for his own good and comfort.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>How grosly doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> oppose the very being of a Sacrament in their transubstantiation? for if the very body and blood of Christ (which is the thing signified by the bread and wine in the Sacrament of the supper) be received by the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, then where is the sign, the outward and visible, which must necassarily be in this Ordinance? if they say (as they do) that the figure and colour of the Cake is the sign, my faith must be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in that particular, until it be shewn that the whiteness or roundness of the wafer or bread was appointed to be the sign, by him that hath the sole power to give the thing signified.</p>
                     <p>Between the sign and the thing signified in the Sacraments, there is a certain harmony and sweet similitude &amp; proportion; how aptly did the circumcision of the flesh represent to the <hi>Iews</hi>: the circumcision of the soul, heart or mind? <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.6. and the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb, that Lamb of God whose blood being upon their hearts, saves them from the destroying Angel. What a Holy harmony is there between a Christians being washed with water in the name of the sacred Trinity, and the blood of Jesus which washeth us from all our sins? 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. and being washed with baptismal water for our natural and outward impurity, <hi>we ought to cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. The like of the other Sacrament, which shall be discovered in due time.</p>
                     <p>Now when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> shall finde out so exact a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between that which they call the sign in the supper, and the thing signified, they may bring possibly a true Catholick one step nearer her then for the present probably he may be; we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:104618:219"/>
but a step; for admit the proportion be never so exact, yet if the sign be not instituted, it can never be a memorial of the thing signified.</p>

                     <p>We need but to be born in Christ, and then continue in him, which is accomplished by these two, without any other. By baptisme we put on Christ as a garment, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. and by the supper we feed upon him as meat, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. having therefore <hi>food and raiment</hi> by these Sacraments, <hi>we ought to be content.</hi>

                              <item>2. Sacraments under the Law depended not upon the merits of the Minister; Circumcision was a token of the Covenant, and was equally in that respect a visible sign powerful in it self to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the circumcised to be one of Gods people, and give him an interest to the priviledges of the Sons of God, who ever it was, a good or bad Officer that cut off the foreskin; therefore baptisme now is of force for the same use, howbeit a scandalous Person ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it.</item>

<p>Without Question, this doctrine was never so much sown with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out assistance from <hi>Rome,</hi> whose doctrine in this particular is near to this, in regard that she makes the Sacraments to depend upon the intention of the giver; the people must either doubt at all times, or act implicite faith for ever according to her tenents.

<p>So in the Sacrament of the Lords supper, he that is a receiver of the bread and wine conscecrated, sanctified, and set a part as in the Gospel, receives the body and the blood of Christ in as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual a manner when the Minister is prophane; as when he is Holy; holiness in the Officer being not a condition required for the consecration.</p>

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:104618:227"/>
And that the Apostles might be encouraged in this great work, he goeth on saying, <hi>I am with you alway even unto the end of the world</hi>; Now the world is not yet ended, and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> are gone, <hi>with you</hi> therefore must be understood to be meant not of the whole multitude of believers, but of them that are outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly visibly called to preach all things that Christ had commanded in an authoritative way as the Apostles were. And as it is said that Kings never dye, that is, regally and successively, though personally they do: so the Apostles never dye, that is, successively, though personally they do; for to the end of the world so oft as any is visibly and outwardly ordained and commissioned to teach and baptize, the Apostles are not dead, but alive, and Christ prospering and blessing the doctrine of any so ordained in his being with his Apostles (that is, with them who are outwardly commissioned to teach) <hi>to the end of the world.</hi>
                              <p>To the multitude of belevers then was never the power to baptize given, because not the power of teaching, because not thereunto ordained, as hath at large been discovered above, unto which for brevity sake the Reader at present is referred.</p>

                        <p>Further admit that dipping were essential to baptisme, (which it is not) yet we may Question whether they be baptized that are dipped among them; the water of baptisme being not applied to the flesh signifying the application of the blood of Christ to the soul.

                        <p>By <hi>infants</hi> we understand such as are born of Christian parents, unto whom the promise of salvation is only made and given, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. The infants of others, <hi>viz.</hi> of Heathens. of Infidels, being without God, are also without Christ, and so without hope of Eternal life,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 2 12. That such infants as are born within the pale of the visible Church, may be baptized, that is, dipped, sprinkled or any other way decently washed, in the name of the Lord, appears from these following reasons.</p>

<p>And when shall the Adversaries of this truth finde out one place that the Covenant of grace made to believers under the Gospel, is not so large as that to believers under the Law, which included not themselves only, but all their seed? <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10.11.12. <hi>Never, Never, Never.</hi>

belongs and is appointed for them, and such as them. This testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of him who is Truth it self, hath sufficient proof to discover the lawfulness even of Baptisme to such, since that is a sign or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of their inheritance.</item>
                           <item>4. Infants are Disciples of Christ: <hi>He that receives one of them receiveth him, and it is dangerous to offend one of those little ones, that believe in him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.4 5, 6. Of whom doth our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour speak this? Of that little child before him, or of them that are little in the account of the world? We say, (or then we say falsely) that he speaks of both, and whereas our adversaries then concludes it were dangerous to offend or anger children: We conclude with them, and truly it is dangerous to offend one of those little ones, if it be purely upon the account that they belong to Christ, as we know hath been done by Turks, Jewes and Papists, not otherwise: for in some cases, that may be a sin even against the Gospel, not to offend them.</item>
                           <item>5. Infants under the Law were circumcised, therefore under the Gospel they are to be baptized. Hence it is that Baptisme is called Circumcision, 2 <hi>Col.</hi> 12. where the Apostle throws off cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of the flesh, and placeth baptizing in the room of it. And as all <hi>Iewish</hi> Proselytes were circumcised before they were owned as Gods people, and therefore called upon to be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; so all converted to the Christian Faith, were baptized before they were owned or declared Christians, (though both the one and the other belonged to God by faith before) and were therefore called to be baptized.
<p>In a word, let the use and end of Circumcision be inquired after, and Baptisme exactly answers it in all points. It is true, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was given onely to the Male, because the Female was unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it; but both Sexes are capable sufficiently of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore to be denied to neither, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12.</p>

There were some that were alwayes pressing the point of Circumcision ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law, to have the Christians not altogether to eye Baptisme, but with it Circumcision, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1.
<p>Now that Circumcision was administred upon Infants, is clear; and as clear it is again, that the Iewes seeing that liberty that Christians assumed under the Gospel, would have had them lay a great part of it aside, particularly baptisme, which they might have seen believers to administer upon all their seed; and this makes them press Circumcision the more eagerly, an Argument more then probable, that the Christians baptized their Infants in those dayes when that opposition was made.</p>

                           <item>9. There is nothing in the Scripture that makes against it.

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:104618:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Covenant, which is the initiatory Ordinance of Baptisme, to extend to the Infants of Believers under the Gospel though he did to those under the Law, but leaves them, and hath no more to do with them, then he hath to the seed of Infidels and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens?
<p>God would not without question have left his Church in so great and necessary a point as Baptisme without instruction, if it had not been his Will, that the seal of the Covenant should be as large now, and extend as far as it did then.</p>
                              <p>Let the Scriptures be searched, and the Bible exactly veiwed with the most piercing eye, and it shall never be able to find that Text that abridgeth or straightneth the Covenant made under the Gospel, but every way shall be found at large as that under the Law, which reacheth not to <hi>Abrahams</hi> person onely, but also all his seed.</p>
                              <p>To say that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was onely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, or carnal, that is, that Canaan should be his, and Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion sealed, that brings dishonour to the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and tends not to Gods honour or glory: that he should onely regard his people so far, as to give them a Land flowing with milke and honey, and assure them of that by Circumcision; but that he was their God to save them any more then he was the Aegyptians, never to give them a sign, seal, or assurance, takes away abundance of that comfort which the Heavenly-minded soul might enjoy: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides it is most false; for both before and after <hi>Moses,</hi> we know Circumcision was given to many that never did, nor never were to inherit the land of Canaan: so that Circumcision was a mystical seal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith in God for spiritual mercies, unto which

                        <p>It hath been the practice of some among us to throw off their first Baptisme, and as they suppose, receive a new one. Yea, Papists, who though they teach the contrary Doctrine, yet sinfully have practised it upon the children of the Reformed Churches; but however, Baptisme if given in the name of the Trinity by applying water according to the Institution, is not to be received twice. For,

<hi>Hence it is called being born of water,</hi> Iohn 3.5. Now though men eat and drink often, and receive the Sacrament of the Supper often, that being our food Spiritual: yet we are born but once, and therefore ought to receive the Ordinance of Baptisme but once, that being our Spiritual birth.</item>

<p>He can give no reason of his being twice baptized, but the same reason will make him, or perswade him to be baptized the third time, the fourth time; <hi>nec decies repetita placebit</hi>; the twentieth time.</p>

                           </note> It is to be observed that although the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Ethnicks</hi>
derided both the Apostles and the rest of the Christians, for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing in him who was Crucified upon the Cross: Yet all both Apostles and Christitians were so far from being discouraged from their profession by the ignominy of the Cross, as they rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced and triumphed in it; yeathe Holy Ghost did by the mouths of the Apostles honour the name of the Cross (being hateful to the <hi>Jews</hi>) so far that under it he comprehended not onely Christ Crucified, but the force, effects and merits of his death and passion, with all the comforts, fruits, and promises, which we receive or expect thereby.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The honour and dignity of the name of the Cross, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat a reverend estimation even in the Apostles times (for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>And this sign they not onely use themselves, with a kind of glory, when they met with any <hi>Jews,</hi> but signed therewith their children, when they were Christened, to dedicate them by that badge to his
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:104618:237"/>
service, whose benefits bestowed upon them in baptisme, the name of the Cross did represent.</p>
                        <p>And this use of the sign of the Cross in baptime, was held in the Primitive Church, as well by the Greeks, as the Latines, with one content and great applause.</p>
                        <p>At what time, if any had opposed themselves against it, they would certainly have been censured as enemies of the Cross, and consequently of Chrsts merits, the sign whereof they could no better endure; this continual and general use of the Cross, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by many testimonies of the ancient Fathers.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It must be confessed, that in process of time, the sign of the Cross was greatly abused in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after that corruption had once possessed it.</p>
                        <p>But the abuse of a thing takes not away the lawful use of it.</p>
                        <p>Nay so far was it from the purpose of the Church, of <hi>England,</hi> to forsake the Churches of <hi>Italy, France, Spain, Germany,</hi> or any such like Churches, in all things which they held and preached, that as the Apology of the Church of <hi>England</hi> con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </note> for when the Minister dipping the infant in water, or laying of water upon the face of it, hath pronounced these words I <hi>baptize</hi> thee in the name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>infant</hi> is fully and perfectly baptized; so as the sign of the Cross being afterwards used, doth neither adde any thing to the vertue or perfection of baptisme, nor being omitted, doth detract any thing from the effect and substance of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is apparent in the Common Prayer book, that the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant</hi> babtized, is by vertue of baptisme, (before it be signed with the sign of the Cross) received into the Congregation of Christs stock, as a perfect member thereof, and not by any power ascribed unto the sign of the Cross. So that for the very remembrance of the Cross, which is very precious to all them that rightly believe in Jesus Christ, and in the other respects mentioned, the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained still the sign of it in baptisme; following herein the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and Apostolical Churches, and accounting it a lawful outward Ceremony and honourable badge, whereby the <hi>infant</hi> is dedicated to the service of him who dyed upon the Cross, as by words used in the book of Common Prayer it may appear.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, The use of the sign of the Cross in baptisme, being thus purged from all Popish superstition and errour, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the primary institution of it: upon those true rules of doctrine concerning things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, which are consonant to the word of God, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all the Ancient Fathers, we hold it the part of every private man, both Minister and others, reverently to retain the true use of it prescribed by publick authority, considering that things of themselves indifferent, do in some sort alter their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when they are either commanded or forbidden by a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Magistrate, and may not be omitted at every mans plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, contrary to the Law, when they be commanded, nor used when they are prohibited.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="418" facs="tcp:104618:238"/>The usual Objection against this harmless Ceremony, is this, <hi>Viz. what need is there of it?</hi> but if Magistrates should not establish Lawes,<note place="margin">

It is a decent gesture; where there is no particular act requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Scripture, it is most lawful for us to betake our selves to general precepts. In the case in hand, being there is no gesture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, our Saviours sitting binding us no more then his receiving in an upper chamber, or after Supper doth, we may betake our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selves to that general, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. and kneel accordingly.</item>
                                    <item>2. It is an humble gesture. The ancients worshipped God often by prostration, signifying how unworthy they were to stand in his presence who was the God of the whole Earth; that is now out of
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:104618:256"/>
use: yet the signification of the same excellently held up by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuflexion: by bowing we signifie our apprehension of his great and infinite Majesty.</item>
                                    <item>3. It is a sitting gesture. This Sacrament is given by the Church with a charge to pray: and if the Communicant have a conscience, he will pray: now let the Scripture be searched, the Saints practice be inquired after; and what gesture is fitter for prayer then kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
<p>It is true that usually we sit when we pray at meat; yet to reason from a prayer in private business, to one that is annexed to Gods solemn worship, will not in all things hold: and if it should, we are not pleading the necessity of kneeling, but its lawfulness.</p>

                                    <item>4. It is of all gestures the most suitable: to behold a sinner where God is, and he in Christ, where Christ is, and he by the spirit sealing to a poor soul, and holding forth a pardon, what is more agreeable to the nature of the thing, then the sinner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that pardon upon his knees?</item>

                        <p>If it here be said that sitting signifies familiarity with God: we can easily Answer, that many are more bold with God then welcome: and this familiarity is a figure of their own election: the true Christian had rather shew his humility. And when they have searched, they will find that in Gods house sitting is not very often used in the time of prayer, with which that Ordinance is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                        <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> useth it also, though Originally she never begot it, it being a gesture almost as old (if not altogether) as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity: yet we must dispise it no more then throw away a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion cloth, which is decent and harmless, though the Papist have it: and even so is this though at <hi>Rome</hi> it be practised.</p>

                        <p>The Question is then, whether a man that hath prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by sound, hearty, real, and holy examination for that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, may altogether forbear it; and omit it upon the account of his knowing or foreseeing that such a drunkard will be at that holy banquet.

It is not left to our own will and discretion, that we may, or may not as we will; we ought to do our duty, and prepare our selves to be worthy receivers; if another neglect his, and yet receive, let him look to it, the Lord is at hand.</item>
                              <item>2. We might neglect other Ordinances as well as that; we might refuse to read the Scriptures, to pray, to hear upon the same reason; and indeed this doctrine as it hath kept some from the Chancel that is, from receiving it hath kept others from the Church that is from hearing, and this again hath kept some from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,

resolving to keep company with none but such as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without sin and therefore the light within is their rule.</item>
                              <item>3. God requires no such condition; he craves faith, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and new obedience on my part, but not that my companion should have the same, or then I to be refused, and my offering not to be accepted; one Christian shall never be bound hand and foot, and <hi>cast into utter darkness,</hi> because another of the company wants the wedding garment.</item>

In respect of the Church, that the ignorant and unlearned make not that Ordinance undervalued; the Question is of this latter, and amounts to this Whether the Church Officer may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully debar a sober pious Christian, or one of whom he neither sees nor hears evil, purely upon the account he will not submit to his examination? a practice of late too commonly known, nay se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral thousands have been excluded, except they came under the tryal, not of the Church Officers only, but of his lay-Elders, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice not heard of in the Church until these late years, and are parts of the Church no more, then those Anticks, whose mouths supplie the places of spouts unto the temples; but to let them pass, it is denied, private examination in this sence is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.

                        <p>By which two things, to all of understanding occurred. First, their arrogance to make Laws and compel the people without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to submit under the pain of le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>They held it an undervaluing of themselves to crave this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of their people, by any Law made by the Church; and yet no presumption to press it upon them by vertue of their own association, in the mean time producing no Scripture, wherein directly these things were either to be done by them, or obeyed by the people.</p>

The promises that are made therein; what ever God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to give his people, or his Church in generall, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever concerned the soul in particular, or the body in things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: (for his promising <hi>David</hi> a Kingdome in special is no rule to us) we may pray for the same thing, as for raine in its season, <hi>Zac.</hi> 10.1. and for a new heart, and new spirit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.</item>
                                    <item>3. The threatenings that are denounced therein, what ever judgment God threatens for sin in general, or for any sin in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it is lawfull for us to pray against that punishment, in the commission of that particular sin; It is therefore agreeable to the Scriptures, to beg that God would not dispise our feast dayes, not our solemn assemblies though we have sinned against him, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.21.</item>
                                    <item>4. The providence observed therein, when we see God in out-goings giving to this or that Saint such a particular grace, sutable to the place wherein he put him, or drawing him out of that misery; this or that way wherein he was pleased to cast him this may be a rule for us to pray accordingly, so Magistrates may pray for wisdome, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.9. and subjects to be delivered from all that oppresse them.</item>
                                    <item>5. The protestations that are declared therein, what ever it be that God for the vindication of his honour or exaltation of his grace, hath declared to the sonnes of men in reference to their sins or soules, to there temporall or eternall estate, may be eyed by us in our prayers, and therefore boldly may we aske, that we dye not the death though we be sinners, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11.</item>
                                    <item>6. The expostulations that are found therein. We find the Almighty chiding and checking men for their wilfulnesse; lazinesse, idlenesse and prophannesse which humbly we may make use of in our pleadings with God, thus <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> may pray that suddenly she may be made clean, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 13.27.</item>
                                    <item>
                                       <pb n="492" facs="tcp:104618:272"/>7. The Saints practises that are recorded therein. What ever we find the Saints prayed for, and were answered, ether <hi>ad voluntatem,</hi> or <hi>ad utilitatem,</hi> whether to their will or to their well, may be a rule for us to pray by, and therefore we may pray to be delivered from unreasonable men, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.2. or the buffetings of Satan, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8.</item>
                                 </list>

                              <item>2. We come? now to the particular rule; Which is that prayer composed by Christ, and recommended to his Apostles as a prayer, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. and to be a rule and standard, of all other prayers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. Unto which rule, scale or ballance should we bring most of their prayers, and petitions who refus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this form and rule, especialy those that had reference to things lately acted upon the stage of these Kingdomes, and the reason why they did so pray, we might write over them and upon them, <hi>MENE, TEKEL, Dan.</hi> 5.25, 26.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>In this rule or pattern of prayer their are four things to be observed,
<list>
                           <item>1. The Preface or Introduction to the whole prayer, In these words, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. The substance or the petitions themselves, which are asked in that prayer: In these words, <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                           <item>3. the greatnesse or excellency of the person, unto whom that prayer is directed. In these words. <hi>For thine is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                           <item>4. The confidence of the petitioner to be heard in the things prayed for. In this word <hi>Amen</hi>: All which in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall shews,
<list>
                                 <item>1. That we are to make a holy decent and honourable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance or preface unto our prayers. It is but blunt to hear men bolt forth thir petitions without giving God some holy title, as Almighty God, or holy and gracious Lord, or Eternal God,
<hi>A Centurion beseeched him saying, Lord, I have a servant lieth at home sick of the palsie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Math.</hi> 8.6.</item>
                                 <item>2. That when we come and appear before God, we are not
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:104618:272"/>
alwayes to be swelling in titles, but have some enlargement by way of request, contrary to the practise of some in our days that pretend they do appeare before God, and speake of high things, yet as if it were below them, they will aske nothing of him, but let us do otherwise, for we have not been so learned by Christ.</item>
                                 <item>3. That when we come to God to receive from him, we are not to go from his presence except something be given to him from us, we are at least to be thankfull, unto him which is done, when we divest our selves of all power, worth and merit, ascribing all the glory unto him.</item>
                                 <item>4. He that prays, ought not to waver, or be regardlesse, but full of faith, and desire to obtaine the things he openeth his mouth unto the Lord for, and faithfully as well as heartily say Amen.</item>
                              </list>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to be more particular,</p>
                     <p>In the preface there are two things by which our prayers are to be ruled.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. What God is: <hi>Our Father</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Where God is, <hi>which art in heaven.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>He that comes to God must not only know that God is, that is, that there is a God of himself, but also what God is to him, as that he is his Father, which is by Christ, and neither can he so call him but by the spirit.</p>
                     <p>So that the three persons in the Trinity must be all believed by him that would pray as he ought.</p>
                     <p>Again God being our Father teacheth us,
<list>
                           <item>1. To love him.</item>
                           <item>2. To fear him.</item>
                           <item>3. To obey him.</item>
                           <item>4. To honour him.</item>
                           <item>5. To depend upon him.</item>
                           <item>6. To love and pray for each other.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though it be said he is in heaven, we are no to suppose
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:104618:273"/>
he is confined there as if he were not upon the Earth, for as a King though he be in all parts of all dominions by vertue of his laws, and officers, yet chiefly and in a more eminent and majestick way he is at the Court. So is God our Father said to be <hi>in heaven</hi>: being there in his greatest glory, Majesty and Dignity.</p>
                     <p>From this we learn,
<list>
                           <item>1. That we pray to none, but to them whom we are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be in heaven. It is foolish to pray to them, of whom we have no certainty that ever they were, and dangerous to pray to them, of whom we have no great hopes that they are in heaven; In both these respects therefore the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> had better reforme her self, that her prayers may be answered.</item>
                           <item>2. That we pray to none in heaven, but to them that begat us, to our Father only are we to pray; now all others that are therein both Angels and men acknowledged themselves to be our fellow servants, and therefore, though in heaven, not to be prayed unto.</item>
                           <item>3. To have no earthly Imagination or thought in our heart in the time of prayer, whether in respect of the glorious Trinity whom we pray to, or of our selves or others whom we pray for. As heaven is in our mouth, so it ought to be in our affections.</item>
                           <item>4. To have raised desires, lifted up hearts, all the time of prayer. Heaven is high above us, and we must lift up the voyce of our soul to be heard by our Father there, and truly men ought so to compose their prayers in the length of them, as not to destroy their own, or their peoples fervency, a thing not much noted and observed in our days.</item>
                           <item>5. To be ever disposed and and fitted for prayer, where ever we are, in what place or dungeon we be, God is above and heaven is above, our fathers mansion house, so that no time shall we misse of him, nor no time shall he be from home.</item>
                           <item>6. To have ever a strong confidence and faith to be heard in prayer. Men may hinder much good doing upon the earth, and may encompasse the Saint like bees, then his hope is this, that
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:104618:273"/>
their hands are but short, they cannot keep his prayers from ascending, and therefore with confidence he may send them up.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 The next considerable thing in this prayer are the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in it.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rome</hi> will have seven and were there no greater difference between her &amp; the reformed Churches, we should quickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</note>

                     <p>In number they are six, as <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>From them in generall we learn.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. To pray for things of moment and of weight. All the petitions are of great concernment, and indeed necessary, to come to God begging trifles, is below his Majesty and Grandour,

                        </item>
                        <item>2.To pray for nothing but what is good. There is nothing in the petitions that is hurtfull either for the soul or body of man; this should learn us to be farre from cursing or wishing evill to any person, and indeed the curse may fall upon them that makes it, he whom thou art so cursing may be praying. <hi>Let him curse, O Lord, but blesse thou.</hi> If this part of prayer had been eyed by many, there had not been so many uncharitable petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons put up as there was.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>These six petitions divide themselves into two parts.</p>
                     <p>Three of them concerns God. <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Three of them concerns man, <hi>Give us this day our dayly bread,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Those petitions that concern God, goeth before the other, shewing that before all things we ought to seek the things concerning the Kingdome of God, and of all those things, the Glory of God ought to be most and first in our eye. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <item>1. Be observant of the providences of God to themselves or others, that they ether know, hear or see, this evil befalling now upon such, and this good being given to others, our own deliverance in such a danger, and anothers being left in the same danger; will afford abundance of matter in prayer.</item>
                           <item>2. Be studious of the Scriptures of God, by observing and heading the promises, threatnings, and passages therein, a great furtherance shall they be to him that intends to go to God by prayer.</item>
                           <item>3. Be often in the pactise of prayer. In this use may go a great way, and bares a great stroake, men that have great parts may lose them by not useing of them, and they that have small parts with exercise, may abundantly improve them.</item>

                           <item>6. Be studious in reading practical Divinity which treasures the soul with abundance of found knowledge, and that affords matter of meditation, and that again in prayer is brought forth with abundance of advantage.</item>
                           <item>7. Call upon God for the Spirit of prayer, not that I mean thou shouldst desire the spirit imediatly to act upon the heart and mind, and then upon the tongue, (as some fond ones in those dayes) for it may be aquestion whether that prayer would be lawfull, in regard that whatever is sayd upon that ground is equall to what was delivered by the Apostles, and equally bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                           <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. Whether the set forms of Prayers used by law in the Church of <hi>England</hi> be Lawfull.</head>
                        <p>Before this question be directly answered we shall premise a few things.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. That the book of Common prayer had never been defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this nature, but that the crossnesse, and peevishnesse of hot spirited men, and passionate writers hath so defamed the the thing it self, and also the users of it, that it appears to be thought by them a sin unto Death, Publickly, or privatly to own it in the Church.</item>
                           <item>2. That this defence doth not at all imply its necessity. I am perswaded the Church of <hi>England</hi> might stand without it, and may stand in purity by it. Unifomity is necessary for the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of the Church, as was known to the publishers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, and if the Magistrate will have uniformity another way, it may be had, and if this way, it may be used.</item>
                           <item>3. That much of the Common-Prayer is in the Masse, may be acknowledged to its honour. It is but a furious and blind zeal that makes men inveigh against the Churches practise in this,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:104618:286"/>
because of its affinity to <hi>Rome</hi>; since we are to preserve the peace of the Church to our utmost, we are not to decline too far from any opinion or practise that is lawfull; the Jews preists did Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, so did <hi>Baals.</hi> The Papists uses this or that form of prayer, if it be lawfull, so may I, that the breach or quarrel may appear to be one his part, not on mine; what ever is in the Masse that is lawfull and according to godliness is not to be despised, and what ever is otherwise is to be condemned and shunned.</item>
                           <item>4. That the book of Common-prayer might be altered, and otherwise framed, in some points bettered, is not rationally to be denyed, what book was ever composed by the wit or art of men, but others might alter it and in some measure better it. Let the Guisels view their Directory, and I doubt not but they will find that somewhat might be left out, and something put in, part of it expunged, and part of it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.</item>
                           <item>5. That by no meanes it ought to jostle out preaching is granted, and is easily to be defended. Prophecying is that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that cheifly discovers the secrets of the heart, that deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full part of man. Prayer and Sacraments hath done vertuously
<hi>but this excells them all,</hi> and therefore for none of them is it to be disesteemed.</item>
                           <item>6. That the Author hath competency of gifts (for which he desires to be thankfull,) to do without Common-prayer as well as others; Can they baptise, pray, bury, marry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without it? (<hi>absit a verbo I. Etantia</hi>) so can he; can they visit or pray su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably over the sick without it? so can he; can they promptly and readily vary their petitions at any time sutable to the duty in hand? so can he. In obedience to authority he useth it, and so ought others, though their gifts were more eminent then they are.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>These things being considered we come now to answer the question. And,</p>
                        <p>That the Liturgy, Service book, or Common-prayer of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is lawfull, and with a safe conscience may be used, appears by these following reasons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the piety, eminency, and godlinesse of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, they were men eminent and famous in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

opposers of, and to death some of them suffered for their not compliance to popish superstition, when they were rooting out popery and disclaiming the Pope with all his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents was that book compiled, shall we Imagin the Guisels, when they were composing the Directory, were establishing Episcopacy? if it were found to conjecture that, why ought we to conceite the other in collecting the formes of that book of Common-prayer were confirming popery, when of any other they most opposed it, and suffered most by it.</p>
                        <p>It will not be a needlesse digression to spend a little time in shewing the occasion of compiling the book of Common-prayer and see the compilers.</p>
                        <p>The occasion of it was breifly this.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth was by the Grace of God Crowned King of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. and it being in his mind to perfect that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation begun by his Father, made many glorious acts for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryfying of the Church from Romish superstition, particularly for administring the Sacrament of the supper under both kinds: there were some in that time obeyed the King and some that did not: so that the Sacraments were given by some one way and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers another way; some were for the King, some for the Pope, and some were neuter: to rectify which abuse, and to extirpate popery with as little voyce as could be, a writ is directed to the Archbishop of Canterbury (who afterwards was burned by Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> for his adhering to the Catholick or (as the terme now is) the protestant faith) by the King and his counsell requiring him with others to meet and consult how to prevent for the future, and remove that confusion for the present, the service of the Church being then various, after the use of <hi>Sarum,</hi> Of <hi>York,</hi> of
<hi>Bangor,</hi> and of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and besides them diverse other formes, and bookes called <hi>Antiphoners, Missales, Graites, Processionals, Manuells, Legends, Pies, Portuasses, Couchers, Iournalls, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,</hi> In a word every man used what form, fashion or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pleased him best.</p>
                        <p>This writ being sent to those persons hereafter to be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, they meet, and after much debate consulting with the antient liturgyes of the Church, expunging from them all what
