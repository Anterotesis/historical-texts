            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE Prediction of the most Learned and Pious Arch-bishop</hi> Usher, <hi>is very remarkable, as it was Printed about seven years ago with Licence, and the Truth of the matter of Fact therein delivered, never that I know of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but confirmed by many, which in short was thus.</hi>—That the year before this holy Primate died (who was Buried in the <hi>Abbey</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi> 17 of <hi>April,</hi> 1656. The Usuper <hi>Cromwel</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing 2001. towards his Funeral, so great his Worth, that it even charmed that Tyrant, otherwise far from being a Friend to any of his Profession:) An intimate Friend of the Arch-bishop's asking him (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other discourse) what his present Apprehensions were concerning a very great Persecution which should fall upon the Church of God in these Nations of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> (of which he had heard him speak with great confidence many years before, when we were in the highest and fullest state of outward peace and settlement) and whether he did believe those sad Times to be past, or that they were yet to come? <hi>He answered</hi>—That they were yet to come, and that he did as confidently expect it as ever be had done. <hi>Adding,</hi> That this sad Persecution
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98980:3"/>
would fall upon all the Protestant Churches of <hi>Europe. His Friend arguing, that he hoped the afflicton might now be over, and be intended of our late calamitous</hi> Civil Wars. <hi>The Reverend Prelate turning towards him, and fixing his Eyes upon him with that serious and severe Look which he usually had when he spake God's Word, and not his own, and when the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God seemed to be upon him, and to constrain him to speak, said thus:</hi> Fool not your selves with such hopes, for I tell you, all you have yet seen, hath been but the beginning of sorrows to what is yet to come upon the Protestant Churches of Christ, who will ere long fall under a sharper Persecution than ever yet has been upon them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>(said he to him)</hi> Look you be not found in the outward Court, but a Worshiper in the Temple before the Altar, for Christ will measure all those that profess his Name, and call themselves his People; and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worshipers he will leave out, to be trodden down by the Gentiles. The Outward Court <hi>(says he)</hi> is the formal Christian, whose Religion l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es in performing the outside duties of Christianity, without having an inward Life and Power of Faith and Love, uniting them to Christ, and th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se God will leave to be trodden down, and swept away by the Gentiles: But the Worshipers within the Temple, and before the Altar, are those who do indeed Worship God in Spirit and in Truth, whose Souls are made his Temples, and he is honoured and adored in the most inward thoughts of their Hearts, and they sacrifice their Lusts and vile affections, yea, and there own Wills to him; and th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se God will bide in the hollow of his Hand, and under the shadow of his Wings? and this shall be one great difference between this last, and all the other preceding Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, For in the former, the most eminent and Spiritual Ministers and Christians did generally suffer m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, and were most violently fallen upon, but in this last Persecution, these shall be preserved by God as a Seed to partake of that Glory which shall immediately follow and come upon the Church, as soon as ever this storm shall be over; for as it shall be the sharpest, so it shall be the shortest Persecution of them all; and shall only take away the gross Hypocrites and formal Professors, but the true Spiritual Believers shall be preserved till the Calamity be over past.</p>
            <p>

His Friend then asked him, By what means or Instruments this great Tryal should be brought on. He answered, by the <hi>Papists.</hi> His Friend replyed, That it seemed very improbable they should be able to do it, since they were now little coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, and but few in these Nations, and that the Hearts of the People were more set against them than ever since the Reformation. He answered again, <q>That it would be by the hands of <hi>Papists,</hi> and in the way of a suddain Massacre, and that the then Pope should be the chief Instrument of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He also added, <q>That the <hi>Papists</hi> were in his Opinion the <hi>Gentiles</hi> spoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. to whom the Outward Court should be left, that they might tread it under Foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they having received the <hi>Gentiles</hi> worship in their adoring Images, and Saints departed, and in taking to themselves many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators: And this (said he) the <hi>Papists</hi> are now designing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, and therefore be sure you be ready.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This gracious man repeated the same things in Substance to his only Daughter the Lady <hi>Tyrril,</hi> and that with many Tears, and much about the same time.</p>

                  <p>AS I am here employ'd by our Soveraign Lord the King, vour Grace can testify that I have left no Stone unturn'd for his Majesty's Advancement; neither can I omit (when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I meet with Treacheries or Conspiracies against the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98980:4"/>
Church and State of <hi>England)</hi> the sending your Grace an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in General. I fear Matters will not answer your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, if your Grace do but seriously weigh them with deliberation. For be you assur, d, the Romish Clergy have gull'd the misled Party of our English Nation, and that under a Puritanical Dress; for which the several Fraternities of that Church, have lately received Indulgence from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Council of Cardinals, or to educate several of the young Fry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who be Natives of his Majesty's Realms and Dominions, and instruct them in all manner of Principles and Tenents contrary to the Episcopacy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be in the Town of <hi>Hague,</hi> to my certain Knowledge, two dangerous Impostors, of whom I have given notice to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who have large Indulgences granted them, and known to be of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> altho they seem <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> and do converse with several of our English Factors.</p>
                  <p>The one, <hi>James Murray</hi> a Scotchman, and the other <hi>John Napper,</hi> a Yorkshire Blade. The main drift of these Intentions is, to pull down the English Episcopacy, as being the chief Support of the Imperial Crown of our Nation: For which purpose above sixty Romish Clergy-men are gone within these two Years out of the Monasteries of the French King's Dominions, to Preach up the Scotch Covenant, and Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> his Discriptions and Rules within that Kirk, and to spread the same about the Nothern Coasts of <hi>England.</hi> Let therefore His Majesty have an inkling of these Crotchets, that he might be persuaded, whenever Matters of the Church come before you, to refer them to your Grace, and the Episcopal Party of the Realm: For there be great Preparations making ready against the Liturgy and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and all evil Contrivances here and in <hi>France,</hi> and in other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Holdings to make your Grace and the Episcopacy odious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98980:4"/>
to all Reformed Protestants abroad: It has wrought so much on divers of the Forreign Ministers of the Protestants, that they esteem our Clergy little better than Papists. The main things that they hit in our Teath are, our Bishops to be called Lords; The Service of the Church; The Cross in Baptism; Confirmation; Bowing at the Name of Jesus; The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Tables placed Alter-ways; Our manner of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations: And several other Matters which be of late buzz'd into the Heads of the Forreign Clergy, to make your Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances the less regarded in case of a Change, which is aimed at, if not speedily prevented.</p>
                  <p>Your Grace's Letter is carefully delivered by my Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's own Hands unto the Prince.</p>
                  <p>Thus craving your Graces hearty Prayers for my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings abroad, as also for my safe arrival, that <hi>I</hi> may have the Freedom to kiss your Grace's Hands, and to tell you more at large of these things; <hi>I</hi> rest,</p>

                  <p>It plainly appears, that in the Year 1646, by Order from <hi>Rome,</hi> above, 100 of the Romish Clergy were sent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> consisting of English, Scotch, and Irish, who had been Educated in <hi>France, Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> part of these within the several Schools there appointed for their Iustructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In each of these Romish Nurseries, these Scholars were Taught several Handicraft-Trades and Callings, as their Ingenuities were most bending, besides their Orders, or Functions of that Church.</p>
                  <p>They have many yet at <hi>Paris</hi> a fitting up to be sent over, who twice in the week oppose one the other; one pretending <hi>Presbytery,</hi> the other <hi>Independency;</hi> some <hi>Anabaptism,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98980:5"/>
contrary Tenents, dangerous and prejudicial to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to all the Reformed Churches here abroad. But they are wisely preparing to prevent these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, which <hi>I</hi> heartily wish were considered in <hi>England</hi> among the Wise there.</p>
                  <p>When the Romish Orders do thus Argue <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> there is appointed one of the Learned of those Convents to take Notes and to Judg: And as he findes their fancies, whether for <hi>Presbytery, Independency, Anabaptism, Atheism,</hi> or for any new Tenents, so accordingly they be to act, and to exercise their Wits. Upon their Permission when they be sent abroad, they enter their Names in the Convent Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istry, also their Licences: If a <hi>Franciscan,</hi> if a <hi>Dominican,</hi> or <hi>Jesuit,</hi> or any other Order, having several Names there Entered in their Licence; in case of a discovery in one place, then to fly to another, and there to change their Names or Habit.</p>
                  <p>For an assurance of their Constancy to their several Orders, they are to give Monthly Intelligence to their Fraternities, of all Affairs where-ever they be dispers'd: so that the English abroad, know News better than ye at home.</p>
                  <p>When they Return into <hi>England,</hi> they are Taught their Lesson, to say (if any enquire from whence they come) that they were poor Christians formerly that fled beyond-Sea for their Religion-sake, and are now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, with glad News, to enjoy their Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
                  <p>The 100 Men that went over 1646; were most of them Soldiers in the Parliament's Army, and were daily to correspond with those Romanists in our late King's Army,

that were lately at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and pretended to Fight for His Sacred Majesty: For at that time, there were some Roman-Catholicks who did not know the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign a contriving against our Church and State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Year following, 1647, many of those Romish Orders, who came over the Year before, were in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation together, knowing each other. And those of the King's Party asking some why they took with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's side, and asking others whether they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched to turn <hi>Puritans,</hi> not knowing the Design: But at last, secret Bulls, and Licences being produced by those of the Parliament's side, it was declared between them, there was no better Design to Confound the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than by pretending Liberty of Conscience. It was Argued then, that <hi>England</hi> would be a second <hi>Holland,</hi> a Common-Wealth; and if so, what would become of the King? It was answered, Would to God it were come to that point. It was again reply'd, your selves have Preached so much against <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Holiness, that <hi>Rome</hi> and her Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists will be little the better for that Change: But it was answered, You shall have Mass sufficient for 100000 in a short space, and the Governors never the wiser. Then some of the mercifullest of the Romanist said, This cannot be done unless the King Die: upon which Argument, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Orders thus Licenced, and in the Parliament Army, Wrote unto their several Convents, but especially to the Sorbonists, whether it may be Scrupled to make away our late Godly King, and His Majesty His Son, our King and Master; who, Blessed be God, hath Escaped their Romish Snares laid for him? It was returned from the Sorbonists. That it was Lawful for Roman Catholicks to work Changes in Governments for the Mother Churches Advancement, and

chiefly in an Heretical Kingdom? and so lawfully make away the King.</p>
                  <p>Thus much to my knowledge, have <hi>I</hi> seen and heard since my leaving your Lordship, which <hi>I</hi> thought very requisite to inform your Grace; for my self would hardly have credited these things, had not mine Eyes seen sure Evidence of the same. Let these things Sleep within your Gracious Lordships Breast, and not awake but upon sure Grounds, for this Age can trust no Man, there being so great Fallacy amongst Men. So the Lord preserve your Lordship in Health, for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Good, and the Benefit of your Friends; which shall be the Prayers of</p>
