            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DEDICATION.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. <hi>Bentley,</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have often (during this Plays being in the
Press) been importun'd for a Preface; which
you, I suppose, would have speak something
in Vindication of the Comedy: Now to please
you, Mr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> I will as briefly as I can speak
my mind upon that occasion, which you may be
pleas'd to accept of, both as a Dedication to your
self, and next as a Preface to the Book.</p>
            <p>And I am not a little proud, that it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
into my thoughts to be the first who in
these latter years, has made an Epistle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to his Stationer: It is a Complement as
reasonable as it is Just. For, Mr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> you
pay honestly for the Copy; and an Epistle to
you is a sort of an Acquittance, and may be
probably welcome; when to a Person of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Rank and Order, it looks like an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Praises, which he knows he does not
deserve, and therefore is very unwilling to part
with ready Money for.</p>
            <p>As to the Vindication of this Comedy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb facs="tcp:59655:3"/>
Friends and Acquaintance, I believe it
is possible, that as much may be said in it's
behalf, as heretofore has been for a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others: But of all the Apish qualities about
me, I have not that of being fond of my
own Issue; nay, I must confess my self a very
unnatural Parent, for when it is once brought
into the World, E'en let the Brat shift for it
self, I say.</p>
            <p>The Objections made against the merit of
this poor Play, I must confess, are very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</p>
            <p>First, Says a Lady, that shall be nameless,
because the World may think civilly of her;
Fogh! oh <hi>Sherru!</hi> 'tis so filthy, so bawdy, no
modest Woman ought to be seen at it: Let me dye,
it has made me sick: When the World lies, Mr.
<hi>Bentley,</hi> if that very Lady has not easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
a much ranker morsel in a little Ale-house
towards <hi>Paddington,</hi> and never made a Face at
it: But your true Jilt is a Creature that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
Bawdy out of the chastest sence, as easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a Spider can Poison out of a Rose: They
know true Bawdy, let it be never so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd,
as perfectly as <hi>Falstaff</hi> did the true Prince
by instinct: They will separate the true Metal
from the Allay let us temper it as well as we
can; some Women are the Touch-stones of
filthiness. Though I have heard a Lady (that
has more modesty than any of those the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
<pb facs="tcp:59655:3"/>
and I am sure more wit) say, She won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
at the impudence of any of her Sex, that
would pretend to understand the thing call'd
Bawdy. So, Mr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> for ought I perceive,
my Play may be innocent yet, and the Lady mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in pretending to the knowledge of a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
above he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
we may credit the World has not buried her
Talent neither.</p>
            <p>This is, Mr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> all I can say in behalf of my
Play: Wherefore I throw it into Your Arms,
make the best of it you can; praise, it to your
Customers: Sell ten thousand of them if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and then you will compleat the wishes of</p>

here's the Ring you sent a Roguing; Sir, do you think my Wife
wants any thing that you can help her too?—Why I'll warrant this
Ring cost fifty pound: What a prodigal Fellow are you to throw a

maist be poor I'll lend thee money upon't, if thou thinkst fit at thirty

            <l>The Merit he allowes, and Praise he grants,</l>
            <l>Comes like a Tax from a poor Wretch that wants.</l>
