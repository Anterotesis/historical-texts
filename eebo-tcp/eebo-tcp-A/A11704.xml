         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Forſomuch
as we and the Eſtates of our Parliament preſently conveened, remembring that at the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Colledge of Juſtice, and divers times thereafter in Parliaments ratifying the ſame;
Our royall Anceſtors and Eſtates of our Realme then aſſembled, found the erection of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
conſiſtorie, which is a biding monument of the glorie of their reignes, not onlie to be
uſefull for royall ſervice, but alſo neceſſarie and profitable for the peace of this our Kingdome,
and to the ſeene good and comfort of all our Subjects; And conſidering that the proviſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of before to the Lords of Seſſion was no wayes ſufficient for defraying of their charges;
And that through their continuall attendance, their private affaires are neglected, and great loſſes
thereby ſuſtained by them: Therefore, and to the effect, the ſaid Senators and Lords of our
Seſſion, preſent and to come, may be more encouaged to go on, and to perſiſt as they do, in their
zeale, and affections to our ſervice, and in faithfull miniſtration of Juſtice, to the generall weale of this our Realme and our Lieges;
The ſaid Eſtates, with our ſpeciall approbation, and gracious good-liking, have moſt freelie condeſcended, ſtatute, and enacted, that
a taxation be preſently impoſed upon their lands and means, which with our conſent foreſaid, they ordaine to be collected and payed
to the effect, in maner, and at the termes following: That is to ſay, The Duke, Marqueſſes, Earles, Vicounts, Lords, and Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Shires for the temporall Eſtate, have granted that there ſhall be vplifted of everie pound land of old extent within this our
Kingdome pertaining to Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Vicounts, Lords, Barons, Freeholders, and Fewers of our proper lands, the
ſumme of ten ſhillings money at every one of the four tearms following, viz. The ſumme of ten ſhillings money at the feaſt and tearm
of Martinmaſſe next to come in this inſtant year of God, 1633. The ſumme of other ten ſhillings money at the feaſt and tearm of
Martinmaſſe, in anno 1634. The ſumme of other ten ſhillings money at the feaſt and tearm of Martinmaſſe, 1635. And the ſumme of
other ten ſhillings money at the feaſt and tearme of Martinmaſſe, 1636. And for the ſpirituall men and burrowes parts of the ſame
taxation, that there ſhall be uplifted of all Archbiſhoprickes, Biſhoprickes, Abbacies, Pryories, and other inferiour benefices, and
of every free burgh within this our Kingdome, at every one of the foure tearms aboueſpecified; the juſt taxation thereof, as they
have been accuſtomed to be taxed in all time by-gone, whenſoever the temporall Lands of this our Kingdome were ſtented to tenne
ſhillings the pound land of old extent. And for inbringing the <gap reason="blank" extent="1 span">
