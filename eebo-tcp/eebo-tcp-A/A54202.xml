            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>FIrſt</hi> then, he has taken <hi>a very unequal Way</hi> to repreſent our Faith, Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to the World, in that he hath rather deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own <hi>Fury,</hi> then a true <hi>Quaker,</hi> and ſhews to the World, rather what he would have us to be, then what we are.</p>
                  <p>Can it be fairly done, to propoſe the moſt knotty Queſtions for himſelf, and <hi>give the weakeſt Anſwers for us</hi>? Had he but had the Generoſity of a <hi>Roman,</hi> he would have given us fair Dealing for our Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: To make a <hi>Fool</hi> and an <hi>Heretick</hi> both, and then call him a <hi>Quaker,</hi> is no leſs then a <hi>Rape,</hi> becauſe a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Robbery committed upon thoſe that go under that Name.</p>
                  <p>The beſt of Men can never eſcape, let their <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries</hi> have but the Characterizing of them. It had become <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> if he would have ſhown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Chriſtian and a Champion too,</hi> firſt to have ſet down our Principles and Arguments, as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and urged by us, and then have enervated both by his pretended greater Strength of Scripture and Reaſon, before he had made ſo many Trophies of Conqueſt; But becauſe, had we been in the wrong, this had been the Practice of a true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and that this has not been his Practice, we are taught to infer, that <hi>T.

                        <hi>Dial.</hi> p. 66.</note> but to <hi>belye our very Conſciences and Principles.</hi> For when he asks us, Do you believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be true Sayings of God? he makes us to anſwer, <hi>So far as they agree to the Light in me</hi>: An Anſwer never ſo delivered by us. And when he queries, Will you be ſo liberal of your Revilings, whether your <hi>Adverſary</hi> gives Occaſion or not? He anſwereth for us, <hi>It concerns us to render them as Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous as we can, and to make our Friends believe, they do nothing but contradict themſelves, which is enough to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly theſe things ſhew ſuch premeditated and wilful Obſtinacy to be wicked, that were we, what he repreſents us to be in this very Matter, the ſevereſt Plagues and Judgments of the Eternal God we might juſtly expect to be our Portion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. I fear <hi>T. Hicks</hi> meaſures us by himſelf; and that the Anſwer he feigns to the <hi>Second part of his Dialogue, will be his Lot</hi> as truly, as he has there feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſaid it. It would take up too much time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large, only thus much let me ſay, That Man is hard put to it, and Unjuſt with a Witneſs, who not only invents Anſwers to diſ-repute a Man or People, but ſuch as are <hi>very Lyes</hi> too againſt their Faith and Practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Nor is this all, but he hath managed the whole of his <hi>Dialogues in a Spirit of Prophanation,</hi> by a tanting and inapplicable Uſe of many ſerious Words, that have at one time or other been ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably uttered by Sober, Simple and Religious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

to the inſnaring Queſtions of ſuch Trapan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as himſelf. As for inſtance,
<q>Thou manifeſts thy Darkneſs, that thou art ſtill in thy Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; What doſt thou witneſs in thy ſelf?

Theſe, <hi>Reader,</hi> with the like Expreſſions doth this Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scoffer give to the World in the Name of a true <hi>Quaker,</hi> as ſome of his beſt Anſwers; and that to ſuch Queſtions, whoſe Matter hath been effectually conſidered and anſwered in many of our Books: however, his Spirit ſhows, to whomſoever thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers are improper, in one ſenſe they are not ſo to him. But above all, that a Man pretending to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, and ſuch a one too as next to us ſtands faireſt for Reproach, ſhould give our ſerious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in a Jeer, as if we were fitter to be Derided than Informed, is horridly wicked. Can his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be ſo ſeared, as to handle holy Things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear? Is Singularity grown ſo odious to an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt Preacher,</hi> that he ſhould make it a Subject for his Scorn and Drollery? However this may reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>T.

of his own Profeſſion.

                  </p>
                  <p>He affirms, <hi>they are; and undertakes to prove his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions out of their own Works,</hi> which naturally leads me to conſider, what are thoſe Doctrines and Expreſſions he hath charged upon us to be ours; and what are thoſe Proofs, by which he endeavours to make good that Charge.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41857:7"/>
the more weighty Parts of Doctrine, and reſerve the more trivial Matters to the latter end.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> conſiderable thing he endeavours to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt againſt us, is, <hi>Our making the Light in every Man to be God,</hi>

Upon which ſayes <hi>T. Hicks,</hi>
                     <q>From this kind of reaſoning we may conclude, not only the <hi>Light within,</hi> but every Creature both <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi> are God; theſe being Effects of infinite Wiſdom and Power.</q>
Doſt thou not Tremble at this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This very thing ſhews great Diſ-ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> That from <hi>G.

White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> did not intend it of a meer Potential, but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effect, that is, ſomething reſulting from the Nature, and not the meer Power of the Divine Life. Men are the Natural Off-ſpring &amp; Product of Men, but ſo are not all thoſe other things in the Creation, which are notwithſtanding the Effects of their Art and Power, ſo that there needs no Trembling at <hi>G.W</hi>'s Blaſphemy, as he afterwards calls it, but better Information to <hi>T.

his wilful Blindneſs. Of this I refer the Reader to <hi>G.W</hi>'s Part of that larger Volum.</p>
                  <p>Again <hi>G.W.</hi> affirm'd it muſt be God, becauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it ſo to be, was to deny the Omnipreſence of God,

Is there as clear a Proof of the Omnipreſence of God in the one as in the other; I would know who is he that ſearcheth the Hearts, and trieth the Reins, and telleth Man his Thoughts? do not the Scriptures attribute this to God, and that as the moſt convincing Proof of his Omnipreſence? And if he doth ſo ſearch the Hearts and try the Reins, let us underſtand, if it be not as the <hi>Great Light,</hi> that enlightneth every Man that cometh into the World, ſince the Scriptures teſtify that <hi>God is Light</hi>; that <hi>every Man is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened</hi>; that <hi>God ſearcheth all Hearts,</hi> and that <hi>what ever doth make manifeſt is Light:</hi> Now unleſs a Man may have his Heart ſearched, his Reins tryed, his Deeds manifeſted &amp; judg'd without an inward Light, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that <hi>the Light within, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with us every where,</hi> is to us the <hi>great Proof of Gods Omnipreſence, and therefore of God.</hi> And though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41857:8"/>
meaſure of Light diſtinctly is not that Intire Eternal Being, yet we are bold to aſſert, that it is no other then God the Fulneſs of all Light, who ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Heart and tryeth the Reins, and telleth Man his thoughts, that doth ſhine into the Inward parts of Man, and doth there convince of Sin, reprove for it, and lead out of it,<note place="margin">

In ſhort, we are willing to let the Controverſie ly here; that the <hi>Quakers</hi> own, promote and aſſert, that <hi>the Life of God which is the Light of Men, with which every Man is enlightened, is ſufficient
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41857:9"/>
to everlaſting Salvation</hi>; And <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> aſſerts and promotes, that this Life of God, which is the Light of Men with which all Men are enlightened, <hi>is not ſufficient to Salvation.</hi> I am not willing to break my Deſign of following his Charge and Proofs by much controverting the Doctrine in it ſelf, ſince 'tis enough for me to ſhew, that the Doctrines and ſayings he faſtens upon us, and the Proofs he brings to maintain them ſuch, are not ours: yet I am willing to mention one Paſſage among ſeveral others, that if I underſtand any thing, is a grand Contradiction to his Opinion of the Light's Inſufficiency.</p>
                  <p>He quotes <hi>Stephen Criſp</hi> thus, <hi>If the Light ought to be obeyed, then it muſt be ſufficient.</hi> To which <hi>T.H.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns this Anſwer.
<q>But I appeal to the Light in thee, whether this be not an Inſufficient Proof. I grant it ought to be obeyed, ſo ought the lawful Commands of Magiſtrates, Parents and Maſters; yet who will thence infer, that therefore they are a ſufficient Rule to Salvation?</q>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I may well ſuppoſe, that as many have been reproved for not believing <hi>Jeſus to be the Chriſt,</hi> by the Light within, as by the Scriptures; and my Reaſons are; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe thoſe who crucified him, were Admirers of the Scripture, and pretended to prove out of their own Law, that it was both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary, he ſhould be put to Death; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had they <hi>brought that Deed to the Light,</hi> the Light would have ſhown it not to have been wrought in God; which the Scriptures without that Light could not ſo effectually do. 2<hi>ly,</hi> Thoſe who by Scripture came to any Convincement, originally received it from the Revelation of the Light within, which both opened the Scriptures and their Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. 3<hi>ly, Peter, Andrew, Matthew, Nathanael,</hi> the <hi>Centurion, Ruler, Diſeaſed Woman, &amp;c.</hi> confeſs'd him from the Illumination and Operation of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41857:11"/>
Light within, ſince whatever makes Manifeſt or works Conviction, is Light; They were not Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyers and Rebellers againſt it, who moſt readily received and followed Chriſt; They who waited for <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Conſolation, lived in the Juſt Man's Path, a <hi>ſhining Light,</hi> which ſhined brighter and brighter to the leading ſuch as walked in it, to the great <hi>Light of Iſrael,</hi> when he appeared.</p>
                  <p>Further, To ſay that <hi>the Light we have, being much of it borrowed from Scripture, Reproves for thoſe Sins, the Common Light in all Men will not,</hi> is great Wickedneſs; for it is to ſay, that the Light wherewith Chriſt hath enlightned all Men, will not Reprove for all Sin; thereby placing the Defect manifeſtly upon the Light, as before, and not upon the thick and groſs Darkneſs (through Diſobedience of the People) as well as that he attributes to the Scripture that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, which is chiefly due to the Light. For by what Way can Mankind arrive at true Sight, Diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Knowledge in the Underſtanding part, but by the Light, and that as it ſhines into the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; is it not the Light to whom every Deed ſhould be brought, to ſee if it be wrought in God, or no? What can any Man ſolidly and beneficially learn by the Scriptures, but through the Diſcoveries of that Inward Light? Are they not dark Sayings, or rather Man dark to thoſe Sayings, if the holy Light ariſe not to ſhine forth, and give to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Scope and Tendency? All Scripture but Prophecy, which was given forth by Inſpiration, as <hi>Reproof, Exhortation, Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> were firſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced or witneſſed, at whom) <hi>Tho.

me)</hi> &amp; that through walking in the Light of the Lord, the Juſt Man's Path; and were written for the ſake of others, that they might be aſiſted and helpt to the ſame Experience, but not another Way, then through the ſame Steps they had trodden: ſo that the Ground of the holy Ancients Experiences now written, and of the true Knowledge of the Scriptures, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from them, as an outward <hi>Mean</hi>; and <hi>whatever is to be obtained and enjoyed within, is originally and chiefly aſcribable to the Diſcoveries, Convictions and Leadings of the bleſſed Light of Chriſt within, through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Generation,</hi> however variouſly the Principle may have been denominated; as, the <hi>Word of God nigh, Wiſdom, Light, Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> under the Old Teſtament; and <hi>Light, Grace, Truth, Chriſt, Spirit, Anointing, Gift of God, &amp;c.</hi> under the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Two ſhort <hi>Scripture Arguments</hi> ſpring in my Mind for the Divinity and Sufficiency of the Light; and from thence I ſhall conſide this Objections:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. If <hi>God</hi> be <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>ſufficient to Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> be <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Life of the Word,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Sufficient to Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> is God, and the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Word, One</hi> with the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Light of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore I conclude, that <hi>the Light of Men, which is the Life of the Word, which Word is God, is Divine and Sufficient to Eternal Salvation.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The only <hi>Cavil</hi> at theſe Arguments will be this; <hi>I deny this Light to be the Common Light in all Men.</hi> To which I ſay, that there cannot be Two Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Lights of the Life of the Word, and not the ſame, if Two could be; For whatever is of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though not of the ſame Degree, is ſtill the ſame in Kind.

But Thanks be to the God of Light, we know (for WE WITNESS) better things, how ill a Reaſon, and how offenſive ſoever <hi>Witneſſing</hi> is to <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> an <hi>Anabaptiſt-Teacher</hi>; to whoſe Brethren, <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> once were the great Foundation of both their Knowledge and Comfort, though now mockt at by him with great Deriſion in a <hi>Quaker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to his Objections faithfully contracted:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>If this Light ever was and is Sufficient, how comes it, that Men have been and are ſo degenerated in Faith, Diſcipline and Worſhip? They have all this Light by your Principle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2ly, <hi>If this Light had been Sufficient, wherefore ſhould God have ſuperadded ſo many other Wayes and Means; they would be then needleſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3ly, <hi>Chriſt being the Only Saviour, who was born of a Virgin at</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>wrought Miracles, was cut off, bore our Sins, &amp;c. I query, how all this can be affirmed of the Light?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4ly, <hi>Are not all the Generations of</hi> Chriſtians <hi>ſince Chriſt's time till within theſe very few Years certainly Loſt and Damned, foraſmuch as they acknowledge not this Light within, as the True Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the <hi>firſt</hi> I anſwer, There is nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which may be thought to reflect upon the Light, but what falls as heavily upon all other <hi>Wayes, Helps, Ordinances, Appointments,</hi> yea the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and which is more, upon <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit too</hi>; For if the Degeneracy of Man, that is the ſad Effect of his own Rebellion, ſhall be a valid Proof of the Inſufficiency of the <hi>Light
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41857:13"/>
within,</hi> then muſt we conclude from the Degeneracy, that hath been among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and which remains to this Day, <hi>that all thoſe Aſſiſtances, Wayes and Helps which have been given, in reality were not Potent nor Sufficient for the End they were given</hi>; The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of which Opinion of our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> are theſe Two, and ſad enough. 1. <hi>That God in his Wayes muſt have been and is Inſufficient</hi>; and 2. <hi>That Man never was, neither is any wayes faulty.</hi> In ſhort, that may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Salvation, which if neglected, will never work Salvation; as in the <hi>Parable of the Talents</hi> may be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Second</hi> I briefly ſay, That Man's Mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much abroad through unſtable, and vain Wandrings from God's Light, the Lord in Wiſdom and Condeſcenſion to the Weakneſs of Man, and Darkneſs of that Carnal State did accommodate both his Diſcoveries to Man, and that Worſhip he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from Man, according to his Capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the one, and perform the other. If God went into Outward Things to meet with Man's Mind that was abroad, to the End that gradually it might return home, <hi>ſhall we infer Weakneſs in the Light?</hi> Man in that State was incapable; he muſt have been new-molded, and as another Creation to have then received that Teſtimoy in all its Plainneſs, which God hath brought forth in after Ages.</p>
                  <p>If any will undertake to charge Weakneſs upon Man, let him; But I warn all, how they conclude it againſt the Light, ſince the ſame falls on God and his good Spirit, who made Uſe of ſuch Wayes and Means in order to gain upon Man's Mind, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a right Underſtanding and Sence of what was his Will concerning him: Beſides, not only did the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41857:13"/>
Light and Life appear unto Man in, and through thoſe things as Vailes; But that which gave Man true Diſcerning, Repentance, and to do the Thing that ever was acceptable with God in any meaſure, and which was as the Soul, Life and Spirit of all the true and well-pleaſing Sacrifices, <hi>was a meaſure of that Divine Light of Life in their Hearts at that time</hi>; though as <hi>Samuel</hi> in a like Caſe, they knew it not. Let none then charge the Weakneſs of the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration upon the Light, but the Generation, to whom he that is the Light of and in Men, appeared, as Mankind has been able to receive the Knowledge of him: It was not Inſufficiency in God, nor in his Light or Spirit, if Man's Eyes were not ſtrong enough to behold the Brightneſs, of what after Ages have beheld; But it was his Mercy and Goodneſs, that he proportioned both his Diſcoveries and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings according to Man's Ability.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, The Light is ſtill the ſame in it ſelf through all Ages, and not a whit the leſs Sufficient, becauſe through its Inviſibility and Spirituallity, and the Wandrings abroad and great Carnallity of Man's Mind, ſome External Means were uſed, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Man's Weakneſs, through which to reach into Man, and raiſe up ſome further Knowledge of the Spirtuallity of God's Worſhip: Nor becauſe of the Light's Sufficiency as to it ſelf, ought any to infer, that thoſe Wayes or Means were vain or needleſs; For as the Weakneſs of Men ſhould not call the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Light in Queſtion, nor their Carnalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty take off from the Light's Sufficiency, Spiritualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Divinity, ſo neither doth the Sufficiency of the Light render all Means accommodated to Man's Weakneſs vain or needleſs; eſpecially when
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41857:14"/>
the Vertue that is in them, comes from the Light of Life.</p>
                  <p>To his <hi>Third Objection,</hi> which with moſt Oppoſers carrieth the greateſt Weight, I have this in Plainneſs and Brevity to anſwer.</p>
                  <p>We <hi>own</hi> not, neither do we confeſs to another <hi>Chriſt</hi> then him, <hi>who after the Fleſh was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>at the City of</hi> Bethlehem <hi>in</hi> Judea, <hi>who preacht an Everlaſting Goſpel, worked Miracles, bore our Iniquities, and was cut off, or dyed for the People.</hi> But ſince <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> would have us believe, that he is not yet <hi>Socinian</hi> enough to deny the Divinity or Godhead of Chriſt, and therefore that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not only a Man, much leſs that what was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> was crucified, and laid in the Sepulchre of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathia,</hi> was the Whole Chriſt; I muſt diſtinguiſh.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Word</hi> that was with God in the beginning, and was God, who in time took Fleſh, was and is the Light of the World; in the fulneſs of time he manifeſted himſelf in a more Familiar and Intimate Manner to Mankind, in order to which he prepared an Holy Body, in which he preached his Everlaſting Goſpel, worked many Miracles, drew many after him: <hi>He ſuſtained grieveous Weights, the Burden of the Iniquity of the whole World lay upon him, he travelled under it, and trod the Wine-Preſs alone, and was preſſed as a Cart with Sheaves</hi>; And ſo well did he love the World, that, to teſtifie the ſame, he gave up his Life not only to recommend his Love, but to confirm his unchangeable Goſpel of Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins, and Eternal Salvation to as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and followed him the Light of the World; that ſo <hi>Remiſſion</hi> might not only be preacht in his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41857:14"/>
                     <hi>Name,</hi> but <hi>Blood</hi> alſo (for it was a time of Blotting-out; for God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf) In which Manifeſtation he not only drew many to him, &amp; gave Teſtimony of his Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſome particulars; but he combated the Serpent, bruiſed his Head, and gave him an abſolute Defeat in the General, ſcattering his Oracles, chaſing his Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirits, cauſing his own Light more univerſally to clear up, and break forth into the World, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that Thouſands followed him: He qualified and deputed Ambaſſadors; Commiſſioned and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred them from on high; whoſe Meſſage was Powerful, and whoſe Miniſtry was Effectual; yet when all this is ſaid, and believed moſt ſurely, as well as expreſt moſt plainly, That which gave the <hi>Life, Power, Virtue, Strength</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> to all this, and to whom therefore eminently the <hi>Work, Salvation, Power and Glory are moſt deſervedly aſcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is the Word that was in the beginning with God, and was God, whoſe Life was, and is the Light of Men, who took Fleſh, and was manifeſted therein.</hi> Therefore <hi>He</hi> who is our Light, ought not to be denyed, being the true Chriſt, and true Saviour; For no other Light and Life then appeared in that Body, that was then an Offering for Sin once for all, is the Life and Light that we aſſert and defend. And for that Holy <hi>Body,</hi> it was our Lord's, as the Scripture ſpeaks, Joſeph <hi>of</hi> Arimathia <hi>begged the Body of Jeſus,</hi> Mat. 27.58. Mark 15.43. Luke 23.52. <hi>They found not the Body of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Luke 24.3. He prepared it, he took it, he was manifeſted in it and by it; how can we deny that Body which was our Lord's? By no means. To conclude, though our Divine Word of Life and Light dyed not (for Chriſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41857:15"/>
as God over all bleſſed forever, could not dye) yet his Body did, <hi>and fo his Fulneſs therein and there by manifeſted, have we received, and Grace for Grace.</hi> So that all thoſe who are talking of the Body of Chriſt, and ſeeking to repreſent us to the World as Deniers and Deſpiſers of his Appearance, they are but in the Steps of the Perſecuting <hi>Jews,</hi> who as they eryed up the Prophets, but being Strangers to their Divine Life, reliſht not, ſavour'd not, and therefore yielded not to Chriſt (the Rock who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Fathers in the Wilderneſs, the Fountain of all the Life and Refreſhment of the Holy Ancients) but with their Proud, and Conceited, and indeed Miſtaken knowledge, not from, but of the Letter, and in a bitter Zeal for their dying Forms and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, did they war againſt the Breaking forth of that Day of Salvation, and that as <hi>Hereſie, Blaſphemy,</hi> and the like; ſo now, theſe Men ſeem buſie and great Sticklers for the <hi>Body of Chriſt</hi> (which they know not) and for <hi>Bread, Wine, Water,</hi> &amp;c. and all in Oppoſition to a more plain and Inward Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Light, Life and Subſtance ſhed abroad, as the Accompliſhment of the Promiſe of the Father in this our Day and Generation. But as it fared with thoſe of old, ſo ſhall it with theſe Oppoſers, their Viſitation ſhall paſs ſwiftly over their Head, and their Temple ſhall be caſt down, and not one Stone of their fair Edifice ſhall be left ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon another.</p>
                  <p>To his <hi>Laſt Objection</hi> I muſt tell him, that we have not that Uncharitableneſs in our Principles, which our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> are guilty of. He, like the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, is ready to think every Man damn'd, nay, by his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41857:15"/>
Principle, it is not avoidable, who hath not heard of the Name <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or is not enter'd into ſome kind of Church-Fellowſhip upon common <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, as they are called and diſtinguiſht from meer Morality or Good Life: But for my part, as God had a People among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of old, <hi>who became a Law unto themſelves, doing the Things contained in the Law,</hi> whom I believe to be at Reſt and Peace (notwithſtanding the ſevere and poſitive Cenſures I have heard from ſeveral Profeſſors againſt them, and Millions more) ſo, though much Darkneſs hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in moſt parts of the World, and ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, yet then, and where the Day of Ignorance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and where there hath been and is a Walking with Sincerity towards God, according to their Knowledge I do believe the Lord did and doth wink, and had and hath Mercy, though great Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to that <hi>Chriſtian-Profeſſion</hi> ſo much <hi>boaſted</hi> of among too many in our Nation: And I doubt not, but that there may be found ſome Thouſands both of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who would not only have deteſted in point of Credit, but in Fear to God, dreaded do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Tittle of what <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> hath falſly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently ſaid and done againſt our <hi>Perſons, Practices and Principles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, though God in every Age hath had a Regard to the Sincerity of Peoples Hearts, and their Upright Living, though ſubjected under groſs Forms, and in the Darkeſt ſeaſons of the World; yet, <hi>God having now cauſed his Day ſpring from on high to viſit, whereby more certain knowledge &amp; ſound Judgment is given of the Darkneſs that hath covered the Earth, the Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Idolatries, humane Inventions, Will-Worſhips, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Cruelty, Wantonneſs, Intemperance, Avarice, and

all manner of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs</hi>; all are required to harken to the Lord's Voice, <hi>to obey his Call, to let him in, and bring their Deeds unto the Light, that Chriſt, who is that true Light, may diſcover the Enemy, may bind him, ſpoil his Goods, and caſt him out; that he may reign over Thoughts, Words and Deeds</hi>; ſo ſhall ſuch be able to ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>O, all that is within me, praiſe his holy Name!</hi> For Chriſt will be known, as he is the Saviour of the Soul from Death, the Reſtorer of Paths, to dwell in, who deſtroyes the Works of the Devil, and brings in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs to the Soul. And though few obſerve it, That which is truly commend able in any People, proceeds from the ſecret Power and Efficacy of that Inward Principle we ſo much teſtifie of: <hi>'Tis that convinces, diſcovers, reproves, reſtraines, tenders, humbles, and affects the Soul,</hi> and not their ſeveral <hi>Outward Forms,</hi> which, with Robbery to the Light or Grace within, they are apt to attribute it to, and whereby the <hi>Devil</hi> beguiles them into a Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them.

unleſs ſome Man, who hath lived unblameably up to the Light can give us a Demonſtration of its Inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to ſhew, and teach him that further thing, that God requires him to believe and do, there can be no valid <hi>Argument</hi> againſt the Light's Sufficiency. If <hi>T.H.</hi> dare be the Man, we ſhall joyn Iſſue with him in the Tryall of the Matter: But if the Light be before hand with Man-kind, furniſhing him ſtill with Work enough to do, as it certainly ever hath done, and ſtill doth, let it be known to <hi>T.H. that ſuch as would know more of Chriſt's Doctrines, muſt firſt do his Will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they do know</hi>: And as it is the common <hi>Method</hi> of the Dealing of God towards the Sons of Men; So is it great Impiety in any Man to infer or conclude <hi>Inſufficiency to be in the Light to diſcover and teach Man what he ought to know and do, from Man's Ignorance of all, that he ought to know and do</hi>; ſince the Ground of that Ignorance is, his not doing, what the Light of God requires from him, as his preſent Duty to perform.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>the Scriptures are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelligible without it,</hi> is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prov'd from the Variety of Judgments that are in the World about moſt of the Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines contained therein; as about <hi>God's Eſſence and Similitude, Chriſt and the Spirit,</hi> their <hi>Divinity, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, Original Sin, Free-Will, Redemption, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, Juſtification, Faith and Works. In ſhort,</hi> the <hi>whole End of Chriſts Coming, Living and Dying</hi> they are ſtrongly controverted: Now were the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo clear capable to determine in theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Differences would quickly end; But ſince the utmoſt Ability they of themſelves can give, is not enough to render thoſe Things obvious, that are now doubtfull, and diſputable; There is a Neceſſity
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41857:17"/>
of Man's Recourſe to ſome other thing, which is able to diſcover the Mind and Intendment of the holy Pen-Men. Now I would be glad to know of any ſober Man, if any thing beſides the Light ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the Underſtanding is able to give true Sight, Diſcerning and Judgment about the Points controverted? would it not be reputed Madneſs to bid Men read, <hi>that have no Eyes, or if they have Eyes, at leaſt no Light to read with them</hi>? The whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it relates to Man's Duty, is a Declaration of the woful State of Darkneſs, and the bleſſed State of Light and Life, with the Way of Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the one into the other. And was this Knowledge <hi>without</hi> Experience, or <hi>by and through</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience? I hope no Man will ſay, the holy Pen-Men were not Witneſſes of the things they wrote: and if they were, I would fain know, by what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way they came to underſtand and comprehend the Darkneſs that was within, <hi>then by the Light within</hi>; And to know the Temptations and Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Spirit of Darkneſs, the Diſcoveries, Reproofs and Leadings of the Light, the Tryals, Travels, Exerciſes, and finally the perfect Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo frequently expreſſed in theſe holy Writings, <hi>but through the Manifeſtation of the Light of Chriſt in the Conſcience, their Obedience to it, and 'its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Redemption and Sanctification.</hi> So that the State of <hi>Judgment, Repentance, Remiſſion, Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> called the New Birth, and perfect <hi>Juſtification,</hi> were their Experiences (or Witneſſings, for all <hi>T. Hicks</hi>) from the Inward Work of God's Light upon their Hearts and their Souls, which though the Scriptures declare of them, they can never bring Man into, nor can any Man groundedly aver the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41857:18"/>
Truth of thoſe things, till he comes through Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Light in his own Conſcience to experience the ſame <hi>Judgment, Repentance, Remiſſion, Regeneration,</hi> called the new Birth, and perfect <hi>Juſtification</hi> before God; Since then the Scriptures can do none of theſe things of themſelves, however Inſtrumental they may be of Good, but the holy Light in the Conſcience, and that theſe things are not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though they may be read, talked and writ of, without being lead by the ſame Spirit, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſame Steps of deep Experience the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients trod in, and have left us for an Example, it muſt be granted, whether <hi>T. Hicks</hi> will or no, <hi>That the Author of thoſe Diſcoveries, Convictions, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. muſt be the Standing Immutable Rule to the Soul, what, how far, and which way we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or own, reject or embrace, relinquiſh or follow, with Reſpect to thoſe things that pleaſe God, or that pleaſe him not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Objections I ſhall contract into theſe Four, urged by him for the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Light</hi>'s being the <hi>Rule of Faith and Practice</hi>; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are the greateſt Strength of his Book, if any it has.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The Light within cannot give a clear and diſtinct Account how Sin came to be; if we conſult the Wiſeſt</hi> Philoſophers,<note place="margin">Dial. p. 21, 22, 33.</note> 
                     <hi>we ſhall find a deep Silence touching this Point: They ſaw Sin did overflow, but could not by all the Improvements of the Light in them, find out how Sin came to be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am perſwaded <hi>T. Hicks</hi> never conſulted ſo much
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41857:18"/>
as the meaneſt of them, at leaſt effectually; had he, his <hi>Dialogue</hi> would have ſavoured of more true Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Morality; for I will make it appear that he has contradicted himſelf, abuſed the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and blaſphemed the Light in this one Paſſage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where there is no Law there is no Tranſgreſſion</hi>; then where there is Tranſgreſſion, there is a Law. Now <hi>T. Hicks</hi> granting that the <hi>Heathen</hi> knew there was Sin, they muſt know it by Virtue of ſome Law that made it ſo. This Law was not written, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves declared, God had imprinted it upon their Hearts,<note place="margin">Pythag. Socrat. Cleanth. &amp;c.</note> as an Immutable and Infallible Guide to them in their Actions. If ſo, how could they be Ignorant of Sin's coming into the World? Who knew it to be a Deviation from God's living Commandment in their own Conſcience, and a Committing quite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Things? If <hi>T. Hicks</hi> means by clear and diſtinct Account the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi>; that is, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were beguiled by the <hi>Serpent,</hi> who tempted them with an <hi>Apple,</hi> &amp;c. 'tis no wayes to his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; For that which is Sufficient to that Faith which concerns Salvation is, to know that God is, that he is Pure and Holy, that he has given Man the Knowledge of himſelf, and his Will concerning Him by ſome <hi>Inward Law, Command, Light, Grace,</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi>; and that who acts not correſpondently to this <hi>Guide</hi> is a Tranſgreſſor, and incurs the Penalty; and that the <hi>Heathen</hi> had this, their Books at large tell us: Nor does <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> deny it, ſo that he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradicts <hi>Himſelf,</hi> and abuſeth the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> in ſaying, They could not find out, how Sin came, ſince they expreſly ſay, <hi>That God made all Good, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41857:19"/>
that Man's Erring from the Divine Law in him brought Evil into the World.</hi> And I boldly affirm, and in the next Head will prove, that the meer Hiſtory is not abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Now that herein he has Blaſphemed againſt the <hi>Light,</hi> is evident; ſince it is to ſay, <hi>That God gave Men a Law and Light not ſufficient to let them ſee, how Sin entered the World</hi>; which is to ſay in plainer En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, <hi>what is Sin</hi>; it will and muſt end there. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſuppoſe the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> had been Ignorant, muſt it needs follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Fault and Want was in the Light, and not in them? Will <hi>T. Hicks</hi> become their Warrant in the Matter, that they arrived as high, as the Light could teach them, <hi>and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency lay on the ſide of their Teacher, and not on theirs?</hi> Confident, yea Impudent Man! Why ſhould either the Darkneſs of any Age be charged upon the Light, or render it Inſufficient; or the more clear Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of Light in a following Generation be reputed another Light, becauſe another Degree then what obſcurely ſhined forth in the former; ſince it was not the obſcurer in it ſelf, but through the groſs Blackneſs that might have over-caſt that People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Diſobedience, it ſeemed ſo to them? But let us hear him further.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor can this Light give any Account of that Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which God in his infinite Wiſdom provided,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pag. 33. Dial.</note> 
                     <hi>that he ſhould be born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, dye for others, and riſe the third day:</hi> This is the Pinch.</p>
                  <p>But I anſwer: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Prophets ſaw it by this Light, unleſs that they ſaw it without Light,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41857:19"/>
or that the Light they ſaw it by, was not the Light of Chriſt, as the Word that was with God, and was God; which, I hope, <hi>T. Hicks</hi> upon ſerious Thinking will not ſay; for of no other do we ſpeak. 2<hi>ly,</hi> Thoſe that believed him, when he came, could never have received him, had they not ſeen him by an Inward Eye, enlightned by that Light in meaſure in themſelves, which then ſo unmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly appeared in him; For the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and according to their Underſtanding of them, they reputed him a Blaſphemer; and both plotted, promoted, and obtained his Crucifixion. The <hi>Queſtion</hi> will be, <hi>Why did they not better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them</hi>? The <hi>Anſwer</hi> is, becauſe they Rebelled againſt that Spirit which could only ſo inform them: <hi>Had they brought their Deeds to the Light, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſound Judgment,</hi> and a true Meaſure would have been given them, which they rejecting, that was both the Ground of their Ignorance, and the Juſt Reaſon of their Condemnation. Hence we ſee, that Light, and not the Scriptures was the higher Rule and Judge of Thoughts, Words and Deeds, yea, and which way the Scriptures themſelves were to be underſtood; And truly it is ſtrange, that the Light in Men ſhould not lead naturally to its own Being and Fountain.

But if we are to penetrate deeper, and that <hi>T Hicks</hi> ſhould hold as he ſeems plainly to do, that what Faith we can have of the moſt weighty Truths declared of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is from it, and not from the Light or Spirit
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41857:20"/>
within, <hi>I muſt firmly deny it</hi>; For <hi>Faith is God's Gift,</hi> not the Scriptures Gift: No, ſo far is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from giving Faith, <hi>that it is God's Spirit alone, that gives both to underſtand and believe them.</hi> The Scripture tells me of ſuch <hi>Prophecies, Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and of ſuch Men as <hi>Moſes, Job, David, Iſaiah, Matthew, Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi>; But what is it that gives me to believe the Things they writ of to be true? Is it not the Teſtimony and moſt certain Amen in the Conſcience? and what is that there, which ſeals to thoſe excellent Truths? Which way then can the Scripture be a Rule to me in believing the Scripture, when that Faith is begotten of God by his Light and Spirit concerning the Scripture? If the meer Scripture could give me Faith, then it might be allowed to rule my Faith; but when God by his Spirit alone begets Faith, and without which I can neither underſtand nor believe the Scriptures, tell me, <hi>If God's Spirit be not the Rule of my Faith; what, how far, and which way I am to believe them,</hi> or the things believed? Certainly they can never be my Rule, <hi>How far, and which way I am to believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> who of themſelves cannot give me that Faith; but it muſt be wrought by another thing; <hi>ſo that what gives to believe, rules the Belief, and not the Thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi>: Therefore the Scriptures cannot be the Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now as to this <hi>of Chriſt's Outward Manifeſtation,</hi> I ſay, ſo far as it is Hiſtorical, the Scripture is that which furniſheth me with a Belief; But I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny, that they give to believe it in that deep Senſe, <hi>which may be truly called a Saving Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Phariſees</hi> had the Scriptures, and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to admire <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi>; yet they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41857:21"/>
                     <hi>crucified Chriſt,</hi> and ſought to countenance their Murder by Scripture. Now had they believed and eſteemed the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets from an Inward Sence of Gods Spirit <hi>(which the meer Scriptures could not furniſh them with)</hi> they had rightly underſtood them, and not made ſo ill an Uſe of their Hiſtorical Knowledge, as to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the Lord of Life and Glory. This ſhews that Men may have an Hiſtorical Faith, and yet not the <hi>True Faith nor Knowledge of the Scriptures,</hi> what then gives to believe aright now? why truely that which did then: <hi>the Light and Spirit of Truth</hi>; no Man could call <hi>Jeſus</hi> Lord <hi>without it,</hi> that is truly ſo, or upon good ground. No Man could confeſs that Chriſt was come in the Fleſh, <hi>but whoſe Spirit was of God,</hi> yet now nothing is more common, &amp; yet nothing is more True then that Thouſands of them are not of God, but lie in Wickedneſs alienated from the Life of God, &amp;c. <hi>what is the matter then?</hi> why this, Thoſe who then confeſt that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was come in the Fleſh, did it by Virtue of an Inviſible Sight, and through a Divine Illumination in their Souls: For im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible had it otherwiſe been for them in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to have ſeen through the Vail of his Fleſh, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Divine Life, Power and Wiſdom that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably filled it,</hi> but having ſome inward Sence and Taſte of that moſt excellent <hi>Being,</hi> that was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in and by that <hi>bodily Appearance,</hi> therefore did they confeſs to it, and their Spirits truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by <hi>John</hi> to be of God.</p>
                  <p>And as in that day it was Impoſſible for any truly and acceptably to confeſs to Chriſt, without a Diſcerning given, and Faith wrought by the Light and Spirit of God in the Heart, <hi>which was the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41857:21"/>
Faith</hi>; ſo is it now equally Impoſſible for any to believe that Chriſt appeared, and that he ſpake and did all theſe great things, ſo as to be benefitted thereby, and any wayes accepted of God therein, but as the Light and Spirit of Truth open thoſe Things to the Underſtanding, and from a meaſure of that Divine Life which then immeaſurably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared (for we have all received of his Fulneſs and Grace for Grace) true Faith comes to be begotten in that Manifeſtation, and a right Confeſſion unto it. In ſhort, He that calleth <hi>Chriſt Lord,</hi> muſt now, as then, do it by the Holy Ghoſt, that is <hi>from an Experience or Witneſſing of his Dominion, and Rule,</hi> which, through the Operation of the holy Spirit, the Soul is to be ſubjected to, ſo that who believes more then Hiſtorically that Chriſt came in the Fleſh, muſt do it by Virtue of the Divine Light and Spirit, who alone gives to reliſh and ſavour the Truth, Nature and End of that Appearance.</p>
                  <p>And though it may be allowed, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a Rule, reſpecting the Hiſtory, as it was to thoſe of old, in reference to the particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies fulfilled in Chriſt's coming; yet as there was then a more Inward and Heavenly Sence of Chriſt, which drew many after him, and begot deep Faith in him, ſo muſt there now be a more Inward Spiritual and deep grounded Faith of thoſe things recorded in Scripture, <hi>of Chriſts Appearance, &amp;c. then the meer Letter is able to give.</hi> And therefore that Light and Spirit which gives that diſcerning, and works that deep Sence and Faith muſt needs be as well the Rule as Author of it, and not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; For if the Scriptures be the Rule, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Themſelves or by Interpretation. <hi>If

of Themſelves,</hi> then either in their Tranſlations, or Originals. Not <hi>in the Tranſlations,</hi> unleſs the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators</hi> had been ſo inſpired, that they miſt not a tittle, which I am ſure is not ſo; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none but Schollars have a Rule, for the Unlearned are ſecluded; &amp; therefore the <hi>Engliſh Bible is not a Rule.</hi>

For my part I ſpeak my Conſcience in Sincerity; I had rather periſh off the Earth, then live ſo great a Burden of foul Diſhoneſty, as I doubt not but a little time will manifeſt him to be.</p>
                  <p>That the Baſeneſs of his Intentions in this kind of Arguing may yet further appear, let this groſs Inference directly charged by him upon our Principle, of the Light's being our Rule, be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſidered.</p>
                  <p>From our Aſſerting the Light Within to be our Rule, he tells the World, <hi>That we mean the holy Qualification, that is in us</hi>:<note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> Which were it true, he would hit the Mark, when he ſayes, <hi>that Holineſs, being a Conformity to the Rule, it cannot be the Rule</hi> But never yet certainly did any but <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> ſo miſ-repreſent the poor <hi>Quaker</hi>: Nay, he Confounds and Contradicts himſelf. How can we be ſaid to make our Holineſs the Rule, when we affirm it only to be a walking up to the Light within, which is Holy? He ſayes that we aſſert the Light to be the Rule, how then is our Obedience to it the Rule; for that is true Holineſs? <hi>Is there no difference between a Rule, and Obedience to it?

                  <p>Now what is more evident, then <hi>firſt,</hi> That it is not our Anſwer? 2. That it concerns not the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, ſo much as the Univerſallity of it? 3. By not having the Spirit, or Light, is not meant, that we believe that God has not given a Meaſure of his Good Spirit unto all to profit with, or that there be ſome, whom he never enlightened, but that they ſo have not the Spirit, as to walk by it, be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitted by it, or come to enjoy it as their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher and Comforter; and that ſome may be ſaid, not to be Enlightened, who are not through Faith in, and Obedience to the Light, come to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged and made Children of Light by it.

Again, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>ſay, that Chriſt is in them; But ſince there is but One Chriſt, who was born of a Virgin, and that he ſuffered at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there crucified, can that Chriſt be in Man?</hi> The falſe Doctrine or Abſurdity he would run us upon, is one of theſe two, <hi>Either that we deny Chriſt's Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or that He is actually in our Bodies with that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy he appeared in at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which is Impoſſible,</hi> witneſs this one Paſſage, <hi>If God be Chriſt, as</hi> Penn <hi>ſaith; or, If the Light within you be the Chriſt, as</hi> Naylor <hi>and</hi> Hubberthorn <hi>affirm, is it proper or ſafe to ſay, God was Slain, or the Light in you was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, That as in other things, ſo in this, our <hi>Adverſary</hi> has ſhewn his great Ignorance or Malice. For is it reaſonable to infer from our Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41857:31"/>
in Scripture Language, Chriſt is in the Saints, <hi>that we deny him as to his Viſible and Bodily Appearance in the World</hi>; and that becauſe he is God, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was never Man; or that the Word took not Fleſh</hi>; Is this to underſtand us right, or give the World a true meaſure of our Belief, who is it confeſſeth Chriſt to be every where, and if ſo, then in his People, ſee Cont. p. 34. Ah, God the Righteous Judge ſhall plead with thee in a Day that thou ſhalt not be able to eſcape his Terrible Recompence, if thou repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt not. Let it ſuffice to the ſober <hi>Reader</hi> (for of him I have little Hopes) that we do believe that <hi>Chriſt, who is God over all, bleſſed for ever, did come of Abraham's Seed according to the Fleſh,</hi> that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prepared of that Line was his Body, that what Sufferings befel it, were the Sufferings of Chriſt, juſt as the Body is called <hi>the Body of Chriſt:</hi> Yet this we do ſay, and that not in any Undervalue to the Body, or Bodily Sufferings of Chriſt, <hi>that the Divine Word, in whom was Life, and whoſe Life was the Light of Men</hi> (who took that Fleſh) <hi>is eminently to be lookt upon, and that to believe and obey the Light of his Life, wherewith he has enlightened us, is both the beſt way to know the Sufferings of his Body, and to receive the Benefit of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, unleſs Chriſt be not God, and unleſs the Light be not Chriſt, <hi>I know no hurt I have done, to aſſert him to be God,</hi> nor any Reaſon our <hi>Adverſary</hi> hath to infer, <hi>therefore I, or any of us, deny him to have taken Fleſh, or that he ſuffered without the Gates of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; <hi>or that he is not as well Chriſt without us as within us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again I do affirm that by the ſame Reaſon the bodily Sufferings of the <hi>Word,</hi> whoſe <hi>Life</hi> was the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41857:31"/>
                     <hi>Light</hi> of Men, are frequently attributed to the <hi>Word</hi> it ſelf, as if the <hi>Word</hi> had immediately ſuſtained them, and not the <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> which ſhineth in the Conſciences of Mankind, which is the very <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Word</hi> it ſelf, is not unconcern'd in the bodily Sufferings, but both gives to believe them aright, and to receive Benefit by them, and that as the Sufferings of his own Body, by and through which his Glory, Grace and Truth, did ſhine forth, in the World: which are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed afreſh in the Hearts of all who believe in him. Let our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> deal ſo fairly with us, as to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Body of Chriſt, <hi>as before</hi> Abraham <hi>the Rock in the Wilderneſs,</hi> and the Appearance of Chriſt in the Fleſh, and not infer from our denying that the whole Chriſt could die; <hi>that Chriſt,</hi> that is, <hi>the Body of Chriſt ſuffered or died not</hi>; And when we ſay, he who took Fleſh has appeared to, and in our Hearts, <hi>that we exclude and deny his then Viſible and Bodily Appearance, or that he is not now as well without us, as within us</hi>; and we ſhall never doubt of a good Iſſue. But truly after the rate we have been uſed by him, the moſt Scriptural Aſſertions can never eſcape a being accounted Falſe and Unwarrantable. For becauſe we are with godly Fear Jealous, leaſt the whole Chriſt ſhould be thought to have been then cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, when his Body was, which ſtrikes at the Life of the Immortal and Divine Being, we are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by this Perverter of our right Meaning, <hi>as Denyers of that Body, whileſt he himſelf acknowledgeth that the meer Manhood was not the Chriſt, but the Word made Fleſh, Emmanuel.</hi> Pag. 44.

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41857:32"/>2. Becauſe we aſſert that true Light, with which every Man is enlightened, to be in it ſelf the Chriſt of God, and Saviour of the World; <hi>he infers that we deny the Outward Sufferings of Chriſt in his Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Appearance,</hi> and in ſhort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>that we deny the True Chriſt, becauſe he dyed and roſe again, &amp;c.</hi> which the Light ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, never conſidering that if he makes what dyed &amp; roſe again the entire Chriſt &amp; Saviour, he excludes the Divinity or Godhead, <hi>which he confeſſeth to be Chriſt in conjunction with the Manhood,</hi> and which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures call <hi>ſtrictly the Saviour, beſides whom there is none</hi>; and which <hi>J. Faldo</hi> himſelf pag. 85. part 2. acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to be ſuch. But if <hi>T. Hicks</hi> does allow, as indeed he doth, <hi>that Chriſt is God,</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> there is nothing befalls us from his Inference, but what ſtrikes himſelf equally; for if the <hi>Light,</hi> with which Men are enlightened, be not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it cannot dye, <hi>then Chriſt cannot be Chriſt as God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God cannot dye.</hi> Well! But <hi>T. Hicks</hi> tells us, that Chriſt as God is alſo Chriſt, and that it was Chriſt's Body only that dyed; Therefore I conclude, <hi>that to own Chriſt to be that true Light, which enlighteneth all men, or that true Light to be Chriſt, is no Derogation from Chriſt or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndervalue to his Bodily Sufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And becauſe that one of us ſpoak of a Two-fold Appearance of Chriſt in the Soul, firſt <hi>as a Seed of Light in Man,</hi> and next, as <hi>perfect Day,</hi> or <hi>in a full grown State of Glory,</hi> Therefore ſayes he, <hi>a Perſonal Coming in any reſpect is denyed by you,</hi> Contin. pag. 45. which Concluſion is ſo horribly Unjuſt, that no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Man needs an Anſwer to it.

                  <p>I ſhall proceed to the next Particular, and that is, <hi>If Chriſt ſignifie Anointed, and Chriſt be God, as</hi> Penn <hi>ſaith, I would query</hi> (ſaith our Adverſary) <hi>whether God himſelf was anointed</hi>? Contin. pag. 47.</p>
                  <p>But though this might have ſeemd ſomething from a <hi>Socinian</hi> hand, yet from <hi>T.

                  <p>To which I anſwer, that <hi>T.

For <hi>firſt</hi> I did in that Book acknowledge and confeſs to <hi>Chriſt's Bodily Appearance, and that he was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>after the Fleſh,</hi> and that largely and plainly p. 36. which he wholy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitts to mention. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I do not remember that I ſo expreſt my ſelf, that God was Chriſt, but whether I did or no, to inſinuate a Denyal of his Manifeſtation in Fleſh is moſt perverſly wicked and ungodly, as well as that it plainly ſhews, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

his feigned Confeſſion to Chriſt's Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that in truth he owns him not to be God, or he has very ill expreſt himſelf when he ſayes thou affirmeſt <hi>God is Chriſt</hi> (or Chriſt is God) for it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>he does not</hi>; elſe what means his following words, <hi>did God himſelf dye and ſuffer to God?</hi> he thus queries to ſhew the Abſurdity of believing <hi>God to be Chriſt (or Chriſt to be God)</hi> and tells us that he believes what dyed was the Intire Chriſt. Certainly, he is either <hi>rank Socinian</hi> in the Point (which I mention not in Diſgrace, unleſs it be to that Party that ſo impious a Perſon is of it) or he has not well given us his Mind. But this proves what elſewhere I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of him, that from our Aſſerting <hi>Chriſt to be God, or God Chriſt, Tho.

                  </p>
                  <p>He wickedly and with an Aggravation, like the Enmity of his Spirit, thus makes <hi>G. Keith</hi> to anſwer,
<q>That which is loſt is ſtill in Man, <hi>That,</hi> Chriſt came to ſeek and ſave, and all his Miniſters preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People to this, <hi>the loſt in Man, a loſt God, a loſt Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

                  <p>To which, before I make my Anſwer, I think fit to inſert that which he gives in the Name of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Here thou ſheweſt thy dark Mind, and that thou art ſtill in thy Imagination, underſtanding neither the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption nor the Seed</hi>; which however feign'd by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt himſelf, is ſo great a Truth, that there is ſcarcely one Paſſage in his Dialogue more allowable.</p>
                  <p>But to his Argument and Queſtion. We do aſſert the Redemption of the Seed for the Light and Life which has been as ſown in the Heart of Mankind,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41857:35"/>
has been <hi>loaded with</hi> Sin, <hi>preſſed down with Iniquity, grieved and almoſt quenched through Diſobedience,</hi> which words are not <hi>properly,</hi> but <hi>metaphorically</hi> to be taken, as uſed by the holy <hi>Pen-Men,</hi> whereby to make things the more plain and eaſie to common capacities. It is ſaid in Scripture, <hi>Out of</hi> Egypt <hi>have I called my Son,</hi> a Place of <hi>Bondage and grievous Weights, Burdens and Oppreſſions,</hi> from all which the Seed was to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and Chriſt came, or God was manifeſted in the Fleſh, <hi>that the Seed of Light, Truth and Righteouſneſs might break through and ariſe over all Corruption, by which it had been grieved and preſſed down.</hi> And it is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to ſay, <hi>That God did rid himfelf of the Enemies that oppreſt his own Righteous Life, or that he brought Salvation to himſelf</hi>; for the Scriptures fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpeak on that wiſe, eſpecially in thoſe two notable Paſſages of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>

                     <hi>And he ſaw that there was no Man, and wondered that there was no Interceſſor, therefore his Arm brought Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to him, and this Righteouſneſs it ſuſtained him.</hi> Again, <hi>The Year of my Redeemed is come</hi>;<note place="margin">

                     <hi>and I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondred that there was none to uphold; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mine own Arm brought Salvation unto Me, and My Fury it upheld me.</hi> Whence it is no wayes abſurd that we affirm, that the End of God's Manifeſting himſelf in the Fleſh was for the Redemption or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his Holy Life that was in Man but as a ſmall Seed, even the ſmalleſt of Seeds, that had been long vexed, grieved, bruiſed and preſſed down by Sin and Iniquity; For the End of that Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was, that Sin might be deſtroyed, <hi>and that Christ, who had been as a Lamb ſlain from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of the World,</hi> might be exalted in the Hearts of Men and Women, <hi>and his, and their Foes, made his and their Footſtool</hi>: For the Work is Inward, we do aver in the Name of the Lord; <hi>for where the Devil hath Reigned and had Dominion</hi> to wit, in Man, <hi>there be muſt be defeated, and ſubdued</hi>; and Chriſt alone, by whom that is brought to paſs, ought and muſt have the Power and the Kingdom forever. And if this be the <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Gibberiſh</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> muſt be charged with from this <hi>Anabaptiſt Preacher,</hi> we are content to uſe it, as well as patient to bear his inſolent Scoff; only let all take notice, that we underſtand not by the Seed's Redemption, its being redeemed from <hi>the Pollution,</hi> but <hi>the Weight</hi> of Sin and Iniquity; for it was and is pure forever.</p>
                  <p>Now as to our Calling <hi>Chriſt-without a Creature,</hi> I muſt tell him, 'tis not our Language; but if he means by it the Body born of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>T.

                     <hi>God breathed into Man the Breath of Life, and he became a Living Soul, and is not this of God, of his Being? &amp;c. and is not this that comes out from God, part of God, &amp; from God?</hi> Where nothing can well be clearer than that <hi>G.F</hi> intends that <hi>Divine Life, Power</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> by which <hi>Adam</hi> in Soul &amp; Body came to live to God.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41857:45"/>
But I muſt tell <hi>T.H.</hi> that as among Men the Will is taken for the Deed, ſo the Lord finding <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> right in his Heart, that he believed, and would obey; he was as much juſtified therein, as if he had actually done it. We have cauſe to believe <hi>T. Hicks</hi> never knew what the Conſequence of that working Faith, and offering up an <hi>Iſaac</hi> to God is. Nor was it needful to recite the whole of his Life: Meaſures are frequently taken by ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Tryal. If he was accepted in that, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being the Condition, where that was before, he was before accepted no doubt. But ſayes he, ſee the <hi>Caveat,</hi> p. 12. and <hi>Apol.</hi> p. 198. How do they agree? Truly very well: For <hi>Grace is Free, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing.</hi> How?

But may <hi>T. Hicks</hi> ſay; <hi>Is Repenting nothing? Believing nothing? Obeying nothing</hi>? No, <hi>T.H. not one jot of Merit in all that</hi>; It is the <hi>great Grace</hi> of God, to give us Eternal Life upon ſo ſmall Conditions. They obtain it; <hi>but that is God's good Pleaſure, and no Purchaſe,</hi> therefore <hi>Grace ſtill</hi>; All that is our Duty; <hi>the Reward is Free</hi>; God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it, but chuſes a Way by which to do it.

To which he replies. Chriſt. <hi>'Tis true, 'tis Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit is the Author and Worker of Sanctification; but will it therefore follow, that the Work of Sanctification in us is Chriſt, or that this Work is perfect in all its Degrees</hi>?</p>

                  <p>This indeed is the Drift of the Man, he would be Sanctified whilſt Unſanctified; as Dangerous, as it is Abſurd: For what thing can be and not be the ſame thing, at one and the ſame time? But I deny they were

But that a perfect Sanctification is no <hi>Hereſie,</hi> ſuppoſe they had been Sanctify'd Perſons to whom the Apoſtle wrote (which could not be, Sanctifying was the moſt) yet ſince he exhorted them, <hi>to put off the Old Man,</hi> which Old Man is <hi>the Body of Sin,</hi> and that when he is off, <hi>he is not on, and that the Apoſtle exhorted them Not to an Impoſſible thing,</hi> I conclude from his Queſtion, that a State of Perfect Sanctification is attainable. He pretended to correct <hi>E.B</hi>'s Extravagancy; but whatever Face he puts upon it, this is the Mark he aims at. To conclude, and ſum up his Ungodly Method; <hi>E.B.</hi> ſpeaks of a Perfect Sanctification in Chriſt. <hi>T.H.</hi> infers, that ſame perfect Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication immediately to the Creature; not only confounding the <hi>Worker</hi> and <hi>Work,</hi> the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and the <hi>Effect,</hi> about which one piece of Baſeneſs he beſtows not a little Pains; but ſuggeſting thereby, that <hi>we deny all Sanctification or Perfection in Degree,</hi> and that we are as compleatly Perfect as Chriſt himſelf.

Holy Will. <hi>But Tho. Hicks</hi> makes this a Strange and Dangerous Doctrine, inſinuating that we perform nothing but upon a kind of Spiritual Compulſion, as if that God required Man to do all his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements without his holy Spirit, alwayes ready to incline and help them, either to begin or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any ſuch Duty: or that there were no Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between waiting for the natural Springs of Divine Power to aſſiſt, <hi>and being compell'd to worſhip.</hi> But this ſhews his great Ignorance of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, its dayly Movings upon the Heart of Men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Reprover or Comforter for Good; for were he better acquainted with its Dealings, it would not be ſo uncouth to him, to hear of our Waiting to feel the holy Stirrings of it, in order to every Religious Performance: wherefore let not his <hi>Ignorance</hi> be any <hi>Argument</hi> againſt our holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Practice. The Saints of old had a <hi>Warrant in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> for what they did: They were not wont to run into the Imitation of former Generations as to any External Appointments becauſe then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and practiſed as proper, but conſulted the Anointing they had receiv'd about the Continuation or Diſ-uſe of ſuch Figures or outward Services; and as they receiv'd Wiſdom and Counſel therefrom, either to uſe or decline the Practice of them, they acted, and no otherwiſe; making good the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Saying, <hi>that as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God:</hi> Are we led by It in ALL things, then in, and about God's things. Had it not been for this, how could the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have preach'd down <hi>the whole Ceremonial Worſhip of the Jews</hi>? The <hi>meer Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of Scriptures could never have been their Rule in

the Caſe. If any ſay they were extraordinarily Inſpired, I anſwer, how did ſuch as then believ'd know that, if not from an Inward Teſtimony? Nay, what Rule had the many Thouſands then to worſhip God by? <hi>The</hi> Hebrew <hi>Bible was little, or not at all known to the</hi> Gentiles. <hi>The Scripture tells us that whole Churches were ſetled in the Faith before the Epiſtles were writ</hi>; And it is hard to think, when they were writ, <hi>that they could be ſuddenly collected</hi>; and when collected, <hi>that every Individual could get a Coppy,</hi> that to be ſure, <hi>ought to have a Rule</hi>; for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was not ſo early in the World, and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing muſt needs have been to Irkſome for every Perſon to obtain a Coppy for his or her peculiar Benefit: But becauſe we are taught to believe <hi>that they wanted not True Rule of Faith and Practice, and that the Scriptures eſpecially of the new Teſtament, could not be all that to them, our preſent</hi> Adverſaries <hi>conclude to make the great Rule,</hi> let them not be diſpleas'd if I infer from hence, <hi>that a Meaſure of that Holy Spirit, which was given to every one to profit with, was their Rule,</hi> and therefore ought to be, our great Rule and Guide, in all things relating to Faith and Worſhip. And let it be remembred, that Chriſt promiſed <hi>to ſend the Spirit of Truth to lead into all Truth</hi>; as much as to ſay, <hi>none are led</hi> into <hi>the Truth, nor</hi> in <hi>the Truth, but by the holy Spirit of Truth; or that their Practice is a Ly, or they are led into a Ly, who are not led by the Spirit of Truth, that alone leads into all the Wayes of Truth</hi>: where by <hi>Truth,</hi> is not to be underſtood the <hi>meer Letter of the Scripture,</hi> which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is True, but the <hi>Living, Powerful Truth; Chriſt the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> of which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

is but a Record, or Declaration: Many may run into a Practice of ſeveral Outward Things mentioned in the Scriptures to have been the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the Saints of former Ages, and yet, not be led into the Truth; for all that is but Will-Worſhip, Imitation and Unwarrantable. To be led into the Truth, is to be led into God's Living Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, whoſe Fruits are Peace and Aſſurance for ever; This is the Truth, the Spirit leads and is all-ſufficient to.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> intended This for the Great Evangelical <hi>Leader, Rule, Judge, Law-giver</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> through the whole courſe of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> the <hi>only Way</hi> into the Everlaſting <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And all thoſe who are not by this Holy Spirit prepared, moved and aſſiſted to perform Divine Worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, but run into that weighty Duty, or any other (ſuppoſed) Ordinance, without its pure Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, which makes it a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Living Worſhip,</hi> they are but thoſe anciently fore-told of, LORD, LORD-CRYERS, whoſe Portion ſhall be that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>Depart from me, I know you not; who has requir'd theſe things at your hands?</hi> Let this therefore be a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto all <hi>Profeſſors</hi> in the Name of the Lord, that they run no longer <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſent,</hi> nor think to be accepted for their many Words; God regards the Heart that he has broken, and is made contrite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and which trembles at his Word; 'Tis not meer Worſhip, but <hi>that which is Spiritual,</hi> which he expects and accepts; and to perform that, Man muſt Ceaſe from his own <hi>Spirit, Strength, Strivings</hi> and <hi>Imitations,</hi> and become <hi>Dumb</hi> before the Lord, and as a Man <hi>dead to Self-Performance,</hi> and then will

                  <p>And becauſe he thinks his Advantage is not ſmall, that he hath againſt us by baſely inferring and aggravating ſuch Conſequences as this, <hi>What of Duty we neglect, we are to charge upon the Spirit's not moving us to it</hi>; or becauſe we muſt not obey without a Motion, <hi>we are acquitted from all Fault till then, &amp;c.</hi> Let me tell him, that he ſtriketh himſelf, and not the <hi>Quakers</hi>; For they hold, that God's Spirit ought to be daily waited for; <hi>And that it is alwayes ready to inform and inſtruct Man's Soul, and to move it to thoſe Thoughts, Words and Deeds, with reſpect to God and Man, as are Well-pleaſing to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:</hi> For we do not only teach, that the Spirit of God is alwayes preſent to convince of Sin, <hi>but to lead out of it, and in that Way of holy Living, which is well-pleaſing unto God.</hi> In ſhort, God's Worſhip ſtands in the Spirit; and I teſtifie from the Eternal God, all other Worſhip then what ſprings from a Mind touch'd, ſanctify'd and mov'd of his holy quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit, is abominable to him; His Righteous Soul loathes it: And what elſe were their Sacrifices, as theirs were, who in my hearing ſaid, <hi>Pray</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <hi>will you Pray?</hi> No, <hi>Brother,</hi> I am not ſo well able as you are; Let <hi>Brother</hi> ſuch a one Pray, he is better gifted for the Work, &amp;c. Complementing, Shifting, and at laſt Praying, &amp;c. in their own Wills, and <hi>not in God's Motion</hi>— This God hates.</p>
                  <p>Next, Since the Pouring forth of the Spirit is the great Goſpel Gift, and that the Children of God are to be led by it; In what ſhould we more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently wait for its Heavenly Aſſiſtance, then in that part of our Duty, which we owe to God? Is his Worſhip Spiritual, and can we perform it out of the Motion of his own Spirit? For what then was his Spirit given? Again, If Men ſhould pray in a known Tongue, <hi>much more with the Spirit,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks. No Wonder the Profeſſors ask Pardon for their Prayers. Indeed God's Spirit gives them to ſee the Emptineſs of their Righteouſneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them for it, wherfore they are at times diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd in them; yet they will not learn of him, to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him, who would cover them with Everlaſting Righteouſneſs. Bleſſed would they be, if their Minds were ſtayed in his Counſel: But inſtead thereof <hi>T.H.</hi> does as good as ſay, <hi>that if he ſhould ſtay till the Spirit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, he might ſtay long enough</hi>; rendring the Spirit <hi>Wanting</hi> in that for which he was ſhed abroad in the Heart: Becauſe through his Enmity and Darkneſs, &amp; haſty Running in his own Spirit, he feels it not to lead him: elſe he would never infer, from our Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Neceſſity of the Spirit's Moving to Right &amp; Acceptable Worſhip, <hi>that we are acquitted from any Fault in omitting to do that which is Good, and the Blame muſt be laid upon the Spirit.</hi> But let me ask him, Can
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41857:63"/>
any Man do Good of himſelf? Surely he will ſay, No. How then ſhall Man do that Good he ought to do, but by the Holy Ghoſt? <hi>Canſt thou call</hi> Jeſus <hi>Lord by any other Power or Spirit?</hi> Read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. What greater Contradiction can there be, then to believe, Man of himſelf can do no Good; and yet to ſay, <hi>he can do it without God's Spirit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and aſſiſt him thereunto?</hi> But if the Spirit do not, what does? Tell me, <hi>what can tender the Heart, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Soul, raiſe the Affections, give true Feeling of Wants, and help to perform all in that Fear, Reverence and deep Senſe (which becomes all New Covenant, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Worſhippers)</hi> if this cannot, or do not? Nay, what an Affront is it to God; ſince it is to ſuppoſe, <hi>that Man wants him not, that his Spirit neither moves to Duty that ought to be performed, nor yet condemns for Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty omitted?</hi> Behold the Impudence of the Man! He talks of <hi>Goſpel, Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kingdom, &amp;c. What groſſer Oppoſer of the New Covenant can there be, <hi>who denies the very Life, Virtue and Soul of all true Goſpel-Worſhip and Diſcipline</hi>; and without which the otherwiſe beſt <hi>Chriſtian-Church</hi> that ever was, <hi>would be worſe then Legal</hi>?

                     <hi>offer ſtrange Fire, ſet up their own Worſhip, and are Image Makers; ſuch ask, but they receive not, becauſe they ask not aright.</hi> For if no Man can call <hi>Jeſus</hi> Lord, but by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>; no Man can pray to the Lord, or in his Name, <hi>without the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; yet a Sigh or Groan from its holy Operation, that Sacrifice, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Words, is manifold more engaging and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

Ye turn People to the Scripture, and they miſtake it; We direct People to the Light, but they miſtake it: So that here is the <hi>Difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Saying, <hi>that Men ſhould do nothing but what the</hi> Spirit <hi>requires</hi>; and your Teaching, <hi>that Men ought to do nothing but what the</hi> Scripture <hi>requires.</hi> For if we diſown them for not doing what we know the <hi>Spirit</hi> requires, you daily diſown ſuch as do not ſomethings you ſuppoſe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do require: And as you think the Scripture to mean the ſame you ever did, notwithſtanding your Oppoſers Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, we are by you juſtified in mantaining our judgment againſt thoſe Pretenders to the Guidance of the Light.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I ſee no Difference between <hi>Tho. Hick</hi>'s ſaying to me, <hi>William Penn, thou bidſt me obey the Light within me, and becauſe I do thou diſowneſt me</hi>; and my ſaying to him, <hi>Thomas Hicks, thou bidſt me obey the Scriptures, and becauſe I do thou cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt me.</hi> This d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:41857:65"/>Let none fancy an <hi>Impoſſibility of Trying Spirits</hi> by that without which it is utterly impoſſible to try them. God's Spirit gives his Children to ſavour and diſcern Spiritual Bad, as well as Spiritual Good Things; It is not unknown to ſuch as are led by God's Spirit, of what Nature and to what Tendency ſuch Words or Actions may be. It was on this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and upon no other Foundation, the Spiritual Goſpel, Sound and Heavenly Fellowſhip ſtood of old; for by One Spirit were the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into One Body.</p>
                  <p>O You that are Profeſſors of Religion, who in dayes paſt, and years that are gone over your Head, Prayed loud and fervently for the Spirit, <hi>riſe not up againſt it</hi> becauſe it ſtains your Beauty, ſubjects your Wills, brings you out of Self, and overturns your dead Forms, where the Spirit of this World has had its Seat for Ages, and in a Myſtery inſnared and beguiled you; But wait upon God in deep Silence to all Fleſhly Conceivings, and Will-Worſhips, ſo ſhall you come to feel <hi>God's Pure &amp; Quickening Spirit,</hi> to Inliven, Tender and Affect your Hearts; in which State one Sigh or Groan is more Valuable, then Years of unprepared and unſanctified Will-Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>The next thing aimed at in this Cavil, attended with ſo much Bitterneſs and rude Language, is this, that <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> being deſirous to repreſent the <hi>Quakers</hi> to greateſt Diſadvantage, takes not a little Pains to incenſe <hi>Parents, Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> againſt them, as Neglecters of all Lawful

                  <p>Were we ſuch <hi>Wretches,</hi> as he would render us, we ſhould not deſerve to live in Civil Societies. What I ſhall ſay in our Defence is briefly this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles and Practice have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves conſiſtent with Government, becauſe they have encouraged to Good Life, Peace and Honeſt Induſtry. I ſhall not here ſeek an Eye for an Eye, nor tell any of thoſe <hi>Black and Horrible</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies, <hi>that go up and down the World, under great</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <hi>Ateſtations of the People called</hi> Anabaptiſts.

                  <p n="2">2. As to the Commands of <hi>Parents</hi> I have this to ſay, and that by good Experience of more then one, That thoſe who have had Children of our Way, though with great Diſquiet, and not a little Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure and Severity againſt them at the firſt, they have left the World with this Teſtimony of their Children, they never diſobeyed them, but for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, and from Threatning them with the Loſs of all, <hi>have become ſo Affectionate towards them, and Confident in them, as to entruſt them with the Whole
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41857:66"/>
of their Worldly Subſtance.</hi> 'Tis true, here and there a Crooked, Perverſe Profeſſor, whoſe Husbands, Wives, Children or Servants convinced, have the worſt of Lives, through their extream Oppoſition, and Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching for Evil, may perhaps have ſpy'd <hi>an Indiſcretion,</hi> which, though againſt his own Blood or Family, his Enmity has aggravated to an Heinous Offence, <hi>and then it muſt be given for a Demonſtration of the Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Way.</hi> But how Juſt, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Conſcientious ſuch Proceeding is againſt ſuch Diſſenting Relations, or the People they aſſociate with, let all Impartial Perſons judge. This is not doing as they would be dealt by; Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience! Tyranny, and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Oppreſſions. I ask, Would the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> be thus ſerved concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their own <hi>Proſelytes?</hi> Did they never any of them ſuffer from their <hi>Parents</hi>? And have not their Parents complained of them? And has that been taken by their Church alwayes for ſufficient Proof?</p>
                  <p>And for the Story of the <hi>Woman that went rambling from her Family and Husband,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contin. p. 63, 69.</note> bidding him <hi>take another Woman, &amp;c. with ſome preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Revelations to refuſe juſt Debts,</hi> I ſhall ſay no more but thus, We know of no ſuch things, <hi>and believe them to be downright Lyes,</hi> as others that are gone before them; However, ſhould they be as true, as we hope they are falſe, we can but judge them, and that we do, by the Light of Chriſt Jeſus to the Pit forever. But if we ſhould take this Courſe, of proving the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> thoſe vile <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> he doth call and pretend to prove the Poor Deſpiſed <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> to be, p. 69.

But truly it is very hard, that we ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as we have done, for the Miſcarriages of other Parties, and yet receive theſe groſs Abuſes at their hands: But our Eye is to the Lord, and our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Suffering Cauſe will he plead in his own time, whoſe Will be done by us, and that will be our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Rejoycing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For <hi>Maſters,</hi> I muſt ſpeak my own Experience; many have deſired to retain us, and great Truſts have been repoſed in us. <hi>To whom were we Falſe? Of whoſe Service were we Negligent? When did any of us ſay, I am not moved to do this or that, when ſo required thereto? Shall a Lying</hi> Dialogue <hi>be Demonſtration enough to prove us what ſo invective an</hi> Adverſary <hi>would have People believe us to be?</hi> We do declare to all, that the <hi>Light</hi> whereby we are enlightned, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes commands and ſtrictly enjoyns us <hi>Duty, Obedience, Love, Peace, Gentleneſs, Faithfulneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Holy Living</hi>; And whatever is ſuppoſed to the Contrary, we diſclaim it in the Fear and Name of the Righteous God of Heaven and Earth to be no Product of our Holy Principle.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now attend his Cavils about the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1.

In ſhort, the very Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, which is a <hi>State of Power and Life immediately received of God,</hi> is denyed by him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in acknowledging ſuch Officers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Church, he muſt confeſs to their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, or he does nothing. Now, that which qualified them was the <hi>Receiving of the Holy Ghoſt, and thoſe Heavenly Gifts by it, which were neceſſary for the Diſcharge of thoſe reſpective Services in the Church.</hi> By this it appears, that either <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> muſt now
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41857:68"/>
yield to Preaching and Praying by the Motion of the Holy Spirit, or in oppoſing of it, <hi>acknowledge to his own Contradiction, that there are no ſuch Apoſtles, Prophets, &amp;c. (who miniſtred to the Church, as any thing was revealed to them, the great Evangelical Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification to the Miniſtry)</hi> in our dayes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But why ſhould <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> therefore degrade the Diſpenſation becauſe the People are not yet fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>It</hi>; or oppoſe the Means uſed to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

here is the Darkneſs of the Man from <hi>our denying of empty <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nauthoriz'd Imitations</hi> he infers our Denyal of ſuch Means as God's Power uſes; and from out Uſing ſuch Means to our Contradicting our ſelves, and Immediate Teaching: and becauſe we uſe Means in God's Power, to bring People to God, the Judge of all, that he may be their Judge and Law-giver, and that from his Immediate Hand they may receive Wiſdom, Knowledge and Comfort, he ignorantly concludes that Men, where they are, ought not to have Means us'd to bring them to this Bleſſed State; but that God ſhould Immediately teach them there.</p>

What falſe Doctrine is it, to preach People to the <hi>Seed</hi> God has ſown, in which is <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Life</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> to bring forth bleſſed Fruits to God? To ſuggeſt from thence, that there is nothing to be taught but the Seed, is great Darkneſs and Prejudice; For the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> is not to teach the <hi>Seed,</hi> but to bring down, and humble the Mind of Man to it, <hi>that the Mind may be taught, and the Seed delivered from under the Preſſure of Sin and Ignorance.</hi> Strange Contradiction, <hi>that the Seed ſhould be ſown in Man for its own Salvation, and not for Man's!</hi>

What but Wickedneſs it ſelf could thus write of us?</p>
                  <p>And that the Carnal Mind receives not the Things of God, becauſe it perceives them not, is <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture,</hi> if not according to <hi>Tho.

But his Inſinuation lies here, that the Spirit of God is that which believes in God, and exerciſes Faith for it ſelf in God, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>G.W</hi>'s Intent.

                  <p>Now that <hi>T.H.</hi> hath ſhown himſelf at once Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt and Erroneous too; Let it be obſerved, 1. That from our Denyal of the Reſurrection of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41857:70"/>
ſame Natural, Fleſhly Body, he abſolutely infers and concludes <hi>our Denyal of the Reſurrection of the Body in any Senſe</hi>; which is great Injuſtice to any Adverſary. 2.

In ſhort, We do acknowledge a Reſurrection in order to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Recompence, and that every Seed ſhall have its own Body, and reſt contented with what Body it ſhall pleaſe God to give us; But as we are not ſuch <hi>Fools</hi> as curiouſly to enquire <hi>What?</hi> ſo muſt we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deny the groſs Conceits of <hi>T.H.</hi> and his <hi>Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> concerning the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>

                  <p>I grant that this implies a Change; but I deny, that it ſo much as intimates, that Men ſhall riſe with thoſe very Carnal Bodies that were buried. No, the Apoſtle not only tells us, that the Body ſown is not the Body that ſhall be, <hi>but that Fleſh and Blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> verſ. 50.

                  <p>Nor am I afraid to tell him, that the Scripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rationally be taken ſtrictly, as tranſlated (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought many more) for there are certain <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, Modes</hi> and <hi>Wayes</hi> proper to that Language in which this Epiſtle was written, which are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with Allowances; for how can the <hi>Mortal</hi> (taken for <hi>Mortality,</hi> and not him who in part is Mortal) put on Immortality; It is Impoſſible. Can Mortality be cloathed with Immortality? then it ſeems that Mortality is the Perſon, and Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Garment. If <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> ſhould tell me, No; it is meant that the Mortal Body ſhould be changed into an Immortal Body, it follows that he is gone from the Letter of the Text into an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, as well as that it contradicts his abſurd <hi>Identity</hi> or Sameneſs of Body: If ſo, it is as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me (and more, if in the Right) to conſtrue

It thus, <hi>That we, who are Mortals reſpecting our Bodies, put off the Mortal Part, and put on inſtead thereof Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.1.</note> ſuitable to that weighty Paſſage of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> For <hi>We know that if our Earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, we have a Building of God, an Houſe not made with Hands, Eternal in Heavens</hi>; which as directly concludes the Charge, not of Accidents, but Bodies, from an Earthly Houſe or Tabernacle, to an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Houſe or Building, as ever any thing can be ſpoken by Men or Angels.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Since Mortality can not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put on Immortality, but Man that is cloathed with Mortality, may put off or exchange Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for Immortality, becauſe otherwiſe Mortality would have Immortality for its Garment; a thing impoſſible and abſurd; I do infer that this place yields no Strength at all to <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi>'s groſs Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>

It is to ſay that the Body that ſhall be, is Vile, elſe what means his Saying <hi>Becauſe ſuch a Body cannot be ſaid</hi> TO BE (not to have been) <hi>either Vile or Changed.</hi> 2. Though the Body That ſhall be, may not be ſaid to be either Vile or Changed, yet it may be given of God in lieu of a Vile Body, and ſo the Vile Body Changed for one that is Glorious. It was either Ignorantly or Sophiſtically done in <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> to imply. <hi>That Body that ſhall be, could not be ſaid to be Changed,</hi> ſince the Change lies on the ſide of the Vile Body, that is exchanged for a more Glorious Body; Therefore all along <hi>we muſt conclude, it is not the ſame, but another Body.</hi> But how Diſingenuous is <hi>Tho Hicks</hi> to repute <hi>G.W</hi>'s Anſwer in the Apoſtle's Words, a preſſing the <hi>Metaphor</hi> too far, and yet by ſo doing, runs himſelf into this Dark Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Fleſhly Reſurrection.</hi>

                  <p>This Principle brings to the Mortality of the Soul (held by many <hi>Baptiſts</hi>) or I am miſtaken: But why muſt the Felicity of the Soul depend upon that of the Body?

But this had leſs ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be done meerly out of Reputation, if they had taken that Vile (yet their Brother) <hi>Anabaptiſt, T.

But <hi>T.

gather, and that ſpeedily, I do believe as well, as that I do very greatly deſire it.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, In both Books he has given thoſe Anſwers in our Names, which never were our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers at all; And that little he has quoted out of our own Books, he has given as thoſe Anſwers to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtions, &amp; many times to other Matter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not our Anſwers, but his own: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Th.

                     <p>And this is the whole Provocation, or Reaſon aſſigned by him, for ſuch Rude and Unhandſom Expreſſions, <hi>and that to a Man that never had to do with him.</hi> God's Witneſs in all Conſciences judge betwixt us, if ſo true an Expreſſion deſerves ſuch Affronts; and if ſuch an Anſwer ought to paſs for a Confutation.

A Way, <hi>T. Hicks</hi> of all Men, has proved himſelf moſt Expert and moſt Unjuſt in. But why <hi>Confident Dictator, and brazened with Impudence, Rage, and Folly</hi>? Becauſe in my <hi>Second Part of the Apology</hi> in Anſwer to <hi>T. Jenner,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who had publiſht ſcores of Lyes, Scandals and Perſonal Defamations againſt many of our Friends, and particularly againſt my ſelf (that his Book ſeemed but an <hi>Epitome of Lyes and Abuſe</hi>) I did ſay, <hi>O wretched Impudence! Could any but a Prieſt brazn'd with Rage and Folly, ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſo great a Lye,</hi> as that we ſhould perſecute the Truth and its Followers, with bitter Revilings
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41857:90"/>
and Reproachings? when yet ſayes <hi>T. Hicks, that, to which</hi> Penn <hi>thus replyes, is ſuch a matter of Fact, that Thouſands can bear Witneſs to the Truth of it.</hi> But herein has he done fooliſhly, for it being yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable betwixt us, <hi>what is Truth, and what is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting, and what is Reviling</hi>? Can he have ſo little Modeſty in his Cryes againſt Impudence, as to make our Accuſers &amp; Parties, either <hi>Judges</hi> or <hi>Witneſſes?</hi> We ſhall ſubmit it to an Impartial Judgment; but not to <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi>'s <hi>Pride and Paſſion.</hi> However, this is moſt true, that to call Chriſt's Light an <hi>Ignis Fatuus, a dim Light, the Spirit of the</hi> Devil, <hi>that we are of the</hi> Devil, <hi>that we are poſſeſt, are Witches, acted and mov'd by</hi> Satan, <hi>Enemies to God, Chriſt, the Spirit, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, humane Societies</hi>; with many Stories that we have offered to prove <hi>Lyes</hi> in the Sight of all Men, and particularly what he charged upon my ſelf, viz. <hi>That</hi> Penn, <hi>another of their Teachers, did boldly affirm to a Friend of mine in</hi> Dublin, <hi>that whoſoever ſhall expect to be ſaved by that Jeſus Chriſt that was born in</hi> Judea, <hi>and ſuffered at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſhall be deceiv'd</hi>; which I declare to be a Lye <hi>in the whole, and every part of it.</hi> I ſay, this is certain, that ſo much evil Treatment may well extort that ſharp and juſt Rebuke from me: But if it be Criminal, (I know in <hi>T. Hicks</hi>'s account it is) for me ſo to Character a <hi>Prieſt</hi> that had written an entire Book againſt us, in which he had moſt wickedly belyed our Principles, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our Friends, and beſpattered my ſelf in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                     <p>What can He think of himſelf, to ſay ſo much more of me, who never writ againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in general, nor <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> in particular, <hi>much leſs,</hi>

                     <p>I teſtifie againſt this as a Fiction; for this was not my Anſwer, neither has he referred us to any <hi>Quotations</hi> of mine; though upon this he is pleaſed to accuſe me with <hi>Paſſion, Furious Replies</hi> and <hi>Sarcaſms</hi> for his own Fiction, to which he hath counterfeited my Name: I queſtion not but the Judgments of God will follow him, and ſuch For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Spreaders of Lyes. But that was not my Anſwer to the ſaid Objection: This <hi>Dialogue-Man</hi>'s Liberty in theſe Forgeries, and ſilly Botcheries is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> nor Civil.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>As to what he ſayes pag. 3. I anſwer:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Life,</hi> which is the Light of Men, <hi>John</hi> 1. is not a Creature, but <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>of the very Being of God,</hi> I ſtill affirm, and have elſe-where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; though the whole Eſſence or Being of God is not contained in Man, yet enlightens all Men. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Inward Speaking or Living Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit of Truth, is of greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then the Scriptures or Writings in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41857:104"/>3. <hi>S. Criſp</hi> doth own the True and Real Chriſt, the Son of the Living God (in his Spiritual Divine Being) to be without either Beginning, Date, or End. This he hath fully anſwered elſe-where.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Soul, or Spirit of Man (as it relates to the Creaturely Being) is a diſtinct Being from the Infinite Being of God, and is not properly a Part of God. For he is not divided into Parts or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; but with reſpect to its Original Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it immortally ſubſiſts, we are God's Off-ſpring, and the Breath of Life, or Immediate Inſpiration of God (by which Man became a Living Soul) or the Original Life of Man's Soul. Of this <hi>G.F.</hi> ſpoke, when he ſaid, <hi>Is not that of God, which cometh out from God</hi>? viz. <hi>the Breath of Life</hi>? His words are perverted and miſ-cited by <hi>T.H.</hi> For in another Conſideration and State he owns the Infinite Being of God, and the Soul or Spirit of Man to be diſtinct Beings, where he ſpeaks of the <hi>Soul being in Death, in Tranſgreſſion, Man's Spirit <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſanctified, the Soul being in Death, Tranſgreſſing the Law,</hi> ſee <hi>Great Myſt.</hi> p. 91. This he could never intend or ſpeak of the Infinite, Incorruptible Being of God; for that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinned.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That <hi>G.W. denies the Reſurrection of the Body</hi> (that is, of the Dead, or any Body at all) is falſe; nor is this prov'd againſt <hi>G.W.</hi> from his Saying, Thou ſoweſt not the Body that ſhall be, it's raiſed a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Body, and Fleſh &amp; Blood ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. 1. Cor. 15. And <hi>T.H.</hi> may as well charge it upon the Apoſtle, and upon his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Tho. Collier,</hi> who in his <hi>Marrow of Chriſtianity</hi> p. 40, 94, 95. plainly ſaith, <hi>The Form, in which they ſhall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41857:104"/>
be raiſed, that is in a Spiritual Form, not in a Fleſhly &amp;c. All Fleſh ſhall be ſwallowed up in Spirit; and our Body ſhall be changed and made like his glorious Body.</hi> But <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> plainly contradicts him ſaying, <hi>That the Apoſtles and all true Chriſtians ſay, This Body of Fleſh and Bones ſhall riſe again.</hi> Dial. p. 59, 60. which he could never yet prove.</p>
                  <p>The Contradiction I placed upon <hi>T. Hicks</hi> was not between his <hi>Denying the Light within to be a Sufficient Rule,</hi> and his Granting, <hi>it ought to be obeyed</hi> (as he falſly ſtates it, <hi>Contin.</hi> p. 8.) but between his Saying, <hi>the Light within</hi> (which we attend to) <hi>hath in many things miſguided thee,</hi> and his granting, <hi>it ought to be obeyed, appealing to it</hi>; See Dip. plung. p. 5. Is that which ought to be obeyed (or appealed to in things relating to Salvation) a miſguiding Light?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>T.H.</hi> his Compariſon between <hi>thoſe Signs wrought by the Light within,</hi> and what is ſpoken of the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> 2 Theſs. 2, 9. or that what we have ſaid thereof may as well prove <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be <hi>the true Chriſt</hi> as the <hi>Light within.</hi> Dial. p. 11.12. — I ſay, ſtill this is Blaſphemy, and contradicted by <hi>T.H.</hi> himſelf in his Saying, <hi>that Chriſt is the Life and Light of Men,</hi> Dial. p. 22. Of which Contradiction he takes no notice, but abuſeth and accuſeth me with <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Falſhood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His ſleighting our Obeying the Commands of the <hi>Living Eternal Word in us,</hi> and reflecting upon our <hi>owning Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as being <hi>with ſuch a mental and myſtical Reſervation</hi> (as he falſly ſaith) which <hi>that it is no other than a meer Myſtical Romance,</hi> Dial. p. 10. and now (to mend the Matter) <hi>that the Chriſt we own is no other then a Myſtical Romance.</hi> Herein I muſt

ſtill look upon him to have acted the <hi>Prophane Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer,</hi> and <hi>Irreligious Miſcreant</hi>: And the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Deceit he would caſt upon me falls on his own Head, and not mine.

                  <p>Why ſhould he charge me with affirming <hi>the Light within to be the Divine Eſſence,</hi> p. 10. (though they are not my words) when he himſelf has confeſſed, <hi>Chriſt to be the Light and Life of Men?</hi> And <hi>Philip Bennit,</hi> whoſe <hi>Queries</hi> are cited, and commended by him, confeſſeth <hi>Query</hi> 17. <hi>That Chriſt, in reſpect of his Divine Nature, is in all Places,</hi> p 34. What ſayeſt thou <hi>T.H.</hi> to this? Doſt thou not believe this? If not, why didſt thou cite it without oppoſing it?</p>
                  <p>It was never my Aſſertion, that the Principle of Divine Light within is but <hi>an Effect</hi> of Power, or Thing made, as thou beggeſt the Queſtion, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Light within</hi> but an <hi>Effect,</hi> or <hi>meer Creature,</hi> Dial. p. 3, 4, 46. but that God's Immediate Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or In-ſhining is a Natural Effect, flowing from himſelf; which therefore is Divine. I never could intend (much leſs affirm) <hi>that</hi> all kinds <hi>of Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects were</hi> in every Reſpect <hi>ſuch as the Cauſe,</hi> though

And when <hi>John</hi> was in the Spirit, he appeared to him, ſo that his Eyes were as a Flame of Fire, his Countenance as the Sun ſhineth in his Strength; inſomuch that he ſaid, When I ſaw him, <hi>I fell at his Feet as Dead,</hi> Rev. 1.13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
