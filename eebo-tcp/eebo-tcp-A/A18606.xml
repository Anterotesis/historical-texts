            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ends thereof are, the Authors ſhewing reſpect to the Patron, and the Patrons giving countenance to the Authors Work:
<pb facs="tcp:8237:3"/>
and the meane to attaine unto both theſe ends, is relation in ſome kinde or degree betwixt them both. In which reſpect, having penned a Treatiſe concerning the Faith of the Goſpell, and upon requeſt printed it, I made bold to dedicate it unto your Worſhips, as beeing the fittest perſons to bee Patrons thereof; not onely becauſe you were the firſt in my conſultation, and the laſt in my reſolution about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating of it; but alſo, and chiefly, in reſpect of ſome relation betwixt your Worſhips, and the matter and Author of the Booke. In reſpect of the matter, I preſumed you would countenance it, becauſe the Subiect thereof, is generally a point of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, whereof ſome of you are Doctors, many Batchelors, moſt
<pb facs="tcp:8237:3"/>
Preachers, and all Students (I hope) more or leſse, ſpecially it is that point of Divinity that is Faith in Chriſt, which (as Proteſtants) you all profeſſe; and more particularly it concernes that point of Faith that is Tryall, which (as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) I truſt you doe all practiſe. In regard of the Author likewiſe, I thought you would protect it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as hee is now a Miniſter of the Church, ſo was he once a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and member of your Houſe. Vouchſafe therefore, I pray you the Head and Superiour members, to looke downe upon an inferiour part of your body, bending it ſelfe to doe you reverence and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance. Amongſt you I received the firſt ſeeds of Divinitie; unto you therefore I offer the firſt fruits of

my Miniſterie for the Preſſe, not doubting but that you will taſte, relliſh, and well digeſt the ſame. My purpoſe herein is, not to reade you a Lecture of what you know not: but to render you ſome account of that little I know in this point, which may be a Remembrancer unto you of what you haue already learned. Neither yet do I tender it, becauſe I thinke, it doth in it ſelfe deſerve, to be a Preſent, but that it may in time ſerve to bee a Preſident unto others, who may teſtifie the like duty, upon the like occaſion. In hope of your free favour herein, I humbly ſubmit my <hi>Tryal of Faith,</hi> to your Tryall and Cenſure; and heartily commit your perſons, and ſtudies, to the protection, &amp; directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, who giue unto you all,

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The Preface containing chiefly an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of one Text of Scripture, that gaue occaſion to the writing of this Treatiſe, and which is alſo one of the principall grounds of the doctrine taught therein.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe men are loth to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the things of the world, therefore doe they trie before they truſt: For they try their Gold by waight and touch, before they take it, becauſe all is not Gold that gliſters. Now if in ciuill things, tryall be ſo good, to preuent loſſe by beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; then in ſpirituall matters it is moſt needfull, becauſe in them it is both moſt eaſie, and alſo moſt dangerous to be deceiued.</p>
            <p>Among other ſpirituall things the gifts and graces of the Spirit are to bee tryed, becauſe euery gift is not a ſauing grace; and amongst
<pb facs="tcp:8237:7"/>
other gifts and graces of the Spirit, our faith is to be tried; becauſe euery faith is not a ſauing faith, as ſhall be proued hereafter. For Satan, who by his fall,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.14.</note> is <hi>become an angell of darkneſſe, can transforme himſelfe into an Angel of light;</hi> not to be one, but to ſeeme to be one, to the end hee may deceiue: therefore much more can hee by the ſame his ſubtill power, transforme that faith, which is but an hiſtoricall faith, and which euery member of the Church militant hath; yea, which himſelf hath,<note place="margin">Iam. 2.19.</note> into a ſauing faith; not to bee it, but to make it ſeeme to be it, to the end hee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them that haue it, with a preſumption of ſaluation without any true ground.</p>
            <p>For this, and other like cauſes, I thought it needfull and profitable to teach my Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to try their faith: and becauſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.8. 1. Ioh. 3.23.</note> which is the <hi>Word of faith,</hi> and which doth <hi>command it,</hi> is the beſt meanes, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vs in this triall, and to perſwade the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience thereunto. Therfore did I make choyce of a Text, that is a part of the Gospell, to preach on, that doth earneſtly exhort vnto it: and it is written in <hi>2.</hi> Cor. <hi>13.5.</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Examine your ſelues whether you be in the faith; proue your owne ſelues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In handling of this portion of Scripture, I propounded theſe foure things: <hi>1.</hi> I ſhewed the coherence of the words, which wee call the
<pb facs="tcp:8237:7"/>
Context: <hi>2.</hi> I declared the ſumme and parts, with the circumſtances of the ſame, which is tearmed the Analyſis: <hi>3.</hi> I deliuered the ſenſe, by interpreting the words and phraſes. And laſtly, I propounded and proſecuted the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, I take the coherence twofold, generall, and ſpeciall. Generall, as it agrees with the matter handled in the three Chapters immediatly going before, and it is thus: Becauſe the reports of the meaneneſſe of a Preachers calling and gifts, are a likely meanes to diſgrace his preaching, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he deliuers: therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> hauing by his preaching conuerted many to the faith in <hi>Corinth;</hi> the Diuell labours to hinder the progreſſe of his Miniſterie, by rayſing vp ſome to report of him, either that he was not an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe hee was not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him immediatly while hee liued on the earth, as the other twelue were; or that he was no ſcholler, becauſe he vſed no vaine ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane learning in his Sermons, or that he was but a meane man, becauſe hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in no outward port and pompe in the world, as did the Scribes and Phariſes: by theſe or the like ſlanders many weake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians being ſeduced, and <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſterie alſo traduced by the ſame: vpon the hearing of it, he doth by many arguments in the <hi>10,
<pb facs="tcp:8237:8"/>

            <p>The ſpeciall dependance is after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Many of the Corinthian Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by falſe ſuggeſtions brought to thinke meanely of <hi>Paul,</hi> and to doubt of the efficacie of his Apoſtleſhip, they are ſo bold with him, as to <hi>demand a proofe of Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in him,</hi> chap. <hi>13.</hi> verſ. <hi>3.</hi> For anſwer hereunto, firſt in the <hi>3.</hi> and <hi>4.</hi> verſes, he doth peremptorily affirme, that <hi>Chriſts power was not weake in him, but mighty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them,</hi> viz. by his Miniſtery. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he ſhewes them how they may finde a direct proofe of Chriſts power in his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, viz. if they do <hi>but examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whether they be in the Faith or no,</hi> verſ. <hi>5.</hi> intimating thereby, that if they doe but examine themſelues, whether they bee in the Faith, they ſhall find themſelues to bee in the Faith; and by finding themſelues to bee in the Faith,, they ſhall find Chriſt to haue beene in him, becauſe by Chriſts power on his Miniſtery, they had beene begotten therunto. And ſo much of the Coherence of the words, by which the Reader may diſcerne the drift of the Apoſtle in them; from whence (beſides the principall Doctrine of the Text, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
<pb facs="tcp:8237:8"/>
to be handled at large in the Treatiſe following) I thinke it proper to obſerue two ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerall duties both for Preachers and Hearers.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doctrines from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence.

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> If it be their lot, to haue their Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Sermons ſo cenſured, and thereby themſelues ſo diſgraced; then to learne by S. <hi>Paules</hi> example, to bee able, and ready to maintaine the ſame by a iuſt defence. And for that end to direct their Hearers, how they may finde ſome arguments to iuſtifie the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of their Miniſtery, by the worke of knowledge, beleefe, ſauing Faith, repentance, loue, patience, and the like in themſelues or others: to the end, that they may thereby, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be fully ſatisfied, or left without excuſe
<pb facs="tcp:8237:9"/>
if they ſhall wittingly ſhut their mouthes, and not confeſſe, or their eyes and not ſee, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Gods ordinance among them.</p>
            <p>Theſe poynts, if they were well known and marked by many Ministers, they would not he ſo ſoone weary of painfull preaching, nor ſo forward to leaue their paſtorall charge, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch diſcontentments, eſpecially if they did well lay to heart, not onely the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> who was not mooued vpon this diſgrace to leaue the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> but alſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God deliuered by the Apoſtle, which is,<note place="margin">2.

            </p>
            <p>Hearers alſo, and ordinary Chriſtians may hence learne their duty:</p>

               <note place="margin">Hearers Duty.</note>
               <hi>1.</hi> To examine themſelues of the fruit and effect of the Sermons of their owne Paſtors and Preachers, and to try themſelues, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by happely, knowledge, and beleefe, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith in Chriſt, with other graces, haue beene wrought in them, that ſo they may either iuſtifie Gods ordinance in its ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie, for their preſent comfort, or condemn themſelues for their owne ſlackneſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proficiencie
<pb facs="tcp:8237:9"/>

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> If by examination they ſhall find the Miniſtery of their Preachers to haue beene effectuall among them, by the worke of the fore-named, and other like Chriſtian graces: then thereupon to conclude infallibly, that the Lord Ieſus hath beene in their Preachers; his power hath beene ſeene in their weakneſſe, his bleſſing hath beene vpon their Sermons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may ſafely conclude, that God hath <hi>ſet his ſeale to their calling</hi> and gifts,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2.</note> and thereby approoued them, not only as a lawful, but as a powerfull Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>Theſe points, had they beene well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and weighed by our brethren and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen that are gone from <hi>England</hi> to the Low-countries; from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> for a lawfull Miniſtery, (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) they might haue ſaued themſelues a great deale of trouble and expence in their remooue. For if <hi>Paul</hi> in his time, by willing the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians to examine themſelues, whether they were in the Faith, did purpoſe, they ſhould by that examination, find themſelues to be in the Faith, to the end he might thereby alledge a good argument, to prooue the efficacie of his Miniſtery by Chriſts power, working through it, Faith in them: then in theſe dayes thoſe Chriſtians, that by examination find, that the Miniſtery of the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath
<pb facs="tcp:8237:10"/>
wrought Faith in them, (I ſay) they may ſee, and they muſt acknowledge it, a ſound argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to proue the lawfulneſſe and efficacie of our Miniſtery here; or elſe the Apoſtles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and exhortation were to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>There be many that are gone on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to look for Christs Church, I wonder, whether or no, they had a ſauing Faith, when they went from vs to them, and what they will anſwere to this queſtion: will they ſay, no? then (ſay I) it is well they are gone, and that we are fairely rid of them. But it is impoſſible they ſhould deny it: for how can they, who pretend ſuch zeale for Gods glory, in leaving their Country, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; friends, to enioy Christs kingdom, (as they vſe to ſpeake) and to liue vnder a lawfull Ministery, to iudge and ſpeake ſo meanely of themſelues, that they haue not a ſauing Faith? What will they ſay then? will they affirme, they had a ſauing Faith when they departed? then (ſay I) it was very ill done, to goe away from their Mother-Church, the Miniſtery wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had begotten them to the Faith. For if they had the Faith, then was it wrought in them by the Ministery of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> if ſo, then was that Miniſtery powerfull in them; and then was Christs power in it; then was it Chriſts owne ordinance, and why then did they go from hence thither for it? And ſo
<pb facs="tcp:8237:10"/>
much briefly for the coherence of the words, and the collecting and applying of that which is obſerueable out of the ſame for our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing propounded in opening of the Text, was, to ſhew the ſumme and parts thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſumme is an exhortation; and in the exhortation, an argument, to prooue the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and efficacie of <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtery among the Corinthians, namely, becauſe by Gods bleſſing thereon, they had beene turned from Heatheniſme and infidelity, to the Christian Faith; which (ſayth hee) they ſhall eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, if they do but examine themſelues whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be in the Faith.</p>
            <p>The parts of the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation are three:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1.</hi> The perſon exhorting <hi>Paul.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Come we now to expound and interpret the Text, which was the third thing promiſed, and ſhal be done, by anſwering certaine queſtions; and the questions ſhall bee propounded firſt touching the ſimple words of the Text. <hi>2.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:8237:11"/>
the compound phraſes that are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of two or more words together, by my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer whereunto the ſenſe and meaning may appeare, and may eaſily be vnderſtood.</p>
            <p>The ſimple words are three, namely, <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, prove, Faith,</hi> which are to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into three queſtions, whereof the firſt is this:</p>
            <div n="1" type="question">
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>For anſwer whereunto I ſay, that though it bee not hard for Engliſhmen to conceiue what is meant by this word <hi>examin,</hi> namely, to make proofe or tryall of our ſelues in ſome thing: yet becauſe the Originall Greeke word is not alwaies in the New Teſtament ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, nor vſed in the ſame ſenſe for the ſame kind of Tryall; therefore do I thinke it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſay a little more of the propriety of the word, becauſe it will ſerue for the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding not onely of this Text, but of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo in the New Teſtament where it is vſed.</p>
               <p>

                     </gap>.</note>I would haue the Reader therfore to know, that the word in the Originall, is ſometimes taken in the beſt ſenſe, for a good tryall, and ſometimes in the worſt, for a bad one, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the circumſtances of the Text where it is vſed, and the good or bad meanes and end of that tryall.</p>
               <p>In the worſt, when it is vſed for a bad tryal,
<pb facs="tcp:8237:11"/>
it is in our Engliſh Tongue properly called <hi>tempting;</hi> and tempting, is an uſing of ſome euill meanes, to effect an euill end, (that is) to try if thereby men will be perſwaded to doe that which is euill: and ſo was Chriſt led by the Spirit into the wilderneſſe, <hi>to be tempted of the Divell,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1.</note> to bee tryed by thoſe meanes he then vſed, if happely hee might bee perſwaded to ſin, and do that which is evill. Now this kind of tryal is not vſed in this text, becauſe tryall by temptation is alwayes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed about that which is euill on the tempters part, and is forbidden in the Word; but tryall by examination mentioned in the Text, is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied about that which is good, namely, their Faith, and it is commanded therein.</p>
               <p>In a good ſenſe, when it is vnderſtood of a lawfull tryall, it is an vſing of ſome lawfull meanes, to effect a good purpoſe, namely, to try if by thoſe meanes we may know the nature and condition of the perſons, or things that we try, whether they be or no, or be good or no, or be ſo good as we expect or no; to the end we may accordingly approoue or diſallow them: and ſo the Angell or Paſtor of the Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> is ſayd <hi>to try or examine thoſe that ſaid they were Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.2.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:8237:12"/>
might know them,</hi> and <hi>diſcerne them,</hi> not to be Apoſtles indeed. And ſuch a tryall was this in the Text, becauſe it was an vſing of good meanes to a good end, namely, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly they might know themſelues to be in the Faith; and conſequently, know, that Chriſts power had beene in him, and in his Miniſtery among them, which was the thing they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med doubtfull of: and for clearing whereof, he wils them <hi>to try and examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whether they were in the Faith.</hi>

the Faith, namely, by experiment and tryall.</p>
               <p>And as touching the ſecond branch of this Queſtion, which is, why he vſeth two words to expreſse one action: I ſay, that hee addes <hi>proove</hi> to <hi>examine,</hi> for one or more of theſe reaſons, (as I ſuppoſe) either becauſe it is his manner to vſe variety of words, to expreſſe the ſenſe of one by another,<note place="margin">

               <p>And concerning the reaſon why he ſaith, <hi>Prove your owne ſelves,</hi> (which is the <hi>3.</hi> branch of this Queſtion) I ſay, he addes thoſe words, either becauſe themſelues principally were the parties, by examining whereof they might beſt find a proofe by the efficacie of his Miniſtery, for their owne ſatisfaction: or becauſe thereby he would giue them a cloſe, (but withall a mild reproofe) for beeing ſo eager and forward in ſeeking a proofe of him, and of Chriſt ſpeaking in him: as if he would
<pb facs="tcp:8237:13"/>
ſay, Turne the edge from me to your ſelues, ceaſe ſeeking proofe of me any further, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to examine and proove your ſelues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be in the Faith, and you ſhall eaſily diſcerne the faith of Chriſt in your ſelves, and the power of Chriſt in me.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:8237:13"/>
he ſaith, <hi>Know yee not your ſelves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">verſ. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>how that Chriſt is in you?</hi> Now by the finding of an historicall and a miraculous faith, (as well, though not ſo much) as by finding of a ſaving Faith, the beleeving Corinthians might find Chriſt to be in them; for by an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall Faith Chriſt was in them by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, making them to vnderstand and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Gospell,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23.</note> though it were once fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto them: by a miraculous Faith Christ was in them by his power, cauſing ſome of them to doe ſtrange and miraculous works, though they were weake men; even as by a ſaving Faith Christ was in them by his grace and goodneſſe vnto ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon to prove, that by Faith in this Text is meant any kind of Faith, is this; becauſe the Corinthians were to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves of any Faith, by the finding whereof in them they might finde a proofe of the efficacie of his Ministery: for that is the end wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> wils them to examine themſelves, <hi>whether they were in the faith,</hi> viz. becauſe thereby they might find it to have bin wrought in them by his Ministery,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.15.</note> for the proofe of Christs power in it. Now not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith, and an historicall Faith were wrought in the Corinthians by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, but a miraculous Faith alſo, as is plaine by the Epistle to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
<pb facs="tcp:8237:14"/>
where doing of miracles, (which were done by a miraculous Faith) is ſaid to bee wrought in them, (and therefore it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly wrought in the Corinthians) by the hearing of the Gospell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2.5.</note> or by the <hi>hearing of Faith preached.</hi> So that Christ being in the Corinthians by an historicall, and a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Faith, as well as by a ſaving, though not in the ſame manner, nor to the ſame end; and the finding of an historicall Faith and a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, being a good argument to prove the efficacie of <hi>Pauls</hi> Ministery among them; therefore doe J thinke, (ſaving other mens better iudgements, vpon better proofes) that the Faith whereof the Corinthian Chriſtians were to examine themſelves, was any kind of Faith, an historicall, and miraculous, as well as a ſaving Faith; and the rather, becauſe by all three kinds a greater proofe will be gained for Christs power in <hi>Paul,</hi> and for the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of his Apostleſhip thereby, then by any one alone, though it were a ſaving faith.

               <p>The points obſerveable out of the coherence and drift of the Apostle, have already beene touched. That which is to be collected out of the words as they ſtand by themſelves, is but one ſentence, or propoſition, and conſequently but one Doctrine; for it is but an exhortation to one Duty; and that one Duty is exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; trying themſelves concerning their Faith; whence the Doctrine of the Text, (ſpeaking according to the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and particular both perſons and matter) is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly thus:
<hi>The Corinthian Chriſtians muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and prove themſelves, whether they be in the Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as the Exhortation was not written for them onely, although it were written to them onely, therfore from the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> to the <hi>Theſis,</hi> from the particular to the generall, I rayſe and propound the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thus:

               <p>This Doctrine ſhall bee the Subiect of the enſuing Treatiſe, whereunto J have added this Preface, even this Diſcourſe vpon the opening of that Text, vpon which it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded, not onely for an Introduction vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Treatiſe; but for a maine pillar and proofe of the Doctrine, to which I perſwade in the Booke it ſelfe.</p>

            <p>To teach ſome Chriſtians this Triall, and to perſwade them to the practice thereof, I haue heretofore preached the point, for the private good of a few, and becauſe the preaching of it was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, to the profit of many that heard it: therefore haue I written a Treatiſe of it, for the common good of all that can reade.</p>
            <p>Now, foraſmuch as Method is both a good ornament to a Book, and a great light thereunto: not onely for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of the Author to write more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly: but alſo for the teaching of the Reader to underſtand and remember more readily: therefore haue I thought good alſo, before I goe on to the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of the point intended, to make known that maner, and order of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the point in proofe, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to my ſelfe in the proſecuting thereof: and my Methode (by Gods aſsiſtance) shall be this:</p>

            <p>The firſt Booke shall be an Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Triall of Faith: and the ſecond a Direction thereunto.</p>
            <p>To exhort men to try their Faith, I will alledge certaine Reaſons, grounded on the Word, which may perſwade them thereunto: and anſwer ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, that may be brought, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them from it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons to perſwade Chriſtians to try their Faith, shall bee referred to three heads. Firſt, the Neceſsity, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Equity, and thirdly, the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie or benefit of this Triall.</p>
            <p>The Neceſsity of the tryall of our Faith, shall be shewed in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by ſeuen Reaſons: and each Reaſon shal be diſtinguished into a ſeuerall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the ſame Chapter.</p>
            <p>The Equity shall bee declared in the ſecond Chapter, by two Reaſons: which ſhall bee diuided likewiſe into two Sections.</p>
            <p>The Vtilitie, or profit of this Tryall of Faith, shall be manifeſted in the third
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8237:19"/>
Chapter, by three Reaſons: which shall be ſevered likewiſe, by three particular Sections.</p>
            <p>The Obiections that may be brought, to diſſwade Chriſtians from the tryall of their Faith, shall be reduced to three Heads likewiſe: firſt, the Needleſneſſe: ſecondly, the Inconveniency: and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Impoſsibility of this tryall of Faith.</p>
            <p>The ſuppoſed Needleſneſſe shall bee anſwered in the fourth Chapter: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in shall be contained three Obiections: each Obiection, with the anſwer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, being diſtinguished into ſeverall Sections.</p>
            <p>The deemed Inconveniencie of it shall bee anſwered in the fift Chapter: wherein shall bee comprehended two Obiections, with the anſwer therunto in two Sections.</p>
            <p>The imagined Impoſsibility alſo, that Chriſtians shal ever be able to try their Faith, shall bee anſwered in the ſixt Chapter: wherein shall bee placed two Obiections; each, with the anſwere thereunto, being ſevered likewiſe by two particular Sections.</p>
            <p>Of the particular diſpoſition of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Booke, I will ſpeake diſtinctly,

when I come unto it.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, let me craue, and obtaine pardon of the learned Reader, for more then ordinary plaineneſſe, in handling the points conteined in the firſt Booke: and of the Reader that is not ſo learned, for ſome difficulty, that he shall find, to underſtand the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the ſecond Booke. I would haue neither of them diſcouraged, from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the whole; becauſe the fault that may be ſuppoſed to be committed in the one, is amended in the other. And the rather am I bold to craue this fauour, becauſe my manner of handling, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the nature of the matter handled in both: ſo that as I could not be plaine, where the matter is difficult; ſo neither was it needfull I should bee difficult, where the matter was plaine.</p>

                     <hi>proue your owne ſelues</hi>: For why ſhould not Chriſtians now examine themſelues whether they bee in the Faith; as well as Chriſts Diſciples, and the Chriſtian <hi>Corinthians</hi> did in thoſe dayes?</p>
                  <p>If any obiect againſt the firſt proofe,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> that it is not pertinent, becauſe it ſpeakes of a miraculous Faith, whereas the point to bee prooued by it, is touching a ſauing Faith:</p>

ſhall be drowned in perdition and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction both of Soule and Body for ever, which is the ſecond death.</p>
                  <p>Or if any chance to reply vpon the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofe, out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> that it is not ſufficient, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not a command: but an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely; or if it bee a commandement, yet it is but a particular precept to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> onely, and given to them but upon a ſpeciall occaſion.</p>
                  <p>I anſwere: Firſt there is no difference in reſpect of obedience betwixt an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to a Morall religious Chriſtian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (ſuch as this is) and a flat precept, that directly commands the practiſe of it, as appeares by this inſtance.

Apoſtle in exhorting to the Duty, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by requeſt, rather then by Precept, ſhould rather gaine obedience; in as much as it is to be conceived, that therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth exhort, and not command; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had not authoritie (as an Apoſtle) to command: but becauſe hee hoped,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8.</note> by that kinde manner of exhorting, he ſhould the ſooner perſwade them to obey the matter of the exhortation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwere, touching the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the obiection, that it is to as little purpoſe as, the former; becauſe though the exhortation were written to them: yet was it not written for them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which I proue; firſt, becauſe it was not written to them as they were <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> but as they were Chriſtians: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may the dutie concerne all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that are Chriſtians like themſelves.

                     <p>It is neceſſarie for Chriſtians, to examine themſelues, whether they be in the Faith:<label type="milestone">

                  </argument>
                  <p>The reaſon is good. Becauſe without this Tryall, any faith may be taken for a ſaving faith: an Hiſtoricall, for a ſaving faith; yea, a falſe faith, for a true. Indeed if euery faith were a ſaving, then were it ſufficient to ſalvation to haue ſome faith, for in having ſome faith, hee muſt bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to haue the ſaving faith; and therefore for a man to examine himſelfe, whether he had a ſaving faith, were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: as long as he had any faith; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery faith is not a ſauing faith (as ſhall bee proved God willing by and by) therefore it is neceſſary for Chriſtians to examine themſelues whether they haue a ſaving Faith.</p>
                  <p>And that every faith is not a ſaving faith, I proue thus:</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, there was in the Churches of Chriſt in the Apoſtles time a miraculous faith, which many had, that neuer were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For the Holy Ghoſt affirmeth, that

                  <p>But though there were no more kindes of faith then one, and that faith were only a ſaving faith: yet if every man had a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, or were ſure to haue it, before he dyed: they might ſhift well enough as they thinke; let us therefore take uiew of

                  <p>The Reaſon is good, becauſe charity begins at home, and every man ought every way to have as much care of his owne Faith and ſalvation, as any other particular man whatſoever. Therefore if another man, for my good, try my Faith, and examine me concerning my

                  <p>Secondly, the Reaſon is good, becauſe if another man try my faith, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine me concerning the ſame, it will be either great ſhame, or ſmall credit to me, according as after triall, I am found to haue it, or to be without it, to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to render a reaſon of it, or not to bee able: to the end then that we may haue credit, by being able to render a reaſon of our faith, wee muſt try our ſelues, whether we haue faith, and are able to render a reaſon of it, for our owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and the good of others.</p>
                  <p>And that Chriſtians ought to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to make anſwere to them, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them concerning their faith, is plaine by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>; where hee wils the Chriſtian Iewes that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the faith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.</note> 
                     <hi>to bee alwayes readie to giue an anſwer to every man that asked them a reaſon, of the hope that is in them.</hi> Whence I thus argue:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſtians in S. <hi>Peters</hi> daies, were asked a reaſon of their faith; therefore in theſe daies, they may bee asked the ſame queſtion: Pariſhioners of their Miniſters, children of their parents, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

of their maſters, ſcholers of their Tutors, yea one Chriſtian neighbour of another, when they meet together for Chriſtian conference.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſtians in thoſe dayes, beeing asked a reaſon of their faith, were to be readie to render a reaſon of it: therfore in theſe daies alſo, they muſt bee readie to render a reaſon of thair faith, when it is asked them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſtians then, could not bee ready to render a reaſon of their faith, except they firſt knew themſelues able to doe it: therfore Chriſtians now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be readie, to render a reaſon of their faith, except they firſt know themſelues able to doe it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the laſt place, Chriſtians then, could not know, they were able to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a reaſon of their faith, except firſt they examined themſelves concerning their faith, and their abilitie to render a reaſon thereof: no more can Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now. So that the faith, and hope of Chriſtians, being the ſame now, which then it was, the cauſes of rendring a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our faith and hope now, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame which then they were; (namely, the glory of God, the profite and encouragement of others, and the

So then, it being dangerous to be ſeduced from the true faith, to a falſe: the tryall of Heretikes by teaching falſe doctrine, being a meanes to ſeduce, and the tryall

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE reaſon is good, becauſe there is in the Word, as much directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to try our faith, as to try any other grace whatſoever.

                  <p>That Chriſtians muſt examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerning other graces of God in them, I proove by two particulars chiefely: namely, Repentance, and Love.</p>
                  <p>Of Repentance they are to try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; becauſe as there is a true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when in the truth of heart, men reſolve and purpoſe to forſake their ſinnes: <hi>they ceaſe to doe evill; and learne to doe well, and returne to God in a new life:</hi>

                  <p>Chriſtians likewiſe are to try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerning their loue: becauſe as there is a true and unfained loue,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 6. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18.</note> when men loue <hi>in deed and in truth</hi>: ſo is there a

                     <hi>that they would not loue in word and in tongue onely.</hi> The like may bee ſaid of patience and the reſt, ſo that other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God in us, requiring and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our tryall of them; it muſt needs follow, that much more is our ſaving faith worthy of it: and the rather, for the excellency, and neceſsity of it, aboue any other grace, as ſhall be plainely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by and by, in two diſtinct Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the further confirmation of this ſecond Reaſon.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The excellent uſe of faith in Chriſt.</note>No grace is ſo excellent as a ſaving faith. I prove it:</p>

                  <p>I know, God Almighty workes many

                     <hi>or faith without workes.</hi> But they are required either as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations afore-going to diſpoſe them to faith in Chriſt, or as fruits and effects fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſame, the better to try and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the truth of their faith, &amp; the more to aſſure them of the certainty of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by faith.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, by obedience to the Law, wee might haue beene Gods ſervants, which is ſome priviledge: but through faith in Chriſt (the ſonne of God by Nature) we are made the children of God; namely, by grace and Adoption,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of continuance, Love is not ſimply more excellent then a ſaving Faith, becauſe (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) it doth not vtterly ceaſe after this life, but continues as well as Love; which I will make (at leaſt) very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable by this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the body muſt be ſaved as well as the ſoule; but vntill the Day of Iudgement, the body cannot bee ſaved; for till then it lies vnder the dominion of death in the grave; therefore at leaſt till then, the ſoule doth truſt in Chriſt, for that part of ſalvation, which is the redemption of the body, though it ſelf be in heaven.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23.</note> For the act of Faith, which is truſt in Chriſt that he will ſave the ſoule, doth ceaſe with this life; for there is no uſe of

of heaven by that right, whereby wee claime it as an inheritance, wee claime our inheritance as heires, we are heires as adopted ſonnes, and wee are adopted ſonnes by faith only) but Love is onely our rent, ſuit, and ſervice that we owe to God, in all duty of thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe for the glory of heaven, which in this life wee beleeved by faith in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe ſome care not for pearls, and many eſteeme not a thing for the dignity of it, or becauſe it is excellent; but for the need thereof, becauſe they cannot be without it: therefore let vs take a little view of the neceſsity of a faving faith, that thereby wee may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne how uſefull and profitable it will be for us, to have a ſaving faith, and conſequently to try it, to the end I may make good alſo the ſecond Propoſition, which is, that</p>
                  <p>No grace of God is ſo neceſſarie, as a ſaving Faith.</p>
                  <p>I proove it, 1. becauſe no grace is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, namely,<note place="margin">The neceſſary uſe of a ſaving faith. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.6, 1.</note> unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without a ſaving faith; for <hi>without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God,</hi> in any thing we have or do.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>So that I may ſafely conclude, that as of all the lights that God created, and ſet in the Firmament of Heaven, for the benefit of men vpon earth, none was ſo excellent as the Sunne, none ſo neceſſary as it: ſo of all the graces and vertuous qualities, which the holy Ghoſt breaths into the ſoules of Chriſtians here on earth, to prepare them for happineſſe in heaven, none is ſo excellent as a ſaving faith, none ſo neceſſarie as it.</p>
                  <p>And thus much haue I thought good to adde of the dignitie, and neceſsitie of a ſaving faith, above other graces; not to take from them any thing that is their due: (for they all are excellent, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie in their ſeverall kindes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeverall ends, and uſes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them by God, the authour of them) nor yet to give unto faith, any right that is not due unto it; as to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the act of faith, which is belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt, any merit of ſalvation.

                  <p n="3">3. Though they could perfectly ſay and underſtand their Creed, as they pretend, yet were not this ſufficient for their ſalvation.

                  <p n="4">4. Though we could ſay the Creed, and underſtand it, yet were not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſalvation. Firſt, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſaying nor the underſtanding of it, are the act of faith whereby wee are ſaved; but onely a relying, or reſting upon, and truſting unto Chriſt (that is) to the merits of his death, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

for ſalvation. Secondly, becauſe with the moſt it is taken for no more then beleeving, that there is forgivenes of ſinnes to be had, and life everlaſting, which the very divels know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
                  <p>I grant, that to ſay the Creed is good, and to underſtand it is better; the one is a helpe to the other, and both are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances to a ſaving faith: but yet with the heart to beleeve in Chriſt, is to have a ſaving faith; and not to ſay with the tongue, I beleeve in Chriſt. for what though a man did with his lippes ſay never ſo confidently, (which out of a mans underſtanding, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and memory being well catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and taught to ſay ſo, he may doe) With all my heart, and ſoule, I reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, for grace and glory; to him I truſt for the remiſsion of my ſinnes, the reſurrection of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and for eternall life in heaven: yet though he ſay all this with his lippes, and underſtand what he ſayes, yet if he doe not ſo indeed, with his heart, and in truth before God, (his conſcience bearing him witnes in the holy Ghoſt, that hee doth really, actually, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely from a broken heart, and heavy

                  <p>Indeed if wee heare a Chriſtian ſay ſo, and profeſſe ſo, we are bound in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charitie to beleeve him, and to perſwade our ſelues that hee hath a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith indeed, and is one of Gods deare children, and a member of Ieſus Chriſt; for wee can know nothing to the contrarie; eſpecially, if his life and converſation be anſwerable to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and profeſsion: but for all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion with the tongue, and ſaying the Creed with the lips, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible but that ſuch a man (not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it of any one particular perſon, but indefinitely of any ſuch man) I ſay, it is not impoſsible; but for all this ſuch a man may before the Lord, and in his ſight bee no true beleever indeed, nor have a true ſaving Faith: except it were true, that there were no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in the Church, who like the Scribes and Phariſes,<note place="margin">

                  <p>I anſwere; firſt, it is true,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> that all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould try and examine their Pariſhioners concerning their Faith and Religion, and labour to know it,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5.</note> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before they come to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and I would to God all Miniſters would make conſcience of this dutie: but it is as true, that al Miniſters wil not take this paines with their people, and ſo thoſe people that are deſtitute of ſuch Miniſters, muſt take the paines to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves, if they will have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, many of theſe obiectors, that with ſuch colours would cover their naked careleſneſſe of their owne ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8237:49"/>
live under Miniſters that would faine take the paines to examine them in matters of Religion, and in the points of their Chriſtian Faith: but they will not ſuffer them, they will count them buſie fellowes for it, and will them to let them alone. For ordinarily the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſort wil be afraid to be catechized, &amp; the elder ſort aſhamed: though I haue beene an eye-witneſſe where both yong and old, men and women, meane and Right Worſhipfull, Maſters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Parents and Children, have in the open Congregation beene catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and queſtioned of their Chriſtian Faith, where they have anſwered rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and diſcreetly, to the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their Miniſter, their owne great credit, and the encouragement of the hearers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, though it were true, that all Miniſters were willing and able, cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and painefull, in trying their people, and examining them concerning the Grounds of Chriſtian Religion; yet will it not follow thereupon, that therefore Chriſtians need not to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Firſt, becauſe it is evident by the exhortation of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.</note> that every man <hi>muſt examine himſelfe before he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8237:49"/>
eate of the Bread, and drinke of the Wine of the Lords Table</hi>; whether his Miniſter doe examine him or no. For there is no ſuch caution or limitation intended or expreſſed. So that becauſe it muſt abſolutely be done, then at leaſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it needfull he ſhould try his faith at other times alſo. Secondly, though it be the duty of every Miniſter to pray for his people, and to edifie them: yet it is the duty of every Chriſtian <hi>to pray for himſelfe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iude <hi>20.</hi> ver.</note> and to edifie himſelfe <hi>in his moſt holy Faith.</hi> Thirdly, becauſe we are better able to know &amp; feele the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or ſtrength of our owne faith, then the Miniſter can: and therefore beeing more privy to it, wee are more fit to ſearch, and try our owne faith, then he can be. Fourthly, becauſe by our priuate and ſecret tryall of our owne faith, and communing with our owne hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, we may be made the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to anſwere the Miniſter when hee ſhall try our faith, and examine us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. Fifthly and laſtly, becauſe in other caſes wee will not bee ſatisfied with other mens tryals, of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the world. For though when one payes us money in gold, and we ſee him weigh it before our faces: yet will

we uſually take the Scales in our owne hands, and weigh it our ſelves; which becauſe we doe, if not out of diſtruſt of another man: yet at leaſt out of more truſt in our ſelves then another, and out of care that we be not beguiled: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould wee our ſelves, uſe tryall of our ſelves, and of our own faith, though not out of diſtruſt of the Miniſters care, yet at leaſt out of care of our owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

                  <p>I Anſwere: Firſt, though it be true,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> that they which have not a ſaving faith, may by examination come to finde that they have it not: (for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and event of tryall is knowledge) yet it is not true, that their finding of

themſelves not to haue faith, will doe them any hurt in generall, or that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed hurt in ſpeciall, which is to drive them to deſpaire. In generall it will do them no harme, but good; becauſe by conſidering the danger of wanting faith, and the benefit of having it, they may be perſwaded to bee carefull in the uſe of the meanes to get it. In ſpeciall it will not doe them that harme that is pretended, namely, to drive them to deſpaire; becauſe deſpaire properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is of two ſorts, neither of which they need to feare.</p>
                  <p>The firſt kinde of deſpaire is of thoſe, who having once had a ſaving faith, and felt the comforts thereof, which are peace,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now this kinde of deſpaire the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectors need not feare, becauſe it is of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8237:51"/>
thoſe that haue a ſaving faith; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the obiection, is of thoſe that have it not, and are found not to have it. and beſides, neither doth it befall all the Elect, but ſuch only, as through ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie are overtaken with ſome grieuous ſinne, after their effectuall calling; nor (if it did befall them all) doe they liue and dye in it; becauſe before they dye, they are comforted againe with the Helmet <hi>of the hope of their ſalvation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.13.</note> as in the example of <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond kinde of deſpaire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly taken, is a perſwaſion that ſome have, whereby they are aſſured that they are Reprobates, and caſt away from Gods favour: that there is no way with them but one, which is Hell, nor any mercy with God for them: to which perſwaſion they come through Satans malice, to whom they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over by God in this life, to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in ſoule for the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or ſome other grievous ſinnes fearefully committed, and not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This kinde of deſpaire the obiectors need not ſo much to feare: firſt, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t is peculiar to reprobates onely, ſuch as were <hi>Cain, Iudas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi>: but to want
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8237:52"/>
a ſaving faith, or to be found without it, is not peculiar to Reprobates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was a time when the elect themſelves had not a ſaving Faith; namely, before they were effectually called. Secondly, they need not ſo much to feare this kinde of deſpaire, becauſe of one Reprobate that dyes in this deſpaire and torment of conſcience, there be millions that dye in preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mercy, without ſenſe of ſinne, or puniſhment: the reaſon whereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Satan (who knowes he hath time little enough in this life to draw men to ſinne, and long enough after this life to torment them for it) doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordinarily reſerve the tormenting of ſinners till the Day of Iudgement, and till they be in Hell; leſt if he ſhould deale ſo roughly with all ſinners in this world, they might being ſo pincht with terrours, ſeeke after the meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31.2.38.</note> as did the Iaylor, and the Iewes, and the rather, becauſe the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods mercy, without the worke of Gods grace in our hearts, is a fitte meanes to feede men fat to the day of ſlaughter, in aſmuch as it is a meanes to make men careleſſe of repenting and beleeving in Chriſt,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8237:52"/>
whereby they may come to be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Indeed thoſe that make this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, may by examination finde they want a ſaving Faith, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this want, may be a meanes to bring them to a two-fold kinde of deſpaire, improperly ſo called; for they may bee brought to ſome anguiſh of minde, and trouble of conſcience, becauſe they haue been ſo long without ſo neceſſarie a grace, and ſo long care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of getting it; yea, they may bee brought to a diſtruſt in themſelves that ever they ſhall bee able, by any goodneſſe or righteouſneſſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to ſave themſelves, to which when men are brought, they may bee ſaid in ſome ſenſe to deſpaire, (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after the manner of men.) But they neede not feare either of theſe kindes of deſpaire; becauſe every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt thus deſpaire in himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee can be fit to truſt in Chriſt for ſalvation, or to hunger and thirſt after righteouſnes by him, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To this Obiection, I anſwer, that though it were true, which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, namely, that if they ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves, whether they had a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8237:53"/>
ſaving faith; by examination find they had it not, and by finding they had it not, bee driven to deſpaire: yet are they no whit in worſe caſe before God, nor are they neerer to damnation, for finding themſelves not to have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, then for not having faith, though they know not that they want it. For though they come not in this life to deſpaire, becauſe they are ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their minds, that they know not that they want a ſaving faith, and ſo hardened in their hearts, that they feele not the danger of that want, and ſo fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their conſciences, that are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with neither: yet in another life ſhall they certainly come to deſpaire utterly, and for ever of ſalvation: yea, they ſhall come to that which is worſe then deſpaire, namely, Damnation it ſelfe, for not having faith, and for bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careleſſe to get it: ſpecially if they have lived in the cleare light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, which theſe cavillers, and moſt people have done, that now live in theſe dayes, and in the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>; ſo that there is no reaſon in the world, why Chriſtians ſhould put off the practice of ſo neceſſary a duty, as is the tryall of our faith, upon a needleſſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8237:53"/>
feare of I know not what deſpaire.</p>
                  <p>For is it not a fooliſh thing,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> for a ſick man that is ready to die, to be of ſo pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, and froward a mind, that by no meanes the Phiſicians muſt looke on his water, nor feele his Pulſes? leſt hee diſcerne thereby, that there is no way with him but one, which is death? nor muſt he tell him how deadly ſicke hee is, leſt he be troubled, and offended at it; and ſo he dies ſuddenly, without ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his heart in order unto God, by faith and repentance; or putting his houſe in order to the world by making his Will? even it is as fooliſh, yea a more fooliſh thing it is for a Chriſtian, to have a perſwaſion hee hath a ſaving faith, when indeed he hath it not; but he will not ſuffer his Miniſter to examine him, nor will he examine himſelfe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he have it or no, leſt happely it might be found hee had it not indeed: nor will he have his Miniſter or his owne conſcience to tell him he hath it not; leſt (forſooth) hee bee troubled in conſcience about it; and ſo on a ſudden he dies ſecurely in preſumption of faith and ſalvation, and is caſt into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Wherefore ſuch Obiectors ſhould learne to feare Hell, rather then

Deſpaire, infidelitie, and careleſneſſe of ſalvation, that are ſinnes themſelves more then Deſpaire, which is but a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſinne: and then they need feare neither Deſpaire nor Hell; if by feeling the want of faith, they labour diligently in the uſe of the meanes to get it, as they would doe for a worldly commodity of pleaſure, profit, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that they delighted in, and had not to enioy.</p>

                  <p>So that as long as rhe fault is not in the tryall it ſelfe, but in the perſon that tryes his faith, namely, that he hath not that which he thought he had: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need not true Chriſtians that have this faith indeed, be diſheartened from this tryall, upon a ſuppoſition of this inconvenience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:8237:55"/>Neither in truth need thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that have not a ſaving faith, for that reaſon feare to examine themſelves concerning it, becauſe the doubting whether or no, they have faith; and the knowledge that they have not this faith, wherof they try themſelves, that may come to them by their tryall, ſhall be no inconvenience to them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a benefit and conveniencie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe knowing the want of it, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the danger of that want, they may thereby be moved to ſeeke for it, in the uſe of the meanes, and to obtaine it.</p>
                  <p>That which I have ſaid of the unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood that any ſuch inconvenience ſhal enſue upon the tryal of the faith of true Chriſtians, namely, that they ſhall not come thereby to doubt they had it not, or not to know they ever had it, ſhall be amplified by a familiar compariſon.</p>
                  <p>There is a piece of Land,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> unto which two men lay claime, the one hath a true title by Law, as appeares by his ancient Deeds, and Evidences; and the other thinkes he hath a good title, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is in poſſeſsion, or becauſe ſome bodie hath told him ſo: if the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the land bee called in queſtion to be tryed before the Iudge of Aſsiſe, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8237:56"/>
to bee determined whoſe it is of right, and by Law: it may come to paſſe upon tryall and iudgement, that hee who thought hee had a good Title (but had it not in deede) may eaſily come to doubt of the Title hee thought he had; yea, certainly to know that it was ſtarke naught: and therefore no marvell if hee bee loth to have his Title queſtioned: but it cannot fall out upon tryall and iudgement, that hee, who had trve right thereunto by his Deeds and Evidences, ſhould come to doubt whether his claime were good: for hee ſhall rather thereby come to know and bee aſſured that it was good in deed.</p>
                  <p>In like manner there is a heavenly inheritance, to which all that are in the Church doe lay claime; ſome thinke they have a good title to it, becauſe by name they are Chriſtians, by profeſsion they are Beleevers, and by Baptiſm they are members of the Church; becauſe they haue a beliefe of the Goſpell, they have been at the Lords Table, and are in poſſeſsion of a preſumption at leaſt of ſalvation: And there bee other, that by the evidence of the Word &amp; Spirit doe know, that they are ſons, &amp; heires with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8237:56"/>
Chriſt, namely, by the witneſſe of the Spirit, in their Adoption; and by the worke of the Spirit in their Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If each of theſe try their title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it may come to paſſe upon the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that he who had but a beliefe of the Goſpell, and therevpon preſumed hee had a ſaving Faith, and intereſt to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, may not onely come to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever hee had a ſaving faith or no; but alſo come certainly to know hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had it, nor never had any iuſt cauſe to perſwade himſelfe of ſalvation, and therefore no marvell if ſuch a one bee loth to try his faith. Whereas on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, hee that had a ſaving faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, cannot bee brought by that tryall, to doubt whether his faith were a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith indeed or not; but rather certainly to know he had it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no marvell if he be willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to try his faith. So that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this colourable pretence all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have reaſon to try their faith, thoſe that thinke they have it, but have it not indeed; to the end they may know they have it not, and ſo labour to get it: and thoſe that have it, to the end they may more certainly know they have it, and ſo labor more to ſtrengthen it, &amp; to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8237:57"/>

                  </argument>
                  <p>TO this I anſwere: 1. that though it be true that many Lay people, and the moſt of ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ſimple and ignorant (the more

is the pitie) yet are not all ſo: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this obiection (if there were any ſound reaſon in it) can but excuſe ſuch onely, whereas under colour of it, all Lay-people, and ordinary Chriſtians, may ſeeme to be freed from trying their faith, and examining themſelves whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have a ſaving Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though all were ſo ignorant &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as it is pretended in the obiection, yet if they would uſe the meanes with that little wit and underſtanding they have, and beat their braines to learne to try their Faith, as well as they doe to try the goodnes or badneſſe of worldly commodities, and to underſtand which are wares vendible, or refuſe, and out of ſale: they might in time, by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the uſe of the meanes, come to ſight and knowledge in the one, as well as in the other; and thereby to try the one, as well as the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But put caſe they could not by the uſing their naturall wit, come to know how to try their Faith, yet might they learne by the light of the Word which God hath given them, to <hi>bee a Lanthorne to their wayes,</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Suppoſe they ſhould alledge that the Word of God, and the Goſpel were hard and darke, and themſelves blinde and ignorant, to underſtand the Rules which it doth propound to Chriſtians for that end, to try their faith thereby, yet hath God in his wiſedome, bounty and goodnes, given us many learned and godly Miniſters, to whom they may have recourſe to inſtruct and direct them, in this tryall of their Faith, either by publike preaching, or private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: and the rather, ſeeing in caſe they have not skill enough to know the goodnes of their Gold, they will not ſticke to goe to the Goldſmiths to tell them whether it want of the purity or waight thereof.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Ordinary Christians have trades and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations <label type="milestone">

                  </argument>
                  <p>I anſwere: Firſt, that it may be, ſome who make this obiection, or approve it, have no Callings at all or Trades to follow, as they that live onely vpon V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and therefore they can make no ſuch plea for themſelves for hauing no buſineſſe in any occupation to take vp their time; they may have time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to employ in trying their faith, and examining it whether it be a ſaving Faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, others there bee that have bad trades and courſes of life to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in; as Players and Gameſters, therefore they cannot ſhare in the ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſe pretended in this obiection, to ſhift off the tryall of their faith: for they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8237:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are to ſpend no time at all in evill Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and therfore muſt they give them ouer, which when they doe, then they ſhall have time enough, to try their faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thoſe that have lawfull Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Trades to follow, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themſelves by, are not ſo ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in time: but that notwithſtanding them, they may ſpare ſome, for the trying of their fairh. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſpare ſome time for ſleepe, for eating and drinking, and for recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, notwithſtanding all the imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Trades; and why then ſhould they not ſpare ſome time from them, as willingly, for ſo holy a worke as the tryall of our faith? 2. Becauſe they do not ſpend all their time in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelling of ware, in receiving and paying of money; but ſome time they take to caſt vp their debt-bookes, &amp; the wares in their ſhoppes, to the end they may ſee how they thriue, or goe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; &amp; why then may they not ſpend ſome time to caſt vp the booke of their conſciences, and their reckonings with God, to ſee how they grow, or thriue in grace, and in the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:8237:60"/>Fourthly, graunt that Tradesmen, were unwilling and loth to ſpare from their trades any time for holy and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall buſineſſes; yet muſt they ſpare it by reaſon of the neceſsitie of the duty, and benefit that comes by the practice therof, as well as they can and will ſpare time from their ſleepe and foode, when they be young; to lay vp againſt a rainy day (as they ſay) and to keep them when they are old: and if they doe not, they cannot bee excuſed before God by this plea of their calling: no more then they were excuſed from comming to the wedding of the Kings Son by pleading that they had Farmes to ſee,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 22.5.</note> and Oxen to try, nor can they bee iuſtified herein upon this ground, any more then <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> was iuſtified for not hearing Chriſts Sermon,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 10.41, 42.</note> by pleading that ſhee was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at the ſame time, in dreſsing Chriſts dinner.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, though Chriſtians could have no time, all the weeke long in the working dayes of it, to try their faith, yet hath God appointed a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day every weeke that muſt be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from common buſineſſe of our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary calling, and muſt be ſpent in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and holy workes (ſuch as is the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8237:61"/>
tryall of our faith) and therefore let Chriſtians ſet apart ſome time of that day, for the examining themſelves touching their faith and repentance, and to commune with their own hearts of theſe things by meditation, and with God by Prayer, for direction from his Spirit in this examination.</p>
                  <p>By this which hath been briefely ſaid touching the obiections againſt the practiſe of this duty, and anſwers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, two things may bee obſerved. 1. That howſoever many ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are hardly able to perſwade Chriſtians to the practice of this dutie of examining themſelves whether they be in the Faith or no: yet ſlender pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and colours of truth are able to diſſwade them from the doing of it, and they will ſuffer themſelves to bee ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them. 2. We may obſerve, that notwithſtanding all the obiections, which ignorant and carnall men may deuiſe, to nouzle them in careleſneſſe of trying their faith, and to keepe them from diligence in this tryall: yet this remaines a firme truth of God, and a neceſſarie Chriſtian duty; that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, men and women of yeeres and diſcretion, muſt try their faith, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8237:61"/>
themſelves, whether they have a ſaving faith, or no. What remaines but that with ſo much the more diligence and conſcience, they addreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to doe it accordingly; ſeeing there bee ſo many ſound arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to it: and not one ſound reaſon to diſſwade them from it?</p>
                  <p>And ſo I proceed to the ſecond Booke of this Treatiſe, and therein to ſet down directions for this tryall: From the proofe of this, that Chriſtians are to try their Faith, to ſhew how they are to try it. From this, that they muſt: to this how they may: from the matter to the maner; and from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the Rules of Tryall.</p>

            <p>For this purpoſe, I will cite Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans into the Court of conſcience, and propound vnto them certaine queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and interrogatories, concerning a ſaving faith: upon which examining themſelves diligently and impartially; they may diſcover this truth, whether or no they have a ſaving faith.</p>
            <p>The interrogatories I purpoſe to propound, are certaine Rules and directions, grounded on the Word of God, and appertaining to the nature and uſe, properties and effects of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith; and they are theſe eight in number:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Examine thy ſelfe, whether or no thou underſtand, what faith in Chriſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8237:63"/>
is, and wherein the nature thereof doth conſiſt, namely, as it doth iuſtifie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When thou underſtandeſt what manner of grace it is, then enquire whether or no thou knoweſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveſt the uſe, and end of it, namely, that it is ordained by God, to ſave, and iuſtifie ſinners.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If thou underſtand the uſe and end of faith in Chriſt; then try whether or no thou conceive rightly, of the manner how faith doth ſave and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After this, make proofe whether thou didſt get this faith in Chriſt by the ordinary meanes, by which God uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly workes it in his children.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This being done, enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no thou wert ever rightly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and duely prepared to beleeve in Chriſt, namely, by the worke of other gifts of the Spirit, that goe before it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When thou haſt found this, make trial, whether or no thou find in thy ſelf thy faith to be lively, and effectuall, to the ſanctifying of thy heart, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of thy life more and more; and to the cauſing of thee to bring foorth fruites beſeeming new obedience.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Examine thy ſelfe whether or no,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8237:64"/>
thou labour in the uſe of the meanes, for the comforts of a ſaving faith, namely, to feele them in thy ſelfe, and to to bee affected with them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In the laſt place make tryal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no, thou uſe the meanes, to ſtrengthen thy faith, and to grow in a greater meaſure thereof.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Chap. 1.</note>CHAP. I. Of the Definition of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, or of faith in Christ.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Faith is a grace of God, whereby a ſinner doth truſt vnto Ieſus Chriſt, for heavenly and eternall bleſſedneſſe, according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN this definition, or deſcription, two things generally are to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the thing that is defined or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the nature of it, namely, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, or faith in Chriſt, contained in the firſt word of the Definition, which is <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that which is ſaid of this faith, or that whereby the nature of this faith is deſcribed, in the reſt of the words following, namely, <hi>a grace of God whereby a ſinner truſts vnto Ieſus Chriſt, for heavenly and eternall bleſſedneſſe, according to the Gospell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:8237:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>By theſe words,<note place="margin">Rule 1.</note> the nature of faith in Chriſt, is deſcribed two waies: gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and ſpecially: for as all other things are defined by a deſcription of their nature; and their nature conſiſts in two points: Firſt, in that part of it, which it hath in common with other things, (as to be a living creature is the <hi>genus,</hi> matter, or common nature of a man, which he hath in common with birds, beaſts, fiſhes, which are living creatures as well as hee.) Secondly, in that part of their nature, which they have proper and peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed from all other creatures, (as to have a reaſonable ſoule, is the <hi>Species,</hi> forme, and particular nature by which man is differenced from all other creatures li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on earth, none wherof are reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures but himſelf.) So is it in my Definition: for in theſe words, <hi>is a grace of God,</hi> is ſet downe the generall nature, or matter of a ſaving faith, which it hath in common with all other graces of God, namely, hope, love, patience, and repentance, which are all graces of God, as well as faith in Chriſt. And the other words of the Definition, <hi>whereby a ſinner truſts unto Chriſt, for heavenly and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8237:66"/>
eternall bleſſedneſſe, according to the Goſpell,</hi> do declare the form or ſpeciall nature of a ſaving faith, whereby it is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from all other graces of God whatſoever; by none whereof we truſt in Chriſt for this bleſſedneſſe, but by faith onely; wherein wee may further diſcover, 1. the ſubiect perſon that truſts for this bleſſedneſſe, namely, a <hi>ſinner</hi>: 2. the action of this habit of faith, namely, <hi>truſt unto</hi>: Thirdly, the obiect of that action, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in whom faith truſts, namely, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi>: 4. the end of this faith or tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, namely, <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi>; deſcribed by two adiuncts, <hi>heavenly and eternall:</hi> and laſtly, the ground or warrant of this truſting in Chriſt for this bleſſedneſſe, namely, the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Definition I will propound and confirme, to the end I may both be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the meaning, as alſo belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the truth thereof. And that which I ſhall deliver touching the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and confirmation thereof, ſhal be diſtinguiſhed into ſeverall Sections, according to the ſeverall words therof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">§. 1. Faith</note>The firſt word of the Definition is <hi>faith,</hi> which ſhewes, what it is, that is ſpoken of in the Definition; and what
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8237:66"/>
is deſcribed: now concerning the word <hi>faith,</hi> or the faith I doe define therein, I would have the Reader to know and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I doe not define every faith: for I doe not define that which is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the Word in generall, or of the Goſpell in ſpeciall, called an hiſtoricall faith, whereby men aſſent to the truth of all the written Word; for this will not ſave them that have it:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13.</note> but the faith that I define, is a ſaving faith, becauſe it will ſave them that have it:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11.</note> nor yet do I define here, that faith that was in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> while for a time he ſtood in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and whereby he was to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for continuance in that ſtate: for that was but a gift belonging to his nature, to make him meet to abide in happineſſe here on earth: but this is a ſupernaturall grace given to men, to make them fit for eternall happineſſe in heaven. Neither doe I here define the faith, that is commanded in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Levit.</note> which is a truſt in God as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Lord, Creatour and preſerver of mankind, for the obtaining of that life, that is promiſed to them that can perfectly obey it. For that is truſt in God without a Mediator, but this is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8237:67"/>
with and by one: that is a condition of the covenant of workes, and but a branch of it too; but this is the ſole and whole condition of the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in my Definition I doe not deſcribe the whole nature of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, in al the particulars thereof, and in every reſpect, namely, as it ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies our hearts, and ſtirres us up to new obedience; or as it pacifies our conſciences, and works in us ſpirituall comforts in the greateſt calamities: but in this Definition I ſo farre onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the nature of faith in Chriſt, namely, as it ſaves and iuſtifies us, and as it is the condition, required on our part, to make us perſons capable of ſalvation, by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">§ 2. is a grace of God,</note>The next words of the Definition to be expounded are theſe, <hi>is a grace of God</hi>: by which words, I meane not only that it is God that works this faith in thoſe that are ſaved:<note place="margin">

                  <p>In the third Section follow to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded theſe words, <hi>whereby a ſinner</hi>:<note place="margin">§ 3. whereby a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</note> by which I do not mean indefinitly any ſinner or every ſinner.

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Infants are ſinners, yet (for ought that God hath revealed in the Word) they have not a ſaving faith, becauſe it is wrought by the hearing of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which is never preached to infants.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now followes the act of Faith, wherby we are iuſtified in theſe words, <hi>doth truſt unto</hi>: for the opening &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving whereof, it will bee needfull to ſhew foure things. Firſt, what is meant by this word, <hi>truſting.</hi> Secondly, that the act of faith whereby wee are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is deſcribed by this word <hi>truſting</hi>; or by other words that ſignifie <hi>truſting.</hi> Thirdly, that God requires <hi>truſt in Chriſt</hi> of all thoſe that ſhall bee ſaved. And fourthly, that hee will accept of <hi>truſt or faith in Chriſt</hi> vnto Iuſtification of them that have it, and doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt. To truſt one, or to truſt unto one, or to put truſt in one, are well underſtood of Engliſh people: they are deſcribed by other words and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8237:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
phraſes, well knowne among vs, as by putting one in truſt with a thing, or putting confidence in a man, for doing ſome thing; our Engliſh language like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe affords vs other words of the ſame ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to reſt, or rely vpon a man, to build vpon him, to depend or caſt a mans ſelfe vpon one for ſomething.</p>
                  <p>To truſt one ordinarily, implyes three things, that will agree with our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe. 1. A knowledge of the party whom we truſt, and of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to doe us ſome good turne, elſe we had no reaſon to truſt him. 2. A beliefe, that he did meane as he ſaid, when hee made the promiſe, &amp; that he was both able and willing to performe it: elſe we would never truſt him. 3. A not uſing of meanes, or a forbearing to take ſome courſe, by our ſelves, or others, to effect that for which wee truſt to another to doe it. (For example) I may truſt a man,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> that hath promiſed to pay mee ſo much money by ſuch a day, if I know him: and if he have promiſed mee to pay it then, and if I beleeue him to bee ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and honeſt, and if I truſt him, I ſhall be careleſſe to goe abroad elſewhere, to get in money to ſerue my turne; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I builded on his word, who I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8237:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perſwaded my ſelfe would not faile me. In like manner, all theſe three are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implyed in a ſaving Faith, and are ſuppoſed to concurre thereunto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man can be ſaid to truſt in Chriſt for ſalvation. Firſt, hee muſt know and beleeve, that God hath promiſed ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that truſt in Chriſt: and that whoſoever truſts in him, ſhall bee ſaved. 2. he muſt ſtedfaſtly beleeve, that God is both willing, and able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. 3. he muſt deny to truſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or to any goodnes in himſelfe, or any other ſave only Chriſt for ſalvation, before he can rely, reſt vpon, or put truſt and confidence in Chriſt for it.</p>
                  <p>I know many Divines uſe other words to expreſſe the nature of the Act of Faith in Chriſt, whereby we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified; as namely, to <hi>apply Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>to lay hold upon Chriſt,</hi> and his benefits, and they are not vnfit, becauſe (as I ſuppoſe) by them they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand an action of the ſoule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſinners intend to honour Chriſt by ſeeking for ſalvation to him alone. But (reſerving reverence to their Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) I thinke the word <hi>truſting,</hi> is both more eaſie to bee underſtood of Engliſhmen; and alſo it doth better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8237:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the nature of that act of Faith, whereby wee are iuſtified; namely, a reſting or relying vpon, a depending or building vpon, a putting truſt or confidence in Chriſt for ſalvation, vpon a knowledge and beliefe that there is no meanes in our ſelves, or any other, to truſt unto for it, but in him onely.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond point propounded in the opening of this word, <hi>truſt,</hi> was to ſhew that the act of Faith, whereby we are iuſtified, is in Scripture often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the word, <hi>truſting,</hi> or by other words that ſignifie as much.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by <hi>truſting,</hi> as where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he <hi>truſted God, and it was counted to him for Righteouſneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3.</note> which was more then bare beleeving God ſaid trve, when hee promiſed to bleſſe him in his ſeede, as ſhall bee prooved hereafter; and where hee ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that <hi>hee knew whom hee had truſted,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.</note> namely, to bring him to Heauen: and likewiſe where he ſaith of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>that if they bee dead with Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8.</note> 
                     <hi>they truſt that they ſhall live with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the act of faith whereby wee are iuſtified, is deſcribed by other words &amp; phraſes,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28.</note> namely, as with the feet of Faith: but all theſe are expounded by beleeving in Chriſt. The two former in the very Verſes &amp; Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quoted: and the latter, which is comming or going to Chriſt, in <hi>Iob.</hi> 6.35. compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. ſo that, by that which I have ſaid, it may evidently appeare, that in the New Teſtament eſpecially, the act of Faith, whereby wee are iuſtified, is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified &amp; expreſſed by truſting in Chriſt,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8237:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or by ſuch words as doe plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe as much.</p>
                  <p>But though we underſtand never ſo well what were meant by truſting to Chriſt; yet if it were not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God, and accepted of him to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, all this were in vaine: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the further opening and proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this part of my definition, I muſt make good theſe two points, which are the two laſt branches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be opened.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third point is, that truſting in Chriſt is commanded of God, to be performed of all thoſe that ſhall bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and this ſhall evidently appeare, becauſe Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.29.</note> 
                     <hi>This is the worke of God, that wee beleeve in him whom hee hath ſent:</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.23.</note> that <hi>this is the commandement of God, that wee beleeve in the name of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And anſwerable to both; <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth that the Apoſtles received Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to preach the Goſpell to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>for the obedience of Faith</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">

word <hi>Truſt</hi>; which is, that truſting in Chriſt, is accepted of God unto iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all that performe it truely; which may evidently appeare, by the many promiſes of God made thereunto in the Goſpell; as namely, where it is promiſed, that they who beleeve in Chriſt, <hi>ſhall not</hi>

                  <p>And I adde theſe words, <hi>according to the Goſpel,</hi> unto my Definition of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith: Firſt, becauſe the Goſpel onely is the proppe and ground of our

faith, by which wee are called to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt; without which it were great preſumption to ſeeke for pardon, and truſt in Chriſt for ſalvation, had not God in the Goſpell commanded us ſo to doe; and promiſed us ſalvation, if we do ſo; and with which it is Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an boldneſſe, and holy confidence, to draw neere to the throne of Grace, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gods Word for our warrant, and incouragement to ſeeke for ſalvation by beleeving in Chriſt, ſeeing the dutie is ſo eaſie that is required of us, the thing ſo excellent that is to be attained unto by beleeving, and the perſon ſo worthy and able to procure it, in whom we truſt for it.</p>
                  <p>I grant, the Law of God, and the whole Bible, are to be beleeved as well as the Goſpell; and the Law commands faith in God, as well as the Goſpell: (though not the ſame faith which the Goſpell doth, as hath beene ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) but no Word is the Goſpell, but the Word of faith; and no Word is the Word of faith, but the promiſe, becauſe it onely teacheth doctrine, concerning the way and meanes of ſalvation; as namely, who ſhall ſave, <hi>viz.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt; and how, <hi>viz.</hi> by his death; and

                  <p>My Definition then containing the true nature of a ſaving faith; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being true, it muſt follow, that all definitions, that deſcribe the nature of it otherwiſe, (that is, not in other words, but in another ſenſe, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other end) muſt needes be falſe and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious.</p>

                  <p>BY the Doctrine of the Papiſts, it ſhall evidently appeare, that all the faith, which they require, to the iuſtifying of a ſinner, is, that hee firmely aſſent to the truth of the Word of God; provided, hee beleeve it to bee true, not becauſe by evidence of reaſon he diſcernes it is true, and underſtands well enough how it may bee true; but upon the bare authority of God onely, who hath revealed and written it.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe I will doe them no wrong, therefore will I cite their owne words; and becauſe it will bee tedious to alledge many teſtimonies, therefore will I content my ſelfe with one, which is the Definition of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> a learned Clarke, a valiant Champion, and a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Pillar of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: his words are theſe:</p>

                        <p>All the faith required of Chriſtians to iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is not onely an aſſent to the truth of all his Word, becauſe God requires more of them then this; namely, to beleeve in Chriſt, or to truſt to the merits of his death and obedience.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>The Reaſon is good, if I can make good theſe three Propoſitions whereon it is grounded, namely, Firſt, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe or truſt in Chriſt is faith. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God requires this truſt in Chriſt, of thoſe that are to be iuſtified.

                        </gap>, which is Faith; but alſo, becauſe to beleeve, or truſt in, or upon Chriſt, is called Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.6, 7.22. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9, 11.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That God requires truſt in Chriſt, which is, reſting and relying on his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits for ſalvation of them that ſhall bee ſaved, needes no proofe here; becauſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8237:76"/>
it hath beene largely declared, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of my Definition of a ſaving faith, to which I referre you.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And that truſting in Chriſt, or truſting to him, or putting truſt and confidence in him, is more then aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the truth of the Goſpel, I prove thus: Truſting to a man is more, then beleeving that he ſaith true; therefore truſting to Chriſt, is more then belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the truth of Gods Word delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſt. The reaſon is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe truſting, is one and the ſame acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in nature, whatſoever the obiect of our truſt be; and beleeving the truth of any ſaying, is one and the ſame in kind, whatſoever the ſaying be, that is belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p>And that truſting a man, is more then beleeving he ſaith true, ſhall be evident by this reaſon; namely, becauſe to aſſent to the truth of a mans word, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve hee ſaith true, is a faith that is common to any ſpeech he utters, be it a truth, or a lye; a promiſe or a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but to truſt a man, is a faith that is proper to that ſpeech which is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe onely. For example: if I tell my neighbour, that I went from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Dover</hi> in one day; and returned home
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8237:76"/>
to <hi>London</hi> againe the next; he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve I ſaid true, and aſſent to the truth of my ſpeech with one kind of faith, and hee may perſwade himſelfe I ſaid truly, and that I did as I ſaid: But if I ſay to him, that to morrow (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) I will give you a piece of gold of twenty ſhillings, to buy you a Bible: in this caſe he may doe more, then onely beleeve I ſaid true, or barely aſſent to the truth of my promiſe; for hee may truſt unto me, and expect to receive it from me, and come to mee the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to demand it, according to my promiſe. So that truſting in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required to iuſtification, as well as beleeving the truth of the Word; and truſting in Chriſt being more then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the truth of Gods Word; it muſt follow then, that the Popiſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of faith is unſound; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no truſt in Chriſt at all, but only an aſſent of the truth of all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Word of God. For the further confutation whereof, this ſhall be my ſecond Argument.</p>

to the truth of Gods Word, becauſe all the faith that he required of his people Iſrael for the obtaining of leſſer benefits, even tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deliverances, and bleſſings, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an aſſent to the truth of Gods promiſe, but a truſting in Gods power, goodneſſe, truth, and mercy, for the obtaining of good things promiſed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>The Reaſon is good, becauſe greater benefits, <hi>viz.</hi> heavenly and ſpirituall, are more excellent then leſſer, <hi>viz.</hi> earthly and temporall: therefore are they not ſo eaſily obtained as they; and therefore for the obtaining of them, the Lord requires at leaſt as much (if not more) faith, as for the obtaining of the other.</p>

                        <hi>trust in the Lord their God,</hi> that ſo they may be eſtabliſhed and proſper: as alſo by 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.20 where the Lord ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the reaſon, why his people Iſrael were not overcome in battel of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garites and others, but that they rather were delivered into the Iſraelites hands; and the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>they prayed to God, &amp; put truſt in him</hi>: which yet may be further cleared, in that where the Lord renders a reaſon, why his wrath fell upon his people Iſrael; the reaſon was, becauſe <hi>they beleeved not in God, and truſted not in his ſalvation.</hi>

Other reaſons I could bring againſt others, (if any other but Papiſts were in this point of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them) to prove, that a ſaving faith is not onely an aſſent to the truth of the Word of God; as namely, becauſe if it were, then 1. reprobates and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Marke</hi> 1.24.</note> that never ſhall be ſaved, may have a ſaving faith; for they may aſſent to the truth of the Word, and beleeve the Goſpel. 2. Then an hiſtoricall faith, and a ſaving faith, ſhould bee all one, which hath beene contradicted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Divines, ancient, and moderne, that have diſtinguiſhed faith into 3. kindes; an hiſtoricall, a miraculous, and a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith: but becauſe I intend here a confutation of the Papiſts onely; and I know theſe reaſons would not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to confute them, who thinke, that reprobates may have any faith, and yet be damned; and who will yeeld no ſuch diſtinctions: therefore will I omit the further proofe and proſecution of thoſe Arguments, and onely content my ſelfe with the two, that I have formerly produced, as beeing ſufficient (in my
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8237:78"/>
iudgement) to confute the Popiſh opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, concerning the nature of their faith, which they require of all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe they endevour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their opinion by colour of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſeemes to countenance it, therefore will it not bee needleſſe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſay a little in anſwer of their Arguments, ſpecially the chiefeſt of them, and the rather, becauſe hereby the truth of that I have ſaid, will be further cleered, the Reader more fully ſatisfied, and the Adverſarie (if hee will reade and beleeue) more ſoundly convinced.</p>
                     <p>The Arguments alledged by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in defence of their Definition of their ſaving faith, are many: but the chiefeſt of them are theſe foure: which being fully anſwered, the reſt will not deſerve any labour about the confuting of them.</p>
                     <p>A ſaving faith, or all the faith that God requires to iuſtification, is onely an aſſent to the truth of the Word. 1.<note place="margin">Arguments of the Papiſts.</note> becauſe it is only in the underſtanding, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. 2.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The generall anſwere to the obiections.</note>The generall anſwere is this: that neither of the foure Arguments doe proue that for which they are alledged. For the point to bee prooved is, that all the faith that God requires of men to iuſtification, is onely an aſſent to the truth of the Word: but the proofe only is, that God requires of them that are to bee iuſtified, that they beleeve his Word, or aſſent to the truth thereof, which I never denyed.

                        <p>This is to as little purpoſe, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; except it could bee prooved, that miracles were onely wrought, for the confirmation of that faith, which is a beliefe of the truth of the Goſpell; and not at all, of that, which is truſt in Chriſt: which is contradicted evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by theſe places of Scripture, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16.20. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.37, 38, 42. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.37.</p>
                        <p>I acknowledge that miracles were wrought, to the end men might be the more ſettled in their perſwaſion of the truth of the doctrine of the Goſpel: but I deny that they were wrought, for the confirmation of that faith onely. And
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8237:84"/>
my reaſon is, not onely becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer places gaineſay it; but alſo becauſe even reaſon doth contradict it.

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the Definition of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, given by ſome <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HAving confuted the firſt Error, concerning the Definition of a ſaving faith, namely, that of the Papiſts; it remaines, that I proceed to the opening and confuting of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: becauſe it alſo as well as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, agrees not with the true nature of faith in Chriſt, as it iuſtifies us. For as the former opinion of the Papiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires leſſe faith to iuſtification, then God doth require; ſo this of the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans requires more.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of the opinion is this, That a ſaving faith is a full aſſurance, and certaine perſwaſion of ſalvation by Chriſt; and that to beleeve in Chriſt, is to be fully aſſured, and perſwaded of ſalvation by him: and becauſe it will be ſuperfluous to alledge many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, therefore I will content my ſelfe with two, that were otherwiſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8237:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and learned men in their times, namely, <hi>Chemnitius</hi> and <hi>Melancthon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>Chemnitius</hi> are theſe:
<q>Faith is a particular aſſent, whereby every <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melancthons</hi> words are theſe:
<q>To beleeve in Chriſt, is to beleeve,<note place="margin">Melanct. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. Theol. Neoſtad anno 1587. in 8. De vocabulo fidei, pag. 583.</note> that forgiveneſſe of ſinne is given not to others on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but even to them in particular: <hi>with which agrees a Definition well known in the Engliſh tongue, viz.</hi> Faith is a full perſwaſion of the heart, grounded upon the promiſes of god, that whatſoever Chriſt hath done for the ſalvation of others, hee hath done it for me, as well as for any other.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Definition, two things are conſiderable: Firſt, the nature of the action of faith, or of beleeving, which conſiſts in perſwaſion or aſſurance. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the things to bee beleeved, or the obiect of this action, which are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes, and eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Now though I might except againſt both theſe parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the latter (as well as the former) that makes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8237:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the act of beleeving, to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, or aſſurance; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the latter that makes the obiect of their aſſurance, perſwaſion, or beleeving, to be ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereas it is Chriſt onely, or Chriſt for ſalvation: yet I will not labour in that, but direct my diſcourſe againſt the former part of it, which makes the nature of the act of beleeving, to conſiſt onely in aſſurance or perſwaſion.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to the confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the opinion, I will firſt ſhew the occaſion of this opinion. Secondly, I will declare in what ſenſe I write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt that part of their Definition, that makes faith, (as it iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies) to bee aſſurance of ſalvation, to the end I may not be miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>The occaſion that was given, to ſome Divines,<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 6. cap. 9. Bellar. de Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat. lib. 3. cap. 2. pag. 851. c. d. 852. e.</note> to be of opinion, that <hi>a ſaving faith is a full aſſurance, or perſwaſion of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> I take it to be this: The Papiſts deliver for truth, That none can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of his ſalvation: but that every one ought rather to doubt thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now to the end this Popiſh doctrine might bee oppoſed, many Divines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them have taught, that faith it ſelfe is an aſſurance of ſalvation, and a full perſwaſion, that our ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8237:87"/>
us; namely, becauſe ſome texts of Scripture make ſhew of ſuch a point. But (by their leave, and ſaving reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their great learning, and ſound iudgement in other points of Divinity) it was not good to oppoſe one untruth with another: for whileſt they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to overthrow the Popiſh faith, which is ioyned with doubting, they have (ere they were aware of it) ſhaken the faith of many weake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; who reading, that a ſaving faith is an aſſurance of ſalvation; and that to beleeve in Chriſt, is to be fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes by Chriſt; and withall, finding in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either no aſſurance at all, or (at leaſt) not ſo full an aſſurance and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of their ſalvation, have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon concluded (to the great diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as well they might, if their Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a ſaving faith were true,) that they have not a ſaving faith, though in deed, and in truth they had, as long as they beleeved in Chriſt, truſted to him, and reſted on the merits of his death and righteouſneſſe for ſalvation, in that manner as ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Touching the ſecond point, I would have the Reader obſerve diligently,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8237:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that I am ſo farre from denying Faith to be the roote, and foundation of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and perſwaſion, of the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes, and ſalvation: that I plainely confeſſe, that it doth bring aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and perſwaſion thereof, to the faithfull: namely, in that meaſure, and at that time, that the Lord of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodnes ſees fit, for each of his children.</p>
                  <p>But this I deny. Faith (as it iuſtifies) is not formally an aſſurance or perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſalvation; and this I will ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make good, by alledging ſome Arguments in defence of my opinion; and by anſwering the Reaſons that may bee brought in proofe of theirs. And of my Arguments, this is the firſt.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>The reaſon cannot iuſtly bee denyed, becauſe it is true; that therefore the cauſe cannot be the effect, nor the roote the fruit, becauſe the one followes the other in nature; the effect, the cauſe;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8237:88"/>
and the fruit, the roote: and therefore if aſſurance of ſalvation follow faith in Chriſt, as the effect and fruit of it: then cannot faith in Chriſt bee the aſſurance it ſelfe, or full perſwaſion of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>And that aſſurance, or full perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſalvation, and iuſtification fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes faith in Chriſt: I proue by theſe Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe aſſurance of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or iuſtification comes to us effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, by the teſtimonie of the Holy Ghoſt, that beares witneſſe with our ſpirits, that God is our Father, and we his children,<note place="margin">

the teſtimony of Gods Spirit, that we are his children, following our being Gods children; and our beeing Gods children, following our beleeving in Chriſt, or our ſaving faith; therefore aſſurance of ſalvation or iuſtification, muſt needs follow a ſaving faith, as an effect or fruit of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Aſſurance of ſalvation followes faith in Chriſt; becauſe aſſurance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or iuſtification, comes to us by feeling certaine graces, wrought in us by faith, namely, peace of conſcience, and ioy in the hope of the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>That peace of conſcience, and ioy in the hope of the glory of God, are means to aſſurance of our ſalvation, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by this, that they are the firſt fruits of our ſalvation, and of the ioyes of Heaven; and that this peace and ioy, are wrought in us, by the meanes of Faith, is as plaine by two places of <hi>Paul,</hi> where he ſaith, Now <hi>then being iuſtified by Faith,</hi>

                     <p>The reaſon is good; becauſe a thing cannot goe before it ſelfe, there muſt be ſome other thing that muſt goe before it. Therefore if a ſaving faith goe before the aſſurance of ſalvation, (as needs it muſt if a man muſt haue Faith in Chriſt, before he can be aſſured of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:) then cannot faith in Chriſt, nor ſaving faith, bee the aſſurance it ſelfe of ſalvation.</p>

                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:8237:90"/>To ſay, a ſaving faith is an aſſurance of ſalvation; implyes that a ſaving faith, and aſſurance of ſalvation, are all one and the ſame thing: but to ſay, wee muſt firſt haue a ſaving faith, before we can be aſſured of our ſalvation; implies, that the one goes before the other, and that therefore they are two diſtinct things; ſo that aſſurance of ſalvation cannot be affirmed, or predicated of a ſaving faith, in the Definition of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not proper to the nature of it, nor is convertible with it.</p>
                     <p>And that we muſt have a ſaving faith and beleeue in Chriſt for ſalvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can haue any aſſurance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I prooue by theſe three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a man muſt be ſaved, before he can be aſſured of his ſalvation, (for hee cannot be aſſured of that which is not) and a man muſt haue a ſaving faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be ſaved by faith (for he can not bee ſaved, by that which hee hath not:) therefore hee muſt haue a ſaving faith, before he can be aſſured of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a man muſt have a ſaving faith, before he can be aſſured of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe ſalvation is promiſed in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:8237:90"/>
the Covenant of Grace, vnder a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the Condition is faith in Chriſt, and faith in Chriſt, is a ſaving faith: So that he muſt firſt performe the condition of the Covenant, by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt, before he can obtaine the thing promiſed in the Covenant, which is ſalvation: For as it is true, that hee which beleeveth in Chriſt by a ſaving faith, is iuſtified, as ſoone as hee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth: ſo is it as true, that before hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, he is not iuſtified. For till then, hee hath no reaſon to lay hold on the Tree of Life, or to lay claime unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or the aſſurance of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we muſt have a ſaving faith, before we can bee aſſured of ſalvation, becauſe we muſt bee united and graffed into Chriſt, that is our Saviour, before wee can bee ſaved, or haue aſſurance of ſalvation by him.

                     </argument>
                     <p>The Reaſon is very probable, becauſe the nature, uſe, and end of faith, is to <hi>overcame the world</hi>: therefore to beat downe all prophanenes, and no way to countenance carnal Goſpellers therein; therefore ſhould the definition of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Faith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4.</note> doe ſo too; if therefore the Definition of a ſaving faith, doe nouzle men in profaneſſe, and formall profeſsion, though they haue not true faith indeed, then cannot it be a good definition.

                     <p>For when ſuch men doe reade in bookes, and are taught what a ſaving faith is, namely, an aſſurance of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and what it is to beleeve in Chriſt,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:8237:95"/>
namely, (as they ſay) to bee aſſured of forgiveneſſe of ſinnes by Chriſt; and withall, doe know and feele, that they have an aſſurance, yea a full aſſurance (as they perſwade themſelves) of their ſalvation; (for they would not doubt of it ſay they for all the world;) how can it be, but this definition of a ſaving faith, through the deceitfulnes of their proud hearts, and Satans craft, muſt needes nouzle them up in this ſtrong perſwaſion, that they have a ſaving faith; eſpecially when they can alledge for themſelves, that they have learned it ſo, by the Miniſtery of the Word, of their Paſtors? for if a ſaving faith be an aſſurance of ſalvation, (as their Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imports) then an aſſurance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is a ſaving faith; and if an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſalvation be a ſaving faith, then why ſhould not their aſſurance of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be a ſaving faith, as they thinke?</p>
                     <p>If they reply, becauſe the aſſurance of ſalvation that is in ſuch carnall Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, cannot be a true aſſurance upon good grounds, but a counterfeit one:</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that for ought their definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a ſaving faith ſaith, it may be a true aſſurance; for it gives no direction to try which is a true aſſurance, and which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8237:96"/>
is a counterfet: ſo that if a ſaving faith be nothing elſe, but an aſſurance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and to beleeve in Chriſt, be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but to be fully aſſured of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt; and to bee certainely perſwaded, that whatſoever Chriſt hath done for the ſalvation of others, he hath done the ſame for them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and for their ſalvation; then muſt it follow, that he which hath this particular aſſurance of his ſalvation, muſt needs have a ſaving faith.</p>
                     <p>If any chance to make the like obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt my Definition, becauſe carnall Goſpellers may eaſily perſwade themſelves, they truſt in Chriſt for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that their ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them for his ſake.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that iuſtly they cannot; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both in the opening of my Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already, as alſo in the Rules here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after following, I have ſhewed what be thoſe gifts and graces of the Spirit, which he workes in Chriſtians, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to prepare them thereunto, before they doe or can beleeve in Chriſt; ſo that by theſe they may know, whether their truſt in Chriſt, be a true truſt in Chriſt or no, and upon good grounds or counterfeit.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:8237:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of their definition, &amp; nature of a ſaving faith, they give no ſuch Rules, to try whether their aſſurance of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bee true or no, in as much as they teach that faith in Chriſt, (that is, if their expoſition of the nature of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith be true, a full aſſurance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt) is the firſt grace that is wrought in Chriſtians; ſo that there is no meanes leſt to try whether their aſſurance of ſalvation bee true or coun<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>So that there beeing by their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, no graces of the Spirit, wrought in them, to prepare them to this faith or aſſurance, it muſt needs follow, that they have no grounds of this aſſurance; and conſequently, that this aſſurance and perſwaſion of ſalvation, is not a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith; and that therefore their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a ſaving faith, muſt for all this, nouzle up carnall Goſpellers in their profaneneſſe.</p>

But the act of their faith, which the Apoſtle mentions in the place quoted, was but an effect of that truſt, as is evident by this, in that it is cauſed by their feeling of their love to God and their brethren, as is plaine by the context; now the feeling of our love to God, and our brethren, muſt needs proceed from the feeling of Gods love to us; and the feeling of Gods love to us, muſt proceed from faith in Chriſt, in whom God hath loved and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us;<note place="margin">

of faith,</hi> is to as little purpoſe as the former.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, becauſe though hee attribute Plerophory, or full aſſurance to faith: yet will not this prove, that faith in the forme, nature, and being of it, as it iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, is a full aſſurance or Plerophorie of ſalvation, becauſe the Apoſtle attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes full aſſurance to faith, not as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to define a ſaving faith, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, as it iuſtifies us (for then hee would have ſaid, Let us draw neere in faith, or full aſſurance,) but he deſcribes it by the fruit; and therefore he ſaith in <hi>full aſſurance of faith</hi>; as noting, full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to be but the effect of faith, which I contend for. So that no man can hence conclude, that a ſaving faith (as it iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us) is a full aſſurance of ſalvation, which is the point to bee prooved; no more then they can prove, that faith in Chriſt (as it iuſtifies) is ioy; becauſe the Apoſtle attributes ioy to faith, and ſpeakes of the <hi>ioy of the faith of the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians.</hi>

                        <p>They may indeed conclude from thence, that a ſaving faith is a cauſe of ioy,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Secondly, becauſe if the Text alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, could prove the point in queſtion, then ſhould the words, <hi>Let us draw neere in full aſſurance of faith,</hi> bee an exhortation to the Hebrewes, that were not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy iuſtified, to teach them, how they might be iuſtified, <hi>viz.</hi> by drawing neer in full aſſurance of faith; that is, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully aſſured and perſwaded of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt; (for that is the point to be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that a ſaving faith (as it iuſtifies us) is a full aſſurance of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that to beleeve in Chriſt, is to be fully aſſured of iuſtification by Chriſt;) but the words are an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Hebrewes, that were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy iuſtified, as appeares by the next words, verſ. 23. where he exhorts them in generall <hi>to hold faſt the profeſſion of their faith without wavering,</hi> part of which was a ſaving faith; which implies, they had faith already, and therefore were already iuſtified: (for they could not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:8237:101"/>
hold faſt that they had not:) ſo that the Apoſtle ſpeaking not of the nature of faith as it iuſtifies, but of the effect of faith only in them that are iuſtified, nor ſpeaking to them that are not iuſtified, to teach them how they might be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: but to them that are iuſtified, to teach them how they may with more boldnes, continually craue the pardon of new ſinnes in weakeneſſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and get more aſſurance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of the old: I cannot for my part ſee, how the place alledged can proue faith to be a full aſſurance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                        <p>There be many other Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">

                        <p>To conclude then, though it be moſt ſure, that Heaven and eternall life ſhall in the event moſt certainly bee attained by all thoſe for whom it is prouided. Firſt, becauſe <hi>they are ordained to it</hi> by God,<note place="margin">

                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21.</note> but aſſurance of ſalvation depends upon faith, onely as it is the condition of the Goſpell, required of us, and wrought in us, to make us capable of the ſame; and this aſſurance of ſalvation is increaſed

                        <p>I grant, the faithfull ſhall have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſalvation before they dye, and they ſhall have it by faith; but they haue it not by faith ſimply, as if the promiſe of the Goſpell were,<note place="margin">Note.</note> either, that he that is aſſured of ſalvation, ſhall be ſaved, or he that beleeues in Chriſt, ſhall be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of ſalvation; but becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſalvation is made to faith in Chriſt; and ſo they that haue this faith, are perſons to whom ſalvation belongs, God being by his righteouſneſſe, true of his promiſe, by his greatneſſe, able to performe it, and by his goodnes wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                        <p>That men ſhall certainly bee ſaved, and that they are ſure they ſhall bee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſaved, are two different things, the former implying a certainty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of GOD, and of his Word, that becauſe hee hath promiſed ſalvation to them that beleeve in Chriſt, therefore
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8237:102"/>
they ſhall certainly bee ſaved in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; and this certainty of ſalvation ſhall bee attained, though in this life men never come to bee ſure thereof in their ſoules, as in the caſe of infants, who being elected of God, ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee ſaved, though they were never ſure of it in their ſoules: and the latter implying a certainty, in reſpect of the perſons that are to bee ſaved, that they have an aſſured perſwaſion that wil not deceive them, which they may want for a time, after they have beleeved in Chriſt: and yet bee beloved of God, and bee beleevers in Chriſt and in the end bee certainly ſaved notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: and therefore the nature of faith as it iuſtifies, cannot conſiſt in aſſurance of ſaluation, nor the nature of beleeving in Chriſt to ſalvation, in our being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our ſoules, that wee are ſaved, as is ſuppoſed.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1. Exhortation.</note>My Exhortation to Proteſtants is, that they would examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; firſt, whether ever they knew what it is to beleeve in Chriſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood wherein the nature of faith (as it iuſtifies) doth conſiſt: namely, as I haue delivered it, that accordingly I may aduiſe them.</p>
                  <p>It may bee, by tryall many ſhall finde that this was all they underſtood of a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8237:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaving faith, that it was a beliefe, that there was once ſuch a one as Chriſt, that came into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that to beleeve in him, is to have a good hope, that he ſhall ſpeed as well as others, and bee ſaved by him, as well as they. Now if by examination they finde themſelves only to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in this faſhion, and to bee wholly ignorant of the nature of faith, as I have declared it; then have they great cauſe, firſt, to be aſhamed of themſelves, in that they haue been ſo long ignorant of the nature of ſo precious and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie a grace of God as faith is. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to feare that as yet they have not a ſaving faith. For I know not how they can have it, and bee wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the nature of it, what it is; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is only wrought, in men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of underſtanding; ordinarily, by the preaching of the Goſpell: and that preaching is made effectuall to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it in them, by enlightening of their mindes, with the knowledge and underſtanding of the points of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; one whereof is the Doctrine of a ſaving faith, which is the condition of the Goſpell required of all thoſe that ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt. Thirdly, to uſe

all good meanes, for time to come, to gaine the knowledge of this point, to the end they may know they are on a ſure ground for their faith and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Yea, they are not to content theſelves herewith, namely, with the knowledge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a ſaving faith, and with this, that they underſtand what faith in Chriſt is, or what it is to beleeue in Chriſt for ſalvation: but that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give over, till they get the grace of

Secondly, my exhortation is to Proteſtants, to examine themſelves whether they ſtedfaſtly beleeve, that faith will indeed iuſtifie all thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that have it: and conſequently that it will iuſtifie them, if they beleeve in Chriſt; for except we more then know the nature of a ſaving faith, and except we more then thinke or geſſe that faith will ſave us: <hi>viz.</hi> except alſo wee ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly beleeue this, for an undoubted truth of God, that every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues in Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved, we ſhall not have incouragement enough there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. For except our ſoules be ſatisfied touching this truth we may ſtill doubt, whether it may not come to paſſe, that for all our faith in Chriſt, wee may bee damned; which whoſoeuer doth, hath little incouragement to beleeue in Chriſt for ſalvation, ſpecially if withall it come into our minds (which it may eaſily doe by Satans ſuggeſtion, and the accuſation of our conſciences) that wee are ſinners by originall corruption, and actuall tranſgreſsion, and therefore ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

to all Gods curſes: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is unlikely that one grace of God, namely, faith, ſhould be ſufficient to ſave us. To ſettle us therefore in this beliefe of this point, that faith in Chriſt will ſave us, we are to meditate:</p>

                  <p>Secondly, we are to conſider, that God having in his wiſedome, and goodneſſe, deviſed and ſet downe a courſe, and way of ſalvation, which is faith in Chriſt, and appointed it, to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on our part, requiſite to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in his Word promiſed, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

of it to that end, will ſurely give power to his owne ordinance, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that for which hee hath appointed it. So that nothing ſhall let, but that they who have this faith in Chriſt, ſhall undoubtedly attaine to ſalvation by it, according to Gods purpoſe, and promiſe.</p>

that they would take notice, not onely how palpably erronious their Prieſts and Ieſuites are in their doctrine of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith: but alſo how dangerouſly iniurious they are to the poore &amp; ſimple Catholikes, in that they conceale from them the doctrine of the true faith, that muſt and will ſave them, <hi>viz.</hi> truſt in Chriſt: and onely teach them that, which neither can, nor will iuſtifie them, namely, a beliefe of the truth of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Herein they ſhew themſelves either groſſely ignorant, in not beeing able to underſtand ſo cleere a point, and then what becomes <hi>of the blinde that leade the blind,</hi>

For by beleeving the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which promiſeth ſalvation to them that beleeve in Chriſt, men are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to beleeue in Chriſt for ſalvation, according to the Goſpell:<note place="margin">Simil.</note> and yet as he that is ſet out, onward of his iourney, and is gone a good way, ſhal never come to the end of his iourney, if he ſit downe and ſtay halfe way: So thoſe Catholikes that are going towards Heaven by an

                  <p>That which I have ſaid in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Popiſh and Lutheran De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, of a ſaving faith,<note place="margin">§. 2. Admonition.</note> may bee a ground of admonition:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to Atheiſts (if any ſuch will reade this Treatiſe) that they learne to feare and tremble, becauſe of their Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie: for if they who have ſome faith (as the Papiſts) that come ſo neere to a ſaving faith, that they beleeve the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, may yet be without a ſaving faith, and be damned; if they live, and dye in this faith only, without faith in Chriſt; then what ſhall become of them, and where ſhall they appeare, that have not

                  <p>Secondly, my admonition is to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Goſpellers, that they bee not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, to thinke they have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they ſay they are ſure they ſhall be ſaved; and they are fully perſwaded they are Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that they would no way doubt of it, for all the world; let ſuch (I ſay) feare, leſt their hope make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed: for this is not the witneſſe of the Spirit of God, but a deluſion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: it is not to comfort them, but to feed them fat to the day of ſlaughter; for as, except Chriſt be the Rocke of the faith of Chriſtians, whereon it is built, their faith will faile them in temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo except faith in Chriſt bee the foundation of the aſſurance of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their aſſurance will faile them alſo.</p>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:8237:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may light upon either of them, in bookes tranſlated into Engliſh. If my Booke had beene written in Latine, ſo that it might have come to the hands of the Learned in the Lutheran Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, I would have intreated them, in conſideration of my Reaſons againſt it, to have expunged, and put out of their Catechiſmes, and Treatiſes of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuch Definitions; and not to have inſerted the like into their Sermons to their people. But becauſe I am out of hope, to prevaile in that kind with them, I will onely content my ſelfe to have admoniſhed my owne Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to take heed of ſuch Definitions in any of their bookes, tranſlated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, when they read them, for feare of the dangerous conſequences thereof.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place,<note place="margin">§ 3. Conſolation.</note> that which I have ſaid touching the confutation of the Lutherans opinion of the nature of a ſaving faith, may be a ſure ground of conſolation to them, that having a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, are yet afflicted in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe they want aſſurance of their ſalvation. For ſuch have no cauſe of deſpaire, or of diſcouragement, as long as with a heavie loaden ſoule, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring for mercy, they truſt in Chriſt,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8237:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and caſt themſelves wholly upon his merits, for ſalvation, according to the Goſpell; for (as hath beene ſaid) the condition of the Goſpell required of ſinners to ſalvation, is not a comfort, but a duty; not an aſſurance that they are ſaved, but a truſt in Chriſt that they ſhall be ſaved. So that, as long as they reſt on Chriſts merits, ſeeke to no other meanes, but with ſuch a heart, as hath beene ſaid, ſeeke to Chriſt for ſalvation; aſſoon as they have beleeved in Chriſt, they are in Gods ſight iuſtified ſinners, though they doe not preſently feele by the witneſſe of the Spirit, a full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they are ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, what an abſurd thing were this, to ſay, that the meaning of theſe words of the Goſpel, <hi>Chriſt died for all thoſe that beleeve in him,</hi> ſhould bee this: Chriſt died for all thoſe that perſwade themſelves fully he died for them; and that the meaning of this Propoſition, <hi>He that beleeves in Chriſt ſhall bee ſaved,</hi> ſhould be this, He that is fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and aſſured of the forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes by Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved?</p>
                  <p>On Gods name let Chriſtians labour continually, by the uſe of the meanes preſcribed to that end, to feele the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8237:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
comforts of faith, and for more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance every day then other of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or that they ſhall be ſaved: but let them not therfore iudge themſelves to be no good Chriſtians, nor to have a ſaving faith, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they have not a full aſſurance of ſalvation; for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſalvation is more faith, then God requires of Chriſtians to iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it is not of the nature of faith, as it iuſtifies.</p>
                  <p>For as a tree may bee a good fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> though in Winter it have no fruit on it: ſo a Chriſtian may bee a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever in Chriſt, though at ſome time of temptation hee want the fruit of his faith, I meane, the feeling of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly comforts thereof; whereof, more hereafter, God willing.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore comfort your ſelves, O yee, that are tender-hearted, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled-minded Chriſtians, becauſe you feele not the aſſurance of your ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in aſmuch as the condition of the Goſpell is not, That hee that beleeves in Chriſt ſhall bee aſſured of ſalvation, but that hee ſhall bee ſaved: ſo that, though thou never have in thine owne ſoule a feeling of aſſured perſwaſion, that thou art ſaved, yet as long as with
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8237:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a heart mourning after Chriſt, and gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.6.</note> as the <hi>barren land for water</hi>; thou caſt thy ſelfe upon him, and hang on him ſtill for ſalvation, with truſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the merits of his death and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou ſhalt in the end and event certainly be ſaved; becauſe God that hath made promiſe, (that he that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves in Chriſt ſhall be ſaved</hi>) is faithfull and true, mercifull and good, mightie and able to performe it.</p>
                  <p>Build therefore thy comfort on thy faith, and thy faith on Chriſt, and feare not; and build the aſſurance of thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, not on thine owne feeling, which may deceive thee; but on the truth, goodneſſe, and power of God, which cannot faile thee. And thus much of the firſt Rule, or Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by which Chriſtians may examine themſelves, whether they have a ſaving faith, namely, by trying themſelves, whether they underſtand what manner of Grace a ſaving Faith is; in opening whereof, I have beene the larger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the difficulty of the point requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it: for it was neceſſarie, that I ſhould at large make plaine this point; becauſe the true underſtanding hereof, will make all the reſt of the Treatiſe the

                  <p>I Will be briefer in the handling of this ſecond Rule, then I was in the firſt, becauſe it wil not need ſo long a Diſcourſe; and the rather, for that the former will give light to the latter. For thoſe words of the Definition, <hi>(whereby a ſinner truſts in Chriſt for ſpiritual and eternall bleſſedneſſe</hi>) doe evidently ſhew, that the end of faith, is to bring us unto ſalvation, and perfect bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; in which reſpect the Divines ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally with one conſent, call it a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, becauſe it will not happely ſo clearely be diſcerned of all; therefore for the making of it plainer, I will han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8237:112"/>
the point in a diſtinct Rule, and I will handle it thus: Firſt, by ſhewing how needfull it is to enquire after this point. Secondly, by declaring, that it is poſsible for us, by inquiry to find, whether wee underſtand the point or no. And thirdly, by making it manifeſt, that it will be profitable, by enquiry to find out, whether we underſtand, what the uſe and end is of a ſaving faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will bee needfull to enquire, whether wee underſtand the end and uſe of a ſaving faith, becauſe elſe, wee cannot tell directly, whether we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it or no; for without this tryall we may miſtake it, and thinke it was appointed for ſome other uſe and end, then indeed it was; by reaſon, wee are by nature not onely ignorant of theſe ſpirituall graces, but alſo well enough content to be nouzled up in the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them. For wee may imagine with the Iewes, that the uſe of our faith is onely to procure us temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, as they beleeved in the Meſsiah for a temporall kingdome onely.</p>
                  <p>To the end therefore, that wee may know, whether we underſtand it or no; and accordingly be affected with it, it is needful that we make enquirie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:8237:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we know the uſe and end of it to be this, namely, to ſave our ſoules; that is, to procure unto them forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and eternall life in heaven, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner whereof, and how it ſaves us, and is a meanes to that end, ſhall bee conſidered in the next Rule, God willing) onely in this place I thought good to ſpeake of the uſe, and end of it, in generall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But although it bee needfull to ſearch for the underſtanding of this point; yet if it were impoſsible by ſearch to find it out, we were never the neerer; therefore will I make it plaine, that by inquiry we may find it out. For if we ſearch the Scriptures, (particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that ſpeake of the Goſpell, or the Covenant of grace) they will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhew, this to be the end thereof; as ſhall appeare by the good things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto it.

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 13.39.</note> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo doth plainely ſhew, where

                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.9.</note> So that by theſe and the like places of Scripture, if we commune with our owne hearts, and aske our conſciences concerning theſe promiſes, we may eaſily tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we know the right uſe and end of a ſaving faith, or faith in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But though it were eaſie for us, to find out the uſe and end of faith in Chriſt, and whether we know, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it or no, yet if this were not profitable for us, we ſhould have little encouragement to go about this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It is therefore fit to ſhew the profit of this examination, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this; that knowing by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the excellent uſe and end of it, we may labour to get it, if we have it not, or to increaſe it, and ſtrengthen it, if we have it; yea to uſe and exerciſe it every day, by beleeving in Chriſt, for the pardon of the ſinnes of every day, in faith craving pardon of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Simil.</note>For as in Playſters and medicinal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, though wee have thoſe that bee never ſo good, for ſpeciall purpoſes, in their ſeverall kinds; yet if we know not their ſeverall uſes and ends, and the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:8237:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſickneſſes, or ſores, to which they are properly to be applied; wee ſhall have little heart to uſe them, and therefore they will doe us no good at all, nor any other; nay, they may doe much hurt when they are miſapplyed: whereas on the other ſide, when we have a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Medicine, that we know is good for ſuch a diſeaſe, or ſore, we will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly uſe it in our need, becauſe wee know the right uſe of it, and ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes profitable unto us. Even ſo, if we know not the good that will come unto us by a ſaving faith, (as we cannot, except we underſtand the right uſe and end thereof) we will never care to get it.

                  <p>Now then, good Reader, try &amp; examin thy ſelfe, whether thou knoweſt this to be the end of faith in Chriſt or no; and if thou find thou didſt not know it, then be aſhamed of thy ignorance, iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fearing that as yet thou haſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in Chriſt: for will a man beleeve in Chriſt to no end? or can hee beleeve in Chriſt to any purpoſe, if not to bee

ſaved by him? No, no, it is impoſsible: wherefore being aſhamed of thy former ignorance and infidelitie, redeeme the time, and now learne the right and true uſe, and end of it.

                  <p>THe knowledge and beleefe of the two former Rules, are very neceſſary, yet are not theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; except withall wee know the manner, how faith in Chriſt doth ſave us: for except we be inlightened with the knowledge hereof, we may erre, by thinking we are iuſtified by it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then indeed we are. Thou art ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to know and learne:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we are not iuſtified by the habit, quality, or vertue of faith, but by the uſe of it, or by the act of faith, which is a beleeving in Chriſt; for ſo runnes the tenure of the Scripture.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>act.</hi> 10.43.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:8237:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. Thou muſt know, that the act of faith, which is beleeving in Chriſt, is not one act onely, once for all done, and no more; but that it paſſeth through the whole courſe of our lives, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and continued every day. For ſeeing we muſt crave pardon of ſinnes every day,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.11, 12.</note> as well as begge daily bread; and we may not crave pardon without faith in Chriſt, therefore muſt wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt every day.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou muſt know, that the act of faith, which is beleeving, or truſting to, or in Chriſt, doth not iuſtifie us, for any merit or vertue that is in it, but for the merit and the worthineſſe of the perſon in whom faith truſts, or in whom we truſt by faith, which is Ieſus Chriſt, the Sonne of God, and of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who is the onely proper, and immediat Obiect of our ſaving faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Simil.</note>For even as it is not the hand, that layes on the Playſter upon a ſore, that cures and heales it; but the Plaiſter it ſelfe, and the healing vertue that is in the Plaiſter, laid on by the hand; ſo is it not faith, (whereby we lay hold on Chriſt) that cures and ſaves our ſoules, but Chriſt who is layd hold on,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:8237:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the hand of faith that cures us.</p>
                  <p>Wee are to know therefore, and to beleeve, that faith iuſtifies us onely, as the condition appointed by God, and required on our part, to make us capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſalvation, in this ſence;</p>
                  <p>Whereas by the firſt Covenant, which was the Covenant of the Law, and of Workes, no man could attaine eternall life, becauſe they are breakers of it; and therefore without the righteouſneſſe required in it. And whereas God not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding will have ſome to live e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, and yet not without righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, therefore hath it pleaſed God, who as Soveraigne Lord of all, can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point what meanes he will, to make us capable of life; to appoint in the ſecond Covenant (which is the Covenant of Grace) that faith ſhall be our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that is, that he will accept of our faith in Chriſts righteouſneſſe and death, inſtead of the righteouſneſſe of the Law; and that wee ſhall by faith in Chriſt, be as capable of eternall life, as if wee had in our perſons actually and fully kept the whole Law, and had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinned. So that faith in Chriſt iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies us not of merit, but of fauour; not of it ſelfe, but by Gods appointment;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:8237:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not as it is in us, but as it reſts on Chriſt; becauſe now by the ſecond Covenant, God requires no more at our hands, to give us intereſt to eternal life, then that we ſhould honor his Sonne, by truſting to him alone for ſalvation: for God will accept of this on our part, in ſtead of the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and by faith in Chriſts perfect obedience unto all Gods ſecret and revealed will, all our imperfect obedience ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him, and crowned by him in the kingdome of heaven.</p>
                  <p>If any chance to aske, why faith in Chriſt, above all other Graces, ſhould be the righteouſneſſe, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in the New Covenant, to make us capable of eternall life, and which he appoints and accepts to our iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Though we could give no reaſon, yet muſt wee beleeve it to bee true, becauſe God hath ſo revealed it. But the Apoſtle gives one reaſon, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16.</note> that <hi>the inheritance of Heaven comes by faith, that it might be by Grace, to the end the promiſe might bee ſure to all the ſeed:</hi> that is, the promiſe of ſalvation was made to faith, or to them that have faith in Chriſt, that the ſalvation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:8237:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might come to men, by the free grace and mercy of God, and it might be ſure to them, which it could never have beene, if it had come by the works of the Lawe, becauſe none ever could doe them.</p>
                  <p>And (if I may bee bold, according to Analogy of Scripture, to give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon) I coniecture, that therfore faith in Chriſt doth iuſtifie us, and that we are accepted as righteous by faith in Chriſts righteouſnes and ſufferings, rather then by any other grace of God; becauſe faith in Chriſt doth (more then any other grace) both moſt abaſe mans worthineſſe, to whom the Covenant is made, to the end he may go out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and emptie himſelfe wholly of all truſt and confidence, in any meanes within himſelfe for ſalvation; and alſo becauſe it doth moſt magnifie Gods free and rich mercie, and the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and al-ſufficiencie of the death and obedience of Chriſt, in whom the Covenant is made, to the end they may <hi>honour</hi> him onely,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.33.</note> by truſting to him ſo much the more confidently for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And yet leſt thou ſhouldeſt collect from hence, that if thou have faith in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8237:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved, though thou hadſt no charity, or obedience in thy life: I ſay, for the preſent (till I come to the ſixt Chapter) that though faith alone doe iuſtifie before God, yet doth it not before men; though faith alone doth iuſtifie, in the act of Iuſtification; and when it doth iuſtifie, yet is it not alone in the party that is iuſtified: but workes doe accompany the ſame, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the verity of the Iuſtification, and the truth of the faith it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Now then (good Reader) examine thy ſelfe concerning thy knowledge and underſtanding, of the manner how faith doth iuſtifie; and if thou haſt thought that it doth iuſtifie, as a part of inherent righteouſneſſe, (as the Papiſts doe) or as having any vertue in it ſelfe to procure it, as Libertines may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, (that have no good workes) then haſt thou beene deceived all this while: and therefore now learne to know the true manner, as I have ſaid, to the end thou maiſt know both when thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveſt to Iuſtification, and that thou beleeveſt truly, and effectually thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: aſſuring thy ſelfe, that though God hath ordained faith to iuſtifie us, yet ſhall it not be effectuall to that end, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8237:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou uſe it to that end, in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and after that manner as himſelfe hath appointed; perſwading thy ſelfe, that thou ſhalt not attaine ſalvation by faith, for the worthineſſe of the grace it ſelf; but of the obiect of the grace, which is Chriſt; who is the Perſon, in whoſe merit faith reſts and truſts for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: neither that thou ſhalt obtaine ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by thy faith, if it be not lively, to ſtirre <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <p>As touching the meanes or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which God workes faith in Chriſt, which is the ſecond point: I ſay, it is the preaching of the Word of God; for ſo ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  <p>Now if any man be deſirous to know more particularly, how God workes a ſaving faith by the Miniſters preaching, and the peoples hearing, (I ſuppoſe) the courſe is this:</p>

come to heare, the Spirit of God doth move thoſe that heare it, to attend to the Doctrine of ſalvation preached. For ſo we reade he did to <hi>Lydia, whoſe heart the Lord opened,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, upon this diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and together with it, GOD in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens the minde to conceiue, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the way of ſalvation taught by the Goſpell;<note place="margin">

of neceſsity hold, al that lived, and dyed in the darkneſſe of Popery, and in the perſecution of thoſe times, to live and dye without a ſaving faith, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, without ſalvation, (which is too hard a cenſure to paſſe upon them) becauſe they had no preaching but reading only: they could heare no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but onely reade good bookes in ſecret: yet, I ſay, that in a ſetled Church (ſuch as England is) where there is a Miniſterie eſtabliſhed, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie given to preach the Goſpell, and where there is preaching to be had; in this caſe, the preaching of the Goſpell is the ordinarie meanes, whereby God is pleaſed to worke in men a ſaving faith.<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.</note> 
                     <hi>to ſave them that beleeve</hi>: what can wee collect leſſe, then that the preaching, that is, expounding and applying of the doctrine of the Goſpell, is the ordinarie way which God hath appointed to worke faith in Chriſt withall; ſo that whoſoever may have preaching, but will content himſelfe with reading; I
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:8237:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
know not how faith in Chriſt ſhould be wrought in him, that deſpiſeth the ordinance of Chriſt, which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that end.</p>
                  <p>Now then, to the end I may upon theſe premiſes, draw to a concluſion of this Rule; I humbly pray the Reader to examine himſelf by this Rule: Haſt thou lived, where the Goſpell hath beene preached, and in a Pariſh, where the Doctrine of the way and meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hath beene publiſhed, and laid open? examine thy ſelfe whether thou haſt come to heare it, and being come, haſt attended to it, and by attention haſt underſtood it; and after the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, haſt beleeved it, and aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the truth of it; and upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe thereof, haſt been affected with the deſire of ſalvation offered in it. If thus God haue wrought in thee, and after this worke, thou haſt come to caſt thy ſelfe on Chriſt for ſalvation, according to the Goſpell: then haſt thou a good evidence indeed, that God wrought kindly upon thee, and thou maiſt ſafely perſwade thy ſelfe, that thou cameſt rightly by thy faith in Chriſt; and that it is truely wrought in thee; becauſe it hath beene wrought by the direct
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:8237:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meanes, which is the preaching of the Word, namely, the Goſpell; and by that manner of efficacie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which it becomes uſually powerfull to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a ſaving faith in others.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe, if thou ſay thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt in Chriſt for ſalvation, and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to Him alone for it, and thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt by this faith but by tradition onely, either becauſe thy Parents and friends that brought thee up, are of this faith, and Religion; or becauſe the King of the Country where thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, doth publikely profeſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this faith: If thou haſt never been a diligent hearer of Sermons, but one that haſt contented thy ſelfe with bare prayers, ſervice and reading, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned preaching; or if thou haſt heard any Sermons, they have beene matters of Hiſtory onely, or Moralitie, and not the Goſpell; or if thou haſt come to heare the Goſpell preached, thou haſt uſually ſlept, or lookt about, or read on ſome other prayer booke, or thought on ſome other matters: ſo that thou couldeſt not attend; or if thou didſt attend, yet thou careſt not for the underſtanding of points deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, or doubteſt of the truth of them;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8237:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or if thou didſt beleeve them, yet wert not affected with them, to deſire ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion earneſtly in the uſe of the meanes: then cannot I ſee how thou ſhouldeſt have a ſaving faith wrought in thee.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore my exhortation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is; firſt, to Miniſters, that they in zeale of the glory of God, and of the ſalvation of ſoules, be painefull in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpell ſpecially, becauſe it onely is the meanes to worke in their people a ſaving faith. Secondly, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all people which have the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, (but as yet have not faith in Chriſt wrought thereby through their owne careleſneſſe,) that they attend unto Gods ordinance, that they labour to underſtand the doctrine of the Goſpell, and to beleeve it; yea, to bee affected with it, that ſo they may bee moved to beleeve in Chriſt, for that ſalvation that is offered them therein: aſſuring themſelves that God having already ſet in his Church a way to ſave ſoules by, and to worke faith in men for the attaining of ſalvation; and having ever ſince the Apoſtles time, ordinarily followed that courſe onely, in the Church of Chriſt: Hee will not now for their ſakes deuiſe a new way
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8237:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to worke a ſaving faith in them; and the rather becauſe they are open neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecters, and contemners of the ordinary meanes.</p>

                     </note>For as when the Lord having crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and appointed the creatures that grew out of the earth for mans foode, and commanded the eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, for the continuance and preſervation of life; if any man ſhall neglect theſe ordinary meanes, and will not eate and drinke of them, but expect new creatures, and meanes for foode and maintenance of health and ſtrength, the Lord will not give them, but iuſtly ſuffer that man to die, becauſe he willingly ſtarues himſelfe: euen ſo now that the Lord hath ordained, and appointed meanes of ſpirituall foode, to nouriſh the ſoule to eternall life, which is the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and given us the ſame, hee will not deuiſe nor raiſe vp a new meanes to thee that deſpiſeſt the old; not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie to thee that contemneſt the ordinarie, becauſe thou imagineſt the meanes to bee either needleſſe, or fruitleſſe, idle or inſufficient.

                  <p>And by theſe ſixe workes of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (for nature onely doth not worke them, ſeeing they are wrought by the Word, and are not in all naturall men) upon the minds and wils of men, they are forwarded, and prepared to ſeeke for ſalvation, and driven thereunto, for feare of puniſhment, even as they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:8237:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are compelled and moved to ſeeke for a pardon from a King, who know themſelves condemned to die, for ſome theft or treaſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But this is not preparation enough to faith in Chriſt; for if this were all, it were to little purpoſe: and therefore after this, there followes another worke, (mentioned before) which is a knowledge and beliefe of the Goſpell, which is this, That notwithſtanding their ſinfull and curſed eſtate in <hi>Adam,</hi> and in themſelves, yet is there ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be had for them, who feeling their need of it, with weary and heavy-loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hearts, do ſeeke and repaire to Chriſt to be ſaved; which was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cord mentioned before, by which I ſaid, Gods Spirit drawes men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and beleeve in Chriſt for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>And when people are thus wrought upon by Gods Spirit, when their mind is enlightened with the knowledge and beliefe of theſe points of the Goſpell, and their hearts affected with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity of having, the poſsibility of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the excellencie of enioying ſo worthy a thing as is ſalvation; by ſo worthy a Perſon, as is the Lord Ieſus; and for ſuch ungracious perſons as themſelves are; how is it poſsible, but they ſhould bee more fitted and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſeeke for ſalvation by Chriſt; and by this beliefe of the Goſpel more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded to beleeve in Chriſt; and drawn thereunto in hope of pardon; even as the Syrians were mooved and drawne to ſue for a pardon of <hi>Ahab</hi> the King, becauſe they had heard, the Kings of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael were mercifull men.</p>
                  <p>Having drawn out at length theſe two cords,<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 10.31.</note> and faſtened them both to the head, and underſtanding, as alſo to the heart and affections, to the end men may be drawne by them unto Chriſt,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:8237:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſeeke for ſalvation by faith in him. It remaines, that I exhort the Reader, to lay himſelfe to this line, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelfe by this Rule, to the end he may diſcerne whether he hath beene thus wrought upon or no.</p>
                  <p>Now then try thy ſelfe (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) hath God prepared a way in thy heart to beleeve in Chriſt, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thee to know, beleeve, and feele thy need of ſalvation by Chriſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thou art in thy ſelfe, in a curſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate through ſinne? doeſt thou feele the burden of them in thy conſcience, and is thy heart pricked and afflicted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with? doeſt thou feare Gods iuſtice, and art thou ſorry for thy ſinnes? doeſt thou acknowledge thy ſelfe unable and unworthy to ſave thy ſelfe? doeſt thou bethinke thee, whether there bee any hope of remedy, and enquireſt thou af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it? and (to conclude) doth thy heart begin to bethinke of taking a new courſe, and of living no more ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly? then art thou not farre from the kingdome of God, but in a good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe in thy way to heaven, if withall (having heard of the Goſpell) thou beleeveſt there is ſalvation to bee had, thou heartily deſireſt it, thou ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8237:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſeekeſt for it, and by the hope of pardon, through the beliefe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, thou purpoſeſt in the truth of thy heart, without hypocriſie, to leave thy former evill wayes, and to turne to God: otherwiſe, if thou haſt felt none of theſe preparing workes of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to fit thee for Chriſt, and for faith in him, and thou haſt nothing to ſay for thy ſelfe but this, that thou haſt a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perſwaſion, (hand over head, and in groſſe) that thou ſhalt ſhift as well as others, that is, goe to heaven, and ſcape hell as well as they, becauſe God is mercifull, and Chriſt is dead, riſen, and aſcended into heaven; and becauſe thou beleeveſt the Goſpel: then art not thou as yet fit to goe to Chriſt, nor to truſt in him for ſalvation: and therefore thou muſt labour in the uſe of meanes to be ſo inlightened in thy mind, and ſo affected in thy will, as I have ſaid, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou wilt duely and truly, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably in thy ſelfe, and acceptably unto God, beleeve in Chriſt for eternall life.</p>
                  <p>But if by the preaching of the Law and Goſpell, Gods Spirit did thus worke upon thy mind and will, as hath beene ſaid before, to beleeve in Chriſt, then waſt thou rightly prepared to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:8237:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in Chriſt, and mayſt boldly and ſafely ſay, thou haſt a ſaving faith ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if withall there have followed the fruites of it, in thy holy life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more at large in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>I doe not ſay, that this preparation is wrought in all men in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but men are made to feele their need of Chriſt, according as God is pleaſed to make them ſenſible of their ſinnes and miſery; for ſome are more ſubiect to be caſt downe, and troubled in mind, then other are; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more forward to hunger and thirſt for Chriſt, and for ſalvation by him: but this I ſay, that all Chriſtians are thus prepared, more or leſſe, to faith in Chriſt, before they can, or will beleeve in him.</p>
                  <p>Neither will I contend ſo eagerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the order of this preparation, as to goe about abſolutely to determine, that this grace is alwayes wrought in the firſt place, and that in the ſecond, in every Chriſtian; nor yet to diſpute, and decide, whether or no, they bee all wrought at one inſtant time, in every particular man or woman alwaies, but I am of opinion, that they are all wrought in men in ſome kind or other,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8237:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in one meaſure and degree or other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can or will bee fit and able to truſt in Chriſt for ſalvation; and that moſt uſually they are wrought in them in that manner, as I have ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Having declared, how men are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to beleeue in Chriſt; and in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration affirmed, that a beginning of repentance, is one meanes to prepare them thereunto, (namely, a ſmaller be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of purpoſe to forſake former ſinnes, upon the preaching, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, beleeving, and laying to heart of the Commandements, and threatning of the Law broken, which convince them of their ſinne and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and a greater worke thereof, upon the preaching, underſtanding, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and laying to heart, of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and comforts of the Goſpell, which offer grace and mercy:) It will be very needfull to inſiſt more at large upon the point, (the rather) becauſe there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that make much doubt of that point and many that are grounded and ſettled in a quite contrary opinion.</p>
                  <p>For this end, I will doe foure things: 1. I will ſhew how farre-forth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is wrought before faith in Chriſt, to the end I may not be miſtaken, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:8237:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thought to be of opinion with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the precedencie of repentance unto faith, 2. I will proove it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons grounded on the Word, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is ſo farre begun indeed, as I ſhall ſay, to the end I may not miſlead any into errour. 3. I will anſwere the maineſt Obiections againſt it. 4. And laſtly, I will make particular uſe and application of the point. And theſe foure ſeverall points ſhall bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in foure ſeverall and diſtinct Sections.</p>

                     <p>Touching the firſt point, I humbly pray, it may be diligently obſerved, and remembred, what I hold, concerning the precedencie of repentance unto faith: and that for this purpoſe, they would conſider generally, of what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance I ſpeake in this queſtion, namely, of a true change of the heart, conſiſting in a purpoſe of leaving our former ſinfull courſes, and ſerving God better; and alſo of what faith, namely, of faith in Chriſt, or that act of faith whereby ſinners truſt unto Chriſt, reſt,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8237:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and rely upon him for ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>This that I have ſaid in generall of the nature of that repentance and faith, (whereof the queſtion is to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) ſhall be better conceived in foure particulars:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I doe not hold, that repentance is wrought in men, before a beliefe of the Word, that is, either of the Law which convinceth of ſinne and puniſhment, or of the Goſpell, which offereth hope of pardon; for I thinke it is impoſſible a man ſhould repent, before hee beleeve this for a truth; that if he goe on in his ſinfull life, and repent not, the Lord will puniſh him; and if hee doe repent, the Lord will forgive him: but this I hold, that repentance muſt be wrought in men, before they can beleeve in Chriſt, or truſt in him for ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I doe not meane, that the, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of repentance, in doing good workes, and bringing forth fruits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy amendment of life, go's before faith in Chriſt, but that a true purpoſe of the heart to leave our former wicked lives, (which is properly repentance, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the notation of the Word) goes before faith in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Neither doe I affirme, that ſo full
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:8237:133"/>
and perfect a worke of repentance is wrought in the heart before faith in Chriſt, as is afterward wrought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; when by beleeving in Chriſt, and by being iuſtified through beleeving, wee feele the comforts of faith in our ſoules, which are the ſtrongeſt motives to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to the accompliſhing of it; but this I affirme, that onely a beginning of repentance is wrought before faith in Chriſt; which though it bee but weake, in compariſon of that which is wrought after faith in him; yet is it a true and ſincere purpoſe of heart, (as truth is oppoſed to hypocriſie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation) to forſake the practice of the former wicked life, and to leade a new.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, I doe not ſay, that this begun repentance can be ſufficient to ſalvation, if we could imagine a man could die before hee had beleeved in Chriſt: but this begun repentance, and purpoſe of heart, to turne from ſinne and Satan and to returne to God, and new obedience is to bee manifeſted by practice, according to the purpoſe, and both are to be made acceptable to God,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</note> and comfortable to our ſalvation by faith in Chriſt, when it is wrought
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:8237:133"/>
within us, without which it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God unto ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>I ſay then fully and plainely, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſinners can truely truſt in Chriſt for ſalvation, or with any confidence craue pardon of their ſinnes by Chriſt; they muſt begin, truely to reſolue, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in their hearts, to leaue their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer euill courſes, and to leade a new life.</p>

The Authour is that worthy Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> who in the ſecond Volume of his Workes, <hi>pag.</hi> 257. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>B. C.</hi> in his Commentary upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians, chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. hath theſe words:<note place="margin">

<hi rend="margQuotes">Laſtly, we are here taught in the working of our ſalvation, to keepe the order of God, which he hath ſet down unto us, in Baptiſme. Which is firſt of all to turne unto God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Lawes; and ſecondly, upon our converſion, to lay hold on the promiſe of God, and the confirmation thereof, by the Sacraments. Thus ſhall wee finde comfort in the promiſes of God, and have true fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God, if wee beginne where hee begins in making of his covenant with us, and end where he ends.

                     </p>
                     <p>I could not have deſired this worthy Divine to have ſpoken more fully, nor more plainely for mee then hee hath done. Out of his words therefore I thus reaſon:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, if that Commentary upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> bee the Worke of Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> as it is, except hee have great wrong, or except it can bee diſproved.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if he in this place alledged doth ſpeake of true repentance and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, as he doth, becauſe he ſpeaks of that repentance which is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſion and turning to God according to all his Lawes, and of that faith which is a laying hold on the promiſes of God, for the finding of trve comfort to our ſoules, both in life and death; and for the having of trve fellowſhip with God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if hee ſay plainely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, that this is the order of God,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:8237:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which he hath ſet downe in Baptiſme, that men muſt firſt turne to God; and ſecondly, and upon that converſion lay hold upon the promiſes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, if he ſay this muſt be done, and this order of repentance and faith is to bee kept both in the firſt converſion (which is repentance from dead workes;) as alſo from ſins which we commit after our firſt converſion, and our firſt beleeving in Chriſt: All which are cleerely laid downe in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie alledged: then may it from thence eaſily and truely bee collected, that it was Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> opinion and iudgement, that repentance is truely begunne before a ſaving faith, as I have affirmed.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe in matters of doctrine, we are not to reſt in mens iudgements, nor in their teſtimonies, (becauſe they are but probable Arguments) but one Reaſons, taken from the teſtimonie of God, which is his written Word: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the better ſatisfying of the Reader, I will produce ſome Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make that good which I have ſaid, and I will produce them in that forme, that the ſimple may conceive the better of them; &amp; each Argument

                        <p>Repentance is begunne before faith in Chriſt, becauſe the repentance of the Publicans and Harlots, <hi>Math. 21.32.</hi> was begunne before their faith: and theirs was true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and a true ſaving faith.</p>

                     <p>The reaſon is good; becauſe there is but one true repentance, and one ſaving faith that is required of all them that ſhall be ſaved: So that if the repentance and faith of the Publicans and Harlots in the Text alledged, were the trve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith that God required of them to ſalvation, and their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance were begunne before their faith, then is the repentance of other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians likewiſe begun before their faith.</p>

                     <p>It is certaine that <hi>Iohn</hi> required more faith (that is, profeſsion of more faith) then beleeving his doctrine to bee trve of all that came unto his Baptiſme: for he required faith in Chriſt, or that they ſhould beleeve in him that was to come.

                           <hi>Act.</hi> 19.4.</note> or to truſt unto him for ſalvation, is more then to beleeve the truth of <hi>Iohns</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:8237:140"/>
concerning Chriſt.

For there is no Text of Scripture that ſaith they had any other.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore by beleeving <hi>Iohn, Mat.</hi> 21.31. either there muſt be underſtood more faith, then beleeving the truth of <hi>Iohns</hi> doctrine, (namely, a truſting unto Chriſt for ſalvation, according to the truth of <hi>Iohns</hi> doctrine concerning Chriſt which they beleeved:) and then it will follow that the faith of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Harlots, <hi>Math.</hi> 21.32. was a ſaving faith, which is the thing I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to prove; or elſe there muſt bee underſtood onely a beliefe of <hi>Iohns</hi> doctrine; and then will it follow that the Publicans and Harlots had no other faith, then that; <hi>viz.</hi> then an hiſtoricall faith. Which if it were trve, then was an hiſtoricall faith ſufficient to ſaue the Publicans and Harlots; and if ſo, then not only is the diſtinction of faith into hiſtoricall, and ſaving meerely idle: but (which is worſe) then would it follow,

that an hiſtoricall faith, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Popiſh faith will ſave ſinners in theſe dayes, as well as it did the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and ſinners in thoſe.</p>

                     <p>The reaſon is good, becauſe a ſaving faith, and truſt in Chriſt for pardon of ſinnes are all one; and the true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith in Chriſt, that is wrought in men after their firſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is one in nature and kind, with that which is wrought at the firſt, when they are firſt turned to God, though there may be ſome difference betwixt them, in regard of the meaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their excellencie.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:8237:144"/>
and the faith in Chriſt that is wrought in men after their firſt converſion, is the ſame with that which is wrought at the firſt. Diſproving this, by urging, that that which is wrought at the firſt converſion, is but Legal; but that which is wrought afterward, is Evangelicall: now Legall repentance is not the ſame in nature and kind with Evangelicall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Solut.</note>I anſwer, If by Legall repentance they meane that which is taught and commanded in the Law, then I ſay, there is no ſuch repentance at all: (for the Law that commands perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſuppoſeth perfect obedience; and therefore cannot imply, or ſuppoſe any breach or diſobedience of it; which it muſt doe, if it command repentance, becauſe repentance is for the breach thereof) and therefore their diſtinction is naught, and conſequently their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</p>
                     <p>But if by Legall repentance, they meane that, wherein they may bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the doctrine of the Law, which convinceth us of ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for which wee muſt repent, and threatens puniſhment, for the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, to drive us to repentance, then I grant there is ſuch a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:8237:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but withall I deny, that the repentance wrought in men before the firſt converſion, and before faith in Chriſt, is onely Legall repentance, as by their obiection they would make us to beleeve; and my Reaſon is this:</p>
                     <p>If that be repentance Legall, which is wrought by the Law, that is, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the Law, then muſt that bee repentance Evangelicall, which is wrought by the Goſpell, that is, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the Goſpell. Now I have plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed, in ſetting downe the ſtate of the queſtion, that the repentance which I ſay goes before faith in Chriſt, doth neceſſarily follow a beliefe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; and therefore their firſt obiection can bee of no force againſt my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Or if any chance to reply, ſaying, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if a man doe never repent, he can never truſt in Chriſt for pardon of his ſinnes, with any hope thereof: but (wil they ſay) hee may repent after he hath beleeved in Chriſt; which if hee doe, it is as well, as if he had repented before:</p>
                     <p>I anſwere, To the end we may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of pardon by repentance, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that it be duely wrought; and it is not onely wrought after a ſaving
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:8237:145"/>
faith, but either before it, or at the very inſtant time, that a ſaving faith it ſelfe is wrought, and I prove it thus:</p>
                     <p>Aſſoone as ever a ſinner hath belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chriſt with his heart, hee may begge pardon of his ſinnes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43.</note> becauſe it is promiſed to ſuch beleevers; and that which is promiſed by God, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be craved of him: but if a ſinner crave pardon, not beeing at the ſame time a repenting ſinner, hee hath little hope to obtaine it; becauſe pardon is promiſed to the repenting, and denied to the unrepenting ſinner, as hath beene ſhewed a little before in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>If then a ſinner begge pardon of his ſinnes, aſſoone as ever hee beleeves in Chriſt, with any hope of obtaining it; he muſt be a repenting ſinner, aſſoone as ever he is a beleever in Chriſt; and if he be a repenting ſinner, aſſoone as he is ſuch a beleever, then muſt his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be wrought in him, either before his faith is wrought, or at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant time that it is wrought.</p>
                     <p>For if it be not wrought till after his faith in Chriſt, then is hee not a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinner, aſſoone as he is a beleeving ſinner; and conſequently, cannot by
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8237:145"/>
faith crave pardon, aſſoone as hee hath beleeved in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>So that either a ſinner may not crave pardon of God for his ſinnes, aſſoone as he hath beleeved in Chriſt, (which I thinke unreaſonable) or a ſinner may by faith in Chriſt begge pardon of his ſins, before he hath begun to repent of them, (which to me is ſenſleſſe) or repentance cannot be wrought in ſinners after their faith in Chriſt, (as is ſtiffely maintained by ſome.)</p>
                     <p>Now if it bee not wrought after it, then muſt it bee wrought either before it, or at the ſame inſtant time together with it, to the end they may be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinners, aſſoone as they are belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſinners, and thereby bee made fit perſons to begge and receive forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, aſſoone as ever they have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chriſt for it, by a ſaving faith.</p>

                     <p>The Reaſon is very probable, becauſe it is ſuppoſed, that therfore repentance

                     <p>And that as hard a worke as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of repentance, is wrought in men before faith, I prove, becauſe the taking out of mans mind, ignorance, and unbeliefe of the Goſpell, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in it the knowledge and beliefe thereof, is wrought in men before they can beleeve in Chriſt; and this is as hard, and as great a worke as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of repentance.</p>
                     <p>For by the light of Nature men know many actions to be ſinnes, and that they ſhould not do them, they beleeve that if they doe them, they offend God, and deſerve his iudgements for them; and that therefore they ought to repent of them, and leave them: yea, upon theſe and the like conſiderations, many are moved (at leaſt for a time) to refraine the committing of many ſinnes: but there is no light in Nature, to make men know and beleeve the Goſpell or the way of ſalvation, that is ordained in the new Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> that if ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners beleeve in Chriſt Ieſus, they ſhalbe ſaved:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23.</note>

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8237:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
why then ſhould it bee thought more impoſsible for men to beginne to turne to God by the working of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, through the preaching of the Word, before they beleeve in Chriſt; then it is for them to underſtand and beleeve the myſterie of the Goſpell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they beleeve in Chriſt. Specially, ſeeing before men beginne to repent, there are wrought in them (by Gods Spirit through the preaching of the Word) certaine preparing graces that doe begin repentance: whereas they come to beleeve the Goſpell, there be no ſuch preparations wrought, to fit them thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Before the repentance (I ſpeake of) can bee wrought in men, firſt, God workes in men a knowledge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe that it is his will they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and this is done by the preaching of the precepts of God, that command men to repent. Secondly, God workes in them a bethinking them of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſinnes,<note place="margin">

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:8237:147"/>
condemnation to the impenitent, which drive them to repent. Thirdly, God workes in them a deſire to repent, and an hope of pardon, which is done by the promiſes of God, that freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer forgiveneſſe to the repentant, which drawes and allures them to repent. Laſtly, God workes in them a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a poſsibility for them to bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: a good hope that God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them as well as others; and this is done by the examples of the faithfull that have beene pardoned upon their repentance; and this animates and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages them to repent: (now who can deny, but that theſe graces prepare men to repentance, and that where theſe are wrought, repentance muſt needs be begun in men by theſe prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations?)</p>
                     <p>But before a beliefe of the Goſpel is wrought in men, there are no ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring graces wrought; for before this be wrought, there is nothing in mens minds and underſtandings, but <hi>darkneſſe</hi> and ignorance,<note place="margin">

                           <p>The reaſon is not good: becauſe though repentance bee begunne before faith, and therefore be not of it, yet is it not ſinne for all that; no more then an hiſtoricall faith, which is a beliefe of the Goſpel, is ſinne, becauſe it goes before a ſaving faith, and therefore is none of it.</p>
                           <p>In like manner, the proofe of the reaſon, out of the fourteenth to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> is not to the purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, becauſe the queſtion is of faith in CHRIST for iuſtification, but the proofe is onely of a faith that is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of liberty, or warrant to the conſcience, to eate of the meates there ſpoken of: with which wee have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe in our queſtion.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtles meaning is not (as it ſhould have been, if the proofe were to purpoſe:) whoſoever eates the meates there ſpoken of, before hee have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith wrought in him, doth ſinne, (for he takes it for granted, that all the

                              <hi>Romanes,</hi> before hee wrote this Epiſtle, had a ſaving faith, and therefore the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat comes too late.) But the Apoſtles meaning is, that whoſoever he be of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that eates of the meats then ſpoken of without faith; that is, before he have a beliefe or aſſurance to his conſcience, upon ſome good ground or warrant of the Word, that hee may lawfully eate thereof, hee ſinnes in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

                           <p>And that this faith there meant is plaine by this reaſon: becauſe though the <hi>Romanes</hi> had a ſaving faith, whereby they truſted to Chriſt for ſalvation: yet if they had not the faith <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of, whereby they certainly beleeved, and aſſuredly perſwaded themſelves they might lawfully eate of them, but did doubt whether they might or no, they did certainly ſinne: for <hi>whatſoever is not of this faith, is ſin</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.)</p>
                           <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that this repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:8237:150"/>
is of faith, in the Apoſtles ſenſe; becauſe it is that wee are perſwaded in our conſcience wee have warrant and precept for, out of the Word of God. So that this firſt obiection with the proofe is to no purpoſe; but let us heare another.</p>

                        <p>And why then ſhould it bee thought ſtrange for the Apoſtle, to uſe the word purifying, for iuſtifying: ſeeing the matter of the queſtion was, concerning ceremoniall purifyings: and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that moved the queſtion were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Iewes, who well underſtood what was the uſe and end of ſuch puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyings? the perſons concerning whom the queſtion was moved, were the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, whom the Iewes eſteemed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and uncleane, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.1. that is, not within the Covenant of ſalvation.

                           <p>Secondly, becauſe <hi>Ahabs</hi> repentance, and <hi>Iehues</hi> obedience, were acceptable to God in ſome kinde and to ſome end; namely, as they were the doing of Gods commandement, and as they were meanes to procure temporall bleſsings to them; though wee reade not in the Scripture, that either of them had a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, when they did thoſe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table actions, or all their life after.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, becauſe a knowledge and beliefe of our ſinfull and curſed eſtate in <hi>Adam</hi>; and thereupon ſorrow and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation for ſinne; after this, a beliefe of the Goſpel, and a deſire to repent and be ſaved, are all wrought in men, before a ſaving faith, for they are meanes and preparations to it: (as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:) yet are they ſome way acceptable unto God, namely, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,

and commended of God, as they are fruits and effects of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Election, as they are wrought in us by the holy Spirit of God, through the preaching of the Word, and as they prepare us to beleeve in Chriſt, though none of them all ſeverally, or ioyntly, can be acceptable to ſalvation, or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſave us; if beſides them, wee have not faith in Chriſt to make us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God.

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:8237:159"/>
downe the ſtate thereof; and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood alſo of regeneration fully wrought in all the parts (though not degrees) thereof; for of ſuch a worke of regeneration muſt the Propoſition be underſtood, elſe it proves nothing in the queſtion.</p>
                           <p>I grant, repentance cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun till regeneration be begun; for they are both begun together; and no ſooner doth a child of God begin to repent, but he preſently begins to bee regenerate: for though it be true, (which is not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned) that repentance for ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after the firſt converſion, doe follow regeneration in the children of God, becauſe they (after they are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate) doe ſinne often, and therefore repent often after they are regenerated: yet is it not true (which is queſtioned) that repentance from dead works (that is, for ſinnes committed before the firſt converſion, when men are dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſinnes) is not begun before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation be fully wrought. And my reaſon is plaine and good, becauſe then repentance ſhould be no part of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                           <p>For if repentance doe but begin to be wrought in men, when regeneration

is already wrought in them, then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repentance be a part of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe all the parts of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (I doe not ſay the degrees) are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fully wrought in the perſon rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, before repentance doe begin to be wrought in him.</p>
                           <p>But it is not true, that repentance is no part of regeneration, ſeeing it is one of the chiefe graces of God, wherein the change that is wrought in men by regeneration doth conſiſt, and the fruits of repentance in amendment of life, are the chiefe ſignes and markes, whereby it is manifeſted and diſcerned. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where (for proofe of their reaſon) they further alledge, that regeneration is not begun before faith in Chriſt: I ſay, that this Propoſition is as falſe as the other, being underſtood of a ſaving faith fully wrought, (for ſo it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the queſtion.) For though it be true, (which is not queſtioned) that when a ſaving faith is wrought in a man, he may be truly ſaid to be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet is it not true, (which is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but not proved) that till a ſaving faith bee wrought in a child of God, there is no regeneration ſo much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in him.</p>

                           <p>I confeſſe alſo, that the beginnings of regeneration, (wrought by certaine preparing graces thereunto, whereof I ſpake a little before) are not ſufficient to ſalvation, unleſſe it be perfited in all the parts thereof; and except a ſaving faith doe afterwards inſue, to perfect it, and to make it acceptable: and yet for all that, I am of opinion, that rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is begun, before a ſaving faith be fully wrought; and that repentance is begun, before regeneration bee perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and conſequently, that repentance is begun before a ſaving faith.</p>

                           <p>And firſt, the conſideration of that which I have ſaid touching the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of repentance to faith in Chriſt, in that manner and meaſure, as I have ſaid,may ſufficiently confute their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, who thinke, that a ſaving faith is fully wrought in men, before any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance begin to be wrought in them; to which opinion they have bin drawn, partly by colour of ſome places of Scripture which ſeeme to fauour it; whereunto I have already given a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and (as I hope) a ſufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, to which I referre the Chriſtian Reader.</p>
                           <p>If there be any thing in our Divines that ſeemes to contradict that which I
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:8237:161"/>
have ſaid touching this point, namely, if by any of them it be affirmed indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, that <hi>faith goes before repentance</hi>; I humbly pray the Reader not to ſtumble at it, becauſe it doth not croſſe that which I have ſaid; for I have often ſaid as much: but to know and remember, that thoſe Divines doe not ſpeake of ſuch a faith and repentance as I doe; as ſhall be ſhewed in foure particulars:</p>
                           <p>Firſt, where they ſay, <hi>Faith goes before repentance,</hi> their meaning is, a beliefe of the Goſpell goes before repentance, which I never denyed: and where I ſay, <hi>Repentance goes before faith,</hi> my meaning is, not before a beliefe of the Goſpell; but before faith in Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, if it may be prooved, that any of them in that ſentence ſpeake of faith in Chriſt, then where they ſay, <hi>Faith goes before repentance,</hi> their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, a ſpeciall faith in Chriſt goes before repentance bee fully wrought, perfected and accepted; which I have plainely affirmed: and where I ſay, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance goes before faith in Chriſt,</hi> my meaning is, onely that repentance is begun before faith in Chriſt; and that a true (though a weake) meaſure of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is begun in men, before they
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:8237:162"/>
can truſt in Chriſt for ſalvation.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, where they ſay, <hi>Faith goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repentance,</hi> they meane, that faith in Chriſt goes before the practice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or the bringing foorth of fruites worthy amendment of life; which is the putting off the Old man, and putting on the New man in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our lives, and whereby the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of the heart is manifeſted: all which I acknowledge with them. And where I ſay, <hi>Repentance goes before faith,</hi> my meaning is, that repentance is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the heart; and that a true pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſolution of heart to leave our former evill wayes, and to ſerve God in a new converſation for time to come, is begun in men before they can goe to Chriſt, to be eaſed of their ſins, or truſt in him to be ſaved, which I thinke none of them ever meant to deny.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, where they ſay, <hi>Faith goes before repentance,</hi> they meane, faith in Chriſt muſt goe, before repentance can be acceptable to God, which I confeſſe. And where I ſay, <hi>Repentance goes before faith,</hi> I doe not meane, that this begun repentance can be acceptable unto God to our ſalvation, before we beleeve in
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:8237:162"/>
Chriſt; but that it is onely begun as a preparation to make as fit perſons to beleeve in Chriſt; and by beleeving, to crave pardon of our ſinnes for his ſake; which I never read, any of them did deny. So that how ever at firſt ſight there may ſeeme to be ſome difference in iudgement betwixt my ſelfe and ſome of our Divines, that ſpeake gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and indefinitely of faiths going before repentance; yet by applying the diſtinctions that I have made of faith and repentance, there will be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction indeed in this point betwixt me and them, but an eaſie way of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and conſequently of conſent herein.</p>
                           <p>Yet am I not ignorant, that there be ſome Lutherans that oppoſe this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that I have delivered; and I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo much the more at it, becauſe (as hath beene formerly proved) they hold faith in Chriſt to be an aſſured perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſalvation by Chriſt; which I know not how poſsibly they can iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie by the Word, in as much as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible, any Chriſtian ſhould be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly and fully perſwaded of his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before he hath repented: which yet muſt be true, if to beleeve in Chriſt,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:8237:163"/>
be to be fully aſſured of ſalvation by Chriſt; and this faith be wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any beginning of repentance.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The point I have delivered tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the beginning of repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith in Chriſt, may teach us how to know, whether or no, we have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith; namely, if before we truſted in Chriſt for ſalvation; our hearts began to turne to God, to reſolve to leave our former evill courſes, and to leade a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. It ſerves to reprove all thoſe ſuch carnall Goſpellers, which preſume they have a ſaving faith; and will ſay, they truſt they ſhall be ſaved, though they live in their former ſinnes, and have no reſolution begun in their hearts (upon the grounds I have formerly mentioned) to ſerve God better, then they have done.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. In the fourth place it may be a ground of great comfort to thoſe, that have beene ſo prepared to beleeve in Chriſt, as I have ſaid, and that have the beginning of repentance wrought in them: for they may build upon it, that if the Lord after this manner have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to ſeeke to be ſaved, and to go to Chriſt for it; that is, to beleeve
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:8237:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the merit of his death and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the ſame; and be ſure that their faith is ſound indeed, and that they are fit perſons to beleeve in Chriſt for pardon.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, this that hath beene delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, touching the precedency of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to faith in Chriſt, may be a ground of exhortation:</p>
                           <p>Firſt, to Miniſters, to be wary how they preach this doctrine, That faith goes before repentance; and that they expound it, <hi>viz.</hi> that a beliefe of the Goſpell doth goe before repentance; but that repentance is begun, before a ſaving faith can be wrought, (that is) before we can truſt in Chriſt for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with any hope to receive it.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, to Chriſtians: 1. That if they have bin otherwiſe minded, then I have taught, that they would alter and rectifie their iudgement herein, and learne to diſtinguiſh betwixt a beliefe of the Goſpell in generall, and faith or affiance in Chriſt in ſpeciall; becauſe though that faith which is a beliefe of the Goſpell, goe before repentance, yet that faith which is a truſt, or reſting, or relying on Chriſt for ſalvation, followes the beginning of repentance, as I have
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:8237:164"/>
ſaid.<note place="margin">Rule 6.</note> 2. That they would try their faith by this Rule, that ſo they may bee the fitter to try it alſo by the fruits which follow faith, which is the next Rule of Tryall.</p>

but this is not all, nor enough; for as there doe go before faith in Chriſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine workes of the Spirit that doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us thereunto; ſo doe there follow many workes of the Spirit, as fruites and effects of faith, that doe declare, it is not a dead, but a lively faith indeed; and this ſhall be the ſixt Rule, by which we are to try our faith, to the end wee may diſcerne, whether wee have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith or no; accordingly as we ſhal diſcerne wee have theſe fruites in us, or no.</p>
                  <p>In the handling of this point, I will obſerve this method: 1. I will prove, that a ſaving faith is lively and effectual to produce many holy actions in them that have it. 2.

                  <p>To prove the firſt point, <hi>viz.</hi> that a

                  <p>This appeares not onely by the very next words, where two of thoſe effects are named, <hi>viz. Hope and Love</hi>; but alſo by the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy works,</hi>

                     <p>I know alſo that there is a difference
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:8237:174"/>
in the fruits of the faith of beleevers, and in their meaſure of grace, as well as in their faith: For ſome have a ſtronger faith then others, and therefore they have a greater meaſure of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, obedience, love, patience, thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and other graces: but for all this, hee that hath a weake faith in Chriſt, hath ſome obedience, ſome loue to God, he hath ſome feare to offend him, and ſome care to pleaſe him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no man deceiue himſelfe, to thinke that as yet hee hath faith in Chriſt, except hee have ſome of theſe fruits.</p>
                     <p>I doe not meane, that becauſe a man hath not theſe fruits now, nor this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith now, he ſhall never have it; for though hee have beene careleſſe heretofore; yet beeing better taught, by this and other meanes of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he may labour to get it, and ſo have it, and the fruit of it: but this I meane, that if a man live and dye without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and new obedience, without loue to God, or to his neighbour, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a true faith in Chriſt, nor can euer be ſaued.</p>
                     <p>I might heere make other uſes of this point, as namely, of confutation of the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:8237:175"/>
Papiſt, who ſlanders us that we doe not vrge workes, nor preſſe our hearers to a holy life; they may here bee confuted: for wee teach men to try the truth of their faith, by the fruits of it, which are manifold.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I might heere reproue all thoſe who would bee taken for good Chriſtians, and yet are they wicked in their liues and converſations, either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly by profaneneſſe, or ſecretly by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie.</p>

                  <p>IN this Chapter is contained the 7. Rule of Tryall, whereby wee may find whether or no we have a ſaving faith, namely, by examining our ſelves touching our endevour after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of it; and here I would have it to be noted, that I do not make the tryall, whether wee feele them in us or no at all times; or at all times in like meaſure: for this would deceive many weake Chriſtians, who though ſometimes they want the feeling of theſe comforts of faith, yet may they have a ſaving faith for all that: but my <hi>quaere</hi> is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Secondly, I will in particular ſhew what theſe comforts be. Thirdly, I will ſet downe the meanes by which a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith becomes thus comfortable. Fourthly, I wil declare why men ſhould labour for theſe comforts. Fifthly, I will teach, how men ſhall labour in the uſe of the meanes for theſe comforts. Sixtly and laſtly, I will make a briefe application of the Rule, to the end the Reader may examine himſelfe by it, and accordingly deale as hee finds by tryall: and of each of them a little.</p>

                     <p>In the fift place, I am to ſhew how Chriſtians ſhould labour in the uſe of meanes to attaine theſe comforts, and what meanes they ſhould uſe to that end. The meanes are, 1.

                     <p>Now come I to conclude this Rule,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:8237:181"/>
and to make application thereof. That which I have ſaid touching theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of faith, may ſerve, Firſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the opinion of profane men, and carnall Goſpellers, who imagin in their hearts, and ſpeake with their mouths, that there is no ioy nor comfort in faith and Religion; that godly men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are quite without any mirth; and that the profeſsion of the Goſpel is an utter enemy to all pleaſure and ioyes. Indeed to ſinfull and carnall pleaſure it is, but not to all pleaſure and ioy: for godly men have a liberty to partake in many lawfull pleaſures, and recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they are not debarred of them, though they belong to the ſenſes, and members of their bodies; and as for their inward ioyes, they are unſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious; though wicked men cannot (as long as they continue wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) be acquainted with them; becauſe they are not fit perſons to receive them.<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, this that I have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the comforts of faith, may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproove many profeſſors in the Church, and carnall Goſpellers, that do not labour for them, though they are to be had; and though being had, they bee ſo neceſſary and excellent. The reaſon
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:8237:182"/>
is, becauſe they are ſenſuall, and their hearts are ſo ſtuffed with carnall ioyes, and taken up with worldly pleaſures, that there is no roome for holy, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and heavenly ioyes to lodge and harbor. Let ſuch men take heed that go on in the eager purſuite of them, and careleſſe neglect of the other, that they be not in the number of them, that have already <hi>received their conſolation</hi>;<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this diſcourſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of faith, may ſerve to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, what is the way to get holy and heavenly comfort, namely, to get a ſaving faith; as beeing the cauſe, root, and fountaine of them, as hath beene ſhewed in the ſecond Section of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it ſerves to exhort us all to labour for theſe comforts, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves, whether we labour for them, and hunger after them.</p>
                     <p>If we doe not, then are wee ſenſuall and carnall either in whole or in part, according as we are negligent of them: let us therefore reprove our ſelves for this neglect, and feare that as yet wee have not the ſaving faith it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="331" facs="tcp:8237:182"/>Indeed, if either there were no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to bee had by a ſaving faith; or if theſe comforts were but meane; or if they were not durable, then might wee have ſome plea for our negligence in getting a ſaving faith, and the comforts of it: but ſeeing they are poſsible to bee attained; being attained, they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be enioyed; being enioyed, they are permanent and may be kept: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we moſt worthy of ſharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, if we labour not for them.</p>
                     <p>But if on the other ſide, wee find by tryall, that in ſome meaſure wee feele theſe comforts, whereby wee taſte <hi>how ſweet the Lord</hi> is to us, then have we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to aſſure our ſelves wee have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith indeed, as alſo we have good encouragement further to apply them to our ſoules; which if we doe, we ſhall not need to <hi>feare againe unto bondage,</hi>

                     <p>For firſt, what though Satan tels thee thou art a ſinner? yet God tels thee in the Word, that by faith in Chriſts death and righteouſneſſe, thou art accounted

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, what though Satan tel thy conſcience, thou art a tranſgreſſour of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and therefore that thou art lyable to the curſe? yet God tels thee in the Word, that <hi>from all things from which thou canſt not be iuſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>every one that beleeves in Chriſt is iuſtified</hi>:<note place="margin">

                     <p>That Chriſtians muſt labour to ſtrengthen their faith, appeares by the

                     <p>Touching the ſecond point, although
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:8237:185"/>
theſe three plaine Texts are ſufficient to perſwade any reaſonable man to labour to ſtrengthen his faith; yet for a better inforcing of this point, I will adde ſome reaſons why they muſt ſo doe, whereof ſome are taken from the neceſsitie of this duty, and ſome from the fruit and benefit of it. The Reaſons that are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the neceſsity of labouring to ſtrengthen our faith, are three.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is borrowed from the nature and condition of our faith in this life, which is but weake and imperfect, and therefore hath need to be ſtrengthened; for wee know in part,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9.</note> wee beleeue in part;<note place="margin">Simil.</note> ſo that as men doe therefore take foode and Phyſicke for the ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their bodies, becauſe they are fraile, weake and mortall; ſo therefore ſhould Chriſtians uſe the meanes of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall food and Phyſick, for the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of their ſoules unto eternall life; namely, becauſe their faith is weak for the moſt part.</p>
                     <p>My ſecond Reaſon that prooves it it neceſſary for Chriſtians to ſtrengthen their faith, is drawne from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Satans malice, who uſeth all meanes to weaken it; yea, quite to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert and ouerturne it (if it were poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:8237:185"/>
as may be ſeene in the caſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> who was <hi>winnowed by Satan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.31.</note> 
                        <hi>that his faith might faile.</hi> For I demand, if a houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to ſinke or reele of one ſide,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> will we not put vnder ſome ſhore to prop it vp? Or if any man queſtion the Title of Land we have purchaſed, will wee not ſearch Records, and uſe meanes to ſtrengthen our Title? Or if an enemy lay ſiege to a Citie to conquer it; or a thiefe ſeeke to breake into an houſe to rob it: will not the Inhabitants of that Citie, or that houſe, fortifie and defend it? if they doe not, they are worthy to be made Vaſſals, and be ſpoiled of their goods. Euen ſo, when Chriſtians doe know that Satan labours to weaken their faith; yea, wholly (if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) to ſubuert it, they have reaſon to ſtrengthen the ſame, ſpecially, ſeeing by faith <hi>wee ſtand in the grace and favour of God</hi>: by being ſtedfaſt in the faith,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22.</note> 
                        <hi>wee reſist Satan</hi>: ſeeing <hi>faith is our victory,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. 1. <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.4.</note> whereby we ouercome the world: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith is a <hi>breſt-plate,</hi> or Corſlet,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8.</note> whereby we beare off all the ſtrokes of Satan, that they cannot hurt us to death; yea, <hi>it is the Shield</hi> and armour of proofe, whereby <hi>wee quench all the fiery darts of the Divell,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17.</note> that they cannot
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:8237:186"/>
wound us vnto damnation.</p>
                     <p>The third reaſon enforcing a neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſtrengthening our faith, is taken from the conſideration of the nature and condition of the life of Chriſtians in this world, which is ſubiect by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, to many tryals that require ſtrength of faith to undergoe them, and to make uſe of them, that wee faile not vnder them. For upon this ground <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the Chriſtians at Antioch to continue in the faith;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22.</note> becauſe <hi>we muſt through many tribulations, enter into the Kingdome of Heaven</hi>: and upon the ſame ground <hi>Paul</hi> ſends <hi>Timothy</hi> to the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi> Chriſtians, to <hi>ſtabliſh and comfort them in their faith, to the end they might not bee mooved by the afflictions of thoſe times,</hi> which hee told them beforehand they muſt ſuffer, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. And no marvell: for when the ſtormy tempeſts of affliction and perſecution beat upon us, how ſhall we be able to ſtand, if wee be not deepely founded on a Rocke? Surely a ſilly Woman will make us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our Maſter, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, if we be not ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; and if in feeling of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our faith, wee labour not in the uſe of meanes to ſtrengthen it.</p>

                     <p>The firſt is this, that if wee uſe meanes to ſtrengthen our faith, we ſhall increaſe our ſpirituall comfort; for the ſtronger our faith is, the ſtronger is the conſolation, the ſweeter are the comforts, and the more permanent are the ioyes of our ſoules, that proceede from our ſaving faith within us.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond benefit of ſtrengthening our faith is, that hereby we ſhall finde in us the more, and the more liuely fruits of our faith in holy obedience: for the ſtronger our faith is, the more conſtant and conſcionable ſhall be our ſerving of God, in caring to pleaſe him, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to offend him; for hereby we ſhall draw downe from the death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, <hi>dwelling in our hearts by faith, Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. more ſtrength to dye to ſinne, and to walke in newneſſe of life.</p>
                     <p>The third and laſt benefit of ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening our faith, is, continuance and perſeverance in the faith, whereby wee

ſhall come to attaine to the end of our faith, which is the ſalvation of our ſoules. For we ſhall be <hi>preſented, holy and unblameable before God at Chriſts ſecond comming,</hi>

It remaines ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the next place, that I ſhew what the meanes be which God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for that end. And of theſe, the firſt is, the continuall hearing of the Word, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the obiect of a ſaving faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the Goſpell.

this end doth <hi>Peter</hi> command the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Iewes, <hi>as new born babes,</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond meanes to ſtrengthen our faith, is the frequent uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper.</p>
                     <p>For if Circumciſion were a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</note> why not the Lords Supper alſo, being a Sacrament as well as it, and a Sacrament of the New Covenant or Teſtament? I do not meane, that the Sacraments confirm the promiſe of the Goſpell in it ſelfe, nor in reſpect of God, but in regard of us, who by reaſon of our weake faith, ſtand in need of the confirmation thereof, and who without it, ſhould not bee ſo ſure of obtaining ſalvation by faith in Chriſt, as otherwiſe with it wee are: And therfore (me thinks) hath the Lord Ieſus ordained ſpecially one of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the New Teſtament in a Supper, and in Bread and Wine; not onely to teach us, that now he hath put
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:8237:188"/>
an end to all the carnall &amp; fleſhly ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; offrings of the Law, by this Bread and Wine repreſenting himſelfe: but alſo to teach thereby,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.14.15.</note> that as Bread and Wine doe naturally nouriſh our bodies: ſo the benefits of the body and bloud of Chriſt crucified comfort our ſoules; and not ſo onely, but that the ordinance of the Lords Supper doth alſo nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, increaſe, and ſtrengthen our faith in the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, there repreſented for the further aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our ſalvation thereby; euen as thoſe creatures nouriſh our bodies.</p>
                     <p>The third meanes of ſtrengthening our faith is the frequent uſe, and feruent exerciſe of Prayer to God, in the name of Chriſt, the obiect of our faith. This the Apoſtles knew, and therefore doe they all pray to the <hi>Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 17.5.</note>

                           <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord, I beleeue,</hi> he prayes in the next words, as in one breath, <hi>Lord, helpe my unbeliefe</hi>: &amp; no marvell for if Prayer bee a meanes to obtaine a bleſsing of ſtrength, to the meanes that God is pleaſed to give us for the preſervation of our corporall ſtrength, and bodily life:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 4.</note> then well may it bee a meane
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:8237:188"/>
to obtaine ſtrength to our faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſts our ſpirituall ſtrength. If Prayer bee a meane to ſtrengthen the faith of other Chriſtians,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9.</note> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in them other graces, then why ſhould it not be a meanes to ſtrengthen our faith in Chriſt, and to increaſe it for the further comfort of our ſoules in Chriſt, in whom our faith is fixed?</p>
                     <p>The fourth and laſt meanes that I will mention for the ſtrengthening of our faith, is the meditation on the power, truth, goodneſſe, and mercy of God, in performing of his promiſes made unto us in Ieſus Chriſt, both of grace and glory; ſpecially for ſpirituall bleſsings in heavenly things: for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee are the rather aſſured that he is able and willing to make them good.</p>
                     <p>For as the conſideration of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and ſufficiencie of a man that makes us a promiſe of any thing,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> giues us good incouragement to beleeue wee ſhall have it, and make us with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to expect it: euen ſo the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods power, truth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, doth ſtrengthen our faith to make us reſt in him, and truſt unto him for the good things promiſed: yea, with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to expect the receiving of them.<note place="margin">

And this ſhall appeare: 1. By the promiſes of God, 2. By the examples of the godly.</p>
                     <p>The promiſes are generall or ſpeciall. Generall,<note place="margin">

                     <p>This point likewiſe is made plaine by the examples of the godly in the Word,
