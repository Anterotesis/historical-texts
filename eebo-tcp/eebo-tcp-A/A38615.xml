         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe ſame Spirit which
caſt the man poſſeſt
ſometimes into the fire,
and ſometimes into the water,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61417:5"/>
aſſays to drive us from one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
to another. The
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in all the acts
of her devotions, affects a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
iteration of the Lords
Prayer, out of an opinion that
the words, or the number of
their repetitions, carry ſome
ſecret vertue. Many at this day
are fallen into a ſuperſtition
quite contrary, ſhunning the
words of this Prayer as a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
rock, or a ſtone of
ſtumbling: Some others who
dare not flatly condemn the
Uſe of this Prayer, make never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
a ſcruple to pronounce
it ordinarily, deſiring rather to
paſſe it by with ſilence; ſo that
this Prayer is found baniſhed
from Families and publike Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61417:5"/>
where it was wont to
reſound: This Candle which
was ſet on the Candleſtick to
give light to all them of the
houſe, is at this day buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a buſhel. If there were none
but Hereticks, or Unbeleevers,
who attempt to forbid it, we
might taxe them with irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and contempt towards
Jeſus Chriſt: but becauſe theſe
people make profeſſion to be
otherwiſe Orthodox, one is
not moved at this novelty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that heretofore we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
it as prodigious.</p>
            <p>That we may ſee then the
buſineſſe in queſtion, We are
not ſo literal that we condemn
every other form of Prayer, or
that we admit not of other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61417:6"/>
words; but men may uſe other
Prayers, and not omit this. It
is a bold attempt to blot out
the memory of ſuch a Prayer.
A Prayer uſed to this preſent
time by all the Churches of
God, ancient and modern,
throughout all the Univerſal
World. A Prayer dictated by
the ſupreme Wiſdom of that
great and eternal Mediator,
who preſents our Prayers to
God, and who perfectly knows
his Fathers minde. The moſt
compleat Prayer that can be
made, ſumming up all the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
requeſts which can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
A Prayer which is the
Epitome, the Miror, and the
Rule of all others. A Prayer
which in its wonderful brevity
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61417:6"/>
includes ſo great a plenty and
variety of matters, as if it
would cauſe a Camel to paſſe
through a needl's eye. A Prayer
which contains more Hiſtories
and more Myſteries then words.
A Prayer in ſum the moſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical,
the moſt Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
the moſt Divine that can
be framed: For all the parts of
this Prayer cohere with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Symetrie: All of it is
exactly made, in meaſure and
proportion: All of it is full of
torches which enlighten each
other: One Petition relates to
another: And theſe ſame men
confeſſe, That neither all the
wits of the Earth, nor all the
Angels of Heaven, were ever
capable to dictate the like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61417:7"/>
Did <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> then dictate
this Prayer to the end we
ſhould not uſe it at all? On the
contrary, he ſayes unto us, <hi>Pray
thus, Our Father which art in
Heaven.</hi> To this, they anſwer
that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> commands us
to pray <hi>thus,</hi> that is to ſay, in
the ſame ſenſe, but not in the
ſame words. Be it ſo. But then
he ſayeth (<hi>Luke 11.) When you
pray, ſay, Our Father which art in
Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> Forbids he to pray
in the ſame words? Becauſe he
teacheth us to ſay <hi>Our Father
&amp;c.</hi> may we conclude that we
ought not to ſay it? It advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageth
not to alledge that if this
were a Command, we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to ſay this Prayer, and
never any other. This is as if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61417:7"/>
one ſhould ſay, it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to pray to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is ſaid, <hi>Pray without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi>
1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 17. As if we
ought to do nothing elſe but
pray unto God. But ſuppoſe
that this is no Command, and
that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
alwayes to pronounce
this Prayer: neither hath he
forbad to ſay it often, much
leſſe never.</p>
            <p>The pretence is nothing, that
it ſufficeth to expreſſe the ſenſe
and meaning of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in
this Prayer, although we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
not his words: For that
we may expreſſe his meaning,
muſt we ſuppreſſe his words?
Or can we better expreſſe the
ſenſe and meaning of <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61417:8"/>
Chriſt,</hi> then by the very words
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf?</p>
            <p>What have they then to ſay
againſt the common Uſe of this
Prayer? Certainly
<list>
                  <item>Either is not lawful,</item>
                  <item>Or it is not neceſſary,</item>
                  <item>Or it is not expedient.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Let us view theſe in order.
Is it then unlawful to utter this
Prayer? This cannot be ſaid.
It ſhall be no more allowed to
read it; but two places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are to be raced, wherein it
is found, <hi>Matth. 6. Luke.</hi> 11. Nor
doth it help at all to ſay that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
abuſe of it. This is the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherewith our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
forbid the people the
Scriptures. If <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf hath
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61417:8"/>
uttered them; if the Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſhould employ the Pſalms
and terms of the Goſpel, muſt
we therefore refrain from ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
them? If it is unlawful
to ſpeak them ſuperſtitiouſly,
ſhall it be unlawful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them piouſly? And if
it be permitted in Prayer to uſe
our own words, ſhall it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to uſe the words of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt,</hi> which are the Rule
of ours?</p>
            <p>It is lawful then; <hi>but</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>it is not neceſſary.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
Grant that it is in no
wayes neceſſary to pronounce
this Prayer, is it neceſſary to
omit it? If it is indifferent to
pronounce it or omit it, ought
we for an indifferency to bring
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61417:9"/>
a difference in the Church? to
affect a novelty? to break an
Univerſal Order? and to raiſe
ſcruples in mens conſciences?
But beſides, there are degrees
of indifferency as well as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.
Will they ſay that the
Uſe or omitting of this Prayer
are in the ſame rank of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,
as the uſe or abſtinence
from certain meats? Certainly
that which ſerves for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is not at all indifferent.
Will they ſay then, that the
words of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſerve not
for edification? Although they
dare not ſay it expreſly, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
they ſay as much; for
they maintain that it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to pronounce them.
This is the knot of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61417:9"/>
and all the Diſpute is
brought to this Point.</p>
            <p>Wherefore then is it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to ſay this Prayer in
the very words wherein <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> did dictate it? What
great inconveniencies ariſe
thence? What loſſe to Gods
Glory? What hinderance to
the ſalvation of mens ſouls?
What ruine to the building of
the Church?</p>
            <p>Thereupon they alledge,
<list>
                  <item>That we muſt not be tyed to words.</item>
                  <item>That there is danger to idolize the
words in pronouncing them ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</item>
                  <item>That the attention that is given to
the ſyllables, tyes up the ſpirit, and
diverts the thoughts.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61417:10"/>
That this frequent pronunciation is
a vain repetition condemned by
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf.</item>
                  <item>That this Prayer doth not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <head>A general anſwer to theſe

               <p>TO all this I will firſt oppoſe
a general anſwer, which
ſhall overthrow the greateſt
part of their Objections. Theſe
men cannot deny, which is moſt
manifeſt, that ſometimes God
hath preſcribed ſeveral Forms
of Prayer and other actions
uſual in the Church, to the end
that they ſhould be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
word by word. Such was
the Form of the Bleſſing which
the Prieſts uſually pronounced
over the people in the very
words which are read in the
ſixth Chapter of the Book of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61417:11"/>
                  <hi>Numbers.</hi> Such was the Form of
Thankſgiving preſcribed in the
offering of the firſt fruits,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 26. Such was the Form of
the Proteſtation and Prayer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated
in expreſſe words to
them which came to pay their
triennial tythes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. Such
was the Form of Prayers which
<hi>Moſes</hi> commonly uſed when the
<hi>Ark</hi> was ſet forwards, or when
it reſted, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 35, 36. Such
was the Form of Prayers, or
Thankſgiving, which they ſung
dayly in the Church; for, were
not the Pſalms for the moſt part
Prayers or Thankſgivings? and
were they not pronounced and
ſung uſually? I forbear to ſay,
that every company of Singers
was expreſly tyed to certain
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61417:12"/>
Pſalms, as if it were to one task,
as it appears by their titles. The
Pſalm 92. was ſung every <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
as we read in the fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpice
thereof. Conſider here
why God would dictate
Prayers in form of verſes, if it
were not to the end that they
ſhould be pronounced word by
word? For it is well known
that it is a difficult thing to
change the words of a line
which is tyed to meaſures and
fallings of the Art of Poetry.
Nay, more: For we have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Pſalms wherein God
would have us obſerve even
the very letters of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.
The 25 Pſalm which is a
Prayer, and comes near in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to the Lords Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61417:12"/>
almoſt every one of its
verſes according to the Order
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Alphabet. The
34. 111. 112. and the 119. are
of the ſame ſtructure; this laſt
notably in each of his eights,
anſwering eight times to the
number and order of the 22 let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Every one acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
that by this Method God
would eaſe mans memory, to
the end that the moſt forgetful
might eaſily retain the words of
the holy verſes, whoſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
were ranked in the form
of <hi>A. B. C.</hi> Did he mean then
that we ſhould neglect the
words thereof, ſince he would
they ſhould be punctually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
even to the very leaſt
letter? I might ſay alſo that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61417:13"/>
there are Pſalms, as the 118.
and the 134. which expreſſe a
Dialogue betwixt the Prieſts
and the people. This inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
diſcourſe, conſiſting
in a reciprocal communication
of the one with the other, could
not be kept without an exact
obſervation of words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they anſwered each other.
But beſides, in the Reformation
of the Church, which the good
King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> procured when
there was queſtion made of the
re-eſtabliſhing the holy <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>
the <hi>Levites</hi> were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to praiſe the <hi>Lord</hi> with the
words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Aſaph,</hi> that
is to ſay, to pronounce or ſing
the very words of the Pſalms,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 30. It appeareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61417:13"/>
that in the Celebration of the
<hi>Paſſeover,</hi> there was the Form of
a Song, which was alwayes uſed
at this Solemnity. And <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> himſelf at the end of this
Action, when he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for Death, made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to pronounce it, and
would that his Diſciples ſhould
pronounce it with him, <hi>Matth.</hi>
26.</p>
               <p>If theſe people who condemn
at this day the Uſe of the Lords
Prayer, had lived in thoſe
dayes, they would have cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
the Wiſdom of God for
having preſcribed Forms of
Prayers, and for having bound
the Church to pronounce them
word by word: For the ſame
reaſons which they bring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61417:14"/>
againſt the Uſe of this Prayer,
the ſame inconveniencies which
they find here, the ſame eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
by which they decline and
ſhun the pronunciation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
all theſe may be alledged
againſt all the Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Bleſſings, and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
which God had impoſed
upon his own people. Could
not one have ſaid, <hi>That one
ought not to tye himſelf to the words
of theſe Forms, and that it ſufficeth
to ſpeak in the ſame ſenſe?</hi> and
<hi>That the ſpirit ought not to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
That by amuſing themſelves at
the words, good thoughts are loſt?
That theſe are continual repetitions?
That theſe ſet Prayers expreſſe not
all that ought to be ſaid? That there
is danger leſt they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61417:14"/>
to Idols?</hi> and in ſum,
<hi>That it was expedient to ſuppreſſe
the Uſe thereof?</hi> This is a ſtrange
thing that God never foreſaw
theſe inconveniencies!</p>
               <p>I am amazed that theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have not alſo aboliſhed the
ordinary ſinging of Pſalms; for
if their maxim be worth any
thing, it is as bad to pronounce
them as to pronounce the
Lords Prayer. If one ought not
to tye himſelf to the words of
this Prayer, Why to the words
of the Pſalms? If we ought
not to bind up the ſpirit, Is it
more bound up by the words
of this Prayer, then by the
words of a Pſalm? If the words
of this Prayer divert the
thoughts of him that prayeth,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61417:15"/>
Shall not the ſinging of a Pſalm
aſtoniſh them? If we ought
not to rehearſe this Prayer, if
it doth not particularize all the
occurrences, if there be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to idolize the words, May
not one ſay as much of any
Pſalm whatſoever? Nay, more:
For we ſing many Pſalms which
concerns us not ſo much, or
wherein we have not ſo much
intereſt as in the Lords Prayer.
In them we pronounce ſome
Prayers appointed expreſly for
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, upon occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
paſt, and which never
at any time befal us. There we
have requeſts, imprecations,
reaſonings, complaints, which
were Divine in <hi>Davids</hi> mouth;
but they are more diſputable
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61417:15"/>
in our mouths then the Lords
Prayer is. Why then doth this
Prayer more ſtick in our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks
then thoſe which are in
the Pſalms? Adde hereunto
that the Pſalms as we ſing them
in our vulgar tongues, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of words added by the
humane induſtry of our Poets:
So that this work, though moſt
excellent, is not alwayes ſo
Divine as the Lords Prayer.
Why then is it more inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to pronounce the very
words of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> then to
ſing thoſe that men have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced?
Furthermore, Since
that inſtead of the Lords Prayer
we finde it more to the purpoſe
to have Prayers after our own
faſhion, or framed according
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61417:16"/>
unto occaſions; Why inſtead
of Pſalms do we not dayly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Songs altogether new, to
ſing them in the Church? Is this
for want of Poetical capacity
that we are conſtrained to keep
a perpetual Form of Pſalms?
And if it be for edification to
pronounce them and rehearſe
them in the very words, Why
is not alſo the Lords Prayer,
which is the Abridgement of all
the Prayers contained within
the Pſalms?</p>
               <p>But I have more to ſay upon
every one of their Objections,
which now we muſt examine in

If this is to be received,

tranſlate it; for in a tranſlation
we ought as much as is poſſible

                  <p n="2">2. But the Objection is
doubtful; For if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that we are not ſo tyed to
the very words of this Prayer,
that it may not be permitted us
to uſe any other; this is that
which we ſay with them. But if
they mean under the ſhaddow
of this liberty, that we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
or ſuppreſſe the words of
this Prayer; this is that we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61417:17"/>
with them. For, becauſe
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> permits us to uſe
our own words, muſt we bury
his? Becauſe our own words
are allowed to paſſe, muſt we
cut down the words of the holy
Ghoſt? But on the contrary;
If ours are good, how much
more thoſe which he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated

to be from ſhunning the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of God, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,

                  <p n="1">1. THis is a ſtrange Paradox,
that the words of this

Idolatry, ſhould be ſuſpected
by us as capable to make us
commit Idolatry: For this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
teacheth us to call on none

theſe men ſay too, That we
are in danger to become Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Decalogue, if we
pronounce it very often? Shall
we make an Idol of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
which forbids Idols?
Certainly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is
not become idolatrous for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
too often pronounced the
words of this Commandment,
but rather for having neglected
them when they concealed them
from the people.</p>

The greateſt Idolatry which is
in the World, is founded upon

The very Name of God is ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
by the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That
the pronunciation thereof can work
all the greateſt miracles even to the

danger they finde in the Lords

other Prayer: For may not any

Thoſe which are vain. Vain they
are when one thinks that their
multiplication carryes ſome
vertue. Vain alſo if there be
want of underſtanding, of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or of Faith. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition

ſeeing the greateſt part

conſiſts not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing

alſo in rehearſing the ſame

when a man having named <hi>dirt,</hi>

                     <hi>mud?</hi> or after he hath ſpoken

are they not ſo many repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We may obſerve here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
that this paſſage which

forbids not onely vain repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but alſo multitude of
words. Wherefore do not theſe
men apprehend that there may
be as much vanity in the length
of their Prayers, wherein they
ſpend as much time as would
ſuffice for a good Sermon, as in
ſaying once the Lords Prayer?
Or is the tediouſneſſe of their

                  <p>It may be they will ask, <hi>How

For we are enjoyned to <hi>pray

                  <p n="1">1. IF this Argument might
take place, When we ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate

words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of

wholly omit the words of <hi>Jeſus

S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſo underſtand it;

                  <p n="2">2. This is a wrong Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that we ought not to take

of the difference which
we finde there. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whereas God repeats the
ſame thing in divers words, by
ſo much the more ought we to
mark them; for this difference
tends to the clearing of one

it by ſaying, <hi>Forgive us
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61417:31"/>

take the one or the other of
theſe two expreſſions: both
theſe two were dictated by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

difficulty ſo great in chuſing?
Or muſt we ſuppreſſe both
theſe two, becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
hath dictated both theſe two?</p>

That one of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts

                  <p n="2">2. As there is no man which
is aſſured to live a day, ſo there
is none that knows whether
this day ſhall be his laſt. Many
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61417:33"/>
touch the gates of death, which

thereof, as though he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured

this is alwayes under conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
In caſe that I have yet any
need thereof; In caſe that my

Is there any impertinence
in this Requeſt? Or ought we

4. It is well known that
this Petition is not reſtrained
to nouriſhment. In naming
<hi>bread,</hi> I preſuppoſe all that
which is neceſſary for my life,
the very air &amp; breathing. May I
not demand them for the time
which I have to live, though
indeed it were but for one very

glorifie God?</p>

                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would not

                  <p n="1">1. THere is indeed much to

If a man which feels in
himſelf any motion of hatred,
muſt ſuſpend the Uſe of this
Prayer: I ſay hereupon, If he
may not uſe this Prayer, he
may not uſe any other. In ſo
much, that to forbid a man the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61417:35"/>
Lords Prayer upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is to forbid him wholly to
pray to God in what form ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
This conſequence is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
by many reaſons. Firſt of
all, he cannot make a good
Prayer, if it be not agreeable (at
leaſt in ſubſtance) to the Lords
Prayer. Now this Prayer then
binds one to ſay, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives
his enemies; ſo that if
he ſays it not in the ſame words,
it behooves him notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he ſpeaks in the ſame
ſence. Beſides, can he make any
Prayer without asking forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his ſins? And ſeeing
that this remiſſion is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
him but upon condition
to pardon, can he deſire it
otherwiſe? <hi>For if ye forgive not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61417:36"/>
men their treſpaſſes, neither will I
forgive you yours, Matth.</hi> 6. 15. Nay
indeed, he cannot ask any thing
elſe of God without he be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to forgive. If he brings
an offering to the Altar, he
ought firſt to reconcile himſelf
to his Brother; otherwiſe all
his offerings, all his ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are of no worth. Adde
to this, that no man can
make a Prayer without proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he will obey God; for
in deſiring God that he will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
our will, we promiſe that
we will perform His. We ought
alſo to deſire that his Will may
be done. Now this is one Point
of the Will of God, that we

and that have no intention to

forſake their malice; but the
Queſtion is of them who
through infirmity, finde a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty

ſcarce power to ſay that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them that have offended
me? I anſwer alſo, Amongſt
the treſpaſſes whereof I ask
pardon, I count this, The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
which I have to pardon.
I deſire pardon for this, that it
is hard for me to give pardon:
And I deſire this grace that I
may pardon. This clauſe comes
then to this ſence; <hi>Forgive me,
as I pray that thou wouldſt give me
the grace to be able to forgive.</hi> Is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61417:37"/>
there any man that can ſtumble
at this? Is there alſo any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
that ought not thus to
ſpeak? It ſufficeth not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that theſe things are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different, to ſay that we
forgive, and to ſay that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
power to forgive: For he
that deſires ſincerely to have
power to be able to forgive,
hath already begun to forgive.
If that this forgiveneſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not yet from a heart per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
appeaſed, ſhall we defer
to pray to God until we become
perfect? until that we love per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
our neighbour, that is
to ſay, until we have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
all the Law?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But after all this, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that it is not lawful for a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61417:38"/>
man to ſay this Prayer whileſt
he is, though but a little, angry?
Is it then forbid to ſay it after
that there is no ſpark of wrath,
and that his heart is entirely
cleanſed from hatred? If he is
not in caſe to pronounce it at
one time, muſt he abſtain then
from it for ever? And beſides,
for ſome particular men who
have the ſpirit of revenge, and
may not ſay this Prayer, Muſt
all the Body of the Church be
forbidden it? Muſt the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſome men ſerve for a
Rule to all? Finally, Is this
well done by him that prays in
Publike, to ſit himſelf rather to
the malice of men, then to the
Rule of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>

Is it then more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

ſay it in words equivalent? And
likewiſe all the reſt of the

their paraphraſes of the ſame

of the Lords Prayer are Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical;

2. Note that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
ſays not, <hi>Ask your Father, That
his Name may be ſanctified, That he
give you your bread, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
how he ſpeaks: <hi>Say, Our

Hallowed be thy Name. Say, Give
us our bread. Say, Forgive us. Say,
Deliver us, &amp;c.</hi> Are not theſe
the terms and the form of a
Prayer? Can one better and
more expreſly put in ones

did <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
us to ſay them, mean the

ought not to ſay them?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe that they

                  <p n="4">4. If they will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

they afraid to lye in ſaying ſo?
or do they fear that this truth is
not well ſpoken?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I ſay, It is need that the
people ſhould be continually
inſtructed to pray well. Now
it is without Controverſie, that
it is impoſſible to make any
good Prayer, if it agree not, at
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61417:42"/>
leaſt in ſubſtance, with this
Form of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Is it not
then expedient that the people
hear often this Form, to the
end that they may ſee to what
Rule they ought to conform
their Prayers? We taxe the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for that ſhe
pronounceth not to the people
the ſecond Commandment of
the Decalogue; becauſe that
this ſilence hinders very many
from acknowledging the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
which they commit. Will
not the ſuppreſſion of this
Form cauſe the people, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as many poor ſouls who
neither can nor know how to
read the Scriptures, to forget
in the end this Prayer, and
know no more the Rule which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61417:43"/>
ought to be kept in praying to
God? In effect, theſe men do
as much as they can, to cauſe
the memory of it to be loſt.</p>
                  <p>To come to an end, Mark
alſo here the difference which
is betwixt the Prayers which are
of our own making, and the
Lords Prayer. There may be
ſaid as much as between the
Tabernacle and the Pattern
which God made <hi>Moſes</hi> ſee upon
the Mountain. The Pattern was
Celeſtial, framed immediatly
by the hand of God: The Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
was Earthly, and made
by the hand of man. The Lords
Prayer is all Celeſtial and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine:
Ours are, in part, from
mans induſtry; for we have not
the ſpirit in perfection. This
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61417:43"/>
fabrick of our ſpirit is alwayes
humane and imperfect: but the
Pattern is alwayes Divine and
perfect. There is no man ſo
knowing, ſo religious, who is
not ſubject to faile in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his Prayers. They are
ſubject to imperfection, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
to diſorders, to many ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities.
We are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
errour in this buſineſſe. We
are herein perpetually wanting;
either in omitting, or being
over-brief in one point, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedious
in another; or in raiſing
our thoughts out of their rank.
But in ſaying the Lords Prayer,
I am ſure I cannot faile to ſpeak
well, that I omit nothing, that
I ſpeak nothing ſuperfluous,
that I am not extravagant, that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61417:44"/>
there is no raſhneſſe in my
words. After then that I have
framed a Prayer according to
that which is poſſible for me,
I conſider the defects thereof;
and to repair them, I uſe this
which I know is altogether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Nay, I ſay, that after I have
preſented a Prayer of my own
faſhion, I ought to deſire of
God that he would help the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
thereof; and to theſe ends
I preſent unto him this which
his Son hath taught me. Is this
proceeding impertinent? Is
there any thing in it why we
ſhould reject the Uſe of this
Prayer?</p>
                  <p>I conclude then, We ought
to pronounce it. We ought,
becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath put it
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61417:44"/>
in our mouths. We ought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that this is the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all other Prayers. We
ought, becauſe this is the Rule
and Star which ought to guide
us in praying to God. We ought,
to reform the defects which
are in all our other Prayers. We
ought, becauſe that it is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,
for all perſons, for all
matters, at all times, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
This is a Prayer which all
the Churches of the World
pronounce: and this is a great
conſolation to me, that I ſhall
keep my part in this great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort.
This is a Prayer which I
can ſay in proſperity, in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;
in Peace, in War; in
health, in ſickneſſe; in life, in
death: the young man and the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61417:45"/>
old, the rich and poor, the
King and Shepheard, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it together.</p>
                  <p>Is not this a ſtrange thing,
that the words of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi>
ſhould become ſuſpected by us?
If our Fathers, who have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo much to have the liberty
of pronouncing this Prayer in a
language that may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
which had ſo much care
to teach us to the end that we
ſhould have it alwayes in our
mouths, ſhould riſe at this day
from their graves, and ſhould
ſee that we attempt to forget
this Prayer; With what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
would they not cover
us? But, which is more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf who
bids you pronounce it. Whom
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61417:45"/>
will you obey; either him, or
them who ſtrive to perſwade
you the contrary? Fear not,
fear not to pronounce the
words of <hi>Jeſus Christ. Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> who dictated them to
you ſhall be your Warrant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and ſhall avouch
your words, ſince they are his
own. Carry them alwayes in
your hearts and upon your lips.
