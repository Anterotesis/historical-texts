         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It increaſeth in a lighte and grauelly grounde, and for the moſt part in a ſaltie ground. It alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in a wateriſh or moyſt ground, and all the yere long loueth to ſucke humiditie. Alſo ſome thinke that doung is hurtfull vnto it.</hi> We haue ſayde, that ſaltilhe ground is brooked well of this Palme tree. Therefore where no ſuche ſoyle is, they ſprinkle ſalte, not at the rootes, but a litle from it, &amp;c. Theſe after the ſame maner maye be ſpoken concerning fayth, and the Church. Fayth ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in the <hi>grauelly</hi> and <hi>ſaltiſh</hi> ground, that is, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite or broken heart through acknowledging of ſinne, and as the Palme trees haue neede of warmth and moyſture, ſo ſayth is kindled by the holy Ghoſt, and is watered by the ryuers of the Goſpell. And it is hurte of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18500:8"/>
doung, that is, by corruption of doctrine, &amp; the woundes of the conſcience. Furthermore as the Palme tree is fruitfull, ſo fayth is not fruitles, but effectuall by loue. And as the Palme tree beareth waighte of any thing layde vpon her, &amp; the more ſhe is borne downe, ſo muche more hyer ſhe ryſeth agayne: ſo fayth is the vanquiſher of ſorowes, &amp; amidſt afflictions ſpecially ſhineth. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the leaues of the Palme tree neuer fall of, ſo the fruits of the teachers are euerlaſting, as in the 15. chapter of John it is moſt comfortably ſayd: <hi>In this is my father glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, if ye be made my diſciples, and that you beare muche fruite, and that your fruite do continue.</hi>

into eternall deſtruction, and as it were vayne chaffe, ſhall be caſt into neuer ending tormentes.

Certaine it is that the name of iudgement is often times taken for a function or office. This is therfore the ſenſe, that the vngodly ones, as <hi>Annas, Caiphas,</hi> and others which beare a ſway in the world as Phariſees and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces (euer warring with God, and holding battell with the true Churche, yea although they ſeeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to be ſenſed with princely powers agaynſt all chaunces of fortune) yet they ſhall be caſt out of their ſtations, and ſhall be ſeperated from the true Churche, as thoſe which are accurſed of God. And although nowe and then puniſhments are deferred, and God doth not by and by execute this iudgement: yet as it is ſayd, <hi>Sera tamen tacitis, paena venit pedibus.</hi> Although late, yet puniſhment ſtealeth on.

                  <p>Furthermore of the diuine nature in Chriſt, moſt aſſured and moſt excellent teſtimonies may be taken out of this pſalme.

Secondly, that he might make ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our ſinnes, vpon the croſſe, and geue his holie spirit and euerlaſtinge ſaluation. With this doctrine are our mindes (through the holie Ghoſt) enflamed, that firſt they might trulie loue God: for we ſee him to burne in ſo great loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, that for our ſaluation, he ſpared not his owne onely Sonne.

The Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator is God, to thend he may delyuer our prayers and worſhippings vnto the Father and enter into the ſecret counſell or the godheade. For God as touchinge his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>dwelleth in a light vnaprochable,</hi> and is a conſuming fire. The ſame Mediator is man, to the end he might talke with vs familierly, and ſhewe vs the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not able to abide him ſpeaking in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. Furthermore this Mediator is man, by reaſon of the conflict and paſſion which he ſuffered, and he is God by reaſon of the victorie and tryumphe in his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aſcention. For the alone nature diuine can not ſuffer nor dye. Alſo the alone nature humaine is not the ouer commer of the world, that is, of ſinne, death and the deuil. Finally the Mediator is man, to the end he may do the office of a prieſt, which perteyneth vnto the doctrine and ſacrifice. The ſame mediator is God, to the end hee may do the offices of prieſthood touchinge interceſſion, and of a kinge, touching victorie triumphes, gyftes, and gouernment of the church. And although theſe caſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not throughly be ſeene, and are more nearer beholden in that ſame lyfe eternall: yet notwithſtanding it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that in this lyfe we thinke vpon the beginninges of this wiſdome, (that the admiration and deſire after the felowſhip with God) might be inflamed in vs, and that as thankful vnto him we ſhould praiſe him in theſe great benefites that the onely begotten Sonne of the eternall Father tooke vpon him nature of man, to ouercome death, and reſtore to vs lyfe, and gather together his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Church and be an interceſſor for vs.</p>

Aske of me, and I will giue thee nations for thine inheritance, and the coſtes of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi>
                     </hi> For in deede the Angels are not Lords ouer mankinde, but are created for the ſeruice of God and his Church. But this Lorde is heire of all things, becauſe by him, and for him, all things were created. Let vs therefore remember this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, and let vs adioyne the ſame vnto the other ſentences, which confirme the diuinitie of Chriſt, and confute blaſphemers. Moreouer ſo ofte as we ſpeake of the calling of the Gentiles, let theſe three things be chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly conſidered: Firſt, how great the force of the mercy of God is, gathering his Church of the miſerable maſſe or heape of Heatheniſh men, which are Idolaters, defiled with wicked ſlaughters, luſtes, theft, lyings, periuries,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18500:19"/>
and finally, with ſuch filthines, as my tong both trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth and eſcheweth to ſpeake of. And it is profitable in theſe hiſtories to conſider the greatnes of the mercy of God. We vſe to maruell leſſe, that God reuealed this Goſpell vnto the Jewiſh people, amongſt whom had remayned ſome doctrine touching God, and with whom there was ſome honeſt diſcipline. But let vs compare <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Neros</hi> time, vnto <hi>Nazareth.</hi> Firſt, the true God was altogether vnknowne at <hi>Rome,</hi> moſte men euery where were Athe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſts or godleſſe men: the reſidue wickedly worſhipped idols. Secondly, the whole Citie was full of moſt filthie luſtes, which were thought to be pleaſures, permitted, not worthy of puniſhment. Thirdly, money, bribing, and vſuries, were had in price of prayſe. Laſtly, no reuerence towards God, no ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe, neither regarde of any trueth and iuſtice. And yet God commaundes his Church to be gathered vnto him euen in ſuch a Citie, and ſuch then were the maners almoſt throughout all the world. In this example is the greatnes of Gods mercy ſeene, that vnto ſuche perſons where as diſcipline was ſo vtterly extinguiſht, euen the worde of God doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ounde, calling them vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, and offering them ſaluation. And at firſt it was thought a matter vnworthy amongſt the Jewes, that the Goſpell ſhould be preached and diſperſed amongſt thoſe curſed people, which liued in great filthines, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all diſcipline or good order. Here vpon happened thoſe conflictes of <hi>Paule,</hi> when he affirmed that the Goſpell pertayned to the Gentiles, and that free remiſſion of ſinnes, for Chriſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſake, was offered vnto all them which did repent. A great and wholeſome conſolation is it vnto the godly, to thinke vppon this greatnes of Gods mercy, which is ſpecially ſeene when we conſider how God diſperſeth his Goſpell amongſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe monſters of men, as then were the heathen, and as now are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18500:19"/>
Let vs knowe that this mercy of God is taught vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, ſo often as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion is made of gathering a Church, from among the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the calling of the Gentiles is an excellent Teſtimony touching the whole effect of the Goſpell, which conſiſteth in the vniuerſall preaching of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, and in an vniuerſall promiſe of grace. For, as God calleth all men vnto repentaunce, ſo vnto all which repent, and beleeue in his ſonne, doth he aſſuredly giue remiſſion of ſinnes, and requireth of vs that we beleeue this voyce of the goſpell, and call vpon him, in this fayth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the calling of the Gentiles teacheth vs the abrogation of the lawe, and confuteth the opinion of the Phariſees, which imagineth that men are iuſt, through the lawe, and the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes:</hi> But there is no diſcourſe equall vnto the greatnes of things which the doctrine touching calling of the Gentiles comprehendeth. Therefore I am nowe more briefe, and do procéede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the third place.</p>
                  <p>I haue declared before, that the kingdome of Chriſte differeth from other kingdomes, in forme of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in benefites, and in ſtabilitie. Now (if it pleaſe you) let vs adde the fourth difference, which is taken as of the endes. For in déede other kingdomes haue their limites and boundes, as the kingdome of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſtretched vnto <hi>Euphrates.</hi> For the <hi>Romanes</hi> neuer had any ſucceſſe in their warres with the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Parthians,</hi> and other people of the Eaſt partes, as the Hiſtories of <hi>Craſsius</hi> and <hi>Iulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and others do witneſſe. And yet although the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Monarchy contayned many Prouinces, yet was ſhe not the Lady of all Nations. But this our king hath moſt ample boundes, becauſe he ruleth from ſea to ſea, and from the floode vnto the ende of the world, as it is written in the Pſalme 72. But to what ende is al this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18500:20"/>
recitall of the boundes of the kingdome of Chriſt? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth to this purpoſe, that we maye vnderſtande, that the Church is not as a common wealth tyed vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne kingdomes, and compriſed within certayne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes. But all perſons whatſoeuer they be, which call vpon God in faith and in true acknowledgemente of Chriſt, and doe flee from idolatrie, are the members of Gods Church. Then are not the olde, neither yet the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Donatiſtes</hi> to be heard, which compriſe the Church within narrow limites or bondes. For as <hi>Donatus</hi> and they which procéeded from him, haue preſcribed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church within the onely boundes of <hi>Aphrica,</hi> So the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Doctors cry out, that the Church is bound vnto an ordinarie ſucceſſion of Biſhoppes, and that there is no true members of the Church out of their Pontificall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement. But let vs ſo ſurely perſwade our ſelues, that the Church is a congregation of the godly ones, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed throughout the whole world, which are tied to the worde deliuered by the Apoſtles, and that there are the members of the Church, whereſoeuer any doe embrace the pure doctrine of the goſpell. So at this day vnder the Turkes gouernment, and vnder the gouernment of other kinges and biſhops, enemies to the pure doctrine of the goſpel, there are ſome godly perſons diſperſed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where. But peraduenture ſome man would ſay, that all nations are not the heritage of Chriſt. Neither that Chriſt doth holde all men vnder the yoke of his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is nothing that wee can ſo eaſilie abſolue. For Chriſt is either Lord and Ruler of the gentiles in this reſpecte, that he might reſtore vnto them righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and life, eyther els is he the fearefull iudge of the wicked and diſobedyent. Therefore, they which wil not imbrace Chriſt as a Sauiour, ought to feare Chriſt as the Iudge ouer quick and dead. But it is now time that we come vnto the Expoſition of thoſe verſes which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne.</p>

                  <p>THe chiefeſt effectes or ſtinges which the preachings of the goſpel leaueth in the hearts of the hearers, are feare and faith. For as feare is oppoſed againſt the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which contemneth Gods iudgement: ſo faith is the ouercommer of doubting and deſperation. Wherefore if a man will comprehende the effecte of a chriſtian life, let him ſo define the ſame, that feare of God may be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with faith, which amids feares reuyueth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth our minde, draweth neare vnto God, and aſketh,

For the thing it ſelfe, &amp; the euent thereof ſheweth, that the Church, and all the godlie ones are burdened with greater multitude of calamities, then the other filthy ſkome of mankind. And contrariwiſe, wee may ſee the vngodlie puffed vp with fortunes fauour, and deſpiſing a farre of, the miſerable and ſorrowfull ſocieties, obſeruers of the heauenly doctrine. Theſe ſorrowful ſpectacles doe often moue the godlie ones, to thinke that in vaine they beſtow ſo great ſtudie and diligence in expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and defending the doctrine deliuered from God, &amp; that they are much wiſer, which follow plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures &amp; whatſoeuer pertaineth therunto, with al care and trauaile. For they which ſingularlie loue the ſtudies of heauenlie doctrine, not onely neglecte worldlie matters, but alſo are proudlie derided and troden vnder foote by the wicked, and are caſte out to all tormentes of Tirantes and Heretickes. But vnto this no light ſtumblinge block is oppoſed a ſtrong concluſion, drawen from a compariſon bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene benefites ſpiritual &amp; corporal. And though riches and honoures are the giftes of God, yet they onelie ſerue but to the vſe of this mortall and fickle life, neither are they that principall good thing, to

When the vngodlie therfore haue loſt their ſlender and tranſitorie good thinges, they lie in their miſeries without God, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, without calling vpon God, neither ſee they in their minde anie remedie for theſe euils. <hi>Pompey</hi> fleeing from out of the hoaſte at <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> was not onelie forſaken of his friendes, but alſo was ſlaine by the commandement of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> king.

So <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> being vtterlie broken with greatnes of calamities, and with the ſodaine change of their former good fortune, killed themſelues.

Let vs alſo (againſt theſe ſclaunders) recyte this pſalme, which containeth a two foulde anſwere there vnto. Namlie vtter denyall and prayer for deliuerance. But here the ruder ſorte diſpute or reaſon touchinge patient ſuffering and alledge the ſaying of Chriſt. <hi>If any man ſmite thee vpon the right cheeke, turne thou alſo the left vnto him.</hi> This (ſaie they) doth not <hi>Dauid</hi> obſerue, becauſe he ſpeketh not in ſilence, but reaſoneth the matter with <hi>Semeus</hi> the ſclaunderer. This cauillation will I refute, becauſe of the ruder ſorte: both vertues is preſcribed, confeſsion and patience. For as it is nede full to defend a truecauſe, ſpeciallie of doctrine, by a cleare confeſsion, ſo therewith ought we to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in minde to ſuffer violence, if the Magiſtrate be either negligent or cruell in doing his office. Neither in deede is it patience to be ſilent, and as it were to confirme the aduerſaries falſe and wrongful cauſe with keeping ſilence. Nay rather confeſsion of doctrine ought to be perſpicuous or cleare, as it is written. <hi>He that confeſſeth me before men. &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> performeth them both. Hee affirmeth that he is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18500:47"/>
not guiltie of the crimes which were obiected by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus,</hi> and ſuffereth grieuous reproches, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of reuenge. As in the 2. lib. Reg. cap. 16. it is written. <hi>Let him goe, that he may curſe. &amp;c. For the Lord hath commaunded him to curſe Dauid.</hi> O wonderfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience which was perſwaded that not by happe, we are afflicted, but by the knowledge and ſufferance of God. And although afflictions come of the deuill, or from the crueltie of men, yet this patience know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they are ſuffered by ſome determination of God, &amp; that there is preſcribed them theire limites, beyonde the which neither can the malice of the deuill nor of men rage in crueltie. This example in manie affaires of our life, it is profitable to folowe. If anie man hurt or hin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

If he geue no place being refuted, neither the arbitrators or iudges defend thee, as they ought, <hi>Dauid,</hi> by his example doth comforte thee, that thou maieſt know why thou muſt haue patience, and after what maner it pleaſeth God. I doe alſo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand howe it is by <hi>Dauid</hi> reaſoned in the 8. verſe thus. <hi>Iudge me O Lord, according to thy righteouſnes.</hi> But the application of this ſaying with other ſentences is eaſie and familier vnto him which vnderſtandeth the boundes of humilitie and of glorie. <hi>Glorie</hi> is the teſtimonie of our owne conſcience iudginge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers rightlie, and of other mens iudging vs rightly. <hi>Humilitie,</hi> is a vertue wherewith acknowledginge our owne infirmitie, we geue God the Glorie, and in our vocation lyue obedient with confidence in Gods helpe, and in time of puniſhment, confeſſe that we are iuſtly puniſhed. Euen as therefore hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie hath commendacion ſo often as we eyther
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18500:47"/>
haue to doe with God, with our ſelnes, or with our frendes: So glorie, whereof I ſpake before, is to be oppoſed as a <hi>Gorgon</hi> againſt the ſlaunders of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. So <hi>Dauid</hi> rightly, and without arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, declared that hee tooke not the kingdome and Iuriſdiction vpon him perforce, but was obedient vnto the calling of God, and that hee exerciſed not priuate deſires in ruling, when as <hi>Semeus</hi> obiected, that <hi>Dauid</hi> for gouernment ſake, both violated the Law, and godlines. This alſo may be anſwered, that we muſt make a difference betweene the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the perſon, and the righteouſnes of the cauſe. For albeit that the perſon (before god) is iuſt by faith alone, yet in the reconciled ones, righteouſneſſe of good conſcience is neceſſarie, both for other cauſes, and ſpecially for this, that we may therein reſt and ſettle our ſelues as in a ſafe hauen, when ſurginge ſtormes in the troubleſome ſea appeare: that is, in time of ſlaunder and reproche, which indeuour not onelie to ſtaine our perſon, but alſo to blemiſh and contaminate our doctrine.

(To whom he knew) his gouernment was acceptable. For in déede ſo <hi>Dauid</hi> warred againſt his enemies, as, that boyes and gyrles at home, in the Church, and in ſchooles, might be perfect in learning, might reade the Law in <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and here the Interpreters of the Law and of the promiſes, wherein God had made himſelfe knowen.

Neither in déede are theſe wordes to be ſo read by the way, as if that the <hi>Sinagogue</hi> of the people ſhould flock about a man. But let che conflict in <hi>Dauid,</hi> euen with his owne affections, be conſidered of vs. For not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great motion of the minde was this finall cauſe of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18500:50"/>
his reduction or recouerie of Gods fauour, pronounced. He prayeth that he may be reduced, and is therwith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto obedience. He is willing to obey gods will, yea though he be not reduced, and yet doeth he not caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way faith touching ſorgeuenes of his ſinnes, neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth he any maner of time. Yea, he wiſheth not to be reduced againe, if he might deliuer his ſonne from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation: rather then ſo reduced, that thereby he ſhould for euer and for euer deſtroy his ſon, and a great multitude of his Citizens.</p>
                  <p>This maner of deliuerance grieued <hi>Dauid</hi> more then the loſſe of his kingdome. But he knew that when God brought him back again, he muſt obay his wil, and that through zeale towardes God and his Church, our affections muſt needes be vanquiſhed. So Religion in vs, and pietie towardes God and his Church, vanquy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth other motions of the minde. But where he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth (of <hi>the aſcending of God on high</hi>) that may be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode by relation, and not abſolutely ſo in deede. For then is God exalted in our ſight, when he is knowen of vs aright, called vpon, and worſhipped according to his worde deliuered, and when we reiect all falſe opinions, and worſhippinges which are wide from the rule of his deuine Inſtitution.

(That is) that we witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breake not the law of God.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond cauſe is, that faith may be retayned: for there are two contradictorie or gainſaying affectes. To doe willingly and wittingly againſt Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: and to haue a deſire to repent, without which, faith cannot be. An euil conſcience, therefore, and faith cannot be in the heart both at once.</p>
                  <p>The thirde cauſe, That true prayer might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed of vs. For he that hath ſtill an euill purpoſe of minde, calleth vpon God in vaine: Nay, he cannot pray
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18500:51"/>
at all, becauſe he commeth vnto God without repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and faith. Now let a man conſider what a wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it is to liue careleſſe of God, (that is) not to bee able to craue and hope for the help of God, but to be forſaken of God, and enthralled of the deuill.</p>
                  <p>The fourth cauſe is, Confidence in the helpe and protection of God. This cauſe ryſeth of the former cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For hee that with a good conſcience endeuoureth himſelfe, hath euer a good confidence, which is the ſwéete Nurſe of olde age.</p>

And ſeeing this propertie may not be attributed vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature, it muſt needes be a cleere thing, that wee ought not to make our prayers vnto men that are dead.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond propertie in this place recyted, is <hi>The Righteouſnes of God,</hi> who is angrie againſt al ſinnes and wickedneſſe which are opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The third propertie is <hi>The goodnes of God,</hi> which helpeth thoſe that are true of heart. (That is) truely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon him in Spirite and trueth without any other cauſes incident, So happened it with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> after their fall, when they could not be helped by angels, nor by their own pollicies, neither yet by any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Then comes God from his ſecrete throane, and receiued ſinners to his fauor, and geues them life. Let our minde therefore behold this true God, which made himſelfe knowen by ſending his ſonne, publiſhing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of him, by rayſing from death to life, and other mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles done. And let our minde therewith thinke that this is the true Creator and helper, which is wiſe, which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs, and is both true, bountifull, Juſt and ſincere, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing alſo wickednes and ſinnes which are contrarie vnto his righteouſnes.</p>

                  <p>But after that he hath ſhewed the difference of the cauſe principall and inſtrumentall, he declareth plainly, not obſcurely, what maner inſtrumentes they be which God vſeth in gathering of his Church together. God hath choſen (ſaith <hi>Ludouicus Viues in his 2. booke of Chriſtian doctrine)</hi> vnto ſo great and wonderfull work the Apoſtles, priuate men, baſe, feeble, vnſkilfull, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes, then whom none could ſéeme to be leſſe fitte for the purpoſe. <hi>But he choſe the weakelinges of the worlde</hi> (as <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith) <hi>
                        <hi>to confound the mightie ones.</hi> 1. Cor. 1.</hi> It is the pointe of a moſt ſkilfull and moſt expert Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, to worke that in a bad and ſimple inſtrument, which another man can ſcarcely doe in a moſt apte and moſt likely for the purpoſe. Like as men ſay <hi>Apelles</hi> with a cole taken out of the fire, did ſo liuely paint out him, of whom he was bidden to <hi>Ptholomeus</hi> his dinner, that all men there acknowledged the ſame gueſtesbidder e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at the firſt ſhadowing. But it is not to be maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that God perfourmeth what pleaſeth him, in likelye
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18500:56"/>
and fitte inſtrumentes, who needeth none inſtruments at all, whatſoeuer he purpoſeth to make. Therefore ſent he a very few vnto very many, the rude to the ſkilful, he ſent children vnto moſt exquiſite and moſt eloquent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he ſent the ſimple to the ſubtile ones, the vnarmed to the armed, the weaklinges to the warriors, and the pore he ſent to the rule and domination ouer the people of Rome. For it was conuenient that at the beginning ſuch a lowly and baſe ſtate ſhould be in the founders of this building, leaſt they ſhould attribute any thing vnto humane ſtrength and cunninge, or repoſe any truſt or confidence in them, but vtterly diſtruſting their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, ſhould depend wholie vpon the helpe and ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of God. Both leaſt any man might attribute any thing of thoſe thinges which were wrought, vnto mans power: and alſo, leaſt that the ſame Apoſtles might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne or deſpiſe any humilitie or baſe eſtate of others, being mindful of their owne. Thus farre <hi>Viues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as touching that which I haue ſpoken of the Apoſtles, the ſame may in like maner be ſaide of all tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the Church, For ſo <hi>Paule</hi> cryeth out: <hi>For theſe thinges who is fitte or meeter?</hi> Namelie, to expound the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to iudge and decyde greateſt controuerſies, and to beare rule in the Church.</p>
                  <p>But what doe theſe infantes and ſucklinges bringe to paſſe? Are they onely infeebled with vaine contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which neither profiteth themſelues nor other? No (ſaith he) the labors of the godly Miniſters in the church doe not onely profite men a ſhort time, but the fruytes are euerlaſting of them which teach, who doe gather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God an eternall church, and are themſelues enriched with eternall rewardes. This Conſolation, is moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes repeated, as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith <hi>1. Cor. 15. <hi>Your labor ſhall not be fruſtrate in the Lord.</hi>
                     </hi> And in the <hi>1. Rom. <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God vnto ſaluation to ſo many as beleue.</hi>

                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:18500:56"/>
That thing alſo is moſt worthy of admiration, that the Apoſtles perſwaded both the learned and vnlearned of their time, in ſo profound matters, and farre paſſing the vigor of mans wit, when as <hi>Philoſophers</hi> could hardly perſwade others in morall thinges, more hardly in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thinges, being furniſhed and prepared with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, eloquence and vſe.

Therefore this <hi>Worde,</hi> whome wee call the Sonne of God, being merciful towardes mankind, which led their life in errors like vnto bruite beaſtes, was content to be borne of a woman, to be conuerſant amongeſt men, and for them vouchſafed to die: and he ſhall come agayne to iudge of all thoſe thinges which haue bene done by euery one in this life.

The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> being thorowly touched to the quick, ſayde, hee beleeued him, and reioyced to ſee himſelf conquered, profeſſed and held the ſame opinion in thoſe thinges, as the olde man did, and perſwaded others that they would be of the ſame minde with him, proteſting ſolemnly that this was done by Gods prouidence, to the ende he might be conuerted to embrace the Chriſtian Religion. For ſo long (ſayth he) as by wordes the matter was handled with me, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered againe wordes for wordes, and what ſo was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with cunning of ſpeech, I laboured to confute.

                  <p>The vniuerſall church is full of hiſtories of ſuch like examples, which declare that God, when we are weake doth vſe courage and ſtrength for vs. Omitting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore longer recytall of examples, touching the latter part of the ſecond verſe <hi>viz. <hi>That thou mayſt deſtroy both the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, and the auenger,</hi>

And becauſe euerie our prayer receyued from the holy Ghoſt, hath effecte of promiſe and of propheſie, let vs confer the euente with the foretokening thereof. For in this laſt age of the world, <hi>D.

Diſtinguyſhed the true worſhipping of God, from the hipocriſie of mans traditions, and ſhewed the vſe of the Sacramentes, which are by God inſtituted. (Touching which matter well conſidering,) it becommeth all the godly throughout the world, to ioyn together their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſighes, and to craue with feruent heartes, that GOD woulde vouchſafe to confirme this that hee hath wrought in vs for his holy temple ſake.</p>

                  <p>IN the ende of this Pſalme is repeated <hi>The Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Finall cauſe</hi> of delyuerance. For this cauſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie is the Church delyuered, that the moſte holye name of God be not for euer polluted, neyther that his Doctrine be extinguiſht, but that alwayes there ſhoulde remayne vpon earth both Teachers and Schollers, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating the benefites of God in his Church, or Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and to be therein true witneſſes of his Doctrine. This cauſe is oftentimes inculcate to our eares, as in the <hi>79. Pſalme. <hi>Helpe vs O Lorde our Sauiour, for the glorie of thy names ſake and deliuer vs, and be mercifull vnto our ſinnes, for thy names ſake, leaſt they ſay amonge the Nations, Where is now their God?</hi>

                  <p>I Am not ignorante that certaine Deuines of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wittes, and excquiſite learning, haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted this pſalme Allegoricallie, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching corruptions in Doctrine: which are the enuenomed dartes, wherewith the hearts of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſorte are wounded. And althoughe I miſlike not this Interpretation: Yet I doe better allowe of the ſimple meaning and effecte, which the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the phraſe bringes foorth. Therefore this Pſalme conteineth a Figure of the Church, which is like vnto a ſillie birde caſt out of her neſte, and laide foorth for all maner perilles and daungers of death. For in very deede, the Church liueth as an exile in this world, and ſetleth her abode in trobleſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, as it were in <hi>Medeas</hi> boſome. And nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liues ſhe in exilement, and wandereth without any certaine reſting place, but is as an open pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all hazardes of ſodaine dangers. For ſhe is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie oppugned by manifeſt violence, and partlie by guilefull ſnares, ſubtillie deuiſed of the enemies. But perhaps, ſome man would aſke the queſtion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence comes ſuch and ſo greate bitter hatred, into the mindes of the vngodlie ones againſt the church, which keepeth and retayneth the heauenlie Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? This queſtion doth this pſalme in one verſe at full reſolue. <hi>The foundations are deſtroyed, what hath the Righteous done?</hi> As if he ſaide, The Church ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not this beaſtlie crueltie of the enemies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,

For neither can it be, but that the Church which ſetteth foorth the true meaning concerning the eſſence and will of God, ſhould therewith alſo reprehende the Confuſion of Opinions and Worſhippinges, which with a malignante countenance, (that is) by all euill ſhew are repugnant to the manifeſted will of God. For God hath called his Church vnto this function, to the ende we ſhoulde builde vp and firmelie plant thoſe thinges that are true, and vtterly deſtroy, and roote out ſuch thinges as are vnto them contrarie. When, therefore, the Deuill, enemie to God and his Church, cannot abide the building vp of his works, he enforceth Tirantes and their Champions to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and practiſe all the induſtrie of his kingdome, vnto the deſtruction of the true Church, and of the Doctrine which ſhe profeſseth.

For, let vs alwayes remember theſe wordes, that we rightly beleeue, that the Sonne of God was alſo made a ſacrifice for vs, and made interceſſion for vs, and alſo applyed his ſacrifice for our ſaluation in theſe wordes. <hi>Among thy Saintes is all my delight, &amp;c.</hi> That is, theſe thinges ſuffer I for the holy ones ſake, and them doe I loue vnfaynedlye.

This doctrine of Applycation let vs alwayes and with ſpeciall care remember, and let vs conſider both poyntes, namely, where Chriſt hath apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Sacrifice, and how all men ought to apply the vtility or fruyte of the Sacrifice vnto themſelues.</p>

Let vs therefore loue and reuerence the exerciſes of his heauenly doctrine that we may rightly acknowledge and call vpon God, and be able to eſchewe the confuſion of fonde opinions and traditions of men. For they which refuſe and deſpiſe theſe exerciſes, are like reedes, toſſed hether and thether with euery winde of doctrine, as in the 4. of <hi>S. Paule. Epheſ.</hi> is written.</p>

of the Goſpell I will not anie waies be againſt him. The ſecond part without doubting entreateth of the efficacie of the goſpel, and diſcerneth the ſame not onelie from philoſophie, but alſo from the law which commaundeth that which is right, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth that which is wronge. For philoſophie can not heale the woundes of the conſcience nor call backe mens ſoules from hell, ſeeing it teacheth no certaine thing touching the will of God, nor our ſaluation. Bee it much leſſe to purpoſe then that the lawe may be a hauen or ſuccoure for our conſcience ſtrugling with ſinne and death, when it wonderfulie encreaſeth our feares and aſtoniſhmentes with her threatning thunderbolts.

Alſo he now comming towards vs, and afterwardes goinge from vs, maketh euerie yeare two contrarie returnes from the ende of the worlde, by whoſe diſtance, he both as it were with a certaine ſadnes maketh the earth heauie, and alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine maketh her glad, as when ſhe ſeemeth to bee
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18500:112"/>
comforted by the bright heauens.</hi> And what is more excellent then to compare Chriſt vnto the Sunne, vnto a bridegrome or a huſband, &amp; vnto a valiant Captaine. Touching theſe compariſons I wil ſpeake a few words for the inſtruction of the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Like as the Sunne with his light beneficially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth all the world: So the Sonne of God reacheth his benefites vnto all men, ſo that they will receiue them thankfully, and not refuſe them diſobedyently. Morre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as the ſun is the welſpring of liuely power: ſo Chriſt geueth life euelaſting vnto all beleeuers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as the ſunne when he ryſeth obſcureth the light of the ſkyes, and diſmiſſeth them, ſo the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of faith, which for Chriſtes ſake is imputed vnto vs, doth vanquiſh the darkenes, and as it were dryueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the night of the glorie of mennes workes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as the ſun when in the midſt of the day he is moſt higheſt, is then moſt whoteſt: so perſecution is the companion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure &amp; vncorrupt Religion of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, as the ſun with his brigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nes dryueth away clowdes and foggie miſtes: ſo the Sonne of God ſittinge at the right hand of his Father, is the conqueror of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes and heretikes.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, as the ſunne in winter when he is moſt far theſt of from the Pole, is moſt neareſt the earth: ſo the ſonne of God is moſt neere vnto the godly ones in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and geueth them helpe and ſaluation. But it were too long to goe through with all partes of this compary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I doe therefore make ſpeede to the expoſition of the other Similitudes.</p>
                  <p>Like as the Bridegroome or huſband beareth a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent loue vnto his ſpouſe or wife: ſo is there in Chriſt true loue, not fayned towardes his Church, which is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed in that he tooke vpon him nature of man. For ſée<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing he hath coupled this nature vnto him by that ſecrete
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18500:113"/>
and marueylous league. Let vs not doubt but he doth loue the like nature of mankind vnfaynedly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the huſband loueth his wife only, and wandreth not out of the boundes of wedlock: ſo Chriſt loueth his Church only which imbraceth the Goſpel, and loueth not other ſectes Mahoinetical nor hereticall.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as the huſband with a franke heart com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth all maner benefites vnto his wife: ſo Chriſt beſtoweth vpon his church his righteouſnes &amp; life: tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto himſelfe the ſorrowes of his Church, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſacrifice for our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as it is the huſbandes parte to maintayn the welfare of his wife: ſo Chriſt euermore defendeth his church, repreſſing deuils, tirants, and heretikes.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Chriſt geueth his worde and holy Spirite, whereby from time to time new members are begotten into the Church. But this is done in the miniſterie of the Church, who as a mother, foſtereth and bringeth vp her children. This conference to thinke vpon is profitable, becauſe not in vaine ſaide <hi>S. Paule Marriage was a great miſterie.</hi> Namely, <hi>a figure of the League which is betweene Chriſt and his Church.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is compared vnto a valyant captain, which cheerefully finiſheth the race that hee runneth in armes. But this comparyſon ſeemeth to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aken out of Geneſis, whereas the Meſſias is called <hi>Schylo:</hi> That is, Fortunate, vnto whom all thinges doe yeald, and all thinges obey. For this Lord was not only prompt and ready to the battell, but alſo with a marueylous and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly felicitie ouercame our enemie the Deuill, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the workes of ſinne, and death it ſelfe. Vnto the conſideration of this Figure doth the Son of God bring vs, <hi>Luke. 11. When a ſtrong man armed keepeth his houſe, thoſe things which he hath, he poſſeſſeth in peace: But when a ſtronger then he commeth vpon him: he ouercommeth him, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18500:113"/>
away all his weapons wherein he truſted, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth his ſpoyles vnto his own ſouldiers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore what a promptitude was in Chriſt to finiſh the courſe of our ſaluation (the wordes by himſelfe recyted) in the 14. of <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Goſpell doe well declare. viz. <hi>The Prince of this world commeth, and hath nothing in me: But that the world may know that I loue the Father, and as the Father commaunded me, ſo I doe, Ariſe, let vs goe hence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore all our life longe let vs remember, that Chriſt is the ſhining ſunne of righteouſnes, alſo the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande of his Church, and the inuincible Captayne: So that we may craue and hope for of him, preſent and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall benefites.</p>

                        </gap>ome, far excelling the diſputations of all Philoſophers touching God.

But we in the church, which doe heare the Goſpell preached and taught, doe learne the perfecte doctrine concerning the eſſence &amp; will of God, Vnknowen vnto mans reaſon, and all other creatures, vntill that it was publiſhed from the ſecret bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſome of the Eternall Father, by his Sonne.

                     <p>Moſt truely ſayde it is, that the Goſpell refreſheth, and comforteth our ſoules: But Philoſophie is onely a meditation of death.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18500:117"/>
out of mens mindes an vniuſt imagination, which diſcerneth not betwene gouernement and ſpoiles, like as that <hi>Pyrate</hi> ſaide to <hi>Alexander.

But of this praying there are precepts extant in the 24. of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Pray ye for the kingdome of Babilon becauſe in the peace thereof, you may alſo haue peace.</hi> He biddes them praye for the empire which at that time was the harboure or ſuccour of the church. And in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. Is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a precept full of erudition. <hi>I exhort you that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and thankes geuinges be made for all men, For kinges &amp; all which are in authoritie vnder them, that we may lyue a quiet and peacable life, in all godlynes and honeſtie.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is cleare what difference there is betwene ruling and robbing. For rulinges or gouernements are the ordinance of god, and theſe muſt we obey for gods cauſe, who is the author of this ordenance. But robbings or ſpoilings are the deſtructions of gods ordinance, and the furies of the deuill where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God is horriblie angrie. Secondlie this pſalme teacheth, that gouernments are not preſerued by fortune or by the counſels of men onlie, but by god who is not onelie ſo the author of politique order, that he alloweth of lawful gouernments but alſo by this meanes. Becauſe like as both by his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he ordeyned the courſe and mouinges of the ſtarres, and alſo by his power preſerueth the ſame. So alſo politique order is the worke of God, and howe much ſoeuer of this ordinaunce abideth in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18500:118"/>
the confuſed ſtate of humaine nature, is by God truelie and effectuallie preſerued. For the deuill woulde altogether deſtroie honeſt ſocietie, but that God repreſſeth his furies and did protecte parte of mankinde. And that God is the preſeruer of this ordniance, the puniſhments of ſeditious and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious perſons do not onlie ſhewe, but alſo that ſame burden of affaires and daungers which mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (without God) is not able to endure.

                  <p>Finallie he reprehendeth the pride of mans minde, which imagineth that greate matters and profitable thinges are gouerned by our wiſdome and vertue.

For firſt is an often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of the eternitie, which agreeth more vnto the kingdome of Chriſt, then vnto tranſitorie ſtates of regiment. Secondlie the phraſe of bleſsing ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times repeated, without doubt pointeth the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vnto the promis which was delyuered to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.

This ground of our purpoſe thus framed, let vs after this ſpeake touching the argument of this Pſalme. No doubt it is that the firſt pare of the pſalme is a plentifull &amp; notable deſcription of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which Chriſt had in his reſurrection, &amp; triumph, and ſitting at the right hand of God, for euer, ſhall haue. For as in his paſsion he was brought low and

debaſed, worſe then Angels and men: ſo riſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life &amp; triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phing, he was placed in high dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of glorie as in the 2. <hi>Philip.</hi> it is ſaide. <hi>Therefore hath God exalted him &amp; geuen him a name which is aboue all names. &amp;c.</hi> This glorie did the Apoſtles beholde whole 40. dayes together. For there ſaw they, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie to be fullie &amp; wholie aboliſhed in chriſt: they ſawe a new nature ſhining in the light of heauen, in a new righteouſnes and life. And ſeeing it properlie appertaineth vnto the prieſt to bleſſe, not only the kingdome of Chriſt, but alſo the prieſthoode of this Lord is here deſcribed. Let vs therfore hold ſtill (the definition of the high prieſt in the church) that the difference betwene Chriſt and other prieſtes may be perceaued. The hye prieſt is a perſon immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſent from God, to the publiſhing of the goſpell, to pacefie by his ſacrifice the wrath of god, &amp; to pray for vs hauing witnes, that he ſhall be heard, and by which perſon, benefites promiſed in the newe teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are beſtowed vpon vs. By this difinition it is cleare, what difference there is betwene the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode of Chriſt and the miniſteries of the teachers in the church. For, he is the fountaine of doctrine, which being pronounced from the boſome of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal father, he hath made knowne. Other teachers onlie receaue the benefites mencioned, from this maſter. Secondlie he onelie with his ſacrifice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſsion pacifieth the wrath of his eternall father. But the miſeries or calamities of other miniſters are not ſacrifices for the ſinne of mankind, but eyther puniſhmentes for certaine proper offences, eyther els tryals or exerciſes of faith diſcerning true faith from hipocriſie, eyther els teſtimonies of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of immortalitie which they profeſſe, and are ſignes &amp; tokens nothing failing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

that ſhalbe. Laſt of al the high prieſt, by his merit &amp; efficacie geueth ſpritual bleſsing, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuerance from the curſe of the law &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wrath of God, forgeuenes of ſins, the holie ghoſt &amp; life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, as in the 1. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> is written. <hi>Out of his fulnes, we al haue receyued grace for grace.</hi> Other teachers are onlie miniſters of the worde of the goſpel, &amp; of the ſacraments, by the which the ſonne of god is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall. Let this high prieſt therefore be diſcerned from Prophetes, Apoſtles and other teachers in the church, as <hi>Iohn baptiſt</hi> ſaith. <hi>I baptiſe you with water, but he baptiſeth with the ſpirit.

                  <p>ALl theſe thinges are moſt eaſilie vnderſtoode, in con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſidering an Antitheſis of the paſſion and reſurrection of Chriſt. For Chriſt in his paſſion was curſed: becauſe the curſe was turned vpon him, whereunto mankinde was ſubiecte. And he himſelfe ſuffered the due puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods iuſtice, and ſo payed for vs the raunſome, But what a heauie ſpeach is this, to bee called curſed of God, that cannot be expreſſed in wordes, but let vs with a godly meditation learne, when we beholde our ſinnes after a ſorte, and tremble, fearinge that wee are in déede caſt away into euerlaſting damnation.</p>
                  <p>But now after his reſurrection, God is not onelie bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for euer, but alſo the fountaine of heauenly bleſſing, concerning which I wil anone ſay more. And that he <hi>was preuented</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with bleſsing,</hi> that ſéemeth <hi>Paule</hi> to interpret Coloſſ. 1. when he ſaith: <hi>Chriſt is the firſte begotten of them which die, that he may holde the principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in all thinges.</hi> Alſo 1. Cor. 15. <hi>Chriſt is riſen from death the firſt fruites of them which die.</hi> Let this prerogatiue of Chriſt be vnderſtoode as touching the circumſtance of time, and efficacie of Chriſtes reſurrection. For (as vnto the time pertayneth) no man was euer ſo rayſed from death before Chriſtes time, that he yealded not again vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mightie death. But <hi>Chriſt ryſing againe from death, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18500:125"/>
that dyeth not, neither hath death any more power ouer him.</hi> Moreouer, the reſurrection of the Lord is ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, that euen in vs alſo it ouercommeth death, and may make vs partakers of the moſt ioyfull reſurrection of the Saintes. We ſhall therefore liue by the merite and efficacie of Chriſt, according to that ſaying, <hi>I liue, &amp; you ſhall liue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, moſt ſorrowfull was the appearance of Chriſt, when he was brought foorth arrayed in purple, &amp; crowned with thornes: But now he beareth a crown of golde ſet vpon his head: wherein is written, <hi>King of kinges, and Lord of lordes.</hi> Alſo, <hi>
                        <hi>Vnto mee ſhall euerie knee bowe,</hi> Apoc. 19. 1. Tim. 6. Phil. 2.</hi> Theſe precious ſtones and pearles are imboſſed in the crowne of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to his death and buryall is oppoſed life, not in deede a tranſitorie and a frayle life, but a permanent and euerlaſting life. In this Antitheſis let the example be conſidered, which the ſaying of <hi>paul, Ephe. 3.</hi> notably ſetteth downe: <hi>God is able more aboundantlie to perfourme all thinges, then we dare aske or looke for.</hi> Chriſt aſked of his eternall father life, and obteyned life, which no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte of time compryſeth, and which alone is to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for a life.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Vnto the reproches of Chriſt crucifyed, is oppoſed glorie, which is, that by himſelfe, hauing clean<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed vs from our ſinnes, <hi>
                        <hi>He ſitteth at the right hand of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, being ordeined in the Heauens as Heire of all thinges, And Lord ouer all principalitie, power, ſtrength, &amp; domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is made of God vnto vs righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> Heb. 1.

                  <p>I Wil repeate in this place the expoſition of an vſual ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: A will agréeing with the wil of God, is good. The Jewes will or minde agréeed with Gods will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God woulde that his Sonne ſhould dye, and the Jewes had a will to put Chriſt to death. Therefore the will or minde of the Jewes was good: I anſwere <hi>the maior,</hi> ſo againe is true, when our will agréeth with Gods will accordinge vnto all cauſes. Falſe is the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> therefore becauſe the wil of the Jewes did not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto all cauſes agree with the will of God. For cauſes impulſiue, formall and ſmall do very greatly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: which make diuerſities of deedes, without end. In the Jewes was the cauſe impulſiue, burning hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theire teacher who rebuked theire ſinnes &amp; lewde

                     </gap>nions. The formall cauſe was as (they had a will euen in his paſſion,) the ſame torments and rending of him, which they would to be eternall. The finall cauſes were that this teacher might ſo be taken away that he ſhould not haue life againe, and to the end this libertie of theire miſchéefe might be confirmed. But the impulſiue cauſe mouing god, is the great mercy towards mankind and the ſame interceſſion of his ſonne, who offered vp himſelfe vnto puniſhment for vs. The formall which god would worke in his paſſion, is not cheefly the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but the obedence of his ſonue. The finall cauſes are, that wrath being pacified by this obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he might ſatiſfie the righteouſnes of God, and that the ſame ſonne might haue life againe, and raigne in eternall felowſhip with the father eternall, and might there reſtore lyfe &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting ſaluation vnto his Heritage. It is manifeſt then that the cauſes agrée not in God and in the Jewes alike, although they runne both into one obiecte, like as the ſurgeon &amp; the manqueller incur both one obiecte, and both do ſomwhat ſmyte, but after a contrarie maner &amp; by contrary cauſes.
