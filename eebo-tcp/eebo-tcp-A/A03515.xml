            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

all possible height of Heroicall Action; in the other, the Minds inward,
constant, and vnconquerd Empire; vnbroken, vnalterd, with any most
insolent, and tyrannous infliction. To many most souer aigne praises is this
Poeme entitled; but to that <hi>Grace</hi> in chiefe, which sets on the Crowne,

things litle, greatly; things commune, rarely; things barren and emptie,
fruitfully and fully. The returne of a man into his Countrie, is his whole
scope and obiect; which, in it selfe, your Lordship may well say, is ieiune
and fruitlesse enough; affoording nothing feastfull, nothing magnificent.
And yet euen this, doth the diuine inspiration, render vast, illustrous, and
of miraculous composure. And for this (my Lord) is this <hi>Poeme</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to his <hi>Iliads:</hi> for therein much magnificence, both of person and
action, giues great aide to his industrie; but in this, are these helpes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
sparing, or nothing; and yet is the Structure so elaborate, and
pompous, that the poore plaine Groundworke (considered together) may
seeme the naturally rich wombe to it, and produce it needfully. Much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd
at therefore, is the Censure of <hi>Dionysius Longimus</hi> (a man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

in his <hi>Iliads,</hi> to the Sunne rising; in his <hi>Odysses,</hi> to his descent or set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Or to the <hi>Ocean</hi> robd of his aesture; many tributorie flouds and
riuers of excellent ornament, withheld from their obseruance. When this
his worke so farre exceeds the <hi>Ocean,</hi> with all his Court and concourse;
that all his Sea, is onely a seruiceable streame to it. Nor can it be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to any One power to be named in nature; being an entirely wel-sorted
and digested Confluence of all. Where the most solide and graue, is made
as nimble and fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent, as the most airie and firie; the nimble and fluent, as
firme and well bounded as the most graue and solid. And (taking all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
of so tender impression, and of such Command to the voice of the
<hi>Muse;</hi> that they knocke heauen with her breath, and discouer their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
as low as hell. Nor is this all-comprising <hi>Poesie,</hi> phantastique,

both for all manly information of Manners in the yong; all prescription
of Iustice, and euen Christian pietie, in the most graue and high-gouernd.
To illustrate both which, in both kinds, with all height of expression, the
Poet creates both a Bodie and a Soule in them. Wherein, if the Bodie (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <l>Patient <hi>Vlysses</hi> vnderwent; exceed</l>
            <l>My womans powre to number, or to name.</l>
            <l>But what he did, and sufferd, when he came</l>
            <l>Amongst the Troians, (where ye Grecians all</l>
            <l>Tooke part with sufferance) I in part can call</l>
            <l>To your kind memories. How with ghastly wounds</l>
            <l>Himselfe he mangl'd; and the Troian bounds</l>
            <l>(Thrust thicke with enemies) aduentured on:</l>
            <l>His royall shoulders, hauing cast vpon</l>
            <l>Base abiect weeds, and enterd like a slaue.</l>
            <l>Then (begger-like) he did of all men craue;</l>
            <l>And such a wretch was, as the whole Greeke fleete</l>
            <l>Brought not besides. And thus through euery streete</l>
            <l>He crept discouering: of no one man knowne.</l>
            <l>And yet through all this difference, I alone</l>
            <l>Smok't his true person. Talkt with him. But he</l>
            <l>Fled me with wiles still. Nor could we agree,</l>
            <l>Till I disclaimd him quite. And so (as mou'd</l>
            <l>With womanly remorse, of one that prou'd</l>
            <l>So wretched an estate, what ere he were)</l>
            <l>Wonne him to take my house. And yet euen there;</l>
            <l>Till freely I (to make him doubtlesse) swore</l>
            <l>A powrefull oath, to let him reach the shore</l>
            <l>Of ships and tents, before <hi>Troy</hi> vnderstood;</l>
            <l>I could not force on him his proper good.</l>
            <l>But then I bath'd and sooth'd him, and he then</l>
            <l>Confest, and told me all. And (hauing slaine</l>
            <l>A number of the Troian guards) retirde,</l>
            <l>And reacht the Fleete; for slight and force admirde.</l>
            <l>Their husbands deaths by him, the Troian wiues</l>

            <l>This then, my thoughts preferd: a huge club lay</l>
            <l>Close by his milk-house, which was now in way</l>
            <l>To drie, and season; being an Oliue tree</l>
            <l>Which late he feld; and being greene, must be</l>
            <l>Made lighter for his manage. Twas so vast,</l>
            <l>That we resembl'd it to some fit Mast,</l>
            <l>To serue a ship of burthen, that was driuen</l>
            <l>With twentie Ores; and had a bignesse giuen,</l>
            <l>To beare a huge sea. Full so thicke, so tall</l>
            <l>We iudg'd this club; which I, in part, hewd small,</l>
            <l>And cut a fathome off. The peece I gaue</l>
            <l>Amongst my souldiers, to take downe, and shaue;</l>
            <l>Which done, I sharpn'd it at top, and then</l>
            <l>(Hardn'd in fire) I hid it in the den,</l>
            <l>Within a nastie dunghill reeking there,</l>
            <l>Thicke, and so moist, it issude euery where.</l>
            <l>Then made I lots cast, by my friends to trie,</l>
            <l>Whose fortune seru'd to dare the bor'd out eie</l>
            <l>

Of that man-eater: and the lot did fall</l>
            <l>On foure I wisht to make my aid, of all;</l>
            <l>And I, the fift made, chosen like the rest.</l>
            <l>Then came the Euen; and he came from the feast</l>
            <l>Of his fat cattell; draue in all; nor kept</l>
            <l>One male abroad: if, or his memory slept</l>
            <l>By Gods direct will; or of purpose was</l>
            <l>His driuing in of all then, doth surpasse</l>
            <l>My comprehension. But he closde againe</l>
            <l>The mightie barre; milkt, and did still maintaine</l>
            <l>All other obseruation, as before.</l>

            <l>Then dar'd I words to him, and did present</l>
            <l>A boll of wine, with these words: <hi>Cyclop!</hi> take</l>
            <l>A boll of wine from my hand, that may make</l>

            <l>What drinke our ship held; which in sacred vow,</l>

            <l>In my dismission home. Thy rages be</l>

            <l>He tooke, and drunke; and vehemently ioyd</l>
            <l>To taste the sweet cup; and againe employd</l>
            <l>My flagons powre; entreating more, and said:</l>

            <l>This said; he vpwards fell; but then bent round</l>

            <l>In his possession; which, he made not knowne,</l>
            <l>But begg'd amongst the people; since alone</l>
            <l>He quite was left: for all his men were lost</l>
            <l>In getting off, from the <hi>Trinacrian</hi> Coast;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ioue</hi> and the Sun, was wroth with them, for rape</l>
            <l>Made of his Oxen; and no man let scape</l>
            <l>The rugged deepes of <hi>Neptune:</hi> Onely he</l>
            <l>The Ships Keele onely keeping, was by Sea</l>

            <l>Themselues safe home: which, he might long ago</l>
            <l>His pleasure make: but profit would not so.</l>
            <l>He gather'd going, and had mighty store</l>
            <l>Of Gold in safegard: so beyond the Shore</l>
            <l>That commune sailes kept, his high flood of wit</l>
            <l>Bore glorious top; and all the world, for it</l>
            <l>Hath farre exceeded. All this <hi>Phaedon</hi> told,</l>

            <l>The Ship was lancht, and men to man the prise;</l>
            <l>That soone should set him on his countrey earth:</l>
            <l>Shew'd me the goods, enow to serue the birth,</l>
            <l>That in the tenth age of his seed, shold spring;</l>
            <l>Yet in his Court contain'd. But then the King</l>
            <l>(Your husband) for <hi>Dodona</hi> was in way;</l>
            <l>That from th'oraculous Oake, he might display</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ioues</hi> will; what course for home would best preuaile:</l>
            <l>To come in pompe; or beare a secret saile.</l>
            <l>But me, the King dispatcht in course before;</l>
            <l>A Ship then bound for the <hi>Dulychian</hi> shore.</l>

So thus you see his safety, whom you mourne,</l>

            <l>The King, the Bow. Then twang'd he vp the string,</l>
            <l>That, as a Swallow, in the aire doth sing</l>
