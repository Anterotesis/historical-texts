            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And when his Highnesse pressed them for the restitution of the <hi>Pallatinate,</hi> which they had often promised to the King his Father, then they temporized so cunningly, and subtillized so trecherously with him, that euery day brought forth new delayes and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, till in the end they had made the cure worse then the disease, and hauing taken firme footing therein, were enforced to vnuaile and vnmask their dissimulation, and faintly and coldly to affirme, that they would treat with the Emperour for the restitution thereof, but could not promise it: Thus hauing abused, first our King the Father, and then our Prince the Sonne, they haue now likewise betrayed and ruined our Princesse the Daughter in their finall Conquest, and resolute detention of the Prince her Husbands <hi>Palatinate,</hi> that Princesse I say, whose Royall and sublime vertues, make her the honour of her time, the ornament of her sexe, and the Phaenix Princesse of the world. Whereunto adding the absolute breach of the Match long since prophetically delacerated, and cast in Heauen by the Princely and Royall Authors of this Consultation, and since the same breach here on Earth likewise so happily confirmed by the King, as also by the Prince: so all these premisses considered, hath not <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> reason to hate <hi>Spaine,</hi> in regard <hi>Spaine</hi> hates it? especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of these two maine ensuing points, and important considerations?</p>

            <p>HEauen being Gods Throne, and the Earth his Footstoole, it is impossible any thing can be here spoken and acted, but will there be heard, reuealed and detected; for not onely our hearts but our thoughts, not onely our tongues but our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, lye open and are obuious and transparent, to the glorious, and relucent eyes of Gods most sacred Maiestie, who being the sole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitector, and preseruer both of Heauen and Earth, rules that by his presence, this by his prouidence, and both by his power; and that wee Men are not by many thousands degrees so great in his eyes, as the smallest Pysmires are in ours; who lookes still in our Designes and Actions, sometimes with approbation; now with pitie, then with contempt, and anon with Choller and indignation, being himselfe the prime President, the great Moderator, the mighty Councellor, the eternall and euerlasting Iehouah; who can and will giue Lawes to all the Kings and Princes of the earth, as they doe to their subiects by their subordinate, and yet transcendent power, drawne from his most sacred Maiestie of Heauen, as the Starres who actually deriue their light, and borrow their lustre from the refulgent beames, and glorious body of the Sun.</p>
            <p>And as this great God seated in his Coelestiall throne of Glory, with his All<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>seeing and sacred eyes beholds in Heauen the thoughts and actions of men here on Earth: so likewise out of his indulgent mercy and prouidence, he likewise giues the same authority and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to his Angels, Saints and Martyrs, to doe the like; who clad in white Robes, the Ornaments of sanctity and purity, with Palme branches in their hands, the Emblemes of Peace and Ioy, and Crowns and Coronets on their heads, the rewards and markes of Glory, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lamb Christ Iesus wheresoeuer hee goe, still singing these ioyfull <hi>Io Peans</hi> and <hi>Epithalamians</hi> of <hi>Haleluiah,</hi> and Glory be to God on high, Peace on earth, and good will towards men.</p>

            <p>I say the newes of these proiects and resolutions of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hauing with as much fortunary as celeritie, passed the cloudes, and peirced the Vaults and windowes of Heauen, it fast arriued there, to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of that immortall Mayden Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whose heart euer loued <hi>England,</hi> as her soule did Heauen, and of whose flourishing wellfare and prosperity I cannot truely auerre, whether she still remaine more iealous or ambitious? whereat grieuing with as much disdaine, as she disdained with griefe, and knowing that her Nephew and God-sonne Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> participated and burned in her zeale, that the insatiable and blood-thirsty ambition of <hi>Spaine,</hi> might not erect his Trophees vpon the Tombe of <hi>Englands</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, and the ruines of her subuersion, shee speedily acquaints him with it, whome although heauen had purified and deuested of his Earthly passions, yet such was this young prince, his neuer dying zeale to <hi>Englands</hi> euer liuing glory that his Highnesse could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from looking red with anger, and pale with feare, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and knowledge thereof. They consult hereon and hold it both expedient and necessary to acquaint other English Princes herewith, especially those whome they knew stood deeply and sincerely affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>England.</hi> So Prince <hi>Henry</hi> acquaints his Mother Queene <hi>Anne</hi> herewith, and Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Brother King <hi>Edward</hi> 6. and both their Father king <hi>Henry</hi> 8. who so vppon aduise here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, could not refraine to looke on <hi>England</hi> with the eyes of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and pitty, and on <hi>Spaine</hi> with those of indignation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.

the prayers of the <hi>Protestants</hi> had brought to Heauen; When at first they considering that in heart and soule, she alwayes loued, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> before <hi>England;</hi> they resolued to exclude her, but at last (vpon riper and more mature deliberation) considering that she knew many secrets of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherof peraduenture they were ignorant; as also that from her innate and inueterate malice to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> shee might (either in iest or earnest) bewray something that might turne and redound to the good of <hi>England,</hi> they all consented she should be aduertised hereof, and so admitted; which was instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed; and as the rest of these Royall Princes enuied <hi>Spaines</hi> ambition, and pitied <hi>Englands</hi> dangers; So to speake the truth, and no more, Queene <hi>Mary</hi> (still resembling herselfe) both in her spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and lookes testified the contrary; Vowing that as she loued <hi>

            <p>Thus these three Princes, and three Queenes, not daring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult in Heauen on any thing, without permission of the Superiour powers, they all repayre to the sacred throne of the Lambe, (of that Great Maker and conductor of Heauen and Earth) whose Tribunall is enuironed with more sparkling and burning Sunnes, then we see Starres in the Firmament; and who is waited and attended on by many millions and Meryades of Angels; Where in signe of Gods glory and their humilitie, these Royall personages fall on their faces to his blessed feet, and so proffer vp their Petition to his heauenly Maiestie to haue authority, and place giuen them to Consult on this important businesse betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>

                  <p>Almost euery yeare Spaine hatched mee a new Treason, witnesse <hi>Parry, Babbington, Williams, Yeorke, Lopez,</hi> and infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who sought to lay violent hands on my Person and Life, but that God in his infinite mercy and prouidence still protected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended me, to their owne confusion.</p>

                  <p>But King <hi>Phillip</hi> 2. chiefely discouered his loue to England, in the treacherous attempt of his huge Armado of 88.

of England; but hee was deceiued of his hopes; for God looked on England with his indulgent eye of pitty and compassion, and on that great and mightie Nauall Army with contempt and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station.</p>

                  <p>Yea God was so gracious to England, and so mercifull to mee, as not only my Ships and People, but the Windes and Waues fought for my defence, and that of my Countrey, against the pride and malice of Spaine, who grew mad with anger, and pale with griefe, to see this his great and warlike Armado beaten, foyled, and confounded, in the midst of their glory and ambition.</p>

                  <p>And yet see the iustice of the Cause, and the equitie of your Armes; for <hi>Essex</hi> landed at <hi>Calez,</hi> and in despight of Spaine tooke and rifled it, beating and sinking their best and greatest Ships, in a manner without any shew of defence or resistance.</p>

                  <p>O but now the times are altered and changed, for then Spaine was poore and England rich, and now England is poore and Spaine rich: Likewise Spaines warres parsimonie, and frugalitie, makes his Men Souldiers; and our Peace, Pride, and superfluitie, hath made our Souldiers either Courtiers or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>

                  <p>O yes; for his Maiestie saith, that his Master is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest King, and hee a wise Seruant: The first all the world knowes; and the second, I hope <hi>England</hi> shall shortly feele, at least, if all hookes take.</p>

                  <p>Strength, Profit, Honour, which England, King <hi>Iames,</hi> and Prince <hi>Charles</hi> will likewise now finde if the Match hold.</p>

                  <speaker>E. 6.</speaker>
                  <p>As for strength, if <hi>England</hi> would know its selfe, it neede not expect or hope for any from <hi>Spaine:</hi> for Spaines assistance hath alwayes proued fatall and ruinous, to those who haue vsed it; And if England would assume the ancient generosity of her Ancestors, and forsake her new fangled pride and prodigality: Wee know it is strong enough to beat Spaine, and all his Kingdomes and Prouinces, and no way so weake, to feare that Spaine should make England a Prouince; for it were farre safer for England and Englishmen, if they wore worse cloathes, and had better hearts and swords, and if they were more martiall and lesse effeminate.</p>

                  <p>For Honour, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were Free, Royall, and ancient Monarchies; when indeed <hi>Spaine</hi> was not <hi>Spaine,</hi> but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynted and disseuered Prouinces: yea, for Pompe, State, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, our Princes were Kings, when their Kings were scarce Princes, nor their Princes Nobles: Therefore GREAT BRITTAINE by the Match can conferre and adde honour to <hi>Spaine;</hi> but not <hi>Spaine</hi> to GREAT BRITTAINE.</p>

                  <speaker>Q. E.</speaker>
                  <p>This match tends onely to bring in the Pope into our Churches, and the King of Spaine into our estate; for that is the ayme of the first, the Ambition of the second, and the obiect and hopes of both, and I feare a few yeares will proue it so; if in time it bee not remedied and preuented: which GOD of his mercie graunt, for 'tis true all the wheeles of <hi>Gondomars</hi> Art and inuention, are at worke to effect and accomplish it.</p>

                  <p>The Pope I must confesse (as Christs Vicar Generall on Earth) desires that England were Catholique, but for the good King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee hath Kingdomes enough of his owne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lookes not after <hi>England,</hi> onely he desires to see the Match con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated.</p>

                  <speaker>P. H.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> tongue hath so long watred, and his mouth gaped for <hi>England,</hi> that after Spaine, hee wisheth England were his, aboue all the Countries of the World, and his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Maiestie is very confident, that this Match will giue a maine stroke to the businesse.</p>

                  <p>If he once haue England, hee will presently assume the Title of Emperour of the West, as King <hi>Philip</hi> his Father was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to doe a little before his death; yea, his Ambition was so violent, as hee missing of England, would haue proclaimed himselfe Emperour of Spaine; and had not his Councell diuerted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented him he would haue sailed to <hi>Mexico,</hi> and there inuested and intituled himselfe Emperour of <hi>America.</hi>

                  <p>And I haue heard that <hi>Gondomar</hi> hath giuen the King of Spaine his Maister good hope of England; for 'tis certaine that hee not long since wrote to the Dukes <hi>Lerma</hi> and <hi>Pastranna,</hi> that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the strength of England resembled those huge Pageants and Colosses erected at <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Caesars past from the <hi>Meluine</hi> bridge to the Capitoll in triumph, who were outwardly glorious, and within filled onely with strawe and poore combustable stuffe.</p>
