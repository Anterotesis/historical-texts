            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Answer to <hi>Iohn Tombs</hi> his Six Propositions, in which he asserts Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be lawful. But on the contrary, from the Scripture it is proved, that the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Christians are not to Swear at all, Therefore to them that are in Christ Jesus no Oath is lawful.</head>
            <p>WE read in the Scriptures of truth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. That <hi>whosoever breaketh the least Commandmen and teacheth men so</hi> he <hi>shall be least,</hi> (or not at all) <hi>in the Kingdom of God.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we do find some men especially <hi>John Tombs</hi> breaking the commands of Christ, and teaching men so, therefore he is guilty of that judgement: but to the first proposion which is this.</p>
            <p>That <hi>some swearing is Lawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His proofs are these.</p>
            <p>That which is not <hi>de toto genere,</hi> in its whole kind evil, may be Lawfull, but swearing is not <hi>de toto genere,</hi> or in its whole kind evil, therefore some swearing may be Lawfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This argument is thus disproved</p>
            <p>To break any of Christs commands or to deny the Apostles Doctrine is <hi>de toto genere,</hi> in its whole kind, but to sweare at all by any Oath is to break the command of Christ, and to deny the Apostles Doctrine, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.35, 35, 36, 37. and, <hi>Jam.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>.12 Therefore to swear at all is not lawfull, but evil, according to Christ and the Apostles Doctrine and in the state of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>John Tombs</hi> concluding that his <hi>major</hi> is manifest of it self, goes.</p>
            <p>To prove this <hi>minor</hi> thus.</p>
            <p>That is not wholly evil about the use of which some Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions are given by God; but God giveth directions about the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95177:3"/>
use of swearing, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.2. And thou shalt swear the Lord liveth in truth and judgment and in righteousness, <hi>ergo</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By the same argument, may it as well be proved that the Christians and believers in Christ; may be circumcised, offer innocence, burnt offerings and sacrifices, because for the use of it God gave some directions, and therefore it is lawfull, but as circumcision, innocence, burnt offerings and sacrifices of the Law is ended in Christ, so is the Oaths which was among the <hi>Jews</hi> in him ended also to the believers, and by him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden: for as it was said in old time thou shalt swear, and shalt perform thy oath to the Lord; but Christ in the 5 of <hi>Mat.</hi> making mention of the <hi>Jews</hi> oath which God gave once directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for, yet saith he <hi>swere not at all</hi>; here Christ puts an end not onely to frivolous and vain oaths, but to the true oaths which the <hi>Jews</hi> was once commanded of God to swear, for these oaths are they which Christs words hath relation to, for he came to end the <hi>Jews</hi> worships and oathes, who is the oath of God, Christ the truth and righteousness of God saith <hi>sweare not at all,</hi> which ends the <hi>Jews</hi> which was to swear in truth and righteousness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2. Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which is approved by God is lawful, but some swearing is approved by God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.11. every one that sweareth by God shall glory, <hi>ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That Scripture <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.11. saith thus, but the King shall rejoyce in God, every one that sweareth by him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lyes shall be stopped. This was spoken of <hi>David</hi> the Anointed of God who was in that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Law, wherein he might sweare in truth and righteousness, that oath as the Lord liveth, and as my soul liveth; but there was some in that time, which if they used that Oath, the Lord liveth, surely, they sweare falsly, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.2.</p>
            <p>But what is that to the Christians under the new covenant who are under Christs command, <hi>who saith swear not at all,</hi> neither by that oath which <hi>David</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> swore by, nor any other oath, but if upon any occasion they were required to testifie their obedience whether they would be subject to such, or such things; their answer was to be yea or nay, and to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95177:3"/>
keep there words, which is more then the hypocrites and hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Priests in these times hath done by there oaths, for this we have had good experience of, that such as do now plead to swear for a thing, hath sworn against the same thing &amp; do now preach against that which they have preached for, so that they will preach, pray, or swear any thing for their bellie, and for filthy Lucre; and the oath which <hi>David</hi> was to swear in truth and righteousness who called Christ Lord, he that was <hi>Davids</hi> Lord &amp; glory <hi>saith swear not at all,</hi> who hath all power &amp; glory.</p>
            <p>Again whereas <hi>John Tombs</hi> instanceth <hi>Abraham, Isack David, Solomon, Elijah, Mica, Elisha,</hi> the women of <hi>Shunem,</hi> and <hi>Itai, Vria,</hi> and <hi>Samuel &amp;c.</hi> their swearing and entring into covenant to be examples for swearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> All these were under the first covenant, and was in that which Christ called the old time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and proves nothing that Christians in the new covenant should swear, for although <hi>Abraham</hi> swore, and <hi>Solomon</hi> swore, yet Christ which was before <hi>Abraham</hi> and greater then <hi>Solomon, saith swear not at all,</hi> and al. though <hi>David</hi> swore yet he was <hi>Davids</hi> Lord which said <hi>swear not at all,</hi> and though the Angels swore by him that liveth for ever, yet Christ unto whom all the Angels shal bow &amp; worship, <hi>saith swear not at all,</hi> so that all these arguments and Scriptures doth not prove that it is lawfull for the believers and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to swear at all, but it is <hi>Tombs</hi> ignorance in his applying Scripture in disobeying Christs command.</p>
            <p>Again to prove swearing lawfull, <hi>John Tombs</hi> saith that <hi>Paul</hi> put an oath on the <hi>Thessolonians,</hi> 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.27. which words are these, I charge you by the Lord that this Epistle be read unto all the holy bretheren: Now saith <hi>Tombs</hi> the Greek word translated I charge you by the Lord, is I put the Lords oath on you, or swear you that this Epistle be read to all the holy bretheren, alike charge are 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. 2. <hi>Tim..</hi> 4.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is the long and thick mist of darkness which hath been long kept over the understandings of people, that when the plain Scripture will not prove their ends and intents, then they tell people it is otherwise in the Greek, or Hebrew, did not the translator of the Bible understand Greek as well as <hi>John Tombs</hi>? or are we not to believe the Scripture as it speaks till again it be translated by him? but least be should be wise
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95177:4"/>
in his own eyes, as it is in the Greek is here set down, that all that can read and understand it may judge whether <hi>Paul</hi> did put an oath upon them, or did swear them to read that Epistle to the brethren.</p>
            <p>As 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.27 <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> Epistle among the brethren, then his obligation or charge to them was fulfilled; but seeing <hi>Iohn Tombs</hi> saith he swore them, he might have declared in what manner they were sworn, seeing <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Athens</hi> when he wrote to <hi>Thessolonicae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again he saith the like charge is in 1. <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 6.13. which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Greek he would make an oath, the words are these <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>that is I in oyn or command thee before God,</hi> not a putting an oath upon them, or causing them to swear as <hi>Iohn Tombs</hi> saith.</p>
            <p>Again he saith there is the like charge (or oath) put upon them in 2. <hi>Tim</hi> 4.1. which <hi>in the Greek is thus</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Again <hi>Iohn Tombs</hi> saith in the times of the Gospel <hi>Paul</hi> used this oath, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. But as God is true <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Now those that minds this Scripture may see that <hi>Paul</hi> doth onely justifie Christs words in keeping to yea and nay, saying that with him it was not yea and nay, for saith he verse 18. but as God is true, our word towards you was not yea and nay, and verse 19. for the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and <hi>Silvanus,</hi> and <hi>Timothius,</hi> was not yea and nay, for all the promises of God in him are yea and in him, Amen.</p>
            <p>So that this Scripture is so far from bringing people to oaths and swearing that he labours to bring them all to yea and nay in all things, and so to Christ the substance in whom all the promises of God are yea; so that the Apostle might well use these words that as God was true <hi>&amp;c</hi> See also were they true to their yea and nay the end of all oaths; other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Tombs</hi> brings to prove the Apostles did swear, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. and 9.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.8.</p>

I speak the truth in Christ, I lye not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness, and continual sorrow in my heart <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.20. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, now the things that I write unto you, behold before God I lye not, is this an oath to testifie the truth of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings against lyes; indeed this we desire that <hi>John Tombs</hi> and the rest of the Priests in this Nation would write nothing, but what God would witness unto the truth of, and that they would speak truth before God and not lye, then they would not thus abuse the Apostles words, and plead for swearing from them, when as the Apostles intend no such thing in their words here asserted; and where as it is again said that the Apostle took an oath, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.8. where he saith for God is my record how greatly I long after you in the bowels of Jesus Christ. Now let all honest and sober hearted men consider whether the truth of God and the Apostles that speak it forth be not abused, that from a novice that is lifted up in pride, and that would do or say any thing for his hire should bring those Scripture to plead for swearing and that lawfulness of oaths, in all which the Apostle took God to witness his love to the Saints and labour in the work of his ministry, signifiing to all that understand how that he spoke the truth and did not lye, and kept to his yea and nay according to Christs doctrine (and did not swear at all).</p>
            <p>Now further to prove swearing Lawfull <hi>John Tombs</hi> brings</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This fifth argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which hath a necessary use for the benefit of humane society is not unlawfull, but some swearing hath a necessary use for the benefit of humane society, <hi>ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This argument is thus disproved, and both the <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor,</hi> to be false.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95177:5"/>For to break any command of Christ is of no necessary use for humane society, but to swear any oath is to break his command, <hi>ergo,</hi> For Godliness is profitable unto all men, in all their societies, but he that swears goes from Godliness into ungodliness and transgrssion, which transgression is of no use nor service amongst Christians, so that <hi>John Tombs</hi> might as well have thus stated his Argument, that to break Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend is of benefit to humane society, therefore to break Christs command is lawfull <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and might thus have proved it, that except we break Christs command, we cannot preach for hire nor sue men at the Law for tythes; nor live in pride, ease, and vanity, nor keep our places of profits, and benefits, which is necessary for our society (of Priests,) <hi>ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we whose eyes God hath opened, do see that all his book tends to the perswading of people to swear, when Christ hath said swear not at all, and that which he now would swear for again would swear against for the same advantage and profits which he hath in his eye, yea or he would perswade all men not to swear and bring Scripture to prove it upon the same account, so that what he doth in this kind is because of advantage: for two years since he did not preach this doctrine nor write those arguments.</p>
            <p>Now it being proved that the followers of Christ, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in him are not to swear at all, then all those promissory oaths upon which <hi>John Tombs</hi> hath grounded his other propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions is not to be taken: But again to prove an oath of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy to King <hi>Caesar,</hi> he brings the example and rule of Christ, and argues thus, if the Lord Christ in the dayes of his flesh did accowledge <hi>Caesar</hi> as supreme Governor in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and did subject himself to his jurisdiction in answering before the <hi>Roman</hi> Deputy and was obedient to his parants real or supposed, then all Christians even the highest Ecclesiastical Prelate should be subject to the King as supreme Governor in his Dominions; and for proof of this brings <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.21. when the Pharises shewed Jesus the Tribute money, Christ bid them give unto <hi>Caesar</hi> that which was <hi>Caesars,</hi> and unto God the things that are Gods, so then it was the tribute money that was due to <hi>Caesar</hi>: but doth this prove that Christ did swear, or was any example of swearing to <hi>Caesar,</hi> or account <hi>Caesar</hi> the head
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95177:5"/>
of the Church and Ruler in Ecclesiastical things, so that this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proves the contrary then for that which thou brings it, for those Pharisees that brought the money to Christ, said they knew that he respected no mans person, but taught the way of God in Truth; so then if Christ be our example and rule in this, then to the supream King or Kings we must not respect their persons but give them their due, which is that tribute which hath their own super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription upon it, and we must teach the way of God in Truth, and give unto God the things which are Gods, which is all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, glory, and rule in spiritual matters, and give to Christ alone the preheminence, which is head of his body which is his Church, and we must not swear at all, neither for nor against any man, for Christ did not swear neither for nor against <hi>Cesar,</hi> and we must live peaceably with all men, not envy nor fight for nor against any man, and this is quite contrary to what <hi>Jo. Tombs</hi> would perswade people, or to what he understands from the Scripture, which would make people believe that Christ was an example of the oath of supremacy to <hi>Cesar,</hi> so that people may well be blind and ignorant who hath such Teachers.</p>
            <p>But we also shall follow the example of Christ, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. who did witnesse a good confession before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and this is a good confession before any King or Ruler now, to say that we have obeyed the Truth from our heart, and have not broken the Commands of Christ by swearing, for, nor against any; neither have we transgrest the example of Christ in respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any mans person, neither do we in our hearts envy any man, King, Ruler, nor people, but hath love even to our enemies, and can do good to them that hate us, and can pray for them that persecute us, and do desire and daily labour that all men might come to the knowledge of the Truth, that they might be saved, And this good Confession we can witnesse before the King, or any in Authority, and say that God is our witnesse, and our Conscience also bears us witnesse in the sight of God, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle did, and we can say also that we speak the Truth before God, and lye not, for our eyes is not blinded with gifts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, neither have we taken Oaths, Covenants, nor Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Parties, Powers, or Religions, but since we knew the way of Christ we have walked in it, and kept to his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Oath, which is yea and nay in all things, and so have

not entred into condemnation with those that are given to change, but the unchangeable Priest, the unchangeable Covenant, and unchangeable Law hath been our Rule, and of this we need not be ashamed, but in Gods power and Authoritie can we hold up our heads, when others do bow down their backs alwayes (crouching under every power and change of Government) as <hi>Davids</hi> enemies did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.23. for that is their place and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as the Apostle doth wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.10.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>Jo. Tombs</hi> saith, that <hi>Paul</hi> a Saint was subject to the judgement of <hi>Caesar</hi> and appealed to him, then he acknowledged him supream, <hi>&amp;c. ergo</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans. Paul</hi> was a prisoner for the word of God and testimony of Jesus, and appealed to <hi>Caesar</hi> for justice, because he was unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accused, and had not done any thing worthy of bonds or of death, therefore according to their Law he ought to be set free, but <hi>Paul</hi> did not call <hi>Caesar</hi> the supream head of the Church, and chief Ruler in Ecclesiastical things, for if <hi>Caesar</hi> had been the supream head of the Church of which <hi>Paul</hi> was a member, he would but have needed little appealing unto for setting of him at liberty; but in such Arguments as <hi>Tombs</hi> hath used, is manifest the ignorance of foolish men, wherein their folly appears to all men, as the Scripture saith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou sayest that there is holy and harmlesse Christians, and many upright soules whose Consciences are very tender, and many godly persons that have excepted against that Oath, and the lawfulnesse of taking of it, as fearing it may take away the liberty of their Consciences, which is dearer to them then their lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> These that are so are in a better condition then thy self, and to such thy ministry if received would beget them from their holy and harmlesse state, into transgression of Christs command, and from the tendernesse of Conscience into hardnesse of heart; and now to answer their objections, thou tells them that it was imposed for excluding of the Popes jurisdiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if so, why dost thou preach it up to be imposed upon the holy, harmlesse, godly Christians, who are redeemed from the Popes power and jurisdiction, and is come into the doctrine of Christ, and into the life of Christ, which is out of all such Oaths.</p>
            <p>Thou art a miserable Comforter to tender Consciences, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95177:6"/>
thy end is seen, and therefore thou cannot deceive many, but for those that thou hast before mentioned, who are holy, harmlesse, upright, and godly, which are tender of an Oath; they ought to be thy Teachers who thy self art far from righteousnesse or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of Conscience, therefore for thee it is a shame to be an imposer of Oaths upon tender Consciences, who professeth thy self a Minister of Christ, who did forbid all swearing, and his Minister did preach against it, and said above all things swear not at all, lest they fall into condemnation, but it is manifest that thy Ministry is to bring people into condemnation, and not into the obedience to Christs command, therefore they that fear God will turn away from such, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>Now saith <hi>Jo. Tombs,</hi> the grand objection against swearing is our Saviours words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34, 35, 36, 37. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.12. which words saith he doth seem expresly and fully to forbid any swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all, excluding some sorts of Oaths by name, and the rest by general terms, that our Communication should be yea, yea, nay, nay, and what is more cometh of evil, or of the evil One; yet saith he, we must of necessity find out a limitation of the speeches as we do, and the limitation is this, that is, frequent, vain, light, prophane, unnecessary, customary, passionate swearing or in secular matters of no importance, which in these Scriptures are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Indeed it doth plainly appear, that thou must of necessity either disprove Christs words, or else deny thy own, seeing they are contrary the one to the other; so therefore thou sayest that it was those Oaths above mentioned that was forbidden by Christ and the Apostles, And I shall shew it plainly that thou hast no necessity to limit Christs words to vain and prophane swearing, (out onely that thou would have thy words true and his false) for Christs words in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. doth not intend such Oaths, for he speaks of the true Oaths which was used amongst the Jewes, and such Oaths as Christ told them they were to perform; for it was not said in old time, that they should perform vain, light, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, unnecess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

false, so that Christ is not to be limited to intend vain Oaths, when as for instance Christ mentions the Jewes swearing, who was in the Commandment, who did deny all vain, customary, false, and passionate swearing, so that <hi>Jo. Tombs</hi> limitation is taken away, and Christs meaning must be as large as his words, which is not to swear at all by any Oath, but to keep to yea and nay in all promises, professions, and engagements upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and so to keep out of the condemnation, whereby all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Consciences may be kept clean to the Lord in all things, and they brought to the exercise of a good Conscience, for the Lord is now teaching his people himself, and bringing them to obey the doctrine of his Son, in which they may find peace for their soules, and not to be in bondage unto such Teachers as are given to change with every Government, who preach as the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did for handfuls of barley, and pieces of bread, and such are they who preach the lawfulnesse of swearing (or sinning) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christs command, but the Lord hath made them manifest, and is redeeming his elect and chosen from amongst such who have made a prey upon people, and fed upon their sins, but not upon the life which the Saints was in.</p>

            <p>And Christ said unto the Jews and to his Disciples, how men had sworn in the old time, and was to perform their oath to the Lord, and that was the true oath, and Christ saith I say unto you now, swear not at all, and let them see that men should not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear themselves, but perform their oaths to the Lord, and so he distinguished between the true and the false, and then bid them they should not swear at all (mark) not at all, neither by Heaven nor by Earth, nor by their head, nor by <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for he gives them the reason, but tells them what they must say, and what they must do, that takes away all swearing, let your communication be yea yea, nay nay, whatsoever is more then these comes of evil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.33, 34, 35, 36, 37. And this is the Doctrine of Christ that faith, swear not at all, who was the oath of God performed. And <hi>James</hi> one of the Disciples and Apostles of Christ Jesus, that abode in his Doctrine, said, above all things my brethren, swear not at all, neither by Heaven, nor by Earth, nor by any other oath; and then the Apostle taught people what they should do, and said, let your yea be yea and your nay nay, least you fall into condemnation; And so Christ and the Apostle did not say they were to swear by the Lord and told them these were frivolous oaths, they denyed, but told them they was not to swear at all, not by any oath, for if they did, they fell into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p>So the Doctrine of Christ and the Apostles who ended oaths,

denyed swearing, and all oaths, said they were to keep to yea and nay, and their yea was to be yea, and nay nay, which keept them out of condemnation, and who lives in this are redeemed out of the Apostacy since the Apostles daies, to Christ and the Apostles Doctrine, that knows the oath performed, and Law, and first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and <hi>Moses,</hi> and a greater then <hi>Solomon,</hi> before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, though these swore, yet he saith, swear not at all, and this is my beloved Son, hear him, and there is the top stone laid, and Christ reignes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>All these Scriptures, which are in all, 113. are brought to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Christs Doctrine by the Apostates, which prove nothing that the Christians should swear.</p>
