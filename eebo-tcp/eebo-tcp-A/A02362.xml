            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     </gap>ſter to giue him inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Againe, when he is growne to the prime of his age, hee becomes audacious and proud. At last in his declining time, he falls into miſery, hauing nothing left him, but the remembrance of his labours ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> noteth, and experience ſhews it to be true that the ill ſent only of a Candle new put foorth, is enough to deſtroy a child in the mothers wombe, ſo that ſhee may be forced to fall in trauaile, and be deliuered before her time, vnleſſe her ſtrength be the greater to reſiſt the
<pb facs="tcp:3703:4"/>
offence. And although the child ſtay the full time that nature hath prefixed him: yet commonly he is not able to get foorth, or come ſafely into the Worlde (yea though the birth be naturall) without the helpe not onely of the Mother, and himſelfe: but alſo of the Mid-wife and other women about her ready to receiue and cheriſh him: And which is worſt of all; if he be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced awry, or elſe be weake and faint, or elſe if the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife be at the fartheſt of her skill; then if they will ſaue the child, and ſo conſequently the mother from death: they muſt call a Chirurgion to deliuer her, and bring the child into the world: which (that I may touch it by the way without taxing any) is commonly done too late eyther through the wilfulneſſe of the kinſfolks, or obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the Midwiues.</p>
                  <p>But grant that the childe comes into the world of it ſelfe, without the helpe either of Chirurgion or Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife: yet (as it is commonly ſaid) he drawes his death after him: the which may be plainely perceiued by the cryes and laments which he maketh as ſoone as he ſeeth the light, as if hce craued for helpe and ſuccour. For if he ſhould continue in that caſe that hee comes from his mothers wombe, clogged with his bed or after-birth, without doubt this bedde being putrified, would infect the child, and at length kill it. Beſides, oftentimes if there were not helpe to make a free paſſage, in the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament, yard, or other naturall places, that are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cloſed vp, there could neither ſuſtenance be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, nor excrements expelled, which would cauſe the child to be ſtifled, and choked vp.</p>
                  <p>Many times alſo the head, and other parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb facs="tcp:3703:4"/>
(as the bones and legges) happen to be ill ſhapen, yea broken and out of ioint, which would neuer come of themſelues, into their proper and naturall place. There, then is it neceſſary that the Chirurgion vſe his helpfull and skilfull hand: So that euery man may plainly ſee the neceſsity and Antiquity of this worke: ſince that the firſt practiſe in Chirurgery, that euer was done in the world, was the <hi>Omphalotomia,</hi> or cutting of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> practiſed on their firſt child.</p>
                  <p>Theſe therefore are the Motiues that haue induced me to publiſh this diſcourſe, and therin to treat of ſuch diſeaſes as happen to women with child.</p>
                  <p>And heerein I haue endeuoured to helpe them both in their naturall, and extraordinary trauaile: and to eaſe them in all ſuch accidents, as may happen vnto them in their childbed: being the rather incited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by reading the complaints of Women, related by <hi>Soranus. O malè occupatum virorum genus! oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidimur nos non morimur: &amp; ab illis qui inter vos peritiſſimi exiſtimantur perperam curatae.

                  </p>
                  <p>O men, how ill doe you beſtow your time, and paines! Alas, wee women die not, but are tormented euen to death: For thoſe that are accounted the moſt expert and skilfull among you, take not that care of vs which they ſhould: you fill whole Libraries with large volumes &amp; writings of euerie light and triuiall diſeaſe of your
<pb facs="tcp:3703:5"/>
owne making little or no mention at all, of our cruell and inſupportable torments.</p>
                  <p>I had purpoſed aboue fifteene yeares ſince, to haue written ſomwhat concerning this ſubiect in my books of Chirurgery: but hauing more maturely conſidered thereof, I thought it fitter to write a Treatiſe of it by it ſelfe: which it deſerueth both for the difficultie of the ſubiect, and for the variety of the matter which I was deſirous to obſerue therein: And indeede this worke excelleth all other, which are practiſed vppon the body of man: whether ye reſpect the Antiquity, Neceſsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y, or dexterity thereof.</p>
                  <p>For the Antiquitie: without doubt the firſt worke in Chirurgery, that euer was in the worlde, was the cutting of the Nauell which, (as is ſaide before) <hi>Adam</hi> practiſed vppon his firſt borne.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the neceſsity: ſome perhaps may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that the bringing a bed of women, is not ſo neceſſary a worke as theſe following:</p>
                  <p>To ſtay the fluxe of bloud, whether it bee in veine or Arterie; to vſe the Trepan; to open the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyema,</hi> or ſuppuration in the breaſt; to cut one that hath the Dropſie; or to let bloud skilfullie: For the fluxe of bloud it may bee further ſaide, that vnleſſe it bee ſtopped by leeſing the bloud, the life alſo is endangered. But we muſt conſider, that the bloud oftentimes ſtaying of it ſelfe, and experience eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhews, that nature, which is wiſe and prouident doth commonly reſtraine, and ſtop it. I haue beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in many skirmiſhes, (yet farre enough out of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, where I haue dreſſed many that were wounded,
<pb facs="tcp:3703:5"/>
who haue had the great veſſels in many parts of their bodies cut, and bruiſed, hauing loſt much bloud vppon the hurt, and yet it hath ſtopped and ſtayed of it ſelfe. Some wil ſay, that he who hath his ſcull cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wee may ſay the like of ſuch which haue the Dropſie, or <hi>Empyema,</hi> the breaſt of the one is full of Corruption, &amp; the others belly full of water: they both choake and ſtifle, vnleſſe the Chirurgion make inciſion: in the one making a Paracentoſis, in the other opening the Pleura.</p>
                  <p>Yet neuertheleſſe we ſee, that he which hath an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyema</hi> or ſuppuration doth oftentimes expell the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and filth, by the mouth or vrine (the waies beeing manifeſt, by which nature doth vnburthen her ſelfe) and he that hath the Dropſie auoideth the water, eyther by vrine, or ſtoole, yea, and by ſweat, or by ſome little vent which Nature makes in ſome part of the body, as in the Nauell or legges: which we obſerue by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in many men: and therefore wee may perceiue, that theſe practiſes are not alwaies, ſo neceſſary, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</p>
                  <p>For letting bloud; you will ſay, that hee hazards his life, (and that ſodainely) who beeing oppreſſed, and
<pb facs="tcp:3703:6"/>
troubled with a great paine of his head or ſide, is not ſpeedily let bloud? becauſe the bloud that boyleth in his veines, striueth onely to come foorth; I will anſwere: that Nature very often ſends it foorth by the Noſe, Mouth, Eies, and Eares: by ſtoole alſo, and other parts, disburthening her ſelfe to the ſicke Mans eaſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: But It is not ſo in the deliuery of women; for if the entrance of the wombe be cloſed, (as it is ſeene in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers) whether it be naturally, by reaſon of a ſtrong and thicke membrane, which ſhutteth vp the paſſage: or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſe, becauſe ſome ſcarre happening there, hath hardned, and ſhrunke vp the ſides of the necke of the ſaid wombe: it would be impoſsible that nature ſhould euer be able to ſeparate, and breake through th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments: for as for the one, it is hard for a penne or quill to paſſe there, and for the other, you cannot put in a ſmall probe through the little hole which is in the middeſt of the membrane. And yet I haue had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience thereof in two women, which were neuer the leſſe with child, as I will ſhew more at large heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that either the Chirurgions helpe muſt bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or elſe both the Mother and the child would die mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerablie.</p>
                  <p>Some may obiect vnto mee, that the Mother might open the paſſage her ſelfe by tearing the parts ſo bound by the ſcarre, &amp; breaking through the ſaid membrane? But what will you anſwere me, for her which hath her child turned awry and lies double in her wombe, and falleth into a Convulſion, or fluxe of bloud, or both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Mother not being able eyther to turne it, or pull it foorth, eſpecially if the head of it bee intangled
<pb facs="tcp:3703:6"/>
and faſtned betweene the bones of <hi>os Pubis,</hi> ſo that it is impoſsible to turne it, ſafe and ſound, except the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion vſe his induſtry and skill.</p>
                  <p>Now for the dexteritie: there is no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this and other practiſes; for there be no workes to be done in Chirurgery; where it is not neceſſary, to haue the benefit either of daylight or candle light, and the part which is to be handled, and dreſſed muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and laid open to the eye.</p>
                  <p>Whereas contrariwiſe in this worke as well by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the company preſent, as alſo, least the woman ſhould be afraid, the very entrance, whereby hee ſhould put in his hand, they are conſtrained to hide: and then his hand being there, he muſt ſearch for the child) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be placed) not being able to ſee it. And if there be found two, three, or foure Children, yea, ſometime fiue (as <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> reporteth, hee ſaw in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, a Woman that brought foorth to the number of threeſcore and fiue children, beeing deliuered euerie yeare of fiue) then (I ſay) I leaue you to iudge what skill and dexteritie the Chirurgion ought to vſe in ſeeking them one after another if they come amiſſe.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, as often as a woman is well deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the helpe and hand of the Chirurgion, there life is giuen to two, to wit: to the Mother and the childe. And therfore as this worthy man ſaith, <hi>In partu in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocatur dei auxilium: quaeritur enim &amp; parturien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis &amp; naſcentis ſalus.</hi> When a woman is in trauaile, they call vppon God for helpe: becauſe they deſire to ſaue both the Mother and the child. Now in all other pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, though they attaine to their wiſhed end, yet can
<pb facs="tcp:3703:7"/>
there bee but one onely ſaued at once. Whereby it may be iudged, that this practiſe is both for the Antiquitie, Neceſsitie, and dexterity thereof, the moſt laudable and commendable of all others.</p>
                  <p>To make the which more eaſie, and the better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the young Chirurgion: I haue gathered together all that I could poſsibly, out of that which I haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this forty yeares and aboue, wherein I haue practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, and ſeene it practiſed, in the greateſt families both within, and without this Kingdom, where, thanks be to God, good vſe hath beene made of me. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I haue not refuſed nor diſdained to go vnto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, mooued partly by Charity, and partly to make my ſelfe more and more experienced therein.</p>
                  <p>Hauing then conferred together, what eyther the Graecians and Latines both ancient and Moderne haue written, with that I haue beene able to obſerue: and hauing reduced it all into one, I haue put it into French in fauour of thoſe who are not ſo well learned, and haue not the knowledge of the Greeke or Latine tongues.</p>
                  <p>Some will ſay (to diminiſh that little honor, which I might get by this my labour) that the Ancients haue written the greateſt part heereof. But they ſhall learne from the mouth of this great Oracle, <hi>That there is no leſſe witte and vnderſtanding required, to bee able to iudge of Sciences formerly written, then to bee the firſt Authors of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know Moreouer, that in the Doctrine, and much more in the phraſe, ſome will find many things to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. But I intreat the Reader, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it in as good part as I offer it him: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:3703:7"/>
exhort others, (that are more experienced, then I am: to doe better. Let them ſhew me my faults friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and I will not refuſe, willingly to retract them: after the example of that diuine <hi>Hipocrates,</hi> who freely confeſſed his, ſaying openly, that <hi>he had gotten more diſhonor, then either glory, or credit, by practiſing of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke.</hi>

I muſt (as well as I can) defend my ſelfe from theſe imputations, and ſhew my care to keep both learning and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie illibate, and inuiolable.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Omen are oftentimes deceiued in reckoning themſelues with child, for they thinke themſelues with child when it is nothing but the ſtopping of their naturall ſickneſſe, which kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not due courſe. Some haue a falſe concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is as it were the beginning of Mola. Others haue the Mola it ſelfe, which we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call the Moone-calfe.</p>
                     <p>Falſe conception is a lump of fleſh gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether commonly like to the gizard of a fowle,<note place="margin">What a falſe conception is.</note> which is bigger or leſſer according to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it, which nature commonly expelleth in the ſecond, third, or fourth month. But the Mola is farre bigger, and continues a yeare or two, yea ten or twelue, and ſometime as long as the woman liues. Of this Mola there be two kinds, the one may be called a true, the other a falſe one.<note place="margin">Mola is either true, or falſe.</note> The true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la is fleſhy, being nothing elſe but an vnprofitable maſſe, without ſhape or forme, hard and firme, bred within the Matrice, and cleauing to the ſides thereof. The falſe Mola is of three ſorts, the one windy, being a collection of groſſe winds: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond watriſh, or a heaping together of waters: the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3703:17"/>
third humorall, or a meeting of many humors. All three contained within the capacitie of the womb, which doth make them differ from the ſwelling, hardnes, or Scyrehus of the ſaid wombe, or from any fleſh, water, or humor, which may chance to cleaue to, or touch the outward part thereof. Theſe are often bred together with the child,<note place="margin">Mola bred together with the child.</note> but then they cauſe death, either for that the child is deceiued of his nouriſhment which is carried to the Mola; or becauſe he wanting roome, cannot grow and come to perfection.</p>

                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, that there be ſome liuing and ſome dead Moles. The dead are like to the falſe burthens, ſo called, becauſe women carry them not long, as being but lightly tyed and faſtned to the ſides of the Matrice. Sometime they are deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into diuers ſeuerall pieces, ſo that <hi>Nicholas Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colus</hi> ſaith, he ſaw a woman which caſt forth nine of them in one day, the leaſt whereof waighed foure pound. The quicke and liuing Moles are they which wholy cleaue to the wombe, and continue with the woman euen to her death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſe of the fleſh Mole.</note>The cauſe of the fleſhy Mole according to the ancient writers cannot wholly proceede from the woman, but the man muſt adde ſomewhat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. <hi>Galen</hi> holdeth, that it is bred when the mans ſeed is weake, barren, imperfect, or in little quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie; and for the moſt part choked through the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the menſtruous bloud, which is groſſe and thicke, vnfit for the framing of a child, ſo that in ſtead thereof is bread a lumpe of fleſh that by

little and little increaſeth, being wrapped in his owne membrane, which nature effecteth, as deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to bring forth any thing rather then to be idle.</p>
                     <p>The windie Mole is ingendred through want of heate in the Matrice, and other parts adioyning,<note place="margin">Windie Mole.</note> as the Liuer and Spleene, whereby much wind is bred and ſhut vp in the emptineſſe of the wombe. It may alſo come from without, as in women new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliuered, and in ſuch which hauing had their naturall courſes in great abundance, doe venture too ſoone into the cold aire.</p>
                     <p>The watry Mole proceeds from the abundance of watrie ſhowres which is ſent from the Liuer,<note place="margin">Watry Mole.</note> or the Spleene, or other parts thereabouts; or elſe through the weakenes of the Matrice, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſimilate the bloud that is brought to nouriſh it, part whereof is turned into water, and being not voided, ſtayeth in the wombe.</p>
                     <p>The humorall Mole is bred by reaſon of too much moiſture, as of ſerious, or whayiſh humors,<note place="margin">Humorall</note> of the whites, or watriſh euacuations, which come downe through the veſſels of the Matrice, and are ſtayed in the concauitie thereof.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3703:18"/>
breaſts which were ſwollen at the beginning, doe fall, and dayly wax ſoft, limber, and lanke, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out milke. In the end, the face, breaſts, armes, thighes, and legs grow leane and thin: true it is, that they ſwell towards night, like thoſe that haue the dropſie, the belly riſeth and groweth quickly, and withall very hard, for the moſt part of an equall roundneſſe, with diuers pricking paines in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the belly that neuer ceaſe, which makes them that they can hardly walke, being hindred as it were with a heauie burthen, and hauing often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a windineſſe in the wombe, as <hi>Ahaſis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Signes from the motion.</note>The ſaid <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerueth, how that by the motion it may eaſily be knowne, for in true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception the male child beginneth to ſtirre at the end of the third moneth, or ſooner; and the female at the third or fourth moneth: and where there is no ſuch quickning, we muſt obſerue whether there be any milke in the breſts, if there be none found, it is a ſigne that it is a Mole.<note place="margin">The child moueth of it ſelfe, and not the Mole.</note> Beſide, the mother fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the child moue euery way, both on the right ſide, and on the left, as much aboue, as below, and in the middle, without any helpe. But in falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, though there be ſome motion, it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall, but proceedeth rather from the expulſiue facultie of the Mother then of the Mole, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no liuing ſoule endeuoureth not of it ſelfe to come forth, neither prouoketh the wombe as the child doth, who hauing neede of aire to breath in, ſeekes after it. But this is a moſt euident ſigne when
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3703:18"/>
the woman lyes downe on either ſide, for then ſhe feeles it fall like a boule, and is not able to vphold, or ſtay it; yea, and being laid on her backe, if her belly be preſſed or cruſhed, it will remaine in the place whither it is thruſt, without comming backe againe. Now that which moſt aſſureth vs, is,<note place="margin">True ſignes.</note> when the nine moneths are paſt, and the woman not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, but her belly growes bigger, and ſwelleth more and more, and all the other parts grow leane and leſſe, this is a ſure ſigne of a Mole, though there be ſome women that haue borne their children ten, yea, eleuen moneths.</p>
                     <p>The ſignes of the windy Mole are theſe,<note place="margin">Signes of the windy.</note> the belly is equally ſwollen and ſtretched like a bladder, ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then in the fleſhy Mole, and chiefely neere the groine and neather belly, which being ſtruck vpon ſoundeth like a Tabour: ſometime it decreaſeth, and otherwhile it ſwelleth more: it is ſooner bred and increaſed then the fleſhy or watery, and ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the belly as though it would teare it, which is not proper to the fleſhy.</p>
                     <p>As for the watery and humorall,<note place="margin">Signes of the watry and humorall.</note> the ſignes are almoſt alike, the belly growes big, and riſeth by little and little. If you touch it with your finger ſometimes the print thereof will remaine behind: it is euen, without any hardneſſe. It is true, that the woman lying on her backe, her flancks are fuller and bigger then the middle and bottome of the belly, which waxe flat, the water and humor running fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one ſide to the other; and in ſhaking the belly, they feele a ſwimming and floting of water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:3703:19"/>
                        <note place="margin">Difference betweene the Watry and Humorall.</note>This difference may be alſo added, that in the the watriſh the flancks, groine, and ſometime the thighes are more diſtended and ſwollen then in the humorall, becauſe the wateriſh ſubſtance ſtealeth thither ſooneſt: beſides, that which paſſeth forth and bloweth below is cleare like water, without any ill ſmell; but that which floweth in the humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is reddiſh, and like to the waſhing of fleſh, and of a bad ſent. This alſo is to be obſerued, that in the falſe conception the naturall courſes flow not, and that the Nauell doth ſhew it ſelfe but little, or not at all, as it commonly doth when the Mother is with child. Concerning the cure thereof, I meane (god-willing) to handle it hereafter.</p>

The other is becauſe the guts, and the excrements within them, are commonly very hard, and dried in women with child, through the great heate, that is in the intrailes, which makes them that they cannot eaſily flow. The ſedentary life alſo, that women leade, is cauſe that their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements are ſtayed, and gather themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by little and little, and at the length ſtoppe vp the paſſage. This accident brings vnto them, flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing in the face, headach, beating of the Arteries; yea and oftentimes an Ague.</p>

This accident is called either a ſhift, or ſlipping away, or elſe Abortment, or (as our women call it) a miſchance: The ſhift is reckoned from the firſt day the ſeed is retained in the wombe, till ſuch time as it receiueth forme and ſhape, in which time, if it chance to iſſue and flow
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3703:45"/>
foorth, it is a Shift. The Abortment hapneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fortieth day, yea, euen to the end of the ninth moneth. For the Abortment is a violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, or excluſion of the child already formed and endued with life, before the appointed time. But the ſliding away, or ſhift, is a flowing or iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing of the ſeed, out of the wombe, which is not yet, either form'd, or endued with life.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that haue been deliuered once before their time, for the moſt part they miſcarie with the reſt of their children, about the ſame time.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Cauſes of Abortment.</note>This accident may happen vpon diuers occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the which are either inward, or outward. The outward are, either an Ague, fluxe of bloud, or of the belly, vomiting, or any other ſickneſſe that may happen vnto a woman with child; as alſo leaping, daunſing, riding in a Coach, too much ſtretching of her ſelfe, and the lifting, or carrying of any heauie burthen: the immoderate vſe of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> Paſsions of the mind, as choller, ſadneſſe, longing after any thing; or the vſe of violent and ſtrong medicines.</p>
                     <p>The inward cauſes are gathered from one of theſe three: either from the Mother, or things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to her,<note place="margin">Cauſes from the child.</note> or from the child. Thoſe that are taken from the child, are, when he is either ſo weak and ſickly, that he cannot be kept in the wombe, being not able to draw ſufficient nouriſhment, and thereby doth decay and die: or elſe by being too big and large; ſo that the wombe is not capable to lodge and ſupport him: which maketh the veſſels
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3703:45"/>
of the wombe to bee relaxed and breake: then the entrance of the womb dilates it ſelfe, and the child commeth forth.</p>
                     <p>From the mother: when ſhee is eyther too ſmall,<note place="margin">Cauſes from the mother.</note> or low of ſtature, which cauſeth that the child can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grow in ſo little roome neither moue himſelfe or breath (although he breath onely by the arteries of the mother) her breaſt beeing ſo ſtraight that it cannot be ſtretched or inlarged: or elſe becauſe ſhe is too fat, which maketh the caule to preſſe downe, and cruſh the Matrice, and cauſeth the ſeed to flow and iſſue forth before it be formed.<note place="margin">Leannes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Abort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> A woman alſo that is too leane, and doth eate but little, ſeldome or neuer beares her child the full time. For if the mother be not well nouriſhed, much leſſe can the child. Too much eating ſtifles the child: as likewiſe the vſe of vnholeſome meates doth engender ill bloud in the mother: wherewith the childe beeing nouriſht, in the ende languiſheth, whence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth death. Another cauſe may bee the ouermuch fulneſſe, and moiſtnes wherewith women abound,<note place="margin">Fulneſſe is cauſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortment.</note> and chiefly in their womb, which oftentimes is ful, and ouerflowes with moſture, and filleth the veſſels of the wombe full of ſlime, whereby the inner ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is inlarged, and dilated, vnable to ſupport, or keepe in the child.

they were not called any more to the cure of women, they accuſed the ſaid <hi>Agnodicea,</hi> that ſhe had ſhaued off her beard, that thereby ſhe might abuſe women, faining themſelues to be ſicke. Then ſhe putting aſide her garments, made it euident that ſhe was a maide: which cauſed the Phyſitions then to accuſe her of a greater fault, for tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Law, which forbad women either to ſtudie or practize Phyſicke. This being come to the eares of the chiefeſt women, they preſently went to the chiefe Magiſtrates, and Iudges of the Citie, called the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> and told them: that they did not account them, for their husbands, and friends, but for enemies; that they would condemne her, which reſtor'd them to their health: which made the <hi>Atheniaens</hi> to reuoke and diſanull that Law, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Gentle-women leaue to ſtudie and practize Phyſicke.</p>

of her paine: and that her child is euen ready to come into the world, exhorting her to be patient, and promiſing, that ſhe ſhall haue, either a goodly ſonne, or a faire daughter, according as ſhe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her affection inclined.</p>
                     <p>And the Midwiues greateſt charge muſt be, that ſhe doe nothing haſtily, or raſhly, or by force, to inlarge the paſſage of the child: and much leſſe, to let foorth the water, or to breake, and teare the membranes, that containe it: but ſhe muſt expect till it breake of it ſelfe.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The water muſt not be let foorth.</note>Some Midwiues either through ignorance, or impatience, or elſe by being haſtned to go to ſome other womans labour, do teare the membranes with their nayles, and let foorth the water, to the great hurt and danger, both of the poore woman, and her child: who remaines drie, the water being iſſued, and voided before the appointed time; yea, oftentimes before the child be well turned, which hath been the death of many women, and children. But when the water, both by the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Mother, and likewiſe of the child, ſhall be newly broken; then aſwell the Midwife, as the reſt of the women preſent, muſt more and more incourage the woman, eſpecially when her throwes increaſe; beſeeching her in the name of God, that ſhe would farther them, as much as ſhe can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. In the meane time, the Midwife muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually annoint the neather parts with butter, or ſome other fats. And when the head doth offer it ſelfe to come foorth, ſhe muſt receiue it gently
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3703:58"/>
with both her hands: which being come ſoorth, and the womans throwes increaſing, ſhe muſt draw out the ſhoulders handſomely, ſliding downe her finger vnder the childs arme-pits; taking the opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie and time when her throwes come faſteſt. And it is to be noted, that the throwes ceaſe verie little, or not at all, after the head and ſhoulders be once come forth: Neuertheleſſe, it will be very fit, to giue the poore woman a little breathing, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her, that ſhe would be of as good cheare as ſhe can. After this, the Midwife hauing drawen out the ſhoulders, may eaſily draw forth the reſt of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: which muſt not be done either haſtily or raſhly.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the child naturally doth come into the world, with the face downward: therefore when he is quite taken foorth, he muſt be turned vpon his backe: for feare leſt hee be ſtifled, or chok't.<note place="margin">The Nauell ſtring muſt be vndone.</note> And if his nauell-ſtring be woond about his necke, (as many times it happens) then muſt it be vnwoond.

When he is come to himſelfe, and begins to crie, then the Midwife muſt follow the ſtring, wagging and ſhaking it, thereby to draw, and bring foorth gently the after-birth, to which it is tyed:<note place="margin">Meanes to draw forth the after-burthen.</note> bidding the woman to cough, and likewiſe to hold ſome ſalt in her hands, faſt ſhut together, and then blow in them.</p>

                     <p>But as I ſaid before, the woman muſt be incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged when the water doth iſſue foorth, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſtraine her ſelfe to be deliuered, that the child may follow the foreſaid water.</p>

For my part, I thinke it the better &amp; ſafer way to draw him foorth by the feete, then to turne him vpſide downe, and lift his feete vpward, thereby to bring his head downward to the paſſage.

with his buttockes, backe, and hinder parts of the head, turned toward the backe of the Mother, and his face toward her Nauell, and belly, then without doubt the feet, buttocks, body and ſhoulders, of the child being drawn forth, when the head commeth to the <hi>os pubis,</hi> it will hang therein: which beeing ſo catched it will be very hard, nay impoſſible, to draw forth the child: and if you draw him too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, it is to be feared leaſt you breake his necke, eſpecially if the child be too big, or his head great. Therefore when you haue drawne him by the feete till he is come forth, as farre as the buttocks, and waſt, before you draw him any further, you muſt marke diligently the poſition of the body, whether the belly breſt, and face, be vpward, or no. For if he be ſo placed, before you draw him any further, you muſt turne him vpſide downe, which you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, if you hold him faſt by the buttockes, and hips, with both your hands, and turn the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (withall drawing it gently) and ſo bring the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, breaſt, and face downeward, which being done, you ſhall draw him forth with eaſe, without daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſtaying, or carrying the head vpon <hi>os pubis</hi>: which muſt needs happen, if the child were drawne with the face vpwards. And this haue I well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, being called to the deliuery of ſome women, where this chance, (for want of good heed taking) hath happened, the head ſticking within, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs to great trouble, to draw it foorth.

take one foote of the one, and another foote of the other: and thinking, that they were the feete of one child onely, without doubt in drawing them foorth after that manner, you would kill them both, and put the mother likewiſe in great danger of death, becauſe it would be impoſſible to draw them forth both together. And you muſt obſerue, that to draw a child well out of his Mothers wombe, you muſt haue a Napkin, or ſome other linnen cloth, that you may not hold the child naked,<note place="margin">You muſt not hold the child naked.</note> either by the feete, thighs, or other part of the body: but let it be with a warme cloth, for your hands beeing annointed, and greaſie, and the child being alſo moiſt, hee will eaſily ſlip from betweene your hands, and you ſhall

not take ſo ſtrong hold as is fit, for to bring him foorth. And yet it may happen,<note place="margin">An Obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that the inner neck of the Matrice, may not be ſo wide, as to giue way to the Chirurgions, or Midwiues hand, without great difficulty and paine: the paſſage beeing not bigger then to admit two or three fingers, by which neuertheleſſe, it is found in what manner the child commeth. If you obſerue that one foote or both come formoſt, you muſt proceed according to this example.</p>
                     <p>Being at <hi>Moret</hi> with <hi>Count Charles,</hi> I was called,<note place="margin">A ſtory.</note> together with the late <hi>Mons: de la Corde,</hi> one of the Kings Phiſitions, to deliuer a poore woman, which had beene in trauaile two daies and two nights: the waters beeing broken, and the child left dry, the necke of her Matrice was cloſed, ſhe being no more vrged with paines or throwes, which I obſerued by ſlipping vp my hand, vnto the ſaid necke, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting two of my fingers therein, where feeling one of the childs feete, I perſwaded my ſelfe that I ſhould deliuer her well, which I did in this ſort.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, when I had placed her well, I annointed my hands with butter and hogs greaſe melted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and with ſtore thereof, I annointed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward necke of the Matrice, as well as poſſibly I could: and when I had ſomewhat dilated the ſaide necke, with three of my fingers I caſt a ryband with a ſliding knot, vppon the childs foote, faſtning it gently: and then dilating againe the ſaid necke, I found out the other foote, vpon which I ſlipped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother riband, as I had done vpon the former: Then
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3703:91"/>
did I draw both the ribands, and brought the two feete together, which when I had drawne out, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the buttocks, I began againe to annoint, as before, then taking a napkin, leſt it ſhould ſlip, I bad the woman force her ſelfe, as much as ſhee could poſſibly, eſpecially when ſhee felt her paines and throws comming: and then drawing ſometimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and ſometimes to the one ſide, ſo to enlarge the paſſage, I drew on the child gently turning the belly thereof downward; that the chin might not catch in the <hi>ospubis,</hi> as I haue noted before.</p>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3703:91"/>
firſt, whether it be fitter to bring the childs head formoſt, or to draw him out by the feet. If he will draw him out by the feet, he ſhall bring him into the foreſaid ſituation, that is, to let the face of the child be turn'd toward the Mothers backe, and his backe, toward her Nauell: then ſhall he vnfold, or vnlooſe the legs, that were bow'd and bent; and ſhall draw them foorth firſt, and then the reſt of the bodie, in this ſort.<note place="margin">How to draw him foorth.</note> He ſhall ſlide his hand from the knee of the child, along the ſhine, till he come to the foote, which he ſhall draw foorth, and tye a ſmall ryband about it, and put that foot in againe, letting the ryband hang out: The like ſhall he doe to the other foot, and ſo ſhall he eaſily draw out the two feet. Then let him draw foorth the thighs, and buttockes, and if the child lie with his belly, breaſt, and face downward, and his buttockes, backe, and ſhoulders vpward; let him inſtantly, draw gently out the reſt of the child, (as we haue ſaid before.)

                     <p>I haue often repeated, this faſhion of drawing out the child, for feare leaſt the young Chirurgion erre, in performing it otherwiſe; which if he ſhould doe, he will be much troubled in drawing out the head, which may ſticke by the way, as I haue ſeen it happen.</p>

And therefore it will be neceſſarie in this caſe, to giue help with as much ſpeed, as may be: The practize whereof is in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you ſhall place the woman as we haue ſaid before,<note place="margin">Meanes to helpe the trauaile.</note> then the Chirurgion hauing his hands an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, as is required: if the child be aliue, he ſhall trie firſt with his right hand to put the feet into the Matrice, making them ſlip vp, as eaſily as he can to the bottome of the ſaid Matrice, and with his left hand, ſhall he ſtay the hands that they come not foorth further: the feet being thus thruſt backe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, he ſhall either put one of his fingers, into the childs mouth, or elſe take him by the hinder part of the head, to bring it direct againſt the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: in the meane time putting backe with his left hand, the childs hands and armes, that they may fall cloſe to his ſides: then taking the head between the palmes of his hands, he ſhall place it iuſt againſt the paſſage.

the child, and alſo by the indeuour of the Mother, when ſhe feeles her throwes come vpon her.</p>

                     <p>Likewiſe if the Chirurgion find that the child be dead, he muſt draw him forth by the feete, without troubling himſelfe to bring the head of the child, to the paſſage.

But you muſt obſerue, that the firſt beeing come foorth, hee muſt be taken from betweene his mothers legges, for feare leaſt he indanger his life;

For the thred that binds the Nauell, being left too ſhort it may ſlippe into the womb, and thereby much trouble the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: When the ſecond child is come foorth, the Chirurgion muſt ſearch whether there bee two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-burthens, or no.

                     <p>When this chaunceth, the Chirurgion ought to obſerue, whether the twins be ſeparated, (as wee ſaid before) or whether they be vnnaturall, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3703:99"/>
foure legs, one or two bodies, and likewiſe one or two heads. Now the beſt way to find it is, that the Chirurgion hauing his hand annointed (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſlip it vp gently wide open,<note place="margin">Meanes to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the child be a monſter or no.</note> as high as he can, and finding that the twins are not ioyned together, but diuided and diſtinguiſhed, he ſhall bring down his hand betweene one of their thighs, and pulling it a little lower, ſhall take hold of one of the twins feet, (that which he thinks may bee eaſieſt drawne foorth) and tye about it a riband, with a ſliding knot, towards the Ankle: then ſhall he put his hand along the ſaid legge, and ſo euen to the buttockes that thereby hee may find the other legge of the ſame child, and ioyne them together, and not bee miſtaken (taking one legge of the one twinne, and another of the other: For if he ſhould doe ſo, then without doubt in drawing of them forth, he would teare them both aſunder:) but beeing certaine by this meanes, that both the legges and feete, bee of the ſame child, you may draw them foorth gently, (as wee haue ſhewed before) taking care that the childe come with his face downeward.<note place="margin">Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt is come hee muſt be taken away.</note> When you haue thus drawne foorth the firſt, you ſhall in the ſame manner, proceed to the ſecond: hauing firſt taken away (as is ſaide before) the other, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the mothers legges. And if it happen that one of the twins come naturally, with his head for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and the other with his feete: and that his feet are more forward then the others head: then the ſafeſt way will be to draw him foorth firſt, that hath his feete formoſt: hauing firſt of all put the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3703:99"/>
that offered himſelfe at the paſſage. But if the head of the one be right againſt the paſſage and the feet of the other on the one ſide, then ſhall hee put backe the feete gently, and deliuer the woman firſt of him that had his head formoſt, and afterwards draw the other foorth by the feete.</p>
                     <p>It may alſo happen in each of the former births,<note place="margin">It muſt be knowen which is aliue.</note> that one of the twins may be dead, and the other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.

But if you find all theſe ſignes concurre,<note place="margin">How you muſt draw him out.</note> then there is ſome likelyhood that he is aliue: and therefore it will be beſt to bring his head right againſt the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that ſo the woman may be the ſooner deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer'd, which will be done the more eaſily, becauſe the liue child can better help himſelfe, then he that is dead. But if the Chirurgion thinke, that he ſhall hardly bring the head to the ſaid paſſage, and that he find the feet are neerer, and readier; then I would aduiſe him to bring the child foorth by the feet, and when the woman ſhall be deliuer'd of th'one, let him draw foorth th'other in the ſame faſhion.</p>

                     <p>And ſince that the chiefeſt, ſymptome that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens vnto them, and which comes ſooneſt, is the after-throws: therefore I am determined to ſpeake of them firſt.</p>
                     <p>As ſoone as a Woman is deliuered of her childe and after-birth, for the moſt part, ſhe is taken with paines of her belly, which oftentimes are ſo great and violent, that ſhe thinkes her very belly, would bee rent, and cut aſunder in diuers places, from whence the french word that ſignifieth theſe pains and torments,<note place="margin">Tranchees.</note> was deriued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The firſt cauſe.</note>The cauſe of theſe gripings or paines, may bee threefold. Firſt, either becauſe the Matrice &amp; thoſe parts thereabouts haue bene ſore troubled through the deliuery, by ſtriuing to bee vnburthened and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3703:115"/>
freed of the child: or elſe,<note place="margin">The ſecond</note> becauſe the bloud that runs, and gathers it ſelfe to the Wombe, (being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained) growes thicke and ſlimy, that it cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily flow, and ſo makes a diſtention of the Matrice, it being not able to come away, but in great clots, and hard matter, like vnto a falſe Conception: and likewiſe when it is altogether retained and ſtopt, it cauſes a great extenſion of the wombe.</p>
                     <p>Againe, it is oftentimes ſo cleere, thin, and ſharpe, that it flowes aboue meaſure, and through the acrimonie and biting thereof, doth gripe and torment, as it paſſeth along:<note place="margin">The third.</note> The third cauſe may proceed from the outward aire, which is enter'd, and got into the wombe, at the comming foorth of the child and the after-birth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath obſerued,<note place="margin">Sentence of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
                        </note> that women in this euacuation, are troubled with gripings &amp; paines of their firſt childmore then of any after: the reaſon is, becauſe their veines are not accuſtomed to disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themſelues in this fort. Experience neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe teacheth vs the contrarie; for a woman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of her firſt child, hath verie few of theſe paines, and gripings, and the more children ſhe hath, the more ſhe is troubled with them. The reaſon whereof ſeemes to bee this: becauſe the bloud, which in youth, is ſweet and milde, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time gets a bitter, ſalt, and aduſt qualitie, which paſſing through the veines, procureth this paine: For we find by experience, that the fleſh of beaſts, or fowle, when they are old, grow's vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, as being hard, and harſh to the taſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:3703:116"/>But what euer the cauſe of theſe paines be, we muſt ſeeke to aſſwage them, and to free the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from them, aſwell as we can. If then theſe paines be ſmall, and that the after-purgings come moderately, we may leaue the worke, wholy to nature: onely giuing the woman in child-bed the drinke we preſcribed before: of Oile of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, or of Walnuts, which of late hath been found by experience, to be better, then the Oile of Almonds, ſo that the Nuts be ſound, and white, not rancide, and the oyle drawne without fire.</p>
                     <p>This Oyle is much commended, for the gripings which comes by the acrimonie and ſharpneſſe of the bloud: and in this caſe alſo, ſome eaſie fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of warme Milke, or fit vpon the belly and lower parts:<note place="margin">Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Fomentations alſo with <hi>Mallowes, March Mallowes, Parietarie, Mugwort, Camomile, Melilot, and Linſeed,</hi> boiled in Milke, are verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
                     <p>When theſe paines and pangs proceed of thicke ſlimy bloud, which cannot eaſily flow: or of windy matter, which being ſhut vp, cannot be diſcuſſed, if the paine continue, beſide thoſe aforeſaid, you may vſe theſe remedies following.</p>

And in this caſe the Chirurgion muſt be carefull, for if they bee bigge, and cleaue to the wombe, they may bring much inconuenience to the woman, by their long ſtaying behind. So then it will be neceſſary for him to know, whether there be any of this kind, and of what nature it is, which he ſhal learne of the Mother, by demanding of her, how ſhe found her ſelfe all the time ſhee went with child. Firſt then let him enquire of her, whether ſhe were very big, at that time, and if ſhe had any hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in any part of her belly, whether ſhee hath beene vſed to any ſuch accident, with her other children: for there are women, which at euery birth haue of theſe falſe conceptions, and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Miſtris Brague-longue,</hi>

                     <p>Beſide theſe ſimptomes, women that haue falſe conceptions ſomwhat bigger, and cleauing faſt to the wombe, are troubled with great paine about the nauell, with vnquietnes, watring of the mouth, vomiting, and heauineſſe downeward.

                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> As for the firſt point, which is the changing of the child, that may eaſily come to paſſe; becauſe as ſoone as the child is borne, and Chriſtned, the Mother pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently deliuers it to the Nurſe, to bee carried into the Country: Where the child, being wholly left to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Nurſe, may by ſome ill chance be ſtifled, ouer-laid, be let fall, and ſo come to an vntimely death: or elſe may be deuoured, ſpoiled, or diſfigured by ſome wild beaſt, Wolfe, or Dogge, and then the Nurſe fearing to be puniſhed for her negligence, may take another child into the place of it, which can hardly euer be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and diſtinguiſhed: And indeede when children grow ſomwhat big, and are brought home from Nurſe, if they proue not like their parents in body, in conditions and wit, the Prouerbe goes, <hi>That they are chaunged at Nurſe</hi>; Which ſometimes may bee truer, then they are aware of.</p>
                  <p>The Hiſtoriographers report that <hi>Arthebar</hi> King of the Epirotes being old, had one only ſonne, whoſe nurſe was corrupted with great gifts to change him, and to take a Gentlemans ſonne into his place. But when the King was dead, the Nurſe repenting her ſelfe of this wickedneſſe, reuealed the error: wherupon enſued ſuch terrible wars, betweene the lawfull and the ſuppoſed ſon, that both of them loſt their liues, in a battaile. Vpon
<pb facs="tcp:3703:139"/>
this occaſion, <hi>Thomiſtus</hi> the ſeuenth King of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> leauing two ſonnes behind him, when he dyed; the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> choſe the younger of them for their King, becauſe he had beene nurſed by the Queene his Mother; and reiected the eldeſt, who had beene brought vp by a ſtrange woman; fearing leaſt he had bene changed by his Nurſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> For the ſecond point which is naturall affection, without doubt that cannot bee ſo earneſt, either from the Mother toward the child, or from the chlld toward the Mother; if ſhee haue not nurſed him and giuen him ſucke. For if ſhe nurſe him, he ſucks and draws her owne bloud. Whereupon grows a familiar inwardnes, and the child (when he comes to yeares of diſcretion) finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe bound to his Mother, for many benefits: both in that ſhe hath borne him nine Moneths in her womb, and alſo becauſe ſhee hath nurſed him, watched him, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made him cleane. In recompence whereof, he ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to ſhew her a thouſand delights, to make her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or take in good part, ſo much care and paines, as ſhee hath taken with him. Hee playes a number of apiſh trickes about her, he kiſſeth her, ſtrokes her haire, noſe, and eares: he flatters her, he counterfeits anger, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſsions, and as he groweth bigger, hee finds other ſports with her, which cauſeth that they beare one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch an affection, as cannot be expreſſed; &amp; makes that they can neuer be parted: When hee is bigge, and comes to be weaned, if one chide his nurſe he cries, and ſtamps: and if one offers to take him out of his nurſes armes, he will flye in their faces, and if it were poſsible, he would euen pull out their heart: and all this proceeds from that inward affection of the child, to which no
<pb facs="tcp:3703:140"/>
loue can bee compared. And heereupon <hi>Plato</hi> iuſtly ſaid, <hi>That children would neuer loue their parents ſo well; but that their fathers doe often beare them in their armes, and the mothers giue them ſucke at their owne breaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And heereof wee haue a memorable example in <hi>Cornelius Scipio,</hi> who when he had condemned ten of his moſt valiant Captaines to death, he would not heare his owne Brother <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> intreating for them, and yet granted their pardon, to one that had bin his Foſter-brother, and ſucked the ſame Nurſe: which being obiected to him, by his owne Brother, ſaying; That they had been borne both of one Mother; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd him, That his Nurſe-Mother had deſerued bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him, than his owne Mother had done. One of the familie of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> returning from the warre, met his owne Mother, and his Nurſe together: but he addreſsing himſelfe, firſt to his Nurſe, preſented to her a Girdle of gold, and then to his Mother, a Iewell of of ſiluer: which ſhe taking indig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ely, and rebuking him with reproaches, he replyed: I know (Mother) that you bore me nine Moneths in your wombe, yet that was out of neceſsitie, becauſe you could do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but when I was borne, then you forſoke me, and my Nurſe-mother willingly intertain'd me, carried me three yeares in her armes, and nouriſh'd me with her owne bloud.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> As for the maners and conditions of the child, there is no doubt to be made, but that they are better bred and faſhioned by the Mother, than by the Nurſe. For first, it is deliuered by learned writers, that the Manners and conditions of the mind, do follow the
<pb facs="tcp:3703:140"/>
temperament of the bodie, and the temperament ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out of the nouriſhment: ſo that commonly, ſuch as the humours are, ſuch proue the manners. Hence muſt we conclude, that the child that ſuckes a Nurſe, that is vitious, and wicked; ſucketh alſo from her, her faults and vices: And beſide, when the child comes to vnderſtanding, and obſerues what the Nurſe ſpeakes and doth, he retaines that, ſaies it after her, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates her: and that which is imprinted from the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, will hardly, or neuer be rooted out. For this cauſe <hi>Plato</hi> warnes vs, not to ſpeake, or ſhew any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a child, which is not decent, and honeſt: and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> forbids, to let a child ſee any wanton or laſciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous picture. Then (to returne to our Nurſe) we may be aſsured, that the Milke (wherewith the child is nouriſh'd two yeares together) hath as much power to make the children like the Nurſes, both in bodie, and mind; as the ſeed of the Parents hath to make the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren like them. For although the child be borne of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Parents, neuertheleſſe, the bad nurture of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Nurſe, will make the child vicious and wicked: For, (as the prouerbe is) <hi>Nurture preuailes more than Nature.</hi> This may be plainly obſerued in all things, that haue life: for a faire and flouriſhing tree, which hath been bred in a good and fat ground, if it be tranſplanted into a barren ground, becomes a ſhrub, and beares no fruit, that is good, and taſtfull. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the graine that is ſowed in good ground, will beare a faire and odoriferous flower; but if it be caſt into bad ground, it will bring foorth a baſtard flower, without any good or pleaſing ſmell. It is reported, that a certaine child, was nouriſh'd with the milke of
<pb facs="tcp:3703:141"/>
a Bitch: But he would riſe in the night and houle with other dogges. <hi>Plato</hi> going about to giue a reaſon, why <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was ſo hardy, although he were an Athenian (who naturally were milde and timerous) reſolues it thus: becauſe the ſaid <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had been nurſed by a Lacedaemonian woman, which is a verie ſtout, and valiant Nation.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> As for the imperfections of the bodie, which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may borrow from their Nurſes, although they bee very many, yet conſider only thoſe, which the corpulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and diſeaſes of the Nurſe may bring them. <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> writeth, that the Germanes of all other people, are the biggeſt, and ſtrongeſt of bodie; and the reaſon is, becauſe they are nurs'd by their Mothers, which are big of ſtature. And it is obſeru'd, that they which put foorth their children, to women of ſmall ſtature, haue them, neither ſo big, nor ſtrong and able of bodie, as if they had brought them vp themſelues. If a young Lambe ſucke a Goate, it is found by experience, that the wooll of it will be harder, then of other ſheepe, and he will prooue more fierce, and wild, then is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall for his kind.</p>
                  <p>And to this purpoſe, <hi>Procopius</hi> relates a ſtorie of <hi>Polopeia,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer'd in ſecret of a ſonne, and deſirous to conceal her immodeſtie, caus'd him to be caſt into a forrest, where he being found by a Sheep-heard, was brought vp and nouriſh'd with Goates milke, (from whence he tooke the name of <hi>Aegiſtus</hi>) which made him ſo ſwift of foot, that eueryone did admire him for his nimbleneſſe and quickneſſe in running.</p>
                  <p>Now, concerning the diſeaſes of Nurſes, you ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:3703:141"/>
find more of them, polluted and infected with the french Poxes, and other diſeaſes; than ſound and healthfull. And I haue knowen Nurſes giue little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the French Pockes, who afterwards lying with their owne parents, haue likewiſe infected them.</p>
                  <p>Now what a diſgrace, and what a ſorrow &amp; griefe of hart, this would be to a Mother, if ſuch a chance ſhould happen, I leaue vnto you (faire Ladies) to iudge.</p>
                  <p>And therefore euery Mother ſhould endeauour, by all meanes poſsible (if ſhe be not ſickly, or too tender) to nurſe her child her ſelfe; ſince that nature hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd two Paps vpon her, onely for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>There are no other Creatures, but giue ſucke to their young ones, and if you do but onely make a ſhew, that you would take them from their dams, what a coyle and ſtir doe they make? If you carrie them away, they will run after you, and neuer leaue, till you haue let go your hold: deſiring rather to looſe their owne liues, than ſuffer their little ones to be carried away.</p>
                  <p>And therefore let Mothers neuer put foorth their children to nurſe (if they themſelues be ſound and healthfull) for feare of being chang'd. So ſhall you be ſure, to haue Children, which will honour and loue you, without ſetling their affections vpon a ſtranger: Then ſhall you not need to make any doubt, but that your Children will be vertuous, and honeſt; not being addicted to any vices, which they may take from their Nurſes: and they ſhall not learne any diſhonest, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent ſpeeches; nor heare any thing that ſhall be either laſciuious, or vnbefitting: then ſhall you be ſure, that your children will be healthfull, ſince they haue been
<pb facs="tcp:3703:142"/>
nouriſh'd with good milke, and not fed with Apples, Peares, Sops, and ſuch like traſh, which is often giuen them, for want of milke. And by this meanes, you ſhall haue faire and goodly children, well brought vp, docile, vertuous, louing, ſtrong, and luſty, without any diſeaſes: Then ſhall you be accounted for Mothers indeed, and not Step-Mothers: and therefore neuer make your excuſes, that you cannot, nor are not able to endure the trouble, and paines; or that your Husbands will not ſuffer you to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, I would haue you imitate <hi>Blanche of Caſtile,</hi> ſometimes Queene of France, who nurs'd the King <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lewes</hi> her ſonne her owne ſelfe; and on a time, as ſhe was out of the way, her child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing froward, a great Ladie of the Court gaue him ſucke, to ſtill him, and make him quiet: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Queenes eare, ſhe preſently tooke the child, and thruſt her finger ſo far downe into his throat, that ſhe made him vomit vp all the milke, he had ſuckt of the ſaid Ladie, being very angry that any woman ſhould giue her child ſucke, but her ſelfe.</p>

may giue him a little ſucke, and lay him to ſleepe: And when hee is wakened and hath beene made cleane, then the Nurſe ſhall carry him abroad into the aire, if it be faire wether, and giue him ſucke, and then lay him to ſleepe againe, without letting him eate any ſolide meate, or very little.

And in their ſecond age (which is when their teeth begin to come) they are troubled with itching of the gums and chiefely when the dog teeth come foorth, and thoſe are moſt troubled therewithall, which are more fat, and fleſhy, and which are bound in their belly. But becauſe there are many other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that they are ſubiect vnto, whether it be that they bring them from their mothers wombe, with them, or that they happen to them afterwards: therefore I will briefly ſpeak of them all, beginning firſt with thoſe that doe moſt trouble them.</p>

The latter muſt be helped by ſetting the bones againe in their right place, whether it bee that they were out of ioint, or elſe broken, and then bind them, and keepe them ſo till they be well grown together, and haue taken firme hold.</p>
                     <p>As for hurts and bruiſes, they muſt bee bathed with ſome fomentation, made of Roſes, Melilot, &amp; Chamomil flowers, and then annointed with Saint Iohns Wort and Roſes, mingled together.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T chaunceth oftentimes, that the childs head after he is born, is bigger then naturally it ought to bee, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which is very dangerous, and hard to be cured: whereof there bee three kinds.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is called of the Greekes, <hi>Macrocephalos,</hi> which is, when the head is bigger then naturally it ſhould be: and yet this comes naturally, as when the bones of the head bee large, and of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe containing great ſtore of brayne, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the compaſſe and circuit of them, there being neither winde, nor waters, nor any other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, that are the cauſe thereof. Nature hauing thus proportioned it: and it is ſo heauy and vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that the child cannot hold it vpright, his necke beeing conſtrained to bow vnder it, with the very waight, ſo that it had neede to bee prop't vp with ſome thing or other: Now there is contrary to this another which is called <hi>Microcephalos</hi> that is a little head, ſuch a one had <hi>Therſites</hi> the Grecian and one <hi>Triboulet</hi> who was a French man. Both theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3703:161"/>
are very hard to bee cured, yea almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond kind is called <hi>Hydrocephalos,</hi> which is, when the head becomes big, by reaſon of ſome waters therein contained. Of the which there are diuers ſorts: for either the waters are contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the skin, and the <hi>Pericraneum</hi>; or betwixt the <hi>Pericraneum</hi> and the bone; or betweene the bone and the membranes, called <hi>Dura mater,</hi> and <hi>Pia mater:</hi> Some of them are particular, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe but onely one part of the head; others are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and affect it wholy.</p>
                     <p>Some of them haue their ſpring and beginning,<note place="margin">The Cauſe.</note> euen from the Mothers wombe: which hapneth when the Mother, while ſhee was with childe, through an ill Diet, gathered ſtore of crudities and raw humours, whereof there is bred a watriſh and flegmatike bloud, with the which the child being fed, and not being able to digeſt, or conſume it, much leſſe to euacuate and void it by the paſſages appointed by nature, the watriſh matter gathers it ſelfe together in the head.</p>
                     <p>It may alſo proceed from the child, being not well purg'd of the ſuperfluities which are gathered in his braine, and diffuſed ouer all the head, or part thereof: whereunto we may adde the ill nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the child receiueth from his Nurſe, whoſe milke is either ſerous and watriſh, or ouer-heated, which cauſeth diuers vapours, to aſcend vp into the braine, which are there conuerted into watriſh humors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:3703:162"/>The third kind is called <hi>Phiſocephalos,</hi> when there chanceth to be a wind, which runneth betweene the skin of the head, and the bone; and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the skull, and <hi>dura mater</hi>; which cauſeth the head to be ſo ſwolne, and puft vp, (as <hi>Auicen</hi> ſaith) that there haue been diuers children which haue dyed of it; the bones of the head being verie much thruſt outward, which is verie painfull: And certainly, there is nothing that cauſeth greater diſtention, or more paine, then when there is ſome wind incloſed, in what part ſoeuer it be of the bodie.</p>
                     <p>The watrie ſwelling hath almoſt the like cauſes, by reaſon of ſome watriſh matter, that is bred in the braine, which through the weakneſſe of the naturall heat, cannot well be diſperſed, and ſo it is turned into wind: or elſe through ſome vapours, which ariſe from the neather parts, which do alſo diſtend, and ſtretch out the parts of the head.</p>
                     <p>They are all of them different one from another: for the <hi>Macrocephalos,</hi> or great headed, yeelds not any impreſſion when it is cruſh'd, becauſe it is the bones which make it ſo big and ſwolne: but in the watriſh ſwelling, the finger enters eaſily, and leaues an impreſſion as an <hi>O Edema</hi> doth: But if you preſſe the windy ſwelling, it leaues no marke, or print, but preſently it riſeth vp againe like a foot-ball.</p>
                     <p>Now, to know whether the water be contained betwixt the bones of the head, and the membranes of the braine: it may eaſilie be diſcerned by the paine, and by the accidents: as if there happen any

                        <hi>Vertigo,</hi> or <hi>Epilepſy,</hi> to the child, and that he ſleep, little, or not at all; as alſo his continuall crying doth witneſſe it.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the windie ſwelling ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,<note place="margin">The cure of <hi>Phiſocephalos.</hi>
                        </note> by appointing the Nurſe to keep a good Diet, vſing meates that ſhall neither breed wind, nor crudities.</p>
                     <p>Concerning outward medicines,<note place="margin">Outward medicines.</note> it is good to vſe Fomentations: for ſuch kind of medicines ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may do him verie much good, if the wind be contain'd between the skin, and the <hi>Pericraneum,</hi> or betwixt the <hi>Pericraneum,</hi> and the skull.

This ſtring muſt be cut with a ſizzer within a few daies after he is borne: and then the nurſe muſt thruſt her finger vnder the childs tongue, and lay there at the firſt a little chaw'd ſalt to keepe it from growing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againe.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another ſtring, which is both har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bigger, and more firme, then the former: which

begins at the root of the tongue, and ſtretcheth it ſelfe almoſt through the middle thereof, the which ſtring is oftentimes ſo ſhort, that it hinders the child from ſtretching it, and putting it foorth of his mouth, and alſo from turning and wagging it, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bring backe the meat hee hath chaw'd, that hee may ſwallow it. This may eaſily be perceiued, for if you bid the childe to put out his tongue hee cannot doe it; for when he goes about to doe it, it binds and folds double in his mouth, hee not being able to make it come farther then his lips: which much hindereth him in his ſpeech, and in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of his words, making him commonly to ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>

thus tyed. But this way in my opinion, is more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then the former. But whether it be cut or tyed, it will leaue an vlcer which muſt be healed, as wee haue ſhewed before, taking care that the ſtring grow not together againe.</p>

                     <p>The Cure muſt be varied according to the cauſe of the diſeaſe.

                     <p>If the little one haue neede to be purged, it will bee fitter to giue the Nurſe a purgation then the child: which muſt neither be very ſtrong, nor with any <hi>Diagridium,</hi>

The ill qualitie of the Vrine is, when it is hote, ſharpe, and pricking, which makes the child afraid to piſſe: becauſe of the paine which they feele when their water comes. The Vrine offends in quantitie, when it is in ſo great abundance, and doth ſo ouer-charge the bladder, that the Fibres being ouer-ſtretched, can not draw themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to expect the vrine: which happens to them which haue kept their water too long.<note place="margin">Children muſt be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten held out to piſſe.</note> And for this cauſe, children muſt oft be called vpon to piſſe,

And when they grow bigger, let them make water both before and after they eate: for ſince they abound with moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and haue their bladder but ſmall, they muſt in no wiſe keep their water long: and therefore if ſome-times they bepiſſe themſelues in their ſleep, they muſt not be much chidden, or beaten, for feare leaſt if they hold their water by force, they fall into this difficultie of voiding it.</p>

And this may happen to young children, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> noteth:<note place="margin">Hippocr. lib. 3.

                     <p>For the help heerof, you muſt bring foorth the ſtone, by the help of a little inſtrument, like to this heere deſcribed, in the faſhion of an eare-picker; which you ſhall vſe in this maner.</p>
                     <p>You muſt hold downe the child faſt, that he ſtir not; and then the Chirurgion muſt take the yard betweene the fore-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and the thumbe with his left hand, by that part, which is next toward the groine, that is beyond the ſtone: for feare, leaſt in the performance of the worke, it ſlip vp, and goe backe againe: Then holding the little inſtrument in his right

                     <p>Sometimes it happens, that the Stone is ſo big, that it cannot be taken away by this meanes; and then we are conſtrained to make an inciſion in the yard; which muſt be done in this manner.</p>
                     <p>You muſt hold the yard faſt with the left hand, taking it by the midſt, ſo that halfe the thickneſſe of it may be betweene you finger and thumbe, and the other halfe out, that ſo the Stone may riſe and ſwell vp the more, on that ſide: Then on that ſide that the Stone ſwels vp, right ouer and againſt the Stone, let an inciſion be made, ſo deep, till you come to the Stone; which when you find, you ſhal put vnder it ſuch a ſmall inſtrument, as hath been before deſcribed, therewith to draw it foorth.

but drop by drop, this imperfection cauſeth a great deale of filth to be gatherd betwixt the <hi>Praeputium</hi> and the <hi>Glans,</hi> whereof proceedeth many trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and dangerous vlcers, yea, and ſometimes a Gangrene. I haue obſerued it, in ſome young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that the top of the yard, hath become blacke and blew with piſſing, through the very paine they endured.</p>
                     <p>The beſt way to remedie it, is to cut off the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie top and end of the <hi>Praeputium,</hi> thereby to take away a piece of it, as they doe in the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For the performance whereof, there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers meanes, but the ſafeſt and leaſt painfull way, is this.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The order of cutting the <hi>Praeputium.</hi>
                        </note>Firſt, it is to be conſider'd, that the <hi>Praeputium</hi> is double, ſo that when one thinks to cut both the skins, he cuts but one; for the ſecond leaps away eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially from betweene the Sizzers.

                     <p>I haue learned this manner of practiſe, of <hi>Monſ. de Maverne,</hi> the Kings Phyſition in Ordinary, who hath cauſed it to bee done after this faſhion: and it is the order and Methode, which the Iewes at this day, doe obſerue, in their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: If you haue not ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, you may take two little flat peeces of wood, and tye them
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3703:190"/>

both together at one end, and then put the <hi>Praeputium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, as we haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, afterwards tying both the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends together, reaſonable hard, &amp; then cut away ſo much of the <hi>Praeputium</hi> as is without the wood, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as you ſee ſmiths cut off the tops of horſe eares.</p>
                     <p>This method may be alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, when the <hi>Praeputium</hi> is too much enlarged, though it hinder not the vrine from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming foorth, which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, for feare leaſt it ſhould ſlip ouer the <hi>Glans</hi> in ſuch ſort that it could not come backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and leaſt it might cauſe a <hi>Paraphimoſis,</hi> which is more dangerous then the <hi>Phimoſis,</hi> &amp; often hapneth to thoſe that are ſomwhat bigge.

the <hi>Glans</hi> and the <hi>Praeputium,</hi> euen to the ſtring at the bottome of it, and there ſuddenly we deuide all the <hi>Praeputium</hi> below, hard by the ſtring, which I haue done very often, and not long ſince for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Gentleman, <hi>Monſ.

                     <p>As for the <hi>Paraphimoſis</hi> of little children,<note place="margin">The <hi>Paraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſis</hi> of little children.</note> it is of two ſorts: For the <hi>Praeputium</hi> being ſlipped vp ouer the <hi>Glans,</hi> it either ſtickes and ſtayes ſo, or elſe it is onely too ſhort, and will eaſily be brought ouer it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and couer it, but not ſtaying ſo, it goes backe againe ſtraight: To that which doth cleaue and ſtick to it, it is not fit to do any thing, by reaſon of the youngeſſe of the child: And for the other, which is onely too ſhort,<note place="margin">The Authors opinion.</note> becauſe it breedes no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, I would aduiſe the Chirurgion not to meddle with it, but rather to defer the practiſe of it, till the child be grown bigger, and be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, which ſhall bee done in this ſort.</p>
                     <p>You muſt firſt of all,<note place="margin">The method of doing it.</note> turne backe all the <hi>Praeputi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> that you may the better come at the inner membrane, which you muſt hold very faſt; &amp; make an inciſion round about it, the which inciſion muſt goe no deeper then the ſaid inner membrane: then letting it bleed well, you muſt make ſuch another
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3703:191"/>
inciſion round about the vppermoſt membrane, which muſt go no deeper then to the nethermoſt: and preſently as ſoone as you haue made theſe two inciſions, you muſt pul out the <hi>Praeputium</hi> at length which will eaſily ſtretch, becauſe both the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes by reaſon of the foreſaid inciſions, wil yeeld. Afterwards you muſt haue a care, that the ſaid inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions grow not together again, and that the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt membrane bee not glued, and ſticke to the <hi>Glans,</hi> or top of the yard: which you may hinder by laying betwixt them, fine little linnen rags, ſpread ouer with ſome ointment, which may ſerue alſo to heale the ſaid inciſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">An other way</note>Some after they haue made theſe inciſions, pull the <hi>Praeputium</hi> quite ouer the <hi>Glans,</hi> and tye it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable hard, that the vrine may haue a paſſage, as alſo by this meanes to keepe it from going backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and then afterwards they vntie it, when they would dreſſe the inner inciſion.</p>

And it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeru'd, that the <hi>Praeputium</hi> muſt be alwaies tyed at the end, otherwiſe it would turne back againe, and the inciſion would grow together.</p>

                     <p>When it happens that there is no paſſage at the end of the yard, then muſt the Chirurgion verie cunningly make an hole there, that the vrine may haue free paſſage to come foorth: which being done, it muſt be kept open, and skinn'd ouer with little cearing candles put therein, which muſt be bow'd at the top, for feare leaſt they ſhould get whole into the bladder;<note place="margin">A good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.</note> which I haue ſeen happen vnto ſome: The ſaid cearing candle muſt be gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rub'd ouer with a little powder of Bole, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, and vpon it ſhall be laid a little plaſter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerans Galeni.</hi>

                     <p>If it chance, that the hole be not big enough, it muſt be widened with fine little cearing candles, fitted to the paſſage, and made with medicines that are ſomewhat corroſiue, thereby to fetch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the vpper skin of the hole: Taking great heed, that the candle go but a little way in; becauſe the paſſage is narrow and ſtraite onely at the end, the reſt being commonly large enough: And when the hole is wide enough, it muſt be cicatriz'd with the like cearing candles, as we haue ſhewne already, obſeruing the ſame methode as before.</p>
                     <p>When the hole of the yard is at the bottome, and not at the end, where it ought to be naturally:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3703:192"/>
If it may bee done poſſiblie, that the bottome of the <hi>Glans</hi> muſt be ſtopp'd vp, and an other made in the end of it: For thoſe that haue the hole ſo low, cannot piſſe ſtraight, but downeward, or elſe they are conſtrained to hold vp their yard toward their bellie. And when they grow to be men, their ſeed cannot be carried ſtraight, as it ought: which may be a meanes to hinder them from hauing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                     <p>For the performance of the Cure, it will be verie needfull to excoriate the ſides of the ſaid paſſage, and to breed a little fleſh there, and afterwards to confirme and skin it: hauing firſt of all made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other little hole at the end of the ſaid <hi>Glans,</hi> which muſt be dreſs'd and skinn'd with little cearing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, as we haue ſhewne alreadie.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all the other accidents heretofore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I haue ſeen the yard of ſome children ſo crooked, that when it roſe and grew ſtiffe, the <hi>Glans</hi> or top of it was drawne, and bow'd quite downeward, which made them, that they could not piſſe ſtraight.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T remaineth now, that we ſpeake of the Meaſells, and the ſmall Pockes: and becauſe there bee few children but haue them eyther firſt or laſt,<note place="margin">Few children eſcape the ſmall pocks.</note> I haue thought good, heere to ſay a word or two of them briefly.</p>
                     <p>The Meaſels and the Pocks,<note place="margin">What the meaſels and the pocks are.</note> are little riſings or puſtules, which appeare moſt commonly in great number, vpon the outſide of the skinne: and at the firſt, they are ſo like one another, that you can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerne whether of them it is. But yet the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels come more ſuddenly, and the face and skinne of the whole body lookes redder: and the redneſſe continues longer without riſing; there beeing ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it moſt commonly a greater itching and pricking.<note place="margin">Difference.</note> But the ſmall pockes comes not foorth ſo ſuddenly, neither is the skinne ſo red: nor doth the colour ſtay ſo long: the puſtules or pimples riſe higher, neither itching nor pricking ſo much, and at length grow white.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of both of them,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> are the reliques of the impurer part of the bloud, wherewith the child was nouriſhed in his Mothers wombe; which now is ſeparated and thruſt to the skin, through the help and ſtrength of nature, becauſe the childs bloud
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3703:197"/>
boileth in the veines of euery part of the bodie: (as <hi>Auicen</hi> ſaith) No otherwiſe then new wine doth in a veſſell,<note place="margin">A good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</note> which boyleth, caſting vp his froath, or ſcum, and ſeparating it from it ſelfe. And, (as <hi>Auenzoar</hi> ſaith) though the child be nouriſhed, with the beſt part of the menſtruall bloud, yet there remaines ſome little portion behind, which is of an ill qualitie; and after the child is borne, and is growne ſtrong, he gathering together his forces and naturall heat, thruſts it foorth by the pores of the skin, nature being willing to acquite and rid her ſelfe of this ſuperfluitie.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, there is a certaine diſpoſition of time, cauſed through the malignitie of the aire, which raiſeth and ſtirreth vp the reliques of the ſaid men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruall bloud in the childs bodie, wherewith he hath been nouriſhed: vnto which the corrupt aire (that we breath, and which we cannot auoide) doth adde an impreſſion, of a ſecond bad qualitie, wherewith nature being ouer-charg'd and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhe thruſts them out to the skin, which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the filth and vncleanneſſe of the bodie.</p>
                     <p>Now, the fuller the bodie is, of this menſtruall bloud, the deeper impreſſion doth the outward aire make in it: which is the reaſon, that ſome haue them in greater quantitie, and are fuller of them, then others: And ſo according to the malignitie of the humour, it is alſo more, or leſſe dangerous to ſome, then to others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Signes.</note>The marks and ſignes whereby you may know that the child will haue the Pockes, are theſe:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3703:197"/>
Headach, together with an Ague, redneſſe of the eyes, which water verie often, itching of the noſe, a drie Cough, gaping, wearineſſe of the bodie, paine of the Hart, deſire to vomit, the vrine red, a pricking, and ſhiuering through all the bodie, and ſometimes convulſions, and rauings. When it is the Meaſels, the face growes red, and ariſeth all at once: but when it is the Pocks, neither the face, nor the reſt of the bodie looke ſo red: but you may perceiue ſome little riſings here and there, in the face, backe, breaſt, and thigh's, which afterwards increaſe, and grow bigger.</p>
                     <p>And when the Pocks begin to ſhew themſelues, then there happens heauineſſe of the head, the face ſwelleth, the eyes are ſetled, all the bodie becomes as it were puff'd vp, the voice growes hoarſe, with difficultie of fetching breath, and ſoreneſſe of the throat: For it is the propertie of this vile diſeaſe, to take hold of the Lungs; and yet we ſee oftener then we would, that the ſmall Pocks do fall euen vpon the bones, and corrupt them.</p>
                     <p>The ſigneſ to iudge of the euent of them,<note place="margin">Good ſignes.</note> are theſe: If the Ague be but little, and diminiſheth as the Pocks come foorth: if they be but few in number, and thoſe ſcattered here and there: if they come foorth eaſily, without much paine, and that the child is not much diſquieted, if they grow white and ripen quickly: theſe are ſignes of recouerie. But if the Ague continue, and increaſe at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming foorth of them,<note place="margin">Bad ſignes.</note> if they thruſt foorth in great quantitie, one vpon another; and if they run as it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3703:198"/>
were all into one ſcab, not ripening ſpeedily; if the child be verie hoarſe, and not able to ſpeake; or fall into a bloudie flixe, theſe are ill ſignes. The firſt ſheweth, that it hath ſeized vpon the Lungs: and the ſecond, that it fretteth the guts.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the ſmall Pocks is verie dangerous, when it comes foorth with paine and griefe, though they be white. When they be ſmall, greene, blewiſh, or blacke, and that they ſinke downe, and grow drie on the ſuddaine, not comming to maturation and ſuppuration: if the child piſſe bloud, and then by and by after his vrine turnes to be blacke, it is ſigne of death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The ſignes of the Meaſels.</note>Concerning the Meaſels, if they be but reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble red, and haue no ill accidents ioined with them, but go away ſuddainly, they are not to be feared: But when they are high colour'd, or if they be blewiſh, or greeniſh, accompanied with vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, paine of the heart, weakneſſe, the bloudie Flixe, and the like, they are verie dangerous.</p>

                     <p>As ſoone as little Children are taken with this diſeaſe, they crie and take on extreamely, and yet one can not perceiue any cauſe, why they ſhould do ſo; which brings them oftentimes euen to their graue, for that this diſeaſe drawes along with it Epylepticall convulſions: becauſe the Sinewes

which come foorth of the backe-bone, and are ſcattred on each ſide, are ouer burthened, and fill'd with ſome fuliginous vapour, of which Haires are bred, and they by their great length, and continuitie, are carried directlie to the braine: whither when they are come, they cauſe this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                     <p>The women of the Countrie of Languedocke, becauſe it is a common diſeaſe with them, make no great reckoning of it, and doe helpe it in this manner.</p>
                     <p>With the palme of their hand, they do rub the bottome of the childs backe and raines downe to the crupper bone ſo long, till they feele through the pores of the skin, the tops of verie ſtiffe and pricking Haires to come foorth, like vnto hoggs briſtles: which as ſoone as they ſee, that they are come foorth, they pull them away by and by with their nayles, or elſe with ſuch little pincers, as women vſe to pull the haire from off their eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browes.</p>
