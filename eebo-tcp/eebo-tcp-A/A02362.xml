            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> noteth, and experience Å¿hews it to be true that the ill Å¿ent only of a Candle new put foorth, is enough to deÅ¿troy a child in the mothers wombe, Å¿o that Å¿hee may be forced to fall in trauaile, and be deliuered before her time, vnleÅ¿Å¿e her Å¿trength be the greater to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the

offence. And although the child Å¿tay the full time that nature hath prefixed him: yet commonly he is not able to get foorth, or come Å¿afely into the Worlde (yea though the birth be naturall) without the helpe not onely of the Mother, and himÅ¿elfe: but alÅ¿o of the Mid-wife and other women about her ready to receiue and cheriÅ¿h him: And which is worÅ¿t of all; if he be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced awry, or elÅ¿e be weake and faint, or elÅ¿e if the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife be at the fartheÅ¿t of her skill; then if they will Å¿aue the child, and Å¿o conÅ¿equently the mother from death: they muÅ¿t call a Chirurgion to deliuer her, and bring the child into the world: which (that I may touch it by the way without taxing any) is commonly done too late eyther through the wilfulneÅ¿Å¿e of the kinÅ¿folks, or obÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the Midwiues.</p>
                  <p>But grant that the childe comes into the world of it Å¿elfe, without the helpe either of Chirurgion or Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife: yet (as it is commonly Å¿aid) he drawes his death after him: the which may be plainely perceiued by the cryes and laments which he maketh as Å¿oone as he Å¿eeth the light, as if hce craued for helpe and Å¿uccour. For if he Å¿hould continue in that caÅ¿e that hee comes from his mothers wombe, clogged with his bed or after-birth, without doubt this bedde being putrified, would infect the child, and at length kill it. BeÅ¿ides, oftentimes if there were not helpe to make a free paÅ¿Å¿age, in the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament, yard, or other naturall places, that are Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cloÅ¿ed vp, there could neither Å¿uÅ¿tenance be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, nor excrements expelled, which would cauÅ¿e the child to be Å¿tifled, and choked vp.</p>
                  <p>Many times alÅ¿o the head, and other parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb facs="tcp:3703:4"/>
(as the bones and legges) happen to be ill Å¿hapen, yea broken and out of ioint, which would neuer come of themÅ¿elues, into their proper and naturall place. There, then is it neceÅ¿Å¿ary that the Chirurgion vÅ¿e his helpfull and skilfull hand: So that euery man may plainly Å¿ee the neceÅ¿sity and Antiquity of this worke: Å¿ince that the firÅ¿t practiÅ¿e in Chirurgery, that euer was done in the world, was the <hi>Omphalotomia,</hi> or cutting of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> practiÅ¿ed on their firÅ¿t child.</p>
                  <p>TheÅ¿e therefore are the Motiues that haue induced me to publiÅ¿h this diÅ¿courÅ¿e, and therin to treat of Å¿uch diÅ¿eaÅ¿es as happen to women with child.</p>
                  <p>And heerein I haue endeuoured to helpe them both in their naturall, and extraordinary trauaile: and to eaÅ¿e them in all Å¿uch accidents, as may happen vnto them in their childbed: being the rather incited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by reading the complaints of Women, related by <hi>Soranus. O malÃ¨ occupatum virorum genus! oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidimur nos non morimur: &amp; ab illis qui inter vos peritiÅ¿Å¿imi exiÅ¿timantur perperam curatae.

                  <p>O men, how ill doe you beÅ¿tow your time, and paines! Alas, wee women die not, but are tormented euen to death: For thoÅ¿e that are accounted the moÅ¿t expert and skilfull among you, take not that care of vs which they Å¿hould: you fill whole Libraries with large volumes &amp; writings of euerie light and triuiall diÅ¿eaÅ¿e of your

owne making little or no mention at all, of our cruell and inÅ¿upportable torments.</p>
                  <p>I had purpoÅ¿ed aboue fifteene yeares Å¿ince, to haue written Å¿omwhat concerning this Å¿ubiect in my books of Chirurgery: but hauing more maturely conÅ¿idered thereof, I thought it fitter to write a TreatiÅ¿e of it by it Å¿elfe: which it deÅ¿erueth both for the difficultie of the Å¿ubiect, and for the variety of the matter which I was deÅ¿irous to obÅ¿erue therein: And indeede this worke excelleth all other, which are practiÅ¿ed vppon the body of man: whether ye reÅ¿pect the Antiquity, NeceÅ¿si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For the Antiquitie: without doubt the firÅ¿t worke in Chirurgery, that euer was in the worlde, was the cutting of the Nauell which, (as is Å¿aide before) <hi>Adam</hi> practiÅ¿ed vppon his firÅ¿t borne.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the neceÅ¿sity: Å¿ome perhaps may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that the bringing a bed of women, is not Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary a worke as theÅ¿e following:</p>

                  <p>Yet neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e we Å¿ee, that he which hath an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyema</hi> or Å¿uppuration doth oftentimes expell the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and filth, by the mouth or vrine (the waies beeing manifeÅ¿t, by which nature doth vnburthen her Å¿elfe) and he that hath the DropÅ¿ie auoideth the water, eyther by vrine, or Å¿toole, yea, and by Å¿weat, or by Å¿ome little vent which Nature makes in Å¿ome part of the body, as in the Nauell or legges: which we obÅ¿erue by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in many men: and therefore wee may perceiue, that theÅ¿e practiÅ¿es are not alwaies, Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiÅ¿ite.</p>
                  <p>For letting bloud; you will Å¿ay, that hee hazards his life, (and that Å¿odainely) who beeing oppreÅ¿Å¿ed, and
<pb facs="tcp:3703:6"/>
troubled with a great paine of his head or Å¿ide, is not Å¿peedily let bloud? becauÅ¿e the bloud that boyleth in his veines, striueth onely to come foorth; I will anÅ¿were: that Nature very often Å¿ends it foorth by the NoÅ¿e, Mouth, Eies, and Eares: by Å¿toole alÅ¿o, and other parts, disburthening her Å¿elfe to the Å¿icke Mans eaÅ¿e and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: But It is not Å¿o in the deliuery of women; for if the entrance of the wombe be cloÅ¿ed, (as it is Å¿eene in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers) whether it be naturally, by reaÅ¿on of a Å¿trong and thicke membrane, which Å¿hutteth vp the paÅ¿Å¿age: or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e Å¿ome Å¿carre happening there, hath hardned, and Å¿hrunke vp the Å¿ides of the necke of the Å¿aid wombe: it would be impoÅ¿sible that nature Å¿hould euer be able to Å¿eparate, and breake through th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>Å¿e im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments: for as for the one, it is hard for a penne or quill to paÅ¿Å¿e there, and for the other, you cannot put in a Å¿mall probe through the little hole which is in the middeÅ¿t of the membrane. And yet I haue had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience thereof in two women, which were neuer the leÅ¿Å¿e with child, as I will Å¿hew more at large heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that either the Chirurgions helpe muÅ¿t bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed, or elÅ¿e both the Mother and the child would die mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erablie.</p>
                  <p>Some may obiect vnto mee, that the Mother might open the paÅ¿Å¿age her Å¿elfe by tearing the parts Å¿o bound by the Å¿carre, &amp; breaking through the Å¿aid membrane? But what will you anÅ¿were me, for her which hath her child turned awry and lies double in her wombe, and falleth into a ConvulÅ¿ion, or fluxe of bloud, or both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Mother not being able eyther to turne it, or pull it foorth, eÅ¿pecially if the head of it bee intangled
<pb facs="tcp:3703:6"/>
and faÅ¿tned betweene the bones of <hi>os Pubis,</hi> Å¿o that it is impoÅ¿sible to turne it, Å¿afe and Å¿ound, except the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion vÅ¿e his induÅ¿try and skill.</p>
                  <p>Now for the dexteritie: there is no compariÅ¿on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this and other practiÅ¿es; for there be no workes to be done in Chirurgery; where it is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary, to haue the benefit either of daylight or candle light, and the part which is to be handled, and dreÅ¿Å¿ed muÅ¿t be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and laid open to the eye.</p>
                  <p>Whereas contrariwiÅ¿e in this worke as well by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of the company preÅ¿ent, as alÅ¿o, least the woman Å¿hould be afraid, the very entrance, whereby hee Å¿hould put in his hand, they are conÅ¿trained to hide: and then his hand being there, he muÅ¿t Å¿earch for the child) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer it be placed) not being able to Å¿ee it. And if there be found two, three, or foure Children, yea, Å¿ometime fiue (as <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> reporteth, hee Å¿aw in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, a Woman that brought foorth to the number of threeÅ¿core and fiue children, beeing deliuered euerie yeare of fiue) then (I Å¿ay) I leaue you to iudge what skill and dexteritie the Chirurgion ought to vÅ¿e in Å¿eeking them one after another if they come amiÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
                  <p>On the other Å¿ide, as often as a woman is well deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the helpe and hand of the Chirurgion, there life is giuen to two, to wit: to the Mother and the childe. And therfore as this worthy man Å¿aith, <hi>In partu in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocatur dei auxilium: quaeritur enim &amp; parturien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis &amp; naÅ¿centis Å¿alus.</hi> When a woman is in trauaile, they call vppon God for helpe: becauÅ¿e they deÅ¿ire to Å¿aue both the Mother and the child. Now in all other pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿es, though they attaine to their wiÅ¿hed end, yet can
<pb facs="tcp:3703:7"/>
there bee but one onely Å¿aued at once. Whereby it may be iudged, that this practiÅ¿e is both for the Antiquitie, NeceÅ¿sitie, and dexterity thereof, the moÅ¿t laudable and commendable of all others.</p>
                  <p>To make the which more eaÅ¿ie, and the better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truct the young Chirurgion: I haue gathered together all that I could poÅ¿sibly, out of that which I haue obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this forty yeares and aboue, wherein I haue practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed it, and Å¿eene it practiÅ¿ed, in the greateÅ¿t families both within, and without this Kingdom, where, thanks be to God, good vÅ¿e hath beene made of me. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I haue not refuÅ¿ed nor diÅ¿dained to go vnto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, mooued partly by Charity, and partly to make my Å¿elfe more and more experienced therein.</p>
                  <p>Hauing then conferred together, what eyther the Graecians and Latines both ancient and Moderne haue written, with that I haue beene able to obÅ¿erue: and hauing reduced it all into one, I haue put it into French in fauour of thoÅ¿e who are not Å¿o well learned, and haue not the knowledge of the Greeke or Latine tongues.</p>
                  <p>Some will Å¿ay (to diminiÅ¿h that little honor, which I might get by this my labour) that the Ancients haue written the greateÅ¿t part heereof. But they Å¿hall learne from the mouth of this great Oracle, <hi>That there is no leÅ¿Å¿e witte and vnderÅ¿tanding required, to bee able to iudge of Sciences formerly written, then to bee the firÅ¿t Authors of them.</hi>

This accident is called either a Å¿hift, or Å¿lipping away, or elÅ¿e Abortment, or (as our women call it) a miÅ¿chance: The Å¿hift is reckoned from the firÅ¿t day the Å¿eed is retained in the wombe, till Å¿uch time as it receiueth forme and Å¿hape, in which time, if it chance to iÅ¿Å¿ue and flow

foorth, it is a Shift. The Abortment hapneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fortieth day, yea, euen to the end of the ninth moneth. For the Abortment is a violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulÅ¿ion, or excluÅ¿ion of the child already formed and endued with life, before the appointed time. But the Å¿liding away, or Å¿hift, is a flowing or iÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uing of the Å¿eed, out of the wombe, which is not yet, either form'd, or endued with life.</p>

                     <p>The inward cauÅ¿es are gathered from one of theÅ¿e three: either from the Mother, or things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to her,<note place="margin">CauÅ¿es from the child.</note> or from the child.

This being come to the eares of the chiefeÅ¿t women, they preÅ¿ently went to the chiefe MagiÅ¿trates, and Iudges of the Citie, called the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> and told them: that they did not account them, for their husbands, and friends, but for enemies; that they would condemne her, which reÅ¿tor'd them to their health: which made the <hi>Atheniaens</hi> to reuoke and diÅ¿anull that Law, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Gentle-women leaue to Å¿tudie and practize PhyÅ¿icke.</p>

Now the beÅ¿t way to find it is, that the Chirurgion hauing his hand annointed (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) Å¿lip it vp gently wide open,<note place="margin">Meanes to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the child be a monÅ¿ter or no.</note> as high as he can, and finding that the twins are not ioyned together, but diuided and diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed, he Å¿hall bring down his hand betweene one of their thighs, and pulling it a little lower, Å¿hall take hold of one of the twins feet, (that which he thinks may bee eaÅ¿ieÅ¿t drawne foorth) and tye about it a riband, with a Å¿liding knot, towards the Ankle: then Å¿hall he put his hand along the Å¿aid legge, and Å¿o euen to the buttockes that thereby hee may find the other legge of the Å¿ame child, and ioyne them together, and not bee miÅ¿taken (taking one legge of the one twinne, and another of the other: For if he Å¿hould doe Å¿o, then without doubt in drawing of them forth, he would teare them both aÅ¿under:) but beeing certaine by this meanes, that both the legges and feete, bee of the Å¿ame child, you may draw them foorth gently, (as wee haue Å¿hewed before) taking care that the childe come with his face downeward.<note place="margin">Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the firÅ¿t is come hee muÅ¿t be taken away.</note> When you haue thus drawne foorth the firÅ¿t, you Å¿hall in the Å¿ame manner, proceed to the Å¿econd: hauing firÅ¿t taken away (as is Å¿aide before) the other, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the mothers legges. And if it happen that one of the twins come naturally, with his head for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t, and the other with his feete: and that his feet are more forward then the others head: then the Å¿afeÅ¿t way will be to draw him foorth firÅ¿t, that hath his feete formoÅ¿t: hauing firÅ¿t of all put the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ide

that offered himÅ¿elfe at the paÅ¿Å¿age. But if the head of the one be right againÅ¿t the paÅ¿Å¿age and the feet of the other on the one Å¿ide, then Å¿hall hee put backe the feete gently, and deliuer the woman firÅ¿t of him that had his head formoÅ¿t, and afterwards draw the other foorth by the feete.</p>
                     <p>It may alÅ¿o happen in each of the former births,<note place="margin">It muÅ¿t be knowen which is aliue.</note> that one of the twins may be dead, and the other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.

But if the Chirurgion thinke, that he Å¿hall hardly bring the head to the Å¿aid paÅ¿Å¿age, and that he find the feet are neerer, and readier; then I would aduiÅ¿e him to bring the child foorth by the feet, and when the woman Å¿hall be deliuer'd of th'one, let him draw foorth th'other in the Å¿ame faÅ¿hion.</p>

                     <hi>1.</hi> As for the firÅ¿t point, which is the changing of the child, that may eaÅ¿ily come to paÅ¿Å¿e; becauÅ¿e as Å¿oone as the child is borne, and ChriÅ¿tned, the Mother pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently deliuers it to the NurÅ¿e, to bee carried into the Country: Where the child, being wholly left to the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the NurÅ¿e, may by Å¿ome ill chance be Å¿tifled, ouer-laid, be let fall, and Å¿o come to an vntimely death: or elÅ¿e may be deuoured, Å¿poiled, or diÅ¿figured by Å¿ome wild beaÅ¿t, Wolfe, or Dogge, and then the NurÅ¿e fearing to be puniÅ¿hed for her negligence, may take another child into the place of it, which can hardly euer be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed: And indeede when children grow Å¿omwhat big, and are brought home from NurÅ¿e, if they proue not like their parents in body, in conditions and wit, the Prouerbe goes, <hi>That they are chaunged at NurÅ¿e</hi>; Which Å¿ometimes may bee truer, then they are aware of.</p>
                  <p>The HiÅ¿toriographers report that <hi>Arthebar</hi> King of the Epirotes being old, had one only Å¿onne, whoÅ¿e nurÅ¿e was corrupted with great gifts to change him, and to take a Gentlemans Å¿onne into his place. But when the King was dead, the NurÅ¿e repenting her Å¿elfe of this wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, reuealed the error: wherupon enÅ¿ued Å¿uch terrible wars, betweene the lawfull and the Å¿uppoÅ¿ed Å¿on, that both of them loÅ¿t their liues, in a battaile. Vpon
<pb facs="tcp:3703:139"/>
this occaÅ¿ion, <hi>ThomiÅ¿tus</hi> the Å¿euenth King of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> leauing two Å¿onnes behind him, when he dyed; the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> choÅ¿e the younger of them for their King, becauÅ¿e he had beene nurÅ¿ed by the Queene his Mother; and reiected the eldeÅ¿t, who had beene brought vp by a Å¿trange woman; fearing leaÅ¿t he had bene changed by his NurÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> For the Å¿econd point which is naturall affection, without doubt that cannot bee Å¿o earneÅ¿t, either from the Mother toward the child, or from the chlld toward the Mother; if Å¿hee haue not nurÅ¿ed him and giuen him Å¿ucke. For if Å¿he nurÅ¿e him, he Å¿ucks and draws her owne bloud. Whereupon grows a familiar inwardnes, and the child (when he comes to yeares of diÅ¿cretion) finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe bound to his Mother, for many benefits: both in that Å¿he hath borne him nine Moneths in her womb, and alÅ¿o becauÅ¿e Å¿hee hath nurÅ¿ed him, watched him, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made him cleane. In recompence whereof, he ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to Å¿hew her a thouÅ¿and delights, to make her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or take in good part, Å¿o much care and paines, as Å¿hee hath taken with him. Hee playes a number of apiÅ¿h trickes about her, he kiÅ¿Å¿eth her, Å¿trokes her haire, noÅ¿e, and eares: he flatters her, he counterfeits anger, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paÅ¿sions, and as he groweth bigger, hee finds other Å¿ports with her, which cauÅ¿eth that they beare one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿uch an affection, as cannot be expreÅ¿Å¿ed; &amp; makes that they can neuer be parted: When hee is bigge, and comes to be weaned, if one chide his nurÅ¿e he cries, and Å¿tamps: and if one offers to take him out of his nurÅ¿es armes, he will flye in their faces, and if it were poÅ¿sible, he would euen pull out their heart: and all this proceeds from that inward affection of the child, to which no
<pb facs="tcp:3703:140"/>
loue can bee compared. And heereupon <hi>Plato</hi> iuÅ¿tly Å¿aid, <hi>That children would neuer loue their parents Å¿o well; but that their fathers doe often beare them in their armes, and the mothers giue them Å¿ucke at their owne breaÅ¿ts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And heereof wee haue a memorable example in <hi>Cornelius Scipio,</hi> who when he had condemned ten of his moÅ¿t valiant Captaines to death, he would not heare his owne Brother <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> intreating for them, and yet granted their pardon, to one that had bin his FoÅ¿ter-brother, and Å¿ucked the Å¿ame NurÅ¿e: which being obiected to him, by his owne Brother, Å¿aying; That they had been borne both of one Mother; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer'd him, That his NurÅ¿e-Mother had deÅ¿erued bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him, than his owne Mother had done. One of the familie of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> returning from the warre, met his owne Mother, and his NurÅ¿e together: but he addreÅ¿sing himÅ¿elfe, firÅ¿t to his NurÅ¿e, preÅ¿ented to her a Girdle of gold, and then to his Mother, a Iewell of of Å¿iluer: which Å¿he taking indig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ely, and rebuking him with reproaches, he replyed: I know (Mother) that you bore me nine Moneths in your wombe, yet that was out of neceÅ¿sitie, becauÅ¿e you could do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e; but when I was borne, then you forÅ¿oke me, and my NurÅ¿e-mother willingly intertain'd me, carried me three yeares in her armes, and nouriÅ¿h'd me with her owne bloud.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> As for the maners and conditions of the child, there is no doubt to be made, but that they are better bred and faÅ¿hioned by the Mother, than by the NurÅ¿e. For first, it is deliuered by learned writers, that the Manners and conditions of the mind, do follow the
<pb facs="tcp:3703:140"/>
temperament of the bodie, and the temperament ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth out of the nouriÅ¿hment: Å¿o that commonly, Å¿uch as the humours are, Å¿uch proue the manners. Hence muÅ¿t we conclude, that the child that Å¿uckes a NurÅ¿e, that is vitious, and wicked; Å¿ucketh alÅ¿o from her, her faults and vices: And beÅ¿ide, when the child comes to vnderÅ¿tanding, and obÅ¿erues what the NurÅ¿e Å¿peakes and doth, he retaines that, Å¿aies it after her, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates her: and that which is imprinted from the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, will hardly, or neuer be rooted out. For this cauÅ¿e <hi>Plato</hi> warnes vs, not to Å¿peake, or Å¿hew any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a child, which is not decent, and honeÅ¿t: and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿totle</hi> forbids, to let a child Å¿ee any wanton or laÅ¿ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous picture. Then (to returne to our NurÅ¿e) we may be aÅ¿sured, that the Milke (wherewith the child is nouriÅ¿h'd two yeares together) hath as much power to make the children like the NurÅ¿es, both in bodie, and mind; as the Å¿eed of the Parents hath to make the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren like them. For although the child be borne of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿t Parents, neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, the bad nurture of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked NurÅ¿e, will make the child vicious and wicked: For, (as the prouerbe is) <hi>Nurture preuailes more than Nature.</hi> This may be plainly obÅ¿erued in all things, that haue life: for a faire and flouriÅ¿hing tree, which hath been bred in a good and fat ground, if it be tranÅ¿planted into a barren ground, becomes a Å¿hrub, and beares no fruit, that is good, and taÅ¿tfull. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e, the graine that is Å¿owed in good ground, will beare a faire and odoriferous flower; but if it be caÅ¿t into bad ground, it will bring foorth a baÅ¿tard flower, without any good or pleaÅ¿ing Å¿mell. It is reported, that a certaine child, was nouriÅ¿h'd with the milke of
<pb facs="tcp:3703:141"/>
a Bitch: But he would riÅ¿e in the night and houle with other dogges. <hi>Plato</hi> going about to giue a reaÅ¿on, why <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was Å¿o hardy, although he were an Athenian (who naturally were milde and timerous) reÅ¿olues it thus: becauÅ¿e the Å¿aid <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had been nurÅ¿ed by a Lacedaemonian woman, which is a verie Å¿tout, and valiant Nation.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> As for the imperfections of the bodie, which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may borrow from their NurÅ¿es, although they bee very many, yet conÅ¿ider only thoÅ¿e, which the corpulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and diÅ¿eaÅ¿es of the NurÅ¿e may bring them. <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> writeth, that the Germanes of all other people, are the biggeÅ¿t, and Å¿trongeÅ¿t of bodie; and the reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e they are nurs'd by their Mothers, which are big of Å¿tature. And it is obÅ¿eru'd, that they which put foorth their children, to women of Å¿mall Å¿tature, haue them, neither Å¿o big, nor Å¿trong and able of bodie, as if they had brought them vp themÅ¿elues. If a young Lambe Å¿ucke a Goate, it is found by experience, that the wooll of it will be harder, then of other Å¿heepe, and he will prooue more fierce, and wild, then is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall for his kind.</p>
                  <p>And to this purpoÅ¿e, <hi>Procopius</hi> relates a Å¿torie of <hi>Polopeia,</hi> the daughter of <hi>TheÅ¿eus,</hi> who being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer'd in Å¿ecret of a Å¿onne, and deÅ¿irous to conceal her immodeÅ¿tie, caus'd him to be caÅ¿t into a forrest, where he being found by a Sheep-heard, was brought vp and nouriÅ¿h'd with Goates milke, (from whence he tooke the name of <hi>AegiÅ¿tus</hi>) which made him Å¿o Å¿wift of foot, that eueryone did admire him for his nimbleneÅ¿Å¿e and quickneÅ¿Å¿e in running.</p>
                  <p>Now, concerning the diÅ¿eaÅ¿es of NurÅ¿es, you Å¿hall
<pb facs="tcp:3703:141"/>
find more of them, polluted and infected with the french Poxes, and other diÅ¿eaÅ¿es; than Å¿ound and healthfull. And I haue knowen NurÅ¿es giue little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the French Pockes, who afterwards lying with their owne parents, haue likewiÅ¿e infected them.</p>
                  <p>Now what a diÅ¿grace, and what a Å¿orrow &amp; griefe of hart, this would be to a Mother, if Å¿uch a chance Å¿hould happen, I leaue vnto you (faire Ladies) to iudge.</p>
                  <p>And therefore euery Mother Å¿hould endeauour, by all meanes poÅ¿sible (if Å¿he be not Å¿ickly, or too tender) to nurÅ¿e her child her Å¿elfe; Å¿ince that nature hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tow'd two Paps vpon her, onely for that purpoÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>There are no other Creatures, but giue Å¿ucke to their young ones, and if you do but onely make a Å¿hew, that you would take them from their dams, what a coyle and Å¿tir doe they make? If you carrie them away, they will run after you, and neuer leaue, till you haue let go your hold: deÅ¿iring rather to looÅ¿e their owne liues, than Å¿uffer their little ones to be carried away.</p>
                  <p>And therefore let Mothers neuer put foorth their children to nurÅ¿e (if they themÅ¿elues be Å¿ound and healthfull) for feare of being chang'd. So Å¿hall you be Å¿ure, to haue Children, which will honour and loue you, without Å¿etling their affections vpon a Å¿tranger: Then Å¿hall you not need to make any doubt, but that your Children will be vertuous, and honeÅ¿t; not being addicted to any vices, which they may take from their NurÅ¿es: and they Å¿hall not learne any diÅ¿honest, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent Å¿peeches; nor heare any thing that Å¿hall be either laÅ¿ciuious, or vnbefitting: then Å¿hall you be Å¿ure, that your children will be healthfull, Å¿ince they haue been
<pb facs="tcp:3703:142"/>
nouriÅ¿h'd with good milke, and not fed with Apples, Peares, Sops, and Å¿uch like traÅ¿h, which is often giuen them, for want of milke. And by this meanes, you Å¿hall haue faire and goodly children, well brought vp, docile, vertuous, louing, Å¿trong, and luÅ¿ty, without any diÅ¿eaÅ¿es: Then Å¿hall you be accounted for Mothers indeed, and not Step-Mothers: and therefore neuer make your excuÅ¿es, that you cannot, nor are not able to endure the trouble, and paines; or that your Husbands will not Å¿uffer you to do Å¿o.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, I would haue you imitate <hi>Blanche of CaÅ¿tile,</hi> Å¿ometimes Queene of France, who nurs'd the King <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lewes</hi> her Å¿onne her owne Å¿elfe; and on a time, as Å¿he was out of the way, her child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing froward, a great Ladie of the Court gaue him Å¿ucke, to Å¿till him, and make him quiet: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Queenes eare, Å¿he preÅ¿ently tooke the child, and thruÅ¿t her finger Å¿o far downe into his throat, that Å¿he made him vomit vp all the milke, he had Å¿uckt of the Å¿aid Ladie, being very angry that any woman Å¿hould giue her child Å¿ucke, but her Å¿elfe.</p>

may giue him a little Å¿ucke, and lay him to Å¿leepe: And when hee is wakened and hath beene made cleane, then the NurÅ¿e Å¿hall carry him abroad into the aire, if it be faire wether, and giue him Å¿ucke, and then lay him to Å¿leepe againe, without letting him eate any Å¿olide meate, or very little.

                     <p>The firÅ¿t is called of the Greekes, <hi>Macrocephalos,</hi> which is, when the head is bigger then naturally it Å¿hould be: and yet this comes naturally, as when the bones of the head bee large, and of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿e containing great Å¿tore of brayne, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the compaÅ¿Å¿e and circuit of them, there being neither winde, nor waters, nor any other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, that are the cauÅ¿e thereof. Nature hauing thus proportioned it: and it is Å¿o heauy and vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that the child cannot hold it vpright, his necke beeing conÅ¿trained to bow vnder it, with the very waight, Å¿o that it had neede to bee prop't vp with Å¿ome thing or other: Now there is contrary to this another which is called <hi>Microcephalos</hi> that is a little head, Å¿uch a one had <hi>TherÅ¿ites</hi> the Grecian and one <hi>Triboulet</hi> who was a French man. Both theÅ¿e acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3703:161"/>
are very hard to bee cured, yea almoÅ¿t im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poÅ¿Å¿ible.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿econd kind is called <hi>Hydrocephalos,</hi> which is, when the head becomes big, by reaÅ¿on of Å¿ome waters therein contained. Of the which there are diuers Å¿orts: for either the waters are contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the skin, and the <hi>Pericraneum</hi>; or betwixt the <hi>Pericraneum</hi> and the bone; or betweene the bone and the membranes, called <hi>Dura mater,</hi> and <hi>Pia mater:</hi> Some of them are particular, and poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e but onely one part of the head; others are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and affect it wholy.</p>
                     <p>Some of them haue their Å¿pring and beginning,<note place="margin">The CauÅ¿e.</note> euen from the Mothers wombe: which hapneth when the Mother, while Å¿hee was with childe, through an ill Diet, gathered Å¿tore of crudities and raw humours, whereof there is bred a watriÅ¿h and flegmatike bloud, with the which the child being fed, and not being able to digeÅ¿t, or conÅ¿ume it, much leÅ¿Å¿e to euacuate and void it by the paÅ¿Å¿ages appointed by nature, the watriÅ¿h matter gathers it Å¿elfe together in the head.</p>
                     <p>It may alÅ¿o proceed from the child, being not well purg'd of the Å¿uperfluities which are gathered in his braine, and diffuÅ¿ed ouer all the head, or part thereof: whereunto we may adde the ill nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the child receiueth from his NurÅ¿e, whoÅ¿e milke is either Å¿erous and watriÅ¿h, or ouer-heated, which cauÅ¿eth diuers vapours, to aÅ¿cend vp into the braine, which are there conuerted into watriÅ¿h humors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:3703:162"/>The third kind is called <hi>PhiÅ¿ocephalos,</hi> when there chanceth to be a wind, which runneth betweene the skin of the head, and the bone; and alÅ¿o be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the skull, and <hi>dura mater</hi>; which cauÅ¿eth the head to be Å¿o Å¿wolne, and puft vp, (as <hi>Auicen</hi> Å¿aith) that there haue been diuers children which haue dyed of it; the bones of the head being verie much thruÅ¿t outward, which is verie painfull: And certainly, there is nothing that cauÅ¿eth greater diÅ¿tention, or more paine, then when there is Å¿ome wind incloÅ¿ed, in what part Å¿oeuer it be of the bodie.</p>
                     <p>The watrie Å¿welling hath almoÅ¿t the like cauÅ¿es, by reaÅ¿on of Å¿ome watriÅ¿h matter, that is bred in the braine, which through the weakneÅ¿Å¿e of the naturall heat, cannot well be diÅ¿perÅ¿ed, and Å¿o it is turned into wind: or elÅ¿e through Å¿ome vapours, which ariÅ¿e from the neather parts, which do alÅ¿o diÅ¿tend, and Å¿tretch out the parts of the head.</p>
                     <p>They are all of them different one from another: for the <hi>Macrocephalos,</hi> or great headed, yeelds not any impreÅ¿Å¿ion when it is cruÅ¿h'd, becauÅ¿e it is the bones which make it Å¿o big and Å¿wolne: but in the watriÅ¿h Å¿welling, the finger enters eaÅ¿ily, and leaues an impreÅ¿Å¿ion as an <hi>O Edema</hi> doth: But if you preÅ¿Å¿e the windy Å¿welling, it leaues no marke, or print, but preÅ¿ently it riÅ¿eth vp againe like a foot-ball.</p>
                     <p>Now, to know whether the water be contained betwixt the bones of the head, and the membranes of the braine: it may eaÅ¿ilie be diÅ¿cerned by the paine, and by the accidents: as if there happen any

                        <hi>Vertigo,</hi> or <hi>EpilepÅ¿y,</hi> to the child, and that he Å¿leep, little, or not at all; as alÅ¿o his continuall crying doth witneÅ¿Å¿e it.</p>

                        </note> by appointing the NurÅ¿e to keep a good Diet, vÅ¿ing meates that Å¿hall neither breed wind, nor crudities.</p>

This Å¿tring is very Å¿lender and Å¿oft, and it hindreth the childe from putting it out at length, and from taking the nipple (as they Å¿ay) that he cannot Å¿ucke well. This Å¿tring muÅ¿t be cut with a Å¿izzer within a few daies after he is borne: and then the nurÅ¿e muÅ¿t thruÅ¿t her finger vnder the childs tongue, and lay there at the firÅ¿t a little chaw'd Å¿alt to keepe it from growing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againe.</p>

begins at the root of the tongue, and Å¿tretcheth it Å¿elfe almoÅ¿t through the middle thereof, the which Å¿tring is oftentimes Å¿o Å¿hort, that it hinders the child from Å¿tretching it, and putting it foorth of his mouth, and alÅ¿o from turning and wagging it, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bring backe the meat hee hath chaw'd, that hee may Å¿wallow it. This may eaÅ¿ily be perceiued, for if you bid the childe to put out his tongue hee cannot doe it; for when he goes about to doe it, it binds and folds double in his mouth, hee not being able to make it come farther then his lips: which much hindereth him in his Å¿peech, and in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of his words, making him commonly to Å¿tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Another way</note>The Å¿econd way alÅ¿o is, by lifting vp the tongue, and holding it faÅ¿t, (as hath beene already Å¿aide) and then with a needle with a double thred in it, you Å¿hall draw the thred croÅ¿Å¿e the Å¿aid Å¿tring, or ligament (to wit, as farre as you would cut it) and tye it hard, cutting away the ends of the thred Å¿om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what neere the knot, and Å¿o let it Å¿tay there till it hath Å¿eparated that part of the Å¿tring or ligament

                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T remaineth now, that we Å¿peake of the MeaÅ¿ells, and the Å¿mall Pockes: and becauÅ¿e there bee few children but haue them eyther firÅ¿t or laÅ¿t,<note place="margin">Few children eÅ¿cape the Å¿mall pocks.</note> I haue thought good, heere to Å¿ay a word or two of them briefly.</p>
                     <p>The MeaÅ¿els and the Pocks,<note place="margin">What the meaÅ¿els and the pocks are.</note> are little riÅ¿ings or puÅ¿tules, which appeare moÅ¿t commonly in great number, vpon the outÅ¿ide of the skinne: and at the firÅ¿t, they are Å¿o like one another, that you can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diÅ¿cerne whether of them it is. But yet the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿els come more Å¿uddenly, and the face and skinne of the whole body lookes redder: and the redneÅ¿Å¿e continues longer without riÅ¿ing; there beeing ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it moÅ¿t commonly a greater itching and pricking.<note place="margin">Difference.</note> But the Å¿mall pockes comes not foorth Å¿o Å¿uddenly, neither is the skinne Å¿o red: nor doth the colour Å¿tay Å¿o long: the puÅ¿tules or pimples riÅ¿e higher, neither itching nor pricking Å¿o much, and at length grow white.</p>
                     <p>The cauÅ¿e of both of them,<note place="margin">CauÅ¿e.</note> are the reliques of the impurer part of the bloud, wherewith the child was nouriÅ¿hed in his Mothers wombe; which now is Å¿eparated and thruÅ¿t to the skin, through the help and Å¿trength of nature, becauÅ¿e the childs bloud
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3703:197"/>
boileth in the veines of euery part of the bodie: (as <hi>Auicen</hi> Å¿aith) No otherwiÅ¿e then new wine doth in a veÅ¿Å¿ell,<note place="margin">A good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariÅ¿on.</note> which boyleth, caÅ¿ting vp his froath, or Å¿cum, and Å¿eparating it from it Å¿elfe. And, (as <hi>Auenzoar</hi> Å¿aith) though the child be nouriÅ¿hed, with the beÅ¿t part of the menÅ¿truall bloud, yet there remaines Å¿ome little portion behind, which is of an ill qualitie; and after the child is borne, and is growne Å¿trong, he gathering together his forces and naturall heat, thruÅ¿ts it foorth by the pores of the skin, nature being willing to acquite and rid her Å¿elfe of this Å¿uperfluitie.</p>
                     <p>BeÅ¿ides, there is a certaine diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of time, cauÅ¿ed through the malignitie of the aire, which raiÅ¿eth and Å¿tirreth vp the reliques of the Å¿aid men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truall bloud in the childs bodie, wherewith he hath been nouriÅ¿hed: vnto which the corrupt aire (that we breath, and which we cannot auoide) doth adde an impreÅ¿Å¿ion, of a Å¿econd bad qualitie, wherewith nature being ouer-charg'd and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Å¿he thruÅ¿ts them out to the skin, which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the filth and vncleanneÅ¿Å¿e of the bodie.</p>
                     <p>Now, the fuller the bodie is, of this menÅ¿truall bloud, the deeper impreÅ¿Å¿ion doth the outward aire make in it: which is the reaÅ¿on, that Å¿ome haue them in greater quantitie, and are fuller of them, then others: And Å¿o according to the malignitie of the humour, it is alÅ¿o more, or leÅ¿Å¿e dangerous to Å¿ome, then to others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Signes.</note>The marks and Å¿ignes whereby you may know that the child will haue the Pockes, are theÅ¿e:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3703:197"/>
Headach, together with an Ague, redneÅ¿Å¿e of the eyes, which water verie often, itching of the noÅ¿e, a drie Cough, gaping, wearineÅ¿Å¿e of the bodie, paine of the Hart, deÅ¿ire to vomit, the vrine red, a pricking, and Å¿hiuering through all the bodie, and Å¿ometimes convulÅ¿ions, and rauings. When it is the MeaÅ¿els, the face growes red, and ariÅ¿eth all at once: but when it is the Pocks, neither the face, nor the reÅ¿t of the bodie looke Å¿o red: but you may perceiue Å¿ome little riÅ¿ings here and there, in the face, backe, breaÅ¿t, and thigh's, which afterwards increaÅ¿e, and grow bigger.</p>
                     <p>And when the Pocks begin to Å¿hew themÅ¿elues, then there happens heauineÅ¿Å¿e of the head, the face Å¿welleth, the eyes are Å¿etled, all the bodie becomes as it were puff'd vp, the voice growes hoarÅ¿e, with difficultie of fetching breath, and Å¿oreneÅ¿Å¿e of the throat: For it is the propertie of this vile diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, to take hold of the Lungs; and yet we Å¿ee oftener then we would, that the Å¿mall Pocks do fall euen vpon the bones, and corrupt them.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿igneÅ¿ to iudge of the euent of them,<note place="margin">Good Å¿ignes.</note> are theÅ¿e: If the Ague be but little, and diminiÅ¿heth as the Pocks come foorth: if they be but few in number, and thoÅ¿e Å¿cattered here and there: if they come foorth eaÅ¿ily, without much paine, and that the child is not much diÅ¿quieted, if they grow white and ripen quickly: theÅ¿e are Å¿ignes of recouerie. But if the Ague continue, and increaÅ¿e at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming foorth of them,<note place="margin">Bad Å¿ignes.</note> if they thruÅ¿t foorth in great quantitie, one vpon another; and if they run as it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3703:198"/>
were all into one Å¿cab, not ripening Å¿peedily; if the child be verie hoarÅ¿e, and not able to Å¿peake; or fall into a bloudie flixe, theÅ¿e are ill Å¿ignes. The firÅ¿t Å¿heweth, that it hath Å¿eized vpon the Lungs: and the Å¿econd, that it fretteth the guts.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the Å¿mall Pocks is verie dangerous, when it comes foorth with paine and griefe, though they be white. When they be Å¿mall, greene, blewiÅ¿h, or blacke, and that they Å¿inke downe, and grow drie on the Å¿uddaine, not comming to maturation and Å¿uppuration: if the child piÅ¿Å¿e bloud, and then by and by after his vrine turnes to be blacke, it is Å¿igne of death.</p>

When the Pockes are quite come foorth, and begin to looke white, and that the Ague grows leÅ¿Å¿e &amp; leÅ¿Å¿e, then he may eate a little Å¿tronger meate, and drinke a little water and Wine: his meate and drinke muÅ¿t not be actually cold.</p>

I haue Å¿eene diuers children, that haue been lame and

                     <p>Wherefore, both the NurÅ¿e and the child muÅ¿t liue in a houÅ¿e, that Å¿tands in a good aire, far from any Å¿inkes, priuies, or Church-yards, from whence there ariÅ¿e many vnholÅ¿ome vapours, and exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Her chamber muÅ¿t haue a good aire, rather Å¿tanding high, then low: Let the window looke
