         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nowe to the place, wherby you would gaine your cauſe, if I ſhould grant vnto you, that this place of <hi>Paul</hi> is miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preted by them (which you ſhall neuer gaine at my hands) yet, how can you out of this place make good your accuſation againſt them? Was it for lack of will, or ſkill, that you ſhew not how you gather your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion, out of this aſſertion? That your will is good, experience teacheth vs: that your ſkill is not ſufficient, argueth more pride. Remember (<hi>E. G.</hi>) that you ſaid not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie you would ſhew how, <hi>They peruert holie ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> But how they peruert them, to proue this, which you lay to their charge? Now if you ſhew a hundreth euidences, and yet neuer a one, that ſpecifieth that lande you claime, what iudge will giue ſentence on your ſide? So, though it were poſſible for you, to charge the miniſters of the goſpell, with manie other crimes, and yet faile in the proofe of this one, you haue nowe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, all this labour in your ſorie booke is loſt: naie, I would it were ſo loſt, as it might not bee found, to redouble your condemnation. But let vs examine that which you haue left at libertie. If by this place you ſaide anie thinge at all for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14547:12"/>
your cauſe, then thus you reaſon: <hi>All that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this place of Paul, thus dooe it to conclude that which I haue laide to their charge, but the Preachers of the Goſpell generally vnderſtande it ſo, therefore they dooe it to that end.</hi> But that the firſt part of your argument hath no truth in it, I would grant your concluſion. For I grant the preachers of the goſpell generally, doo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete that place ſo, and therefore I rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced of you, that you accuſe not the Church of England onlie, of Libertine preaching, but al others of the goſpell likewiſe, throughout Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, with it. But wée will not yet throw awaie your argument, but rather proſecute it to the vt-moſt, to ſee if anie pith of reaſon maie bee found in it. This place of <hi>Paul,</hi> thus vnderſtood, what can it conclude? Forſooth, that a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, and elect childe of God, ſo long as hée beareth fleſh and bloud about with him, cannot be frée from all ſinne. The reaſon is, becauſe ſo notable a veſſell as <hi>Paul,</hi> teſtifieth ſo-much of him-ſelfe. Now ſir, is it all one, to ſaie, the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man is not frée from all ſinne, with this, <hi>That Drunkards, Gluttons, Leachours, &amp;c. though they continue in their ſinnes without ceaſſinge, maie neuertheleſſe aſſure them-ſelues to be ſaued, if they belieue their ſinnes are pardoned in Chriſte, &amp;c?</hi> And doo all that conclude the firſt point, auouche the latter leaſing? I hope, by this time, your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie in this pointe is open. The ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce you bring vs is this: <hi>But they obiect that Paul witneſſeth of him-ſelfe, that he had a pricke in</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:14547:12"/>
               <hi>the fleſhe, and that God would not deliuer him from that weakenes.</hi> Goe to, if this interpretation of <hi>Paules</hi> pricke bee not aright, what maketh it for you? Are you ſo ſhort witted (<hi>E. G.</hi>) as ſo ſoone to forget what ſo latelie you aſſumed and tooke vpon you to ſhew: namely, how they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert holy ſcripture to proue that wicked doctrine which you charge them withall? Els, why doo you not vncouer the danger of this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make manifeſt, how it leadeth to that terrible downefall of peſtilent perſuaſion afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid? All that haue common ſenſe in them, ſée that this place, (noting onlie holie Paul to haue his infirmities) hatcheth no ſuch monſter, as you, in a ſpirituall drunkennes, haue dreamed of. And thus you go forward to a third inſtance. <hi>It is ſet downe (ſay they) for a certaine point of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,</hi>

This man is deſperately bent to ſlaunder, that forgeth falſe obiections to féed the fire of his quarrell? If anie your friends (<hi>E.

For whileſt it proueth nothing your accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is onlie vſed by you, as a plaine ſong, for your furious penne to deſcant vpon, what els appeareth it, but ſome new affected ſtanding, wherein you would ſet to ſale other farre fetcht wares of your pelagian hereſie? All which ſtuffe (the Lord willing) ſhalbe ſorted out, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

hereafter, in his fitter place. Your ſixt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of there peruerting ſcriptures, to teach that wicked doctrine you accuſe them of, is this: <hi>That they ſaie, the holie Ghoſt meaneth him onlie, to be the ſeruant of ſin, and of the deuill, who willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with delight, committeth ſin, not miſliking, nor ſtriuing againſt it.</hi> If (I ſaie) this interpretation were not aright, yet it ſaith neuer a word, ne gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth one backe, nor winke, to witneſſe againſt the teachers thereof, the intoilerable accuſation which you, as one that cannot bluſh, haue laide againſt them. Therefore take vnto you this ſaying of wiſe <hi>Salomon,</hi> as a glaſſe wherein to ſée your ſelfe, if poſſibly anie prick of remorſe maie pearſe into you: <hi>Fooliſhnes is ioy to him<note place="margin">Prou. 15. 21.</note> that is deſtitute of vnderſtanding, but a man of vnderſtanding walketh vprightly.</hi> And a litle before: <hi>The mind of the prudent ſeeketh<note place="margin">Verſe. 14.</note> knowledge, but the mouth of fooles is fedde with fooliſhnes.</hi> What I can ſaie, to warrant their aſſertion, you ſhal heare anon, after I haue once throughly ſhewed, how honeſt a man you are of your word. Yet or I paſſe, let it be noted in this place, that of theſe ſix witneſſes, which you haue (indéede) not orderlie produced, but forcibly haled into the Court, to teſtifie for you, not one of them would doo you that fauour, as to giue you a good countenance, but preſentlie turned their backes, ſo ſoone as the matter was but repeated, and in a deepe ſilence departed. Wherefore now at length, being ſomewhat ſpent of witneſſes, and hardly diſtreſſed in your

cauſe, you ſet forth your ſelfe, to entertaine your iudges, partly with the odious repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your vnproued ſlaunder, and partly with a new craft of ſubtile inſinuation, as though our Miniſters indéed by an argument of compariſon, did driue at ſome ſuch concluſion as you haue enforced vpon them. For anſwere whereunto, I muſt tell you, firſt, that whileſt you procéed thus, you betraie the verie iſſue of your cauſe into my hands. For whereas in the beginning, you knew that our Preachers ſaide not that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words, which you accuſe them of, and yet charged them ſtill to teach no other thing in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, you grew on then to this point, that you would proue it, by ſhewing how they peruert the holie ſcriptures to that end. Hereupon wée haue ioyned our iſſue, hitherto your proofes haue failed, and now you fall a ſhifting, as though you would alter your iſſue. So that <hi>A wauering minded man is vnconſtant in all his waies.</hi> But I am content to make no gain of this van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, my cauſe is full ſo good, as that I doubt not to ouerthrow you, although I yeld you all thoſe liberties &amp; helpes, that may any way (lawfully) be vſed of you in this caſe. Now let vs hear you. Theſe men (you ſay) do hold, <hi>That the ſpirit is in their belieuers, though they bee wholy poſſeſſed of pride, couetouſneſſe. &amp;c. becauſe wee ſee fier may bee raked vnder the aſhes, and the ſap may be in the root of the tree, and yet appeare not.</hi> Which men? where be they? when heard you it (<hi>E. G?</hi>) (lying is no lawfull helpe, I can not graunt it you.) Or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14547:14"/>
if you heard it not, perhaps you might reade it, tel vs, what writers do ſo apply that ſimilitude? for this he bringeth not a ſillable to ſatiſfie vs. O beaſtlie impudencie. O Babiloniſh pride. O pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable impietie. But I will ſtay my ſelfe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming, though this man hath neither ſtop nor ſtay in lying. But do you perſwade your ſelfe (<hi>E. G.</hi>) there are anie ſo ſeruilely addicted to your hereſie, as that they ſhoulde eaſely brooke this lothſomneſſe, of your lying and forgerie? for my part, though I know (as experience of all ages hath confirmed vnto vs) that there is no hereſie ſo foule or vgglie, but it ſhal finde too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie fitte ſubiects to receiue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it (ſuch is the iuſt iudgement of God, vpon thoſe that reſt not them ſelues in his trueth) yet am I in very good hope,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 24. 26. 2. Theſ. 2. 11.</note> that this groſſe impudencie, and apparant ſinne of ſlander, which thus raigneth in you, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all your writing, will giue as cleare light as the ſunne, vnto the conſciences of all thoſe that haue anie feeling, not onelie that your accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is without proofe, but alſo that your opinion, of the full power, of the regenerate man, ouer al his waies, to abſteine from euil, and keepe the commandements is, (beſides the falſhood of it) a verie monſter, fearefull and venomous, not to be approached of anie, that would auoide the poyſoning of their ſoules. But of this more fully in his place. Meane time, let euerie faithful bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know this, that the miniſters of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, profeſſing the goſpel, generallie through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſtendom (I ſpeake not of anie limbes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14547:15"/>
of the diuel in corners) do vſe this ſimilitude, of fire raked vnder the aſhes, and ſap in the rootes of the trees, onely in the caſe of ſome afflicted conſcience, and not otherwiſe. As for example: there be manie deare children of God, that either immediatlie vpon their new begetting to the faith, or ſhortly after, in the growing vp of the ſame (God in his wiſedom ſo ſeeing it good for them) are, not ſo daungerouſly, as grieuouſly (for the time) aſſailed of Sathan, with diuers ſtormes of doubtfulneſſe, dreades, and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes, and amongſt the reſt, with the terrour of the remembrance of ſome ſpeciall time, wherein the fruites of their faith appeared not: with which terrour, ſo ſoone as euer he hath dumpped them, he ſlacketh no time (preſentlie to waielaie them with this two-fold ſnare: to wit, either that their faith (which before they had ſtoode vpon) was no true faith, but a counterfeit (ſaith he) becauſe it was not fruitfull by workes, or els though it were at firſt a true faith, yet now, they had loſt it, by their owne negligence: by one of which hookes it commeth often to paſſe, that the humbled ſoule is hurried (as it were) to the gates of hell, before it obtaine deliuerance. In which caſe, when the miniſter of Chriſtes glad tidinges, finding anie, ſhall ſay to him: this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that Sathan oppoſeth you withall is ſophiſticall and falſe, and he doth it, but in the rage of his malice, to drowne you in doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and deſpaire. For, the intermitting of good workes, doth not neceſſarilie conclude a voidnes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14547:15"/>
of faith, no more then you can truelie ſay, of fire vnder the aſhes, or of a tree whoſe ſappe (as in winter) is withdrawne to the rootes, either that the one is quite put out, or the other vtterlie deade. By this ſimilitude (I ſay) if the miniſter of the goſpel ſhall detect the fraud of the diuel, and reach a hand for the diſtreſſed ſoule, to bee lifted out of the mire by: what doth he worthie blame therein? or not warrantable by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall word of trueth? Thus let the faithfull rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this place, obſerue, that this ſhameleſſe mouth, hath brought nothing by this place, but one vnaltouchable ſlaunder to maintaine ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. After this, he retnrneth to his iſſue againe, as though he would ſhew how our preachers peruert the holie ſcriptures for the end afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: though with no better ſucceſſe then before. Thus he ſetteth downe the places: <hi>Chriſtes ſheepe</hi>

               <hi>Ieſus, which walke not according to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirite.</hi> You muſt vnderſtand it, as it is thus paraphraſticallie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by him: <hi>To them which are in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, there is no condemnation (or no ſuch bodie of death, which is the cauſe of our condemnation) for they walke not after the fleſh (as he was forced to doe by the law of ſinne, when as he did the euil he would not, and left vndone the good hee would) but they walke after the ſpirite, and ſo doe the good they would.</hi> His boloneſſe here as before, whether it ſauour of Babilon or no, I leaue it to the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader to iudge. But three thinges muſt be obſerued and examined, wherein beyond al rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; warrant, he abuſeth this place of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the holie ghoſt to ſpeake for his purpoſe: but without all probabilitie: both foraſmuch, as that word is no where vſed in that ſenſe, as alſo this verſe, repeating the argument of the 5. chap. 1. verſe, of the ſame Epiſtle, concerning iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith onely, proued by an argument drawne from the effectes, toucheth nothing at all that ſpeciall obiection, which hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth in the latter ende of the 7. chapter, whereby he was occaſioned ſo to handle that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of the fleſh and the ſpirite. So that then we ſée if (<hi>E.

It is God that iuſtifieth: who is hee that ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt that is dead, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is riſen againe, who ſitteth alſo at the right hand of God, and entreateth for vs.</hi> The ſecond thing I obſerue, is concerning theſe wordes: <hi>[They walke not after the fleſh]</hi> which walking he taketh to be al one with that, S. Paule calleth, the law of ſinne in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whereas he might aſwell haue compared a beaſt vnto a man: for by that other law in his members, it is manifeſt he meant the power of ſinne, which gate oportunities manie times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, although in his inner man, to his might, he made reſiſtance: as all open eyes may ſée, both by the oppoſing of the law in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the inner man, as alſo by the whole ſuite and circumſtances of the text. Contrariewiſe, in the other place, Paule ſpeaketh of the minde giuing obedience to the law of the members, which he calleth <hi>To walke according to the fleſh,</hi> as when there is no reſiſtance made to ſinne.

of a man, falling but ſometimes through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: alſo there he ſheweth in what reſpect the law hath a worke of death in our mortal bodies, (according to the obiection in the 13. verſe) but here he teacheth a note to know our ſelues tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuſtified by (euen our ſanctification) according to the matters handled from the beginning of the ſixt chapter.

               </hi> Either this is idle, or els it ſoundeth a full abilitie to do the good we would.

haue a ſight alſo of the naturall man, as he is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, when the written law approcheth him, and ye ſee what he is, euen ſo far from being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpoſed by it, and framed to that tough bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell and conflict, that <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribeth in himſelfe.<note place="margin">From the 14. ve. of the 7. chap. to the Rom. to the 25. verſe.</note> as that contrariwiſe, he is become by it much more ſinfull, &amp; his affections brought to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter outrage of rebellion, then before. How far the hipocrite by his enlightning, can go, beyond the mere naturall man, I am not ignorant, as appeareth hereafter. But neither hath the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite anie ſuch conflict, as whoſe faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is neuer vnfained. Therefore to conclude this point, ſith the naturall man, neither by his own light, nor yet by the light of the law, can attaine to be a partie in this combat, he muſt of neceſſitie, yeld the place to his better, namely to him whom the Lord hath ſanctified by his ſpirit, and made fit to endure it. And ſo it followeth, that thoſe, that haue armed thus the naturall man, and brought him foorth to the liſts, for ſo honorable an enterpriſe, muſt be content to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer loſſe of their labour, and receiue the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man (whom the king of kings hath made worthie) into his place. The reſt of <hi>E.

And thus hauing gained this place of the ſeuenth to the Romans. I conclude by it, the generall queſtion
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14547:23"/>
thus: If <hi>Paul</hi> regenerate was ſubiect to ſin, then euerie regenerate perſon is ſubiect to ſinne, but Paule regenerate was ſo, as this place apert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proueth, therfore our Miniſters teach tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that no regenerate perſon is frée from ſin. This they confirme by two other places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the firſt is, wheras <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth of him ſelfe, that hee had a prick in the fleſh, and that<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 6. 8. 9.</note> God would not deliuer him from that weaknes. <hi>E. G.</hi> ſaith, <hi>They peruert this ſcripture:</hi> What is his reaſon? Becauſe <hi>The Apoſtle ſheweth, that this was a prick painfull, not delightful to the fleſh, as is ſin.</hi> Well, thus then hee reaſoneth, <hi>Sin is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to the fleſh, but this prick was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteful to the fleſh, therfore this prick was ſin.</hi> I anſwere, if by fleſh he vnderſtand the vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat part of <hi>Paul,</hi> as vſually the ſcripture doth, in ſuch caſes, then is it falſe that he ſaith, [<hi>This prick was not delightfull to the fleſh</hi>] but if by fleſh, he meane whole <hi>Paul,</hi> (as by his next words [<hi>It was a meſſenger of Sathan ſent to buffet his fleſh, not to tempt him to ſin</hi>] he muſt néeds doo, or elshée corrupteth the text) then the firſt part of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is falſe, where he ſaith: <hi>Sin is delightfull to the fleſh.</hi> For it is proued before, that ſin is loathſome to the regenerate man, and he doth it vnwillingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whenſoeuer he falleth into ſin. So here we ſee, this man would ſophiſtically beguile vs, with a failation of <hi>Homonymie.</hi> Concerning that he ſaith, <hi>This prick was a meſſenger of Satan, ſent to beat or buffet his fleſh, not to tempt him to ſin.</hi> Let the Reader note, firſt, that [<hi>of</hi>] is here raſhly put in betwixt Meſſenger &amp; Sathan. Secondly he ſheweth his accuſtomed ſawcines, in reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14547:24"/>
to a part, that, which the text attributeth to the whole: as where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>The Angell Sathan did buffet him. <hi>E. G.</hi>

Forſooth <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Paul reioyced and tooke pleaſure in theſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, which hee would neuer haue done, if they had been vices, and ſuch fleſhly infirmities as they ſpeake of.</hi> Firſt marke his words. [<hi>Such fleſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities as they ſpeake of</hi>] What may he mean by this think you? If you read the firſt page of his book, where he maketh a flood of ſlandrous ſpew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to drowne (if it were poſſible) all the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt Preachers of the Goſpell in, you ſhall ſée, he would haue the ſimple take it thus, that our Preachers doo extenuate and hide the gréeuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ouglenes of the groſſeſt ſinnes in the world, with the nice and ſoft terme of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: which is ſo open a lie as it bewrayeth, there was no feare of God before his eies. Now for his reaſon, if he will thus meane by infirmities, whoredom, drunkennes, oppreſſion, &amp;c. We are ſo far from vnderſtanding them to be anie cauſe of <hi>Pauls</hi> reioycing (who was far from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) as that we denie, the temptations, luſt, and eggings of ſin, (which héere we take for the prick in his fleſh) or the buffets of <hi>Sathan</hi> (which

are, by his continuall ſtirring vp thoſe luſts of concupiſcence) yea or yet his infirmities indéed, (whereby he meaneth his weake condition, and neceſſarie ſubiection vnto theſe things) to bee anie true cauſes of his glorying: no more (if you remember well) then the law could be truly ſaid<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 5. 8.</note> to be the cauſe of ſin, for that the naturall man was the more ſtirred vp to rebellion by it. And yet it is true that <hi>Paul</hi> gloried in his infirmities: not in reſpect that they were vncleannes in the ſight of God (for in that regard they humbled him, and kept him from being proud of his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations) but in reſpect that they were the waie that the Lord had choſen both to doo him beſt good, and alſo to aduance his own power by: for ſo he plainly expreſſeth it, when he ſaith, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">2.

O how far from the Apoſtles ſpirite? who when he would reaſon from the end, or (as this man ſaith) from the inconuenience of a thing (as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places hee doth) ſetteth another maner of edge vpon his argument, as for example, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the verie like caſe, in the 8. of the Epiſtle<note place="margin">verſe. 13.</note> to the Romanes: exhorting to forſake the fleſh, and follow the ſpirite, among other arguments he hath this: <hi>For if you liue according to the fleſh you ſhall dye, but if by the ſpirite you mortifie the actions of the bodie, you ſhall liue.</hi> He can not make vs belieue therefore, that <hi>Paule</hi> was ſo rude a workeman as hee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14547:31"/>
walking alone, making to them ſelues an Idoll of their owne conceipt, and ſo their reioycing is naught: but I will ſay this by the grace of God, and make it good, that the worde of the Lord alloweth no ſuch diuiſion for his naturall man, and therefore he ſhall not enioy. What therefore bringeth <hi>E. G.</hi> to proue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> natural man to conſiſt of theſe two partes? Firſt becauſe, <hi>whereas the holie Ghoſt doth bid the naturall man to caſt off the old man, he doth there plainely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betweene the naturall man, and the old man.</hi> The place that he citeth for this, is the 4. off the Epiſt. to the Ephe. and 22. verſe: whereupon as though it were cleare for his cauſe, he preſumeth to interpret the meaning of that ſpeach <hi>[the old man]</hi> for his purpoſe, namely that by it is meant <hi>nothing els, but the old, and wicked conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and life, of the naturall man.</hi> But his reaſon is apparantly falſe, and his concluſion heretical. That his reaſon is falſe, euerie man ſeeth, that can read the 1. verſe of the Epiſtle to the Ephe. vnleſſe <hi>E. G.</hi> preſuined ſo farre, of his ſinguler cunning in conuaying, that hee could bring his naturall man, into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mumber of the true ſaints, and faithfull ones, whom the Apoſtle called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon in that Epiſtle, <hi>to put off the old man.</hi> If one ſay, there were hipocrites among them, not regenerated, I ſtriue not therein. But then they muſt obſerue withall, that, which I wiſh <hi>E. G.</hi> could haue conſidered, in all the Apoſtles wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Namely, that in regard of this mingling, whileſt they exhort, they write that vnto all, which can in déed take place but in the truelie</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:14547:31"/>ſanctified. And againe in dehorting, they write manie things vnto all, which can ſimply be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified but in the hipocrites. And yet both theſe courſes haue due effect, in both theſe ſortes of men. By exhortation, the hipocrites are made vnexcuſable, and by threatnings, the children of God are made more watchfull, as hereafter more largely. Now where he ſaith, <hi>The old man is nothing els, but the wicked conuerſation, and life of the naturall man.</hi> His breath is ranke of pelagian frée will, whileſt hereby, he inſinuatety, yea and the law of contraries conſtraineth him to ſay, that the new man, is the new and godly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the naturall man. Which though it be an abſurditie hatefull inough, to all that are but meanely exerciſed in the ſcriptures, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man ſhould thus be adorned with frée wil, yet it is ſo much more foule and odious in this man, as that he giueth the naturall man in this place, by conſequence of the oppoſition, ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, both of willing and doing good: and againe, within the ſpace of two leaues following, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him of the latter vtterlie. So that he is not onely contrarie to vs in this caſe, but to himſelfe alſo: that he might agrée with no bodie. Another reaſon he would draw from theſe wordes of S. <hi>Peter, <hi>For of whomſoeuer anie man is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 19.</note>

G.</hi>) <hi>the man that is in bondage, muſt needes bee diſtinct from his corrupt nature, to whom he is in bondage.</hi> And out of the word [<hi>ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>] he gathereth, that there muſt néedes be a fight and reſiſtance, <hi>without which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:14547:32"/>
               <hi>can be no conqueſt nor victorie.</hi> This is but vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dealing with the ſcriptures. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh not there, neither of a méere naturall man, but of ſuch, as had a calling and reckoning in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the faithfull, which becauſe they bare the eſtimation of fighting the Lordes bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, together with his people (though it were but in their owne conceipte) if it had béene law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to haue dealt thus with compariſons, <hi>E. G.</hi> might yet haue ſéene, that it was not without cauſe, the Apoſtle afforded them ſuch a Phraſe as being agréeable to their own ſenſe, might the more notably conuince them in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, of their moſt miſerable caſe. Eſpeciallie this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no new guiſe or vnwonted thing in the ſcrip tures: As namely where our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>I am come into the worlde to execute iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Io. 8. 39.</note> that they which ſee not, might ſee, and they which ſee might be made blind.</hi> Should we gather by theſe laſt wordes, that the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes did ſée? We know that our Sauiour meant nothing les: for he ſaith of them flatly in another place, that <hi>they are blind leaders of the blind.</hi> Thus <hi>E. G.</hi> might haue ſéene, the holie Ghoſt<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 14.</note> ſometime, leauing the proprietie of ſpeach, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelfe to the ſenſe of thoſe, whom his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe ſhould moſt concerne, for the déeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion therof. But I muſt anſwere him more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that this libertie of ſtretching compariſons is vnlawfull. For like as they that compare thinges together, reckon it ſufficient, that there bee proportionable agréement, in thoſe points, wherein the compariſon ſtandeth, although in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14547:32"/>
euery circumſtance, one be not like an other: ſo we muſt be wiſe, in reading, to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſcriptures: namely, to note, and receiue, the verie drift and point of the compariſon, and buſie our ſelues no further in the other partes of the ſame. Which rule, if <hi>E. G.</hi> had here known, or els obſerued, I ſhould haue had no cauſe in this place to note him for an encrocher vpon the ſpirite of God. For whereas the Apoſtle was to proue the falſe teachers, to be ſeruants of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he doth it by an argument of equall effects, and notes of victorie, ſet out by a ſimilitude of martiall conqueſt: wherein the caſe is ſuch, that whoſoeuer is ouercome in fight, is diligent to apply himſelfe afterwarde, to ſerue his pleaſure that ouercame him. Now what is the drift of this compariſon? but to ſhew, by one proper note of both, that the ſeruitude is alike in both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. Wherby the carnall profeſſors might ſée, that howſoeuer they perſwaded themſelues of fréedom and libertie with the children of God, though they followed their luſts ſtil, making the Goſpel a protection of their looſenes, yet ſhould their daylie iniquities, in ſpite of their beardes, argue againſt them, that they are no leſſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of ſinne, ſéeing they occupie themſelues in the workes thereof, then we ſée them to appeare ſeruants of their conquerours, who apply them ſelues to do their commandements: and this the Apoſtle amplifieth in the next verſe, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon<note place="margin">verſe. 20.</note> of vnlike endes. Now hauing here the full purpoſe and meaning of the Apoſtle, what warrant haue we, to ſtraine the compariſen, to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14547:33"/>
make the circumſtances meete likewiſe? If it were warrantable for <hi>E. G.</hi> herehence to infer a reſiſtance, becauſe there is mention of a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: why might not another of as euil a ſpirite, and by the like libertie, gather, that a man ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſin aboundantlie, ſhall neuer be brought to death therby, becauſe we know, it is ſo by the law of armes, that he that yéeldeth his life, &amp; his ſeruice to his conquerour, is accepted into grace, and neuer endangered anie more, ſo long as hee abideth faithfull vnto him? but that the error is infinite, that commeth by this maner of dealing with compariſons in the ſcriptures, this one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſhall be in ſtead of manie others: euen the parable of the vniuſt Steward in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,<note place="margin">Luke. 16. 1.</note> which, if a man of an vncleane ſpirite, ſhould come to handle, according to the ſeuerall partes of it, he might make plaine footing for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt theft in the 8. verſe, and all kind of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and popiſh merits in the 9. verſe: and that cleane beſide the purpoſe of our Sauior Chriſt, who in al that parable, had ſimply this meaning, to ſhew that the care and prouidence of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, touching the eternall life, is euen farre ſhort of the care that prophane worldlings haue in temporall things. Other circumſtances, of the particuler practiſes of the ſteward, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing his forecaſt, are of no regarde in all the matter. Thus haue you all the arguments, this good patrone can bringe for his naturall man: which being poore two, and too too weake, yea falſe and fabulous, yet he is ſo fooliſh, as to caſt his plot out of them, and make diuiſions,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14547:33"/>
for the ſafe ſeating of him there, as in his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall habitation: yea &amp; that with ſound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet (as it were) liking to bee contrarie to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the matter. But <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde<note place="margin">Prou. 3. 32.</note> are abhomination vnto the Lord,</hi> and <hi>ſhame taketh the fooliſh out of the way.</hi> His<note place="margin">verſe. 3. 5.</note> wiſe collection of abſurdities, with his lying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports oft repeated, &amp; other railings, I willingly paſſe by, as thinges that eſcaped him, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly vpon his wakening out of that dreame, wherein he thought we had held the inner man to be the ſpirite of God. Where he taketh the inward man, both of the regenerate and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat perſon, but for the heart, minde, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, thus far equaling either, with the other, ignorantly, arrogantly, and without all ground of ſcripture, what ſhould I anſwere? let it goe for me, to the fulfilling of the meaſure of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. In the reſt of this diuiſion he hath promiſed to ſtand vpon two points. 1. <hi>To reconſile ſome ſcriptures which ſeeme at firſt bluſh to ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. 2. To ſhew what difference the holy Ghoſt maketh betweene the inner man of the good, and the inner man of the bad.</hi> In the firſt his ignorance is wofull, and in the latter his impudencie won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull. His [<hi>ſome ſcriptures</hi>] fall out to bee but one place, and that not the moſt pregnant for this purpoſe: for where the queſtion is, whether the naturall man bee endued with an inwarde man, he bringeth that place to the Cor. which<note place="margin">1. Co. 1. 14.</note> denyeth the naturall man to be able, to perceiue the thinges that be of God: which though it bee mightier againſt him, then hee or his can euer
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14547:34"/>
anſwere, yet becauſe it concerneth knowledge chiefly, and toucheth not the affection directly, it appeareth he was willingly, and therefore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ignorant of all other places, which cut the combe, and ſpoile all the powers of his naturall man, concerning the righteouſnes of God. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of ſuch places, haue I ſet downe before, where I haue done the naturall man his right. But now ſith <hi>E.G.</hi> hath brought out this place as eaſieſt for him to anſwere, let vs ſée how well he will auoide it. The argument it afordeth, is of this ſorte: he that is not able to vnderſtand the ſpeciall righteouſneſſe of God, is much leſſe able to will it, but the naturall man is not able ſo much as to vnderſtand it, therefore much leſſe to will it. I meane by ſpeciall righteouſneſſe the ſpeciall forme thereof, which God propoundeth vnto men: which is the ſenſe of this place to the <hi>Corinthes,</hi> agréeable to the 17. verſe of the 1. chap. of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we know, the Apoſtle alloweth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Gentile, to haue a certaine generall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and vnderſtanding of God and his law, but<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 19. 20. 21. c. 2. 15.</note> becauſe it is not, nor can not bee, according to Gods preſcribed rule, (yea though that rule bee amongſt them,) therefore is it ſaide alſo, to <hi>be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemitie againſt God.</hi> As for the argument, <hi>E. G.</hi> belike ſaw it not: for he anſwereth neuer<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> a worde. But to this text of the <hi>Corinthes,</hi> he oppoſeth a place of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> where the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall<note place="margin">

               <hi>the commandements of God, according to the rule of his will, but onely lacketh abilitie to walke in them.</hi> Abilitie being the verie difference betwixt the regenerate and him. And hereupon without anie more labour of reconciling places, he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth into his ſecond point, being gladlie ridde of the former. But haſt maketh waſt &amp; accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth daunger. Two places of ſcripture, that by wordes ſéeme contrarie, can not be eaſelie or vndoubtedly reconciled, without the thréed of a third place (at the leaſt) to ſowe them together. And that third place, muſt not be the word of a man, but the word of God. For he, that ſhall péece his owne wordes, vnto the wordes of the liuing God, ſhall haue the plagues added vnto<note place="margin">Apoc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore he can not be excuſed of preſumptuous and wicked dealing therein. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, call you that reconciling, when the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reconciliation it ſelfe directlie fighteth with one of the textes? Truely it is like, as if a man pretending to part a fray, ſhould ſet vpon one of the parties himſelfe. But it is manifeſt, that <hi>E. G.</hi> reſolution of theſe two places, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth directlie againſt the place of the <hi>Corinthes,</hi> as appeareth both generallie by the whole drift of the chapter, and perticulerlie by the reaſon S. Paule there rendreth, while the naturall man can not vnderſtand the thinges that be of God: to wit, becauſe they haue a ſpirituall vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them, which the naturall man can not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14547:35"/>
reach vnto. Now if <hi>E.G.</hi> ſenſe ſtand, that the naturall man hath the ſame knowledge, with the regenerate man, then is the Apoſtles rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon quite ouerthrowne. Therefore it appeareth, that <hi>E.G.</hi> hath here reconciled no places at all. And now that his foile is apparant in this, I will procéed to buckle with him in the next. You know he promiſed to ſhew, <hi>what difference the holie Ghoſt maketh, betwene the inward man of the good, and the inward man of the bad.</hi> Let vs attend vnto him, though he haue thereby, enlarged his queſtion, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the naturall man, to the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. The difference he putteth thus, that <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the vnregenerate man, miſliking euil, and deſirous to will and to do that which God commandeth, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth notwithſtanding ſtrength, either to will or doe anie thing that good is, according to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: the regenerate man, hath that ſtrength added to him by the ſpirite of God, ſo as he can both will, and do that which God commandeth, though fleſh and blond ſtriue neuer ſo much againſt it.</hi> Let vs diuide the partes, and examine them a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Who ſéeth not, that all the drift of <hi>E.G.</hi> in this ſection, is to able his naturall man, to ſay as much, as S. Paule ſaide in the 7. to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>To wil is preſent with<note place="margin">verſe. 19</note> me, but to performe that is good, I attaine not to. &amp;c.</hi> to the ende, he might prooue that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake that, but concerning his eſtate before he was regenerate, and therefore hath he all this while, béen buſilie blewing in the face of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, to fill him as full of an inner man as he coulde, but now when wee come to trie him
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14547:35"/>

For if hee might once furniſh him, throughly, with frée will, he would ſoone prooue that <hi>Paul</hi> was no regenerate man, when he coulde not doo the good hee woulde, His verie woordes are theſe: <hi>The inner man, minde or conſcience of the regenerate and righteous man, it hath ſtrength and ſufficiencie by the ſpirit of God, both to will and do that good which God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, though fleſh and blood ſtriue neuer ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</hi>

            <p>Firſt for his phraſe, wherein the conſcience is put to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of the members, not ſo ſtrangely as fondly, I will not take the vantage that I could: but referre it to his ouerſight, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that indéed hee ment thereby flatly thus much: to wit, <hi>That the regenerate man hath ſtrength and ſufficiencie by the ſpirit of God, both to will and doo that good which God commandeth, &amp;c.</hi> To which purpoſe therfore he ſaith by and by afterward, <hi>That God hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and plainly pronounced, that he is not the ſeruant</hi>

               <hi>of righteouſnes, or of Chriſt, but the ſeruant of ſin, and of the deuill, which committeth ſin with his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſo ſerueth and obeyeth the luſts of the fleſh, vntill that Chriſt hath ſo looſed the works of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in him, that he ſin not.</hi>

            <p>Theſe two places ſet togither, ſhewe his meaning to be as I haue ſaid. Now is the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man not only a mightie warriour, but a ſoueraign king, this latter place hauing clothed him with the robe of perfection, and the former, put the crowne of frée-will vpon his head. Why ſhould we not now make haſt to ſalute him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>All haile victorious king?</hi> But ſoft, that is a matter not ſo ſafe as you take it: experience telleth vs, that if there bee a prince ſet vp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out right, not only he and his proclaymers, but all other likewiſe, that congratulate and are knowne to ratifie him with their voices, are in litle better caſe then traitors, and ſo ſhalbe eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and rewarded. And if the terror be ſo great in worldly caſes, what are we to feare in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord our God being king of kings and a ielous God? It is beſt therfore, before we ſalute him king, to enquire of his right.

And here I ſaie moreouer: if the regenerat ſhould haue ſuch power and perfection in this life, he muſt either haue it at his new birth, or els ſhortly after it: ſo as there may be a manifeſt ſeaſon, wherin hee

Now that he hath it not, vpon his firſt begetting by the ſpirit, the Apoſtles themſelues are a preſident, who whileſt our Sauiour wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with them, fell ſundry times, not only in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéemely behauiour worthie <note n="a" place="margin">Mar. 9. 32. 33.</note> rebuke (as wée in extenuating will ſpeake:) but alſo ſome into <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 20. 20.

think of that, wée are therein commanded: eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day to aſke for giuenes of our ſinnes? If wée be regenerate, ſo as we ſin no more, what néede we? If to ſtop vp this breach for <hi>E. G.</hi> any of his diſciples haue a liking, to bring in his popiſh diſtinction of veniall and mortal ſinnes, let them not ſpare. I could here bring it in, to make them bluſh, if it were poſſible, for I haue it written by his owne hand (as I am perſuaded) mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the conference betwéene <hi>M. Whitaker</hi> and him: but for that I know of what ſpirit they are, and am loth to looſe labour vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> written papers, I will not now ſtand vpon it. Thus firſt wee finde, that the regenerate perſon by no warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table right in himſelfe, can take this title vpon him. But becauſe ſome men looke not vpon the right and worthines of a Prince, ſo hée haue the place by the forcible decrée of ſome mightie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch that hath power to eſtabliſh him, let vs examine in like maner, whether this kingly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the regenerate man be by the will and appointment of the eternall God or no: for by the places I finde quoted, ſome ſuch thing ſe'e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue béen by <hi>E.G</hi> pretended: and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his confident ſpéech declareth it, where hee ſaith, [<hi>This being proued &amp; authoriſed by the word of God, &amp;c.</hi> For the former part, that <hi>The rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man is able to doo what God commandeth, though fleſh and blood ſtriue neuer ſo much againſt him,</hi> hee coateth thrée places: The firſt is in the 2. Cor. 3. 5. in theſe words: <hi>Not that we are fit of our ſelues to thinke anie thing as of our ſelues, but that we are fit, it is of God.</hi> This
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14547:37"/>
text teacheth vs plainly, that we are in no wiſe<note place="margin">verſe 2. 3</note> to aſcribe any thing to our ſelues, no not in thoſe works, wherin our labor hath chiefeſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, for aſmuch as there is not the leaſt thought<note place="margin">verſe 5.</note> of good, that riſeth in vs, that may in any truth be referred to our ſelues as the fountaine, but to God only. Wherehence we drawe theſe leſſons to carry with vs: Firſt that no man by nature, <hi>hath anie thing in him toward the ſeruice of God.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That wee muſt ſeeke to him for fitnes in euerie particuler ſeruice and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and return the praiſe of the ſucceſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to him alone.</hi> Theſe things by the grace of God we ſée and learne in this text. Only, how the regenerate ſhould herehence be warranted, to haue full ſtrength to kéepe the law, this wee ſhall neuer ſée, ſo long as there is one hereticke vpon the face of the earth. His ſecond place is, Epheſ. 3. 16. where the Apoſtle prayeth for the Epheſians, <hi>That God would giue them euen for his rich glory ſake, to be mightely ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by his ſpirit, in their inner man.</hi> The effect of the petition is this, that there might be a<note place="margin">verſe 16.</note> continuing growth of their inward man, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of their knowledge in Chriſt, &amp; they<note place="margin">verſe 18. verſe 19.</note> euery way fulfilled, euen to the high meaſure that God hath appointed. This place therefore giueth vs this leſſon for our inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably. To wit, <hi>That no regenerate man, ought to ſtaie in anie meaſure of his gifts, but to labour and looke continually for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of them.</hi> Which is ſo far of from enſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the regenerate man, in any kingdom of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14547:38"/>
power, as that with one hand it diſrobeth him of all perfection, and with the other, caſteth his glorious crowne of frée-will to the ground. For if encreaſe muſt bee ſought for continually, then is there no perfection in this life. And if no perfection, where is that ſufficiencie to doo the commandements? Miſerable is that caſe, when a man miniſtreth a ſword to cut his own throat withall. His third place is, Phil. 2. 13. <hi>For it is God that woorketh in you, both to will, and to do, according to his franke beneuolence.</hi> Theſe words preuented a certaine ſecret obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſcruple, which might be in the mindes of the Philippians, vpon the vehemency of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation which <hi>Paul</hi> made vnto them, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the accompliſhing of their ſaluation, in the 12. verſe. For, that they might not ſlothfully lye down vnder the burthen, as men out of hope and heart to go through with ſo great an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, he putteth them in mind, that they haue it from the Lord, both to will, and alſo to be able to performe. Whereby they had to obſerue theſe two points. Firſt, that they had not the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their will of themſelues, but from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, that he was alſo diſpoſed to giue them abilitie if they ſought it. Which doctrine neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily vrgeth this vſe therof: firſt humilitie and reuerence in all our behauiour. Secondly, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diligence, in continuall ſéeking of the Lord by praier, in euerie thing wee néed: he hauing verie well confirmed this laſt vnto them, by his own practiſe and example in the firſt Chapter. Where he had with feruent affection, praied the<note place="margin">verſe 8. 9. 10.</note>

Lord to giue them more and more abundance of knowledge and iudgement, and ſtill to clear the whole courſe of their life, vntill the verie day of Chriſt. Now to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude thus from the text, <hi>The regenerate hath full power to keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> becauſe the Lord dooth giue them both to wil and to doo, is not to deale truly with the word of trueth, but ſophiſtically to adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ſame vnto the perill of ſoules. If that be ſound reaſoning, I may in like maner conclude thus: Whoſoeuer honoreth his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhal liue long in this life, becauſe God hath promiſed ſo, in his fift commandement. Againe it is ſaid of the righteous man: <hi>That whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 3.</note> he doth, it ſhall proſper:</hi> therfore ſhall no vnproſperous ſucceſſe come to ante of his labors and endeuours in this life? And on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part (according to this mans faſhion) ſhal we condemne all for diſobedient children that die in their youth, or vnrighteous men, that ſow ſéede which commeth not vp againe? Nay, who is ignoraunte that albeit we reade in the newe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt, manie promiſes of fuller words, then this, whereof is now the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet is not there performance to be expected or taken (touching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which thing he muſt likewiſe haue neceſſarilie ſéene, (if hee had not wilfully cloſed his eies) both by the contradiction of other ſcriptures to his ſenſe of this place, as alſo by the verie light of the wordes in the text it ſelfe. For it is not written, <hi>God hath wrought in you both to wil and to do:</hi> as though it were done alreadie) but <hi>God doeth worke</hi> (or bring to paſſe in you) <hi>both to will and to doo:</hi> as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the worke to be but begun, and in doing in them yet.

And that this mans doctrine of often rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating is falſe, abſurd, and extreamely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: and therefore ſuch a monſter, as all the louers of trueth, ought of duetie vnto God, laye violent handes thereon, that it may not liue. Like as he that hath once loſt his way, is readier (for the moſt part) to wander ſtill from it, then to hit vpon the right path againe: ſo in like maner, fared it with <hi>E.

therefore now he ſaith: <hi>It is manifeſt in the word of God, that if we be not ſtirred vp to take heed, wee may quench, &amp; ſo put cleane out the ſpirite of Chriſt, we may fall away from the grace of God, we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the temple of God, we may be broken off from the vine Chriſt Ieſus &amp;c.</hi> Firſt let the Reader note, that the queſtion here, differeth nothing in effect from the laſt before handled.

And this is a full anſwere, not onlie to theſe places of ſcripture, but likewiſe to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14547:53"/>
all others of like nature, that can be brought for this purpoſe: namely to the 11. of Rom. v. 20. which he alledgeth in the 9. diuiſion, and the 18. of Ezech. v. 24. with all the reſt that follow, to proue (if his aſtonied ſenſes had not failed him) <hi>That the holie Ghoſt doeth no where teach, the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanctified ones to perſeuere in that eſtate vnto the end.</hi> For in all thoſe his teſtimonies &amp; examples like as in theſe before, he either by groſſe vnſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, or ſinguler maliciouſnes, ſeduceth his reader, with ſophiſticall deceits: as in the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the principle, both here and throughout his booke, taking it ſtill for granted, that we hold preſumptuous ſinners for elect and ſanctified: which is the chiefe thing he ſhould haue proued. Alſo taking wordes in one ſignification which haue diuers, as where men are called iuſt &amp; ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, that indéed are not ſo: and again, taking things as ſpoken ſimply, which are but in part, and in ſome reſpect, as where the Corinthians are feared to bee corrupted from the ſimplicitie that is in Chriſt, and the Galathians ſeduced, he vnderſtandeth them to be ſimply and altogither corrupted and ſeduced, which cannot be ſaid of the truely regenerate, but hath only place in the hypocrites and reprobate. Which becauſe <hi>E G.</hi> ſo proubly hath denied to bee the dectrine of the holie Ghoſt, let vs adde yet moe arguments vnto thoſe againſt often regeneration, that this trueth may plentifully appeare, to haue a ſurer foundation in the ſcriptures, then that all the hereticall ſpirites in the worlde can preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.

All that are truly ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified are Chriſtes ſhéepe, as appeareth by that whole Chapter: therefore none that are truelie ſanctified can fall away. <hi>E.

            </p>
            <p>Firſt it is falſe and pepiſh doctrine, to make obedience anie cauſe of our election, when as Chriſt plainly ſheweth, their hearing &amp; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, to be ſignes of their election, putting the only cauſe of it, in his fathers gift, in the 29. verſe. Then alſo a childe may ſee, this is nothing to the queſtion: for wee enquire not of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but of the certaintie of our election. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his anſwere is in theſe words: <hi>When as therefore we doo heare the voice of Chriſt and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, then may we be ſure that wee are his choſen ſheepe, which can neuer bee plucked out of his hand, nor periſh, but that wee ſhall haue eternall life.

Only this ſufficeth, he granteth in theſe words, an euerlaſting certaintie of the ſtate of thoſe that are Chriſtes choſen ſhéep, therefore he granteth the argument of the place, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the queſtion.

Therefore in the 29. verſe, he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his former reaſon, by this vniuerſall and perpetuall principle, <hi>For the gifts and calling of God are ſuch, as he cannot repent him of.</hi> As though he ſhould haue anſwered the former obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mens minds, on this ſort: The gifts of God (in the 9. Ch. 4. v.) and his calling, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he tooke vnto him this nation, for his people in times paſt, are not the gifts and calling of a man, who is apt to repent him of his facts, but they are of God who cannot be changed, and is ſubiect to no repentance: whereupon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that their election ſtood certaine and could not be diſanulled by anie meanes. Yet <hi>E. G.</hi> who preſumed ſo much of his quicke ſight, that hee durſt ſet downe theſe points, and interprete di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſcriptures, contrarie to the receiued iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſenſe of the whole Church of GOD, was ſo blinde, in eſpying the conſequence of this place, that he aſketh, <hi>how this doeth prooue, that he can neuer fall away from God, that is once truely called and ſanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certeinly hée ſhall neuer iudge colours for me, that is not able to diſcerne one inch before his eies. But leſt he haue left any, as dim eids as himſelfe behinde him, I will lend them theſe ſpectacles, to make the letters greater: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is done not to be repented of, for abideth euer vnremoueably, but the gifts that God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and the calling wherewith he calleth his, are done, not to be repented of, therefore they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide for euer vnremoueably. And ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14547:55"/>
there is no breaking of anie more. The parts are plaine, and the argument (I doubt not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch it againſt anie heretike) inumcible. Now to theſe arguments I wil adde two or three me, not as my ſtore: (for I proteſt I could fil a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

G.</hi> hath granted before, <hi>That they are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtes choſen ſheepe, which heare his voice and follow him.</hi> Now we take all the truely ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therfore thoſe whom we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d here for truely ſanctified are all one with thoſe, <hi>E.G.</hi> accounteth the choſen ſheep of Chriſt. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon let this be the third argument, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance of the ſaints. They that cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, cannot fall awaie, but the elect cannot be ſeduced: (if the word of Chriſt may bee taken, 24. Math. 24. verſe) therefore the elect cannot fall away. 4. Chriſt ſaith, 4. 10. 14. verſe, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall drink of the water that I wil giue him, he ſhall not thirſt for euer, but that ſame water which I will giue him, ſhall become in him a fountaine of water, ſpringing vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life.</hi> Now what hee vnderſtood by that water, is explaned in the 7. of John. 39. verſe: where it is ſaid to be <hi>the ſpirite, which Chriſt wold giue thoſe that beleeued in him.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence I reaſon thus: Whoſoeuer haue the holy Ghoſt promiſed to abide in them for euer, ſhall neuer fall away, but all that truely beléeue in Chriſt haue this promiſe: therfore they ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

fall away, and ſo conſequently the ſtate of the ſaints is vnchaungeable. 5.

            <p>From hence <hi>E. G.</hi> aſcendeth to the high pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of predeſtination, &amp; there taketh vpon him, like a wanton childe, more cockedly, then with any modeſtie can be declared. For, beſides the generall view of the glorious buildings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the marble of Gods vnchangeable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and reading the writing of his ſecret decrée, he firſt inſolently condemneth the iudgement e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the chiefeſt of al ſuch, as God hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to giuen vnto his Church, to be interpreters of his reuealed will, and next that, preſumptuouſly ſetteth foorth himſelf, to be the only true expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ſame. And thus he babbleth: <hi>Firſt, God hath from the beginning purpoſed, appointed, elected and choſen in Chriſt, ſuch onely to bee in the ſtate of ſaluation, the children of God, and heires of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, which are in the ſtate of true repentance and amendment of life, holie and blameleſſe before God, in loue and charitie, and ſo made according to the likenes and Image of Chriſt. Secondly, God hath from the beginning, purpoſed, appointed, predeſtinate,</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:14547:56"/>
               <hi>elect, and choſen all ſuch to bee condemned to eternall death, which are not in that ſtate of true repentance and amendment of life. Whereupon (ſaith hee) it muſt needs follow, that Dauid a murtherer and an adulterer was elect and praedeſtinate of God from the beginning, to be the ſeruant of ſin, the child of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and in ſtate of eternall death. But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Dauid a true penitent, a righteous &amp; holy man, blameleſſe before God in loue and charitie, hee was elect of God in Chriſt from the beginning to bee the ſonne of God, and fellowheire with Chriſt of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To my remembrance, I neuer read ſo ſhort a ſpéech, ſo full of vnſoundnes. If a man would examine euerie word to the fartheſt, &amp; diligently gather euerie abſurditie that falleth, the words would ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arſe ſurmount the faultes in number. To all that haue their ſenſes exerciſed, they are plaine inough, only for the ſimpler ſort, I will point at the chiefeſt. Firſt, he calleth <hi>Dauid</hi> the ſonne of God, which is a fault, in that he durſt ſo boldly vſe this phraſe, contrarie to the cuſtome of the ſcriptures, which doo no where giue that title, by thoſe words vnto anie, but to the onely begotten ſonne of God, who is called <hi>[the ſonne of God]</hi> by an excellencie. Secondly, ſo déepe was his ignorance, that he knew no difference betwéene election and reprobation: wheras the former euer tendeth to life, and the latter euer to death. So that whereas he ſaith, <hi>God hath elected &amp; choſen all ſuch to bee condemned, &amp;c.</hi> Hee might as well haue ſaid, <hi>The Prince hath pardoned ſuch a man to be hanged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:14547:57"/>
               <hi>The father hath made ſuch a ſonne his heire, to disinherite him.</hi> A man would thinke, fire and water could not be ioyned togither. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pretending that this point of doctrine, hath been hitherto corruptly taught, &amp; that he would teach the trueth, he neglected to ſet downe what predeſtination is, the diſcription whereof (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding) he ought moſt exactly to haue ſet down: ſeeing therupon reſteth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whole waight of the building. Fourthly, in the former part of his words, he either maketh works the cauſe of our election, or els maketh election nothing els, but an appointment or decrée of God, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch ſignes as ſhould tell vs, who is in the ſtate of ſaluation. As though a decrée were not rather directly of ſuch thinges as ſhoulde bee brought to paſſe, the things incident thereto, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a more remote conſideration. Els can there be an adiunct, without his ſubiect? Now in the contrarie member, he ſaith, <hi>God hath praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate all ſuch to bee condemned to eternall death, which are not in the ſtate of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Who then is not condemned in the beginning of his life? And if euerie one of vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Gods ſpeciall condemnation one time of our life, where haue we our diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that ſentence afterwarde? Againe, a little wit might haue ſerued him to haue put it downe thus rather, <hi>God hath praedeſtinate all ſuch to be in the ſtate of eternall death, &amp;c.</hi> For ſo the contrarietie of his members ſhuld haue ſtood (at leaſt) in ſome proportion. Fiftly, if when a man dooth well, he be the childe of God, &amp; when hee ſinneth any actuall ſin (for ſo I vnderſtande
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14547:57"/>
his meaning) he forthwith become the childe of the deuil, and thus again and again, as oft as he riſeth vp and falleth down, it followeth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that the ſpirite of God diſpoſſeſſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuill, and againe the deuill diſpoſſeſſeth the ſpirite of God, from time to time. What raging blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is this?

The reſt of that diuiſion, is nothing but a continued courſe of his old ſhameleſſe lying, and a begging of that which no bodie will grant him.</p>
            <p>In his next diuiſion, where he ſaith, <hi>Becauſe they ſurmiſe that Gods praedeſtination and election, ſhould be ſure and certaine vnto vs, although we doo euill, I aske them whereunto men are ſaid of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14547:58"/>
wholly ſubiect vnto ſin, to yeld willing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto, and to ſerue ſin. Otherwiſe if he ment by [<hi>doing euill</hi>] any kinde of euill, then belike he held, that euerie kind of fall or ſlip doth cut of election. But ſome perhaps will vrge the former ſenſe againe, as to ouerthrowe my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, interpreting raigning ſin, by actuall ſin, betwixt which they diſcerne no difference. If there be any ſo ignorant, they muſt learne: that euerie raigning ſin is actuall ſin, but not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, euerie actuall ſin raigning ſin. Like as al wallowings in mire are defilings to a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but euery defiling is not wallowing in the mire. To ſlip, and fall in the dyrt to his defiling, is incident to the carefulleſt man that walketh, but to wallow in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> myre is proper vnto ſwine. So experience hath taught the deareſt children of God, that they are ſubiect to their defilements and falles, but if any man loue to fall, or lye ſtil, our ſoules haue no pleaſure in him.

Yet this miſerable man procéedeth, and ſaith: <hi>God doth from the beginning predeſtinate, and elect in Chriſt, ſome to ſtand onely for a time in the ſtate of true ſactification and ſaluation, and then giueth them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in iuſtice vnto themſelues, &amp; ſo wipeth them out of the booke of life.</hi> That hipocrites euer attaine to true ſanctification, is falſe, and followeth the forme of his old beggerly reaſoning.

That he gathereth it from ſome ſcriptures that make mention of a putting out of the booke of the liuing, as the 32. of Exod. 33. verſe, and 69. Pſal. 29. verſe, vttereth his old ignorance &amp; childiſh vnderſtanding of the ſcriptures. Firſt therefore let the Reader conſider, that God wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no bookes of memorie, but this is onely a ſpeach borrowed from the manners of men, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14547:60"/>
aſcribed vnto God for our capacitie &amp; comfort: whiles it imprinteth in the mindes of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, that not one of them can be forgotten in the day of the iuſt, ſith they are now from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, as plainely ſet downe in the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, as if their names were regiſtred in a booke written for that purpoſe. Therfore ſaith<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 19.</note> the Apoſtle: <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> As for his places that mention a wiping out of the booke, in Exod. it is called, <hi>[The booke that thou haſt written:]</hi> in the Pſalme, <hi>[the booke of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.]</hi> His iuſt anſwere might be, that there is not meant the booke of predeſtination to life, but the communicating of the couenant, which God had made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſéed, whereby they were now, as in a muſtre rowle reckoned the onely people of God, the Gentiles being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. But if by way of conceſſion, we graunt him that place of the Pſalme to reſpect the booke of life, mentioned Apoc. 20. 12. as alſo anie ſuch place of ſcripture, reporting a racing out of the vngodlie: yet he that is not wilfullie blind, may ſée, that thoſe places, are not to be taken in a full and exquiſite ſenſe, as though any ſuch as the ſcripture thus ſpeaketh of, were euer writen in déed in the booke of life, but onely according to the ſuppoſall of men, and eſtimation that the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite hath of him ſelfe: ſo doth the ſcripture in ſuch places anſwere home, to his owne heart, that he ſhall be wiped out of the number, among which he thinketh himſelf ſo certainly regiſtred and written. Which is nothing els, but to bee
