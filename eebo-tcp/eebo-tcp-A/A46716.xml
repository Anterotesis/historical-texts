         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the Golden Age, when Men were more Zealous to please God than to
promote their own Interest; when <hi>Popish Intreagues</hi> and <hi>Jesuits Plots</hi>
had not shown their Faces on the Stage of these Kingdoms, the Prince
feared no Plotting against him, and the Subjects lived in Peace, every one
abhorred Injustice, and he that should have acted in those days, those
Crimes and Villanies which I have perpetrated in these times, would have been
looked on as a Monster in Nature, unfit to live, and Destructive to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95038:2"/>
every one would have pointed at him in the Street, and every Man
that had but the least Honesty, would have abhorred his presence, would have
scorned to defile his Eyes, by beholding so vile an Object, and would have
shunned the very Ground he trod on: His Memory would have been blotted out,
his Good Name taken away; every one would have threw the dirt of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in his Face, and in every respect, revile, reject and hate him as much
as possible: Though such a Man would be in a very bad case, and without the
least comfort in the World, yet for ought I know his case might be better than
mine; for he being under such Dejection and Despair, might have the Good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to end his Life the sooner. But I cannot be so concerned for my Sins, as to
kill my self by extraordinary Repentance; neither can I (as I hope I shall not)
do as <hi>Judas</hi> did; I have no Somach to Die, nor no Heart to Repent. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
by my Indirect Dealings, to Enslave the Nation, that I might live in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Pomp; and was always more ready to Sacrifice my Conscience for my
Interest, than my Life for my Religion; and it is a hard thing for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and never knew what true Repentance was. But,</p>
            <p>What a Damn'd Fool was I, that I did not run away in time! Could not I have
had the Wit of <hi>Petres,</hi> put my Ten thousand Pound Bag of Guineas under my
Arm and troop'd to <hi>Brussels?</hi> A dull Beast! to stay to be thus noos'd. I was
often told of a Dutch Invasion, and a Protestant Parliament, but by St. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s
Necklace, I could never believe it. Now <hi>Petre,</hi> Pope and Judges, with your
Dispencing Scarlet; where are you to assist me? You will be Damn'd before you
will help me at a dead lift. I see, I see now, I was a meer Ass, out upon it, to be
thus ont-witted! they all promised to stand by me; Ay, ay, so they will, if I will
go into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was it for this I perverted Justice, and did things contrary to both the Law of
God and Man? Oh! Hub, Bub, Bub, Boo, what shall I do now? A PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT!
A PARLIAMENT! What a Dreadful Sound does that word leave
in a Dispencing Ear. I did not think they would prove such a sort of Men as I
find they are like to prove; an Inquisitive PARLIAMENT. Oh that I
might vent my Choller against them, as I used to do on the Bench against the
Poor! Who would ever thought to have seen such a PARLIAMENT?
This <hi>Parliament</hi> will not wink at my Faults; as my Job of Journey-work in the
<hi>West, &amp;c.</hi> This is a <hi>Parliament</hi> will have Justice, the more is my ill Luck. I
was never more Drunk with Wine, than I am now with Passion; Oh how I
could—Ay that I could, if I had power over the Scriblers and Ballad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers.
I had hoped by this time to have seen the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
that I might have piled those barking Persecutors, the Objects of my Hate, up
in heaps like Faggots, and then have set Fire to them: Oh! I thought to have
made the World tremble, and filled the Goales with them all. I would have
been worse to them than <hi>Bonner,</hi> verily I would, but now the Scene is altered.
They bring all my Crimes publickly on the Stage, they forget nothing that may
help to Condemn me, Pox on their Memories, Hang me if I know what to do in
this Case.</p>
            <p>There is one comes with a List of the Names of those I put to Death in the
<hi>West,</hi> another comes with their Dying Speeches and Prayers; a third comes to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95038:2"/>
have Justice done upon me for the same; one cries Hang him, another cries that
is too good for him; a third cries, no Death is bad enough for him; a fourth
cries Hang him first and Judge him afterwards: But though they differ in all
other Points, yet they agree in this, (<hi>viz.</hi>) they all cry, <hi>Let him Dye,</hi> Oh!
that I could have stopped their Mouths with Fire balls, or have Hanged them
out of the way, as well as the other; then they had not lived to have done me
this Mischief. But now all my Crimes, both old and new, are made publick to
the Eyes of the World, and I am exposed in my proper Colours!</p>
            <p>Curse of my Fortune for a Bitch! that ever I should be born in a time of
Printing; by St. <hi>Judas,</hi> I hope he that invented this Heretical Art, is in that
place where I fear to be before it is long: I had thought (if things had happened
out pat) to have sent all those Stingy Booksellers and Printers to the Devil by
Dozens, and to have set up an Inquisition against Printing before this.</p>
            <p>They put my Name in Capital Letters, and leave out my Titles too, and seem
to care no more for me than for <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Ass. Now shall I have nothing
from them but wicked Lampoons, odious New-Years-Gifts, Plaguy Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dums,
Satyrical Poems, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> baul'd about the Town: One comes with a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Glass for me; another Forms a Confession in my Name; a third brings a
Dialogue; a fourth invents a Petition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus I am run down by every
Poetical Scribler; and thus these Rogues, Villains, Dogs, Rascals, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Curs, will perpetuate my Memory when I would be forgotten. I cannot
leave my wonted Language, they have put me into such a Fustian-fume, worse
than when the City turned me out of my Recorder-ship. But stay, let
me think of something to comfort me; I have some Fellow-Sufferers,
it is true, but alas! they are scarce taken notice of, it is I bear the burthen;
Oh! the People have a dear love for me! I see they stand ready to devour
me! Some Cordial quickly, I have a sullen Fit just a coming upon me: Oh!
my Heart grows cool, a Devilish Qualm has seized me. Ah! Impeached for
High Misdemeanors? By Gad it is no Jesting Matter: A Lord Chancellor!
And what of that? My Purse and Mace will not defend me; my Purse will
serve to put my Head in after it is off; and my Mace will serve to stick it upon
afterwards: The <hi>Parliament</hi> will have Justice done without any respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
I shall never endure to Dye; I find there is a certain Antipathy between
Pain and me, I shall never endure it. No, no, it is a Folly to talk on it: What!
will they Hang a Lord Chancellor? Ay, Ay, they fear nothing. I am told
of <hi>Trisilian,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> &amp;c. Oh terrible! terrible! <hi>Trisilian</hi> was Lord
Chief Justice, and yet Hang'd at <hi>Tyburn; Moor</hi> was Lord Chancellor and yet
Beheaded, a very ill Example! I never thought things would have been brought
to this pass, no I'faith did not I. I had many Hopes and Assurances that this
would never be; I had imagined far other things in my Head; but now to see
how the Devil has ordered it, all things look Scurvy, Ill, and with a Dreadful
Hue. But my Conscience also is presenting Visions before the Eye of my Mind,
and my Secret Sins and Debaucheries are set in order before my Eyes; Nay, my
Memory also is strangely touched, and I remember I have read in the Scriptures,
such like places which might have deterred me from my Wickedness; as
<hi>Job 4. 8. They that plow iniquity, and so wickedness, reap the same; we
are wearied in the way of Iniquity and Perdition, and the way of God have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95038:3"/>
we not known. What profit have we received of all our pomp and pride?
They are now past as a shadow, and as a messenger that rideth in post, and we
are consumed in our own iniquities. Thou shalt do no unrighteousness in
judgment, thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person
of the mighty, but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. Cursed
is he that perverteth judgment. To do justice and judgment, is more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Lord than sacrifice; the integrity of the upright shall guide them,
but the perverseness of the transgressors shall destroy them. I know your mighty
sins, you take a bribe, and turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.</hi>
I, alas! had quite forgot all these Scriptures, and to see that I should think on
them now! Is there no hopes? No! I fear I shall find as severe Judges to
judge me, as I have been my self to others; and, which is worse, a Severe
and Impartial Judge in Heaven, who will not be brib'd, and before whom
I must clear my self, or be Condemn'd. Oh! what a Reckoning have I to
make! What an account have I to give! How many Women have I made
Husbandless! How many Children have I made Fatherless! And how many
Men have I made Money-less! How shall I answer all? My Crimes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable,
the Roll Black and Long, my Offences Hainous, my Deeds most
Evil, my Sins of the Darkest Die; and I must have an Impartial Judge, from
whom there is no Appeal. I must leave my Pomp, forsake my Delights, my
Pride must down; I must Dye, and the day is coming when I must pay for
all, and answer for the least and every of my innumerable Sins: Where all
my Private Intreagues, Wicked Thoughts, Damnable Designs, and Evil Deeds,
will be Exposed before the Blessed Angels. God Almighty will be my Judge,
and my Conscience will bear witness against me, How shall I behave my self?
How shall I clear my self? I must not Dissemble, What shall I say? Oh that
I could but tell? My Conscience Condemns me already, and if it do so now,
What will it do then? Oh that I should bring my self to this! Who would
venture his Soul for a little Trash? Who would venture to have Eternal
Damnation for a little Money, and to please a Company of <hi>Jesuits?</hi> Whose
Designs, I verily believe, was to Enslave the whole Nation, and make the
People bow their Necks under a Papal Yoke and Tyranny. They care not
who they Ruine, so that they can but advance their own Interest; and what
better and easier way to Enslave the People, than by Seducing and Drawing to
their own Party such of the Great ones, as are guided more by their Interest than
their Conscience, the part of one of which I (have reason with shame to) confess I
have too much acted, as is too well known. To keep up my Interest, I would
run my self into the greatest Sin, use the greatest Oppressions, and venture
my own Soul. And all that I can now do, (and all that is like to help me) is
to go and prepare my self for another World, for I have little hopes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
long in this. I have little to say in Vindication of my self, for if I had
never so much, there is none would believe it, my Crimes are so Evident, Plain and
Notorious.</p>
