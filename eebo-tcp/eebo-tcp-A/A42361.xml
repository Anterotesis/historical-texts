            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A SERMON PREACH'D UPON Breach of Covenant, By that Reverend and Worthy Servant of <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Guthrie</hi> ſometime Miniſter of the Goſpel at <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boltoun</hi> 1663.</p>
            <bibl>2 CHRON: 15.12.</bibl>
            <q>And they entred into a Covenant to ſeek the Lord God of their fathers, with all their heart, and with all their ſoul.</q>
            <bibl>Verſ. 15.</bibl>
            <q>
And all Judah rejoiced at the Oath: for they had ſworn with all their heart, and ſought him with their whole deſire, and he was found of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about.</q>
            <bibl>DEUT: 29.14, 15.</bibl>
            <q>
Neither with you only do I make this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and this Oath; but with him that ſtandeth here with us this day before the Lord our God, and alſo with him that is not here with us this day.</q>
            <bibl>NEH: 9.38.</bibl>
            <q>
And becauſe of all this, we make a ſure Covenant, and write it, and our Princes, Levites, and Prieſts ſeal unto it.</q>
            <bibl>DEUT: 29. 24, 25.</bibl>
            <q>
All nations ſhall ſay, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? Then men ſhall ſay, Becauſe they have forſaken the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Lord God of their fathers which he made with them.</q>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of Publiſhing this Treatiſe, eſpecially at this time, is to evince to the World, what have been the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Her Faithful and Conſtant Wreſtlings against abjur'd Prelacy, that bitter Root of Human Invention, obtruded upon this Church, contrary to Her Received Reformation, and diametrically oppoſite to the Word of GOD, and our Covenants, both National and Solemn League. The Scope and Deſign of this Treatiſe, conſiſts in theſe Two; <hi>Firſt,</hi> In aſſerting and proving from Scripture, the irrevocable Tye and Obligation, this Land lies under to proſecute the Ends, and Deſigns of theſe ſolemn Sworn Covenants. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In anſwering ſome Objections adduced for debilitating their Obligations. This Treatiſe, by the Bleſſing of GOD upon the Conſcientious Peruſal, may be a Mean to diſcover our Ancient and Received Principles, and Practices in adhering to theſe Covenants, even to the Effuſion of much Blood; and alſo, how far we are degenerated from our Firſt Love and Wonted Zeal to, and Apoſtacy from our Covenant-Engagements, ſo as the Senſe of our Covenant-Obligations, is not only ſlipt out of the Memories of ſome, but alſo out of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of not a few. If the Reader find any thing not ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, let it not be imputed to the Author, but to the Pen of him who gathered it from the Author's Mouth.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>EZEKIEL, 17 Chap. 19 Ver.</bibl>
               <q>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, as I live, ſurely mine Oath that he hath deſpiſed, and my Covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompenſe upon his own head.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Conceive in the Verſe that I have read, there is more ſolid Truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Spirit of God, which cannot lye, than I am able to declare, when I have fallen to the Explication and Enlargement of if; yet the very firſt words in the 11 and 12 Verſes, ſpeak as much to the Truth contained in the reſt of the Sermons of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> as that it is not laid before the People, neither left unto them in any confuſed way, which is not plain: But the Prophet gets a Commiſſion to ſhow them plainly, what the mind of the Lord was to them. This will more clearly appear, if you take notice of the former part of the Chapter, wherein theſe things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered plainly to the People by a Similitude, the Prophet having ſhewed to his Hearers the ſame things that he comes to ſpeak plainly of unto them, ſo that any Man might have thought this with himſelf, What needs ſo plain Preaching, and Application? Will not any Man that hears the Words take them up without any Application? You find the Lord in his Commiſſion to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> after he Points out the Similitude of two Eagles taking away the Branches, he tells (now ſays he) Go to the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and ſay, Do ye underſtand theſe things, that God will avenge his broken Covenant againſt the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>? And if they underſtand not theſe things, go and make them plain to them, and apply it to them; ſpare neither King nor Prince, but tell them this is my Meſſage; Thou haſt broken my Covenant, therefore by this Meſſage which I ſend to you, the Plague and the Vengeance of God ſhall come upon you, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And leſt any of you who ſometime have heard us preſs the Oath of the Covenant in theſe Lands, ſhould now a-days think it alterable, and look upon it as a thing that may be diſpenſed with; therefore, we are through God's ſtrength from Scripture, to make out the indiſſolvable Tye of the Covenant; and that we bear not upon the Air in ſpeaking to that purpoſe, according to the Faithfulneſs of the Prophet's Commiſſion by the Lord, We intend to follow this Rule, as we ſhall be anſwerable to our Lord and Maſter; and to be free of your Blood, whoſe Souls are committed to our Charge, to lay it before you; and if you ſin againſt the Lord, then your Blood will be upon your own head; this we intend not to ſpeak in general but in particular; and if any Man will juſtle himſelf againſt the Lord, then he will break himſelf for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94136:3"/>And for making the words more clear, conſider, that the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> as you read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.17. did change <hi>Mattaniah</hi>'s Name to <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and made him King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and afterward <hi>Zedekiah</hi> entered into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that he ſhould abide Tributary to him; and for the Confirmation of it, he puts the King <hi>Zedekiah</hi> to Swear by the Lord. But after he had ſent him home to <hi>Jeruſalem, Zedekiah</hi> upon ſome ſuppoſed Advantage which he ſaw not at that time, did break his Covenant with the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>; therefore the Lord ſends the Prophet to him, and ſays, <hi>Since thou haſt broken Covenant with the King of</hi> Babylon <hi>and has not keeped it, as I live ſaith the Lord, thou ſhall not proſper.</hi> Yea the Lord noticeth and owns it ſo much, that he makes the Covenant ſworn to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> his Covenant; and therefore ſays in that Verſe, <hi>As I live, my Oath which he hath deſpiſed, and my Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. This is the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and we have it clearly ſet down in the Prophet's Commiſſion, which he muſt not dare to ſit, but faithfully doth deliver the ſame, as it is in the 33. Chap. of this Prophecy, Ver. 7, 8. wherein the Prophet tells the Duty of the Watchmen of <hi>Iſrael, Son of Man, I have ſet thee a Watchman unto the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>Therefore thou ſhalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I ſay unto the wicked, O wicked Man, thou ſhalt ſurely die; if thou doſt not ſpeak to warn the Wicked from his way, that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man ſhall dye in his iniquity; but his Blood will I require at thy hand;</hi> that is, whenever a Land or Kingdom is found guilty of ſuch and ſuch things for which the Lord's Wrath uſes to come upon a People; if that be made known to the Prophets, they are bound to Preach and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, or elſe reſolve that the Blood of all thoſe, that are taken away with the Stroke, ſhall be charged on them as unfaithful Men in the Houſe of God. And it were to be deſired, that there were many to give warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I fear there ſhall not the blood of a few in <hi>Scotland</hi> be required at the hands of Miniſters for not giving faithful and timeous Warning; for as every Man that ſhall be taken away in his iniquity, and for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhall be made to ſmart for it: ſo it ſhall be no Excuſe to you the People, that the Miniſters did not tell you; O but dreadful ſhall be the Account that Miniſters muſt give for not telling the People!</p>
            <p>In the words there is 1<hi>ſt.</hi> a threatning for Breach of Covenant, and 2<hi>dly.</hi> There is the Thing for which he doth threaten, and that's for deſpiſing the Oath, and breaking the Covenant of God. 3<hi>dly.</hi> The Confirmation that's fixed to the Threatning; would it not have been thought that this was enough, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> I will puniſh thee for breaking my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Now this is extraordinary, that it muſt have this put to it twice, <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, ſhall he break my Covenant and eſcape</hi>? All this put together, ſpeaks the certainty of the Threatning, ver. 16 and 19. and alſo the greatneſs of the Matter, and the weightineſs of it, and how the Lord looks upon breach of Oaths and Covenants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94136:3"/>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> from the Words, is, <hi>That the Oath is indiſſolvable, the Breach whereof God recompenſeth upon the heads of thoſe that break it.</hi> It's inviolable, it's in the words not framed by my Mouth; the Holy Ghoſt framed them in the mouth of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the Prophet long ago, <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord God, ſurely mine Oath,</hi> &amp;c. As applicable to our Caſe, conſider, the Doctrine ſuppoſeth ſomething that is not plainly ſpoken, and that is, That every Oath and Covenant of God is a thing that is inviolable, that is, may not nor can not be broken; For the better underſtanding whereof, there is ſomething that is needful to an Oath and Covenant of the Lord. I am not to ſpeak here in relation to the Covenant of Works between God and Man in his Integrity; neither am I to ſpeak to the Covenant of Grace, either in the way of it's Diſpenſation on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> or as to the fulneſs of it under the New Teſtament, though all theſe are more properly called Covenants, becauſe they are of his own deviſing: But we take the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant here in this place, to be of Mens Duties in the Land; and for keeping them the better, we take an Oath upon us in things that are neither Morally evil or good, but indifferent; but a Man once engaged by Oath cannot retract, though they be not commanded Duties, yet once entered into they muſt ſtand; for when we open our mouths to the Lord, we cannot go back. But I ſay, for clearing this,</p>
            <p>Conſider what makes an Oath and Covenant of God: 1<hi>ſt.</hi> It muſt be a thing in it ſelf lawful; there is no Man that warrantably according to the word of God, may ſwear the thing which in it ſelf is unlawful, 2<hi>dly.</hi> It muſt be a thing in it ſelf poſſible, within the Man's power; no Man is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to ſwear that which he cannot perform. 3<hi>dly.</hi> When we take the Vows and Oath of God upon us, we interpone the Name of the Lord to it; we ſwear by the Lord; this is the thing here, that makes this Covenant the Covenant of the Lord; the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> made <hi>Zedekiah</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſwear by the Lord. And it is more the Covenant of the Lord, when the King is Religious, and the thing commanded of the Lord which we are bound to obey, though we had never ſworn it: Therefore it muſt ſtand, once entered into, leſt we make enquiry after Vows, and ſo deſtroy that which is holy.</p>
            <p>Now for further clearing ot the words conſider, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> That in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.21. you may ſee, how much the Lord counts an Oath binding, <hi>When thou ſhalt vow a Vow unto the Lord thy God, thou ſhall not ſlack to pay it</hi>; for it will be ſin to thee not to perform it; <hi>but if thou ſhalt forbear to Vow, it ſhall be no ſin in thee. Numb.</hi> 30. The Lord gives out Laws to <hi>Moſes</hi> for Vows, and will have them declared, v. 2. <hi>If a Man vow a Vow to the Lord,</hi> or ſwear an Oath, <hi>to bind his Soul, he ſhall not break his word, he ſhall do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.</hi> The Scripture is very full, ſo that a Man once engaged in Duty, if he break, the Vengeance of God ſhall be upon him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94136:4"/>2<hi>dly.</hi> The Inviolableneſs of the Oath of God, is founded upon the Law of Nature and Nations. Wherefore is it that there is ſuch an Order in Ordinances to ſwear by the Name of the Lord? Is it not for this, think you, to make the Thing ſtand ſure? For the very Law of Nature teaches, That if a Man ſwear, he muſt ſwear by his God, and muſt keep it; and in like manner the Law of Nations for the Matter of Offenſive and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Arms, and as to the Matter of Ceſſation and Peace. Is not all this to hold out, that they deſign to ſecure themſelves by interponing the Name of God to it? Now once allow this, that Men may retract and break Covenant with God, then we break the Law of Nature and Nations too: and ſo there is not a Nation under the Sun ſecure, becauſe the way of continuing Peace (which is by the Name of the Lord being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpon'd) is broken, ſo that neither the Law of Nature or Nations (if it be broken) can ſtand; if that be granted, then it may be retracted.</p>
            <p>The 3d Confirmation for the Truth of this Doctrine; The Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Word hath declared a Man's tender keeping of the Covenant, Vow or Oath, that it is exceedingly well pleaſing to him; and that he has declared ſuch a Man bleſſed, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 15.1. compared with the laſt words of the 4th Verſe, <hi>Who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill</hi>? Would not any Man think they are fooliſh that would not dwell in Heaven? Then look through, He ſhall dwell <hi>that ſweareth to his own hurt and changeth not.</hi> A Body that ſwears any thing, muſt keep it though it be to his hurt.</p>
            <p>The 4th Thing for Confirmation of the Doctrine, as to the inviolable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Oath of God, it appears and is eſtabliſhed, as the Lord hath commanded the thing in his Word, and as it is founded upon the Law of Nature and Nations, and has the Promiſes; ſo the Lord has appeared an eminent Revenger upon the Breakers of this Oath and Covenant; that is to ſay, when Folk hath taken a Lawful Covenant upon them and has bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, God will appear eminently in ſending Plagues upon them. And for proving this, we are not here to ſpeak of the Covenant given upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> of which ſee the Ten Commands, how he threatens emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to puniſh the Breakers thereof; or for not receiving Chriſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel-Covenant, without Queſtion he puniſheth his People for the Breach thereof; but we mean theſe Oaths and Covenants we enter into, whether they be commanded or not; yet once being entred into we muſt keep them, or elſe he will puniſh us, as is clear from theſe three following Inſtances.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt Inſtance</hi> you have <hi>Joſ</hi>: 9. compared with 2 <hi>Sam</hi>: 21. where it will be found clearly, that the Covenant being broken by <hi>Saul,</hi> many Generations after it was made, he and his Houſe and the People muſt be eminently puniſhed for the Breach of it, by three years Famine: For the Princes and all the People of Iſrael are ſaid to have ſworn to the Gibeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, (wherein many a black Face was ſeen among them) now this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was meerly Civil, and the Oath could not be very well warranted, but yet when it was made, it was binding.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94136:4"/>2<hi>d Inſtance</hi> to prove the Judgments on them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Conſider <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.8, &amp;c. where you read, after the People had broken the covenant they had made with the Servants, whom they had liberated, and yet brought them into Bondage afterwards; that the Lord ſayeth, Since you have done ſo, <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a liberty for you, &amp;c.</hi> that is, I ſhall pay you home in your own Coin, I will proclaim a Liberty to you for the Sword, Peſtilence and Famine.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>d Inſtance</hi> is in that place of the Text, Shall he break and ſhall he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, ſaith the Lord? Though the Oath was given to an Uſurper, and <hi>Zedekiah</hi> being his Priſoner at the time, yet it was required at his hand. I ſhall ſay no more to it, but conſider how Covenant-breaches are reckon'd among the Deeds of the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. <hi>without natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, truce-breakers, falſe accuſers.</hi> And, alſo I read of the great War betwixt the Turks and Chriſtians, the Chriſtians entering into Covenant with the Turks, the Pope gives the Chriſtians a Diſpenſation to break it before the day come: Upon this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> came forth againſt <hi>Amurath,</hi> and when he came to the Field, he did firſt beat the Turks; then <hi>Amurath</hi> having the Covenant in his boſom, took it out, and lift up his eyes and ſaid, <hi>If thou, crucified Christ, be a God as the Chriſtians profeſs thee to be, then take vengeance on them for this broken Covenant, and for the wrongs they have done to me.</hi> And preſently the Turks fell upon the Chriſtians, and gave them a fatal Stroak, and gain'd the day, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Chriſtians had ſcattered them before. A moſt remarkable Inſtance; this, I think, except People be more than curious, will ſatisfy them.</p>
            <p>From all which you may ſee, that the inviolableneſs of Oaths and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants is founded upon the Law of Nature and Nations; and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Hiſtory is clear for it, that Covenants cannot be broken, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Folk reſolve to meet with the Deluge of God's Wrath.</p>
            <p>For <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of this, 1. If it be ſo, that the Oath and Covenant of God once engaged into, cannot be broken, then let no Man deſpiſe the Oath and Covenant of God; let Folk be endeavouring to ſecure themſelves in this Truth, according to the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be ſo, then know this, that all who venture on the Breach of it, do ſin againſt the Lord, againſt Precept, Promiſes, Law of Nature and Nations, and againſt Threatnings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Since it's ſo, that every one doth ſin that makes void the Covenant of God, then let all that are under that Sin expect, that the Wrath and Vengeance of God will be upon them, which is the ſecond thing in the Text; becauſe of my Oath and Covenant which he hath deſpiſed, I will recompenſe it upon his own head. Underſtand now what I have been ſaying, and what I am driving at, leſt it be to you as the Similitude in the preceeding Verſes was to this People: For I declare plainly to you, That theſe three Kingdoms have deſpiſed the Oath and Covenant of God; and therefore according to the Word of God theſe 3 Kingdoms are to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94136:5"/>
expect his dreadful Wrath and Vengeance, if he in Mercy prevent it not; let no Man or Woman be ignorant of theſe things afterward; remember I have told you that it ſhall be ſo.</p>
            <p>But now I ſhall ſpeak to ſome things which Folk may have for excuſing themſelves about the Solemn League and Covenant: and for underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, conſider, the Parliament of <hi>Scotland, England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> entered into a Covenant for maintaining the Word of God and the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereof, and putting away Prophanity; and engaged themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Schiſm, Hereſie, Error, Popery and Prelacy; and there was an Oath of God taken for this End upon us; and our King took it at his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this Oath again is broken by our King and Parliament, and is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed: For which, according to the Word of God, Wrath will be upon the heads of theſe that have broken it, if God do not mercifully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>
            <p>Now there are many that have many Excuſes and many Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Solemn League and Covenant; I ſhall therefore ſpeak to ſome of them, and I take you to record this day, I intend not to preach Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt King or Parliament, but according to the Word of God: and if it be Rebellion, we muſt take our hazard of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 1. We are not bound to a Covenant and Oath which is not Lawful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this is ſuch. <hi>Ergo. Prob. Minor.</hi> Becauſe it wanted the Conſent of the King the Supreme Magiſtrate. <hi>Ergo.</hi> I dare ſay, many of you have this Objection, which is no Ground for it; but to ſtrengthen your Argument, look <hi>Numbers</hi> 30, compare 3d and 5th Verſes; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument runs thus: The Subjects of a Land taking upon them to covenant with God, they can do no more in it than a Woman in her Father's Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſo is it with theſe Lands: For ſeeing the King who is Supreme, did diſallow it, therefore it is not binding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> I. The Place alledged doth not ſpeak directly to the thing; for though the King be a Civil Parent, he is not a Natural Parent.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This Place cannot be alledged to prove the thing; for the Matter is only ſpoken of a Woman in her Father's Houſe, or ſubject to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is true that a Parent or Husband may diſannul her Vows, being made without his Conſent anent theſe things, wherein ſhe is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to her Parent or to her Husband; but that Place doth ſpeak nothing of annulling the Man's Vow or the Widows, as verſ. 2. for their Vows muſt ſtand.</p>
            <p n="3">III. God makes no Exception here but this firſt; and therefore it muſt ſtand. Will any of you who has this Argument ſay, that the King's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or not taking the Covenant made the Covenant Lawful or Unlawful? Yet, though the King was not conſenting to it, (which I will not grant, for there was at that time a Power for it; I will not take upon me to diſpute the Power that Parliaments have without a King, it's far above my hand, yet I ſay) the Parliament has Power to put Folk to Duty, nill they, will they.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94136:5"/>IV. For making the Covenant valid and lawful, ſomething may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it afterward, though not at the preſent time, (yet ſeeing it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards added, it is enough) but ſo was it with our Covenant, there was a frequent Conſent given to it by our King; and alſo it was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by him, which is ſufficient to make our Vows ſtand. <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. we ſee, if a Husband or Parent hold their Peace when they heard a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man vow, the Vow did ſtand; much more if the Husband or Parent take the Vow upon themſelves. I know no ſhadow imaginable of Excuſe for them, the Word of God, which ſtands ſure, makes againſt them: and ſince it is ſo, our King and Parliament cannot retract what they have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> Some will ſay, there is no Man but knows that the King has taken the Covenant, for it was not done in a Corner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he may break, becauſe he was forced to it, and he was not abſolut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly free.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw:</hi> I. We did not hear tell of this before now; if any Man would have ſaid at that time, that he was conſtrained to take it, he would be counted a very uncharitable Conſtructer.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Suppoſe that he was not free, which I will never grant, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ppoſe he was forced to the Oath, yet Scripture makes it out, that a Man's Swearing, though he was not free, muſt ſtand to it; Though it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t a ſpontaneous Act, yet at was a moſt voluntary Act. Again, Conſider this in <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> he was a Captive, to whom? To a Heathen: (now no Man will ſay a Captive is a free Man, and a liberate Man) yet he ſwearing to the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> a Heathen, and breaking his Oath after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, God's Vengeance came upon him, for there is no dallying with God in theſe Matters; for all Caſuiſts ſay, If a Man ſwear to a Robber to give him ſo much to ſpare his Life, he muſt keep his Oath, if it be in his power, though it be to his hurt. I ſhall ſay no more on this, but I am hopeful, if you will receive the Word in Love, ye ſhall have wherewith to anſwer your Adverſaries in the Gate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> The ſolemn League and Covenant muſt be broken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not bound to keep with them that brake to us firſt: but it is ſo betwixt Us and <hi>England. Ergo. Anſ:</hi> Is there not many make this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which, I dare ſay, never read the Covenant: Thou poor blind Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how dare thou ſpeak of it? Theſe that will ſay ſo, it ſeems they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtood the League and Covenant, becauſe it is not a Bargain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Parties on Earth, the one whereof breaking, the other is free; but theſe 3 Lands is one Party, and the God of Heaven is the other Party; therefore, though <hi>England</hi> ſhould break, ſhould <hi>Scotland</hi> break alſo the Covenant? It is not after this Tenor; We will endeavour Reformation in theſe Lands, but if you break, we will break alſo: No, it's each Man ſwearing for himſelf, that he ſhall in his Place and Station endeavour Reformation; ſo that if it were left all to one Man, he muſt endeavour
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94136:6"/>
Reformation. For, conſider the laſt words of the Article, each of them for themſelves did lift up their hands to the Moſt High; and ſo theſe 3 Lands are one Party, and the other Party is the God of Heaven. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeriouſly upon it; for it's the thing you muſt either ſuffer for or ſin, ere it be long without Remedy. Whatever <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have done in breaking the Covenant, we ſay, they juſtly muſt ſmart for it, according to the Word of God, if God in mercy prevent it not: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs as long as there is in theſe Lands any who keep the Covenant, we are bound to keep it; and ſuppoſe there are many who had rather ſuffer for it than ſin, as Witneſs the many ſcattered Flocks and Shepherds in theſe Lands; and ſuppoſing this were not, though both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>worn to reform <hi>Scotland</hi>; but that which is ſworn is this, Each of them are to endeavour in their Places and Callings the Reformation of Religion in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government in theſe Lands, and to reform <hi>England,</hi> according to the Word of God and the beſt Reformed Churches: For though we had never ſworn an Oath, we are bound to promote the Kingdom of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So that the Objection is rather out of Malice againſt the Word of God, than any conſcionable Principle; he is not worth the Name of a Chriſtian, that condemns this, for it is contrary to the Petition, <hi>Thy Kingdom come</hi>: So that we ſhould ſtudy all Kingdoms Reformation, that they may become the Kingdoms of our Lord. If the King and Parliament were ſtudying to reform as much as they are ſtudying to deface and deform, there ſhould be no need of this Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 5<hi>th.</hi> The Covenant which theſe Kingdoms entred into, as to their own Reformation, and as to the Reformation of all the reſt, it was too raſhly and inconſiderately gone about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> I. I queſtion if any of you who moves the Objection, knows what Conſideration is; was there not Deliberation when there was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Remonſtrators for the poor Lands? and at laſt they came to this with it, to enter into Covenant: wherefore it ſeems it was not inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate.</p>
            <p n="2">II. There was more Deliberation in it than many other Oaths in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and yet they did ſtand, as <hi>Judges</hi> 11.35. the Vow of <hi>Jeph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

heaven</hi>? And yet it did bind him, while he ſays, <hi>Alace, my daughter, thou haſt brought me very low!</hi> And might not his Daughter have ſaid, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it's but a raſh Vow, break it? Nay, ſays he, <hi>I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot go back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. To confirm it more, What would you think of a Covenant made between the People of the Lord and Heathens, and no Counſel ſought from the Lord? <hi>Joſ.</hi> 9. The Covenant is made there with the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>; there you will ſee a Vow very raſhly taken, yea not ſo much as to ſeek Counſel from the Lord; and <hi>Iſrael</hi> made Peace with them, <hi>The Princes of the Congregation ſwore unto them.</hi> Now I hope none of you will deny, but God's Counſel was ſought to our Covenants, which was not ſought in that Covenant, and yet for the Breach of it, all the Land did ſmart, as you may ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. Therefore, I conclude, Though a Covenant be entred into raſhly, and want many things for making it compleat, yet opening the Mouth to the Lord, we cannot go back, or elſe we muſt expect the Wrath and Vengeance of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 6<hi>th.</hi> The Covenant cannot be binding, becauſe the Parties dealt craftily with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> I. <hi>England</hi> is not our Party that we covenanted with, but all the 3 Lands together, as one Party, and God the other Party with whom they covenanted.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Conſider <hi>Joſh:</hi> 9. and you will find how little weight this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath in Matter of Covenanting: It's ſaid in the 4<hi>th</hi> Verſe, They did work wilily, and went as if they had been Ambaſſadours, yet <hi>Joſhua</hi> &amp; the Princes entred into Covenant with them, and when it was broken, the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſmart for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 7<hi>th.</hi> The Covenant binds us to things that are not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſet down, but are ſo general as keep us in doubt; the Ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this, becauſe we ſwear in general to endeavour the Reformation of <hi>England,</hi> according to the beſt Reformed Churches; but theſe Churches were not particularly ſet down and pitched upon: therefore it cannot ſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> I. If there be any Man that would have a more particular Rule than the Word of God for Reformation, he muſt be ſent to another Land to ſeek another Goſpel from <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi>; and if it be ſo, then there is not a Rule among us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Comparing one part of the Covenant with another, its moſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſet down and determined; As (1<hi>ſt.</hi>) the Covenant is clear, the Reformation muſt not be Popery. (2<hi>dly.</hi>) The Biſhops, Prelates, Arch-Biſhops, Deans, Chapters, Curates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, the Covenant is clear in chief, if it lays aſide all theſe things; what, I pray you, remains in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate then? I know nothing, except you make it either a Presbyterian or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94136:7"/>
Independent Covenant, and at that time Independency was to be brought to Presbytery; now ſince they paſs by all theſe things, I hope the Matter is not left in the dark, as ſome think it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 8<hi>th.</hi> Suppoſing the Covenant binds the Land, yet it binds none but theſe that took it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw</hi>: Now I perceive there are many of you young and ranting Blades that think your ſelves happy Youths, becauſe ye never took the Covenant; But I have a word to ſpeak to ſuch from the Scriptures, and therefore take it with you: Where ever a King and the Princes of a Land take a Covenant, the reſt of the Land are bound to it, as you may ſee in that Covenant with the <hi>Gibeonites:</hi> The People there did not ſwear, yea they murmured againſt the Oath; but though the People did not ſwear, yet the Princes ſay, We have ſworn to the Lord, we cannot touch them. Therefore do not beguile your ſelves, ye ſtand as ſurely engaged to it as I or he, who did ſubſcribe it with our hands: Therefore the Breach of it ſhall be required at your hands, be you young or old, Men or Women; and therefore remember the 9. of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not ſmite them, becauſe the Princes had ſworn the Oath. Might not the People have ſaid, Let them keep it, who did ſwear it? But it is not ſo, for they ſay, We have all ſworn it, therefore we muſt not touch them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 9. Suppoſe it binds this Generation yet it cannot bind our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This ſame Generation that did ſwear it, hath broken it, and I fear the ſame Generation ſhall be puniſh'd for it. 2<hi>dly.</hi> The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doth directly bind all following Generations, <hi>That our Children after us be found walking in Faith and Love, that the Lord may dwell among us</hi>; theſe are the very words of the Covenant. For what end was theſe words put in? Was it nor to bind our Poſterity, and to keep Conformity and Unity, and to bind them to the Word of God? But you'll <hi>ſay,</hi> There is no mention of the Poſterity. <hi>Anſ.</hi> There was no Mention made of the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made that Covenant with the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> neither was there mention made of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> Poſterity, yet you may ſee the Covenant binding to their Poſterity, as is clear <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. ſo then you muſt underſtand, that the Covenant is abſolute; therefore I conclude, that as ſure as Sun and Moon endures in the Firmament, if there be any Generation in theſe Three Lands, God will require the Breach of His Covenant at their hands, and his Vengeance ſhall be upon them, if they repent not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 10. The King and Eſtates of the Land found hurt in keeping it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Ay but read <hi>Pſalm</hi> 15.1, 4. He that ſweareth to his hurt and changeth not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 11. There will be eminent Advantages by the breaking of it, <hi>Ergo. Anſwer.</hi> For my ſelf I do not underſtand any Advantage to theſe Three Lands comparable to the Solemn League; this is my Judgment:

But will you conſider the Covenant betwixt <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> it was a Covenant contrary to God's Command, yet His Name being taken in it, could not he retracted, they dealt wilily with him, and they ſought no Counſel from the Lord, and they were ſuſpecting it in the mean time, and they knew it within 3 days afterward; yet becauſe of the Breach of it, though it was broken out of Zeal to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet the People did ſmart for it by 3 Years Famine, and when it was broken, it was not the ſame Generation that broke it; I believe, and ſet all the Three Kingdoms Wit together, they will not get as many Excuſes for the Breaches of the Covenant of our Kingdom as <hi>Zedekiah</hi> had for his Covenant: For <hi>firſt,</hi> his was contrary to God and his People; for he had promiſed to the People within 70 Years to be delivered; now the Covenant was, to keep them in Captivity, and to keep the Kingdom in Subjection. 2<hi>dly.</hi> He was a Captive, and ſo forced to it. 3<hi>dly.</hi> The Covenant was made with a Heatheniſh King, it was the direct Intent of the Covenant to make the Kingdom baſe as it is in the 14 verſe, that it might not lift up it ſelf. Now what could have been a greater Excuſe to have broken the Covenant, than for him to have ſaid, I cannot keep this Covenant becauſe I will prove falſe to my People, for I was a Captive when he made me ſwear, <hi>&amp;c</hi>? Therefore might he ſay, I will break it: But ſaith God, It is my Covenant, therefore I will recompenſe it upon his own head. And therefore I conclude, That whoever enters into Covenant, be what he will, eſpecially when he is commanded, he muſt keep it: For he that breaks it, God's Vengeance ſhall be upon him. Now ſeing it is ſo, we are to expect, he will avenge his Broken Covenant upon theſe Lands, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His Word.</p>
            <p>Now the next thing in the Text is, That the Breakers of Covenant with God, God will recompenſe it upon their own heads; this is the words of the Text, <hi>My Oath that he hath deſpiſed,</hi> &amp;c. Now to clear it to you, who they are that are Deſpiſers of the Covenant; conſider, <hi>Firſt.</hi> That it is a Covenanter in Opinion and not in Practice, that is to ſay, There is not a Man that reforms not in his heart according to the Covenant, but he is a Breaker of the ſame; for this is the Articles of the Covenant. Therefore know aſſuredly, O ye Drunkards, Adulterers, Deſpiſers of Ordinances, and the People of God, Sabbath Breakers, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Perſons and Civilians, who care for no more than an outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; if ye be not endeavouring Reformation, and to keep the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, God's Vengeance ſhall be upon you. Indeed we will hear many Folk who pretend to keep the Covenant: But they will let an Oath flee when they like, thou by ſo doing art a good Keeper of the Covenant indeed, thou art guilty before God, for thou never Covenanted in Heart and Affection.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> All thoſe deſpiſe the Covenant that care not for it; for there is no Indifferency here: Therefore all the Three Kingdoms may expect Wrath from the Lord, except they repent.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:94136:8"/>3<hi>dly.</hi> Theſe are Deſpiſers of the Covenant, who are Fathers of Lyes and Seditions, and find out Shifts to ſhun it; but whoever they be that are ſeeking Wiles to be freed of the Covenant, whether King or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, God will ſend Vengeance on them. We are not here to Preach Rebellion or Treaſon, but what we ſhall warrant from the Lord's Word. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was a King, and yet you find Vengeance came upon him; and ſo did it upon <hi>Saul</hi>'s Houſe and Poſterity for his Breach of Covenant; therefore let all take head to it.</p>
            <p>But what would you have us to do, ſay ye? 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Conſider what Caſe theſe Lands ſtand in? And what it is they ly under? Is it not the Breach of Covenant? and the Judgment of God will come upon them, if he in mercy prevent it not: Becauſe we have ſworn the Covenant, and broken it; therefore God has ſworn, That we ſhall not proſper. O! Is there none among the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to lament theſe things this day, this ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of theſe Three Lands, that they are guilty of breach of Covenant, and are under the threatning of moſt ſevere Judgments! Will you then bewail it, if you have any tenderneſs of heart, each Man for himſelf and for his Family. I know ſome Folk will ſay, Let it even be ſo, for we will never lift it up again; but of this afterward, now I would intreat you to beware of partaking of other Mens Sins, leſt ye partake of their Plagues and Judgments. Wilt thou Vote with the King in Parliament to ſin? then thou muſt Vote for Judgments. And I ſhall only ſay this, Endeavour to cover your ſelves now, with that which you would cover your ſelves with at the Day of Judgment. There will never a Man come in and ſay, The King muſt anſwer for me; no, no, the King muſt anſwer for himſelf. If you be not ſtudying to keep theſe things, the Covering will be too narrow for you that Day. Again I would adviſe you to lay your thoughts aſide from getting much of the World, but ſee if ye can get this that's in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Thou haſt a few Names, even in</hi> Sardis <hi>which have not defiled their Garments, and they ſhall walk with me in white; for they are worthy.</hi> It was a time then of great Defection, and theſe of them that continued ſtedfaſt, were as Signs and Wonders. O then walk now as you would deſire to walk afterward! for ſurely theſe that ly down with ſin unpardoned in the Grave, muſt reſolve to ly in an eternal Bed of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and theſe that keep themſelves clean, ſhall walk with the Lamb in white.</p>
            <p>Now a word to that which I mentioned before, What ſhall we do, ſince theſe Lands have broken Covenant with God? I tell you that <hi>Scotland</hi> is bound to keep it, altho <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have broken it; and altho <hi>Scotland</hi> broke, yet <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> are bound to ſtand to it. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Though thou Iſrael play the Harlot, yet let not Judah offend</hi>; that is to ſay. As for you at this preſent time, though <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have broken, yet let not <hi>Scotland</hi> do ſo too. Suppoſe, there were but one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in theſe Lands that would ſtand to it, and if all that Family ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94136:8"/>
turn their back upon it except one Perſon; truly that Perſon is bound to ſtand to it, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>Chooſe you whom you will ſerve; but as for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Here is but a Family; ſo that if all the Kingdom ſhould forſwear the Covenant, yet ſo long as I am Maſter of a Family, I muſt ſerve the Lord, I muſt not ſerve other gods, that is to ſay, We ſhould not ſerve Popes nor Prelates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what if it come to this, That there be no Man to bide by it at all but one Man? That Man is bound to keep it according to Scripture, read 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.14. <hi>I have been very jealous,</hi> &amp;c. from which I conclude according to the Scriptures, though <hi>England</hi> has forſaken, yet <hi>Scotland</hi> is bound; and tho' <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould forſake, yet <hi>England</hi> is bound; and tho' both ſhould forſake, yet one Family is bound to ſtand to it. Therefore ſtudy to know your Duty, leſt the Wrath of God come upon you and your Poſterity; believe theſe things, for our King and Princes, Nobles and Miniſters, and all the People, and our Poſterity, is bound to it: So I leave it to you with this word, Happy is that Man that ſhall be ſtedfaſt in the Covenant, though all the reſt ſhould forſake it. But as to the Perſons who they are that ſhall continue ſtedfaſt, God has reſerved that to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a piece of his Sovereignty. Again, we hear not tell of a Publick Covenant ever ſworn and broken, but God viſibly plagued the Breakers thereof. There is no ſin God would have Folk laying more to heart than the Breach of Covenant: <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, ſurely mine Oath that he hath deſpiſed, and my Covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe upon his own head.</hi> God uſeth not to truſt Folk long, that break Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, without ſome viſible Stroke, as it was in <hi>Saul</hi>'s Days and <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s. If you would have a Mark upon your Foreheads, and be keeped free from theſe things, be ſighing for the Abominations of theſe Lands, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. Wo to the Man that's rejoicing at this day. Is there no Family found ſighing for theſe thing? if not, all the World ſhall hear tell of their Puniſhment. This we recommend to you, and do not ſay, that we did not give you warning: For we have told you this from the Word of the Lord, therefore receive it in love.</p>
            <p>As for my ſelf, I know not what I may do, yet though I ſhould ſhrink from the Faith by my weakneſs, which God forbid, I ofttimes remember the words of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> when they did teſtify againſt the People's ſins; and I do Proteſt againſt the Breach of Covenant, that I may not be made acceſſary to other Folks ſins, and leſt I be found guilty before the Lord, and be made Partaker of other Men's Judgments. This is the way, that the Prophets did uſe; this is no Rebellion or Treſon: For if they think it Rebellion or Treaſon, and think it Cenſurable, I commit them to the Prophets who are gone to their Place, who did theſe things; and firſt puniſh them and then me. I commit all thir things to you, Lord engrave them on your Hearts, <hi>Amen.</hi>
