         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ehold here a true Convert, an Iſraelite
indeed in whom is no guile; no <hi>Spalata</hi>
to change a petty Biſhoprick for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Deanry, and loſe that too to turne
againe in hopes of a <hi>Cardinals Hat</hi> by
the allowance of the Pope his Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow.
Here is one of Gods little Ones
whom no ambition or earthly preferment ſpurres forward,
but a holy ayme at the Kingdome of Heaven, who having
forſaken a certaine being unites himſelfe with a Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whoſe charity depends his whole reliefe, with a Church
which admits no Priority in the Miniſtry, and therefore
could have no expectances of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> promotions.
In his old Age after he had paſſed nigh forty yeares in the
Capuchin Order where were novices enough to have travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for his maintenance and have kept him warme in his
Covent.</p>
            <p>He was the Popes Miſſionary, whoſe faculties by vertue
thereof were ſeverall and notable, as hereafter are expreſſed.
And as his eminency for them beſides his golden tongue
which graced his Sermons to the admiration of his auditors
made his revolt from them the more conſiderable: So hath
he gotten ſtore of contumelious reports from them, who in
him have loſt the glory of their Order and their Chaire, and
the beſt benefactor to their Edifices, his perſwaſions prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more upon the devotions of the auditors, then all the
reſt he left behinde him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93281:3"/>
But let their Aſperſions be as many as malicious. The
Church of <hi>England</hi> is well acquainted with the nature of
Popiſh flamme<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as in that of our ſometimes reverend Biſhop
<hi>King,</hi> and others: neither will our Fryer beg any helpe in
his vindication, nor doubts but by what followes to give his
Reader ſatisfaction. Some way may be given his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to load him with lyes, ſince tis not ſo much fault as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
among them, and the prime weapons they uſe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their precious Religion, to wit, their jugling exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes
and lying miracles, as in the boy of Bilſon, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe their Abuſes may paſſe for Truths if unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and my ſelfe was told by a Fryar of the ſame Order, that
Father <hi>Baſil</hi> our Converts departure was for the love of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
I have tranſlated for Thee their Calumnies and his
Anſwers, whereby Thou mayeſt eaſily diſcerne the untruths
and malice of his Accuſers.</p>
            <p>That he was not a man of that Diſorder, thoſe of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
would have thee beleeve, ſurely Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that
great wit, and Confeſſor to the Cardinall of <hi>Richelieu</hi>
would have us think, when he ſollicited him by Letters to
accept the ſuperiority of the Queens Capuchins, but his Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
finding him to be of more profitable uſe among them,
as the ſequell intimates, hindred his voyage hither.</p>
            <p>And that his auſtere and exemplary life together with his
elaborate preaching gained him a rare opinion from his
compatriots, thoſe many hundreds of Proteſtants he drew
into the Romiſh folds are witneſſes: for which his ſoule doth
hourely pennance, and his eyes ſhed rivolets of teares in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for their ſafe returne into the boſome of the Church
againe.</p>
            <p>So that if God had pleaſed to have wrought in him this
work among us, we might have hoped, the reſt of his Order
here as well as divers of them in <hi>France,</hi> might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Converts through his example, beſides many of our
<pb facs="tcp:93281:3"/>
Engliſh Renegadoes who happily might have beene ſtopped in
in their flight from their holy Mother the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to that adulterous one of Rome.</p>
            <p>There are ſtrong Reaſons and Motives written by the

more at large then here ſet downe. And when I ſhall finde
thou haſt procured an appetite to them by reading theſe, I

            <p>Firſt, after I have humbled my ſelfe before my God, praying
him, that my unworthineſſe paſſed over, he would be pleaſed to
illuminate my underſtanding, guiding my ſoule and my hand
ſo, that I may alleage things conformable to his Word, I do in
his glorious preſence, as before him that is my Judge, and

this profeſſion to live at more eaſe, and better my world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condition, or to leade a life of more liberty or plenty. For
in that religion whereof I earſt was, under a cloake of being
poore I had ſtore of all things, and while I ſo continued had
wherewith to pleaſe my ſelfe in abundance; farre was I from
having any cauſe to complaine of want, and was honoured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, and had a ſetled Lively-hood: but by the Religion
I have now entred am reduced to an aſſured poverty, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the beſt of my worldly conveniencies, loſing the good
will of Millions who highly valued me, yet this poverty and
diſgrace I entertaine as an honour, ſince it is for Gods cauſe, and
that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſcored out our way herein by his owne
miſeries and ſufferings: My life I thank my God hath beene
blameleſſe, and I am provided for the convincing of thoſe which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93281:4"/>
would urge ought to the contrary. Had I been a man prophane
and vicious, they would not have allowed me the office of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
for twelve years, which I did yet exerciſe, but the laſt yeare
among thoſe of mine owne Order; nor did I leave it for any
miſdemeanor I had committed, but to obey the call of my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
God, who ſo knocked at the doore of my conſcience that
I could not be quiet. I dare without vanity ſay that I have been
in the Church of Rome, and the Capuchin Order of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
I preached vehemently againſt the Church of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I have now by the Lords great mercy ranked my ſelfe; not
thinking then that I waged warre againſt my owne Captaine
and Saviour: and that is it, wherein I confeſſe with perfect ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
I have grievouſly offended his ſacred Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>I had there no other booke than the holy Scripture, which
might be termed the Word of God, nor was it thence I digged
ordinarily the doctrine which I taught, no more than others
who preach in the Romiſh Church, that tye not themſelves to
the interpretation of holy Writ; and when I entred into the
Order, I made a vow to keepe the Rules and Inſtitutions of
Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> which bind not the Friers to ſtudy ſacred let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but command in expreſſe termes, That thoſe of the frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
which are unlearned need not to ſtudy to learne them, but
ordaine in the ſecond chapter, that they ſhould be clad in old
tayments, and that they might peece them with ſacke-cloth
and other peeces on Gods bleſſing. Being thus faſtned to this
Order, I thought with my ſelfe that in obſerving it, I ſhould do
workes of Supererogation, by which I ſuppoſed to doe more
good than God commanded me, and ſo to merit a degree of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in Paradiſe above that common to the Saints, which had no
more perfection here, than meerely to fulfill the Law of God.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>interim,</hi> this perſwaſion dwelt in my ſoule, that true
Religion which leads to ſalvation comes from God, not humane
invention: To the end therefore I might ſtrengthen my ſelfe in
the beleefe of the Romiſh Church, and be furniſhed with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to gain-ſayers; I deſired to know, as exactly as I might,
what Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, Founders of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
taught us, as it is contained in holy Scriptures; but in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

knoweſt thoſe that are thine owne, which no power can
wrench from thy holy hands; how copious hath bin thy bounty
to me thy poore ſervant: thou haſt dealt with me, ó Lord, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Thou didſt ſuffer me to ſpend neere forty yeares in an erronious
religion, which I ſuppoſed conformable to thy holy Word, and
have as obſtinately defended it, not ſlighting the leaſt occaſion
tending to the perſecution of thy Church: But O my eternall
God, it was my ignorance did it, and I now beg thy pardon
with an heart contrite and humbled before thy glorious face.
Thou haſt put me to the teſt O Lord, by a ſore diſeaſe, which I

beare me for reverencing thy holy Name: But grant rather that
they acknowledging the ſanctity of the doctrine which I have
embraced, which is the very ſame Jeſus thy Son brought from

               <head>The firſt Calumny.</head>
               <p>I Learn by letters of my friends, that they accuſe me for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the purſes of divers perſons above two thouſand
pound ſterling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under pretext of <hi>Pius uſes,</hi> and that now I ſerve

               </p>
               <p>The groſſeneſſe of this Calumny hath diſcovered it ſelfe ſo
much the better; for who is it but knowes that Capuchins han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
no money, nor doth any body uſe to offer them any, unleſſe
that craving almes at a doore, unawares they put a double in
their ſcrip, as they would to an Eremite; but the Capuchins do
never receive it. Their Order permitting them to receive a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Wine, a Capon, or things of like kind, but not one Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or Denier, as doe others who profeſſe poverty. If any man

and publiſh the give<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, let him ſet downe the place and the
time, when and where he received it, it will be eaſie for mee to
convince him of lying or theevery, ſince I for my part never
handled any of it. In ſooth I have beſought my good friends
ſometimes to gratifie me with ſome almes, for the building or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accommodations of the Covents whereof I had charge, but
did never miſplace one ſingle denier of their charities. Let them
look upon the regiſters of receipts of the Capuchins in any place
where I reſided, and they ſhall find from point to point the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
and disburſements of all the mony that every body hath
given. Had I miſ-employed the money, I obtained for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
where I dwelt, with what were nine hundred pounds paid
for buildings at the Capuchins of Caudebeck, while I was Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
there, and above an hundred pounds for Chalices, and
other ornaments of the Altar, which are to be ſeene in their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93281:6"/>
Veſtry? Have I put to other uſe ſix hundred and ſixty pounds
aſſigned me by order of the overſeers of the Kings treaſury in a
voyage which I made to Paris? The breaſt-worke of ſquared
free-ſtone which defends that Convent from the power of the
ſeas batteries, and the greater part of a Dormitory, which
were built with that money, are very viſible teſtimonies to the
contrary.</p>
               <p>If I had kept to my ſelfe what was given for mine owne
ſake, could the Capuchins of Alenzon have had a large Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitorie,
which I cauſed to be almoſt wholly ſet up in that
yeare when I was their Superiour? Had I then ſeene the
foundations of a Church, Quier and Chappels Veſtry and
of a ſecond Dormitory, and almoſt all the timber-frame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the admiration of the inhabitants of that Citie,
who could not conceive whence I came by ſo much almes. The
Receiver knowes that the Guardian who preceded me, left his
Regiſter thronged with debts when hee left the Charge; and
when I parted with it, I left unto him above an hundred pounds
in Caſh, and the Convent cleane out of debt.</p>
               <p>I ſay nothing of a rich preſent that a Gentlewoman of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſiderable quality, offered to aſſiſt the building, which
neither would ſhee give but upon condition I ſhould returne
to that place, for my Succeſſour there can tell that ſhee gave
it not, though hee uſed the beſt of his power to have it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee did his utmoſt, (he being indeed a man fit onely
to reape the benefit of others labours, and more prompt to
conſume goods implored by others, than procure any to the
Covent, and bring water to the mill by others, not his owne
ingenuitie.)</p>
               <p>The laſt yeare of the ſuperioritie I exerciſed in the Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin
Order was at Nagent Rotrou, where I cauſed to bee
built from the ground a new Dormitory: but whoſoever
would judge of my uprightneſſe in the disburſing of the coine,
whereof my ſelfe was procurer, ſhall finde that beſides what
was employed in building, when I went thence, I left to the
Receiver of that Covent above threeſcore and ten pounds, and
gave a good account to the Chapter of that Province, by the
ſame token they checked me with a flout for having been too
beneficiall to thoſe Covents I had in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93281:7"/>
I well knew that a Capuchin which was laſt yeare of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of <hi>Alençon,</hi> and was under me the laſt year in that of <hi>Nogent,</hi>
ſpread a noiſe about at <hi>Alençon,</hi> that I had carried from <hi>Rouen</hi>
two chains of Pearle of good value given to the Cove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Rouen</hi>
by the Q. of England to trick up a little virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> into a pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of a peece of Oak, which the Capuchins (not without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
deſigne in it) called <hi>Our Lady of health,</hi> giving out thorow
the town, that her Majeſty had beſtowed it on them for a wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
remedy againſt the plague, wherewith <hi>Rouen</hi> was then infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
But to that I anſwer, that as it is utterly falſe that the Queen
of England gave this Idoll (the Capuchins giving it out onely
that they might ſeem no leſſe in favour with Queens than the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
of <hi>Rouen,</hi> who the ſame time had obtained a ſilver Goddeſſe
from the Queen of France, under the title of <hi>The Lady of Peace)</hi>
ſo, it is untrue that ever ſhee beſtowed Pearles to dreſſe it: but
this reporter is knowne to be a common traducer, as well of
others, who as little deſerve it from him as I, and if he eſcape pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for this fault from his ſuperiours, I doubt not he will
receive it elſewhere.</p>
               <p>For my laſt anſwer to what can be objected againſt me in this
matter, I will make Oath that I never diverted the leaſt thing
contrary to the intent of the Donours, neither before, nor at my
going thence. My preſent penury can ſufficiently juſtifie mee,
for I am able to ſay with a good and ſound conſcience that I
brought nothing from the Convent but my habit, and that pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
for humilities ſake, as our rule commands it (although it
was fire new:) and my papers: and that to come and be here,
I neither had nor have any money, but the helpe of one of our

               <head>The Second Calumny.</head>
               <p>BEſides this firſt accuſation I have lighted upon diverſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by ſuperviſall of a Letter which the Provinciall of
the Capuchins of <hi>Normandy</hi> expreſly wrote to an Aſſeſſor of the
Kings Aides at <hi>Alençon,</hi> a man whom I heretofore did helpe to
revolt from the true Religion, for which I am heartily grieved.</p>
               <p>This Letter exhorts him not to ſtagger in his beliefe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of my change, and the better to ſettle him, he chargeth me
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93281:7"/>
with Calumnies. After ſome compliments wherein he calleth
my change <hi>An unthought of Blow,</hi> addes, I will tell you this
(Sir) ſincerely, that this poore man a while ſince diſpoſed his
fall by wayes cleane averſe to his profeſſion. He took to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
liberties in things which could not be allowed by the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of his Order which puniſheth as oft as it knowes of them,
which he foreſeeing could not avoid but by flying, and that it
was which caſt him into this Abyſſe, as the Starre in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps.</p>
               <p>I am ſure this man foreſaw not this Letter ſhould light into my
hands, for elſe he would either not have writ it, or concealed it,
ſince he muſt needs know I have letters he wrote unto me, which
compared with this, will manifeſt him one that can breathe hot
and cold with the ſame mouth. But I reſerve one eſpecially
which a Capuchin who deſired to ſee me here, brought (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve)
and got it conveighed to me, not willing to be ſeene in
the delivery himſelfe.</p>
               <p>I keepe it to inſert with ſome ſtore of pieces I have, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
which I ſhall make to the anſwer of this my declaration, if
they think good to frame one. It will not be diſpleaſing to well
affected people to behold my innocency averred by the Letters
of this party, who (having abuſed me to the Aſſeſſor of <hi>Alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon)</hi>
loads me with commendations in that he wrote to me ſince,
diſavowing the falſe reports raiſed upon me, and exhorts me
returne to my Order, giving me his faith and word, <hi>That I ſhall
not be leſſe honoured among them then before.</hi> And to note that
he names my going thence a blow ſo unexpected; if it were ſo,
it muſt follow my deeds and behaviour were unreproachable;
for had I lived licentiouſly before, my bad deeds would have
prepared their wits to have termed this Exite a foreſeene and
lookt for, not ſo unexpected an Accident.</p>
               <p>The motive for writing this Letter makes for my Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for tis to eſtabliſh this Aſſeſſor whoſe faith was ſtaggering.
Had I lead ſo profane a life, this change of mine could not have
made ſo hard an aſſault upon the faith of a man of ſo good a
judgement, as he is to whom this Letter is addreſſed; when a
raſcally deboiſt fellow ſtrayes from the right way, the world is
not much troubled or ſhaken at it, but if a man conſcionable in
his Courſes goes away, there is much more cauſe of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93281:8"/>
Truly if it were behovefull for a Provinciall to pen theſe
Letters to ſettle his wavering beliefe, for feare my example
might draw him after me, it may be yeelded that my life was
not ſo guilty of libertiniſme, and ſerve for argument of my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
deportment.</p>
               <p>The Letter tels farther that I fled for feare of the rods that
were laid in Piſſe for me.</p>
               <p>I do not beleeve that he who frames theſe, nor yet the foure
Definers who have a deliberate voyce for impoſing penance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
offenders juſtly condemned, have ſo corrupt conſciences as
to take it upon the <hi>Holy Evangeliſt</hi> that ever they took into
conſideration the puniſhing of any crime of mine, nor that ever
it entred into their thought to pronounce ſentence againſt any
of my actions: if to belye me be enough to beget beliefe,
there is no innocency in the whole world which may not bee
ſubjected to Diffamation. And for the terme, Flying, poſſibly
this reverend Sir had wiſhed, that ere my departure from the
Cloyſter I had preſented my ſelfe before him to ask his leave
thus: <hi>Reverend Father, Give me your bleſſing, for I will leave the
Church of Rome, and your Congregation, becauſe there I cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
my ſalvation.</hi> I intreat his Reverend ſelfe to hold me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
if I tendred him not this duty, it was not contempt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
me do otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>I will not allow that for a Truth which is not univerſally
true, to wit, That the Juſtice of the Order puniſheth all thoſe
liberties it knowes not: For I am able to ſhew when other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
offers it ſelfe, that the Juſtice of the Order hath beene
conſcious of many extravagancies and wicked Acts which it
hath let paſſe unpuniſhed, but if in me it knew any which it
could not diſpenſe withall, why did not that Juſtice give me
my due of puniſhment, being alwayes at hand? For I have this
twelve yeares aſſiſted at all the Chapters held in that Province,
and at the very laſt before my going away, I alwayes had a voice
active and paſſive in all Elections; I perſonally was before the
Provinciall and Definers, who at that time receive both true
and falſe accuſations which the Religious of Covents frame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
each other, and underlings againſt their Superiours: I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
came thence with honour, being thence ſent back to be
<hi>Guardian</hi> of ſome Covent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:93281:8"/>
Six or ſeven moneths after the laſt Provinciall Chapter, the
ſame Provinciall Fathers and Definers which were principals
there were aſſembled at the Covent of <hi>Roüen,</hi> where I was to
treat upon ſundry buſineſſes, and among the reſt to give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon a Fryer who was priſoner in that Covent: I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
twice of my own free will before them, to acquaint them
what things I thought becomming me for the diſcharge of my
Conſcience: they applauded my Zeale, and teſtified of me that
I had benefitted in my proceedings: ſo our Conference ended,
and I departed.</p>
               <p>Preſently after I was ſent by the ſame Provinciall Scribe of
this goodly Epiſtle, three Leagues from S. <hi>Michel</hi> with a young
Fryer to viſit <hi>Madame de Forrests</hi> his Aunt, who is one of the
Religion, but chiefly to talk with her Miniſter, and this done, to
viſit his kindred and ſome of my friends: I had my Letters of
Obedience ſigned by his owne hand, and ſealed with his owne
Seale: they preſcribed me no terme at all, yet in all I ſpent but
ſix weekes. If the Juſtice of the Order had knowne in me crimes
which it could not paſſe by without puniſhment; why did not
this Provinciall with whom I daily was, cauſe me to be ſtaid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of ſending me ſo long a voyage, having occaſions of other
nature ſufficient to retaine me, being engaged upon preaching in
the Pulpit of the Covent, and upon other imployments that he
might have well pretended? But ſurely, when he ſent me with
ſo good a will, the thought of my offences was not in him. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
had I felt my ſelfe culpable, and bound to take my heeles
to outrunne my puniſhment, I had then the key of the Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
<hi>I</hi> had liberty to go and come, my Companion being my
ſubject and owing me obedience in this Voyage. <hi>I</hi> had leiſure
enough to treat of the meanes of my Converſion with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Proteſtant Religion, without the knowledge of my
Camarade: but not being otherwiſe importuned, <hi>I</hi> beleeved it
would be better to ſee the end of one Moneth after the worke of
the Lord begun in me. So ſhaking this Viper off my finger, as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> did that at <hi>Maltha,</hi> I call to minde the words of our

               <p>THE third untruth is couched in the ſame Letter, and the

               <p>That which Pride wrought in the bad Angels, Covetouſneſſe
and Deſpaire in <hi>Iudas,</hi> and what other vices have begot in all
the Deſertors of the Faith; Vanity alwayes accompanied with
all ſorts of Licentiouſneſſe both diſhoneſt and irreligious, hath
wrought in this poore man, making the puniſhments he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
terrible to him, although we had not prepared for him ſuch
as were very great.</p>
               <p>If he would have himſelfe believed, he ſhould ſpecifie thoſe
Actions diſhoneſt, &amp;c. and the time when <hi>I</hi> began to give my
ſelfe unto them. To moote thus in Generall, without being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to particularize any thing, is but tacitely to confeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a Backbiter; if <hi>I</hi> had beene guilty of all ſorts of diſhoneſt
liberties, ſome ſcandall muſt have riſen, as unto divers whoſe
Sentences are yet freſh upon the Regiſter of the Definition of the
Capuchins, which <hi>I</hi> could relate even to the meaneſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
But <hi>I</hi> cannot hinder publick babling tongues more
prone to belye then praiſe vertuous Actions, nor ſtop the talke
of theſe baſe Liberties. The ſilence which hath been kept upon
this Subject might paſſe for a Miracle in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>I</hi> had been of a ſcandalous fame, would they have appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

out of the Covent, even the very laſt yeare? The Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials
that have had atteſtation of my good manners and ſucceſſe
of my teaching, may ſerve as witneſſes to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>I</hi> given ill example at the places where <hi>I</hi> reſided, would
the Communalty of the Townes, &amp; the Lords of the Countrey,
who erected the Covents which <hi>I</hi> governed, have written to
the Provinciall Aſſemblies of Fathers of the Chapter-houſe,
Letters gratulatory for my being ſent thither, and to requeſt
my continuance there the yeares following: this is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
knowne. <hi>I</hi> ſay nothing of a Biſhop in great eſteeme
among the Capuchins, who ſeeing me in my way to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and not knowing whether <hi>I</hi> ſhould returne to the Cloyſter
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93281:9"/>
from whence <hi>I</hi> went the yeare following, which was in the
principall City of his Dioces, told my Companion that the
Fathers were Reverend Coxcombs if they ſent me not back,
conſidering the advantageable progreſſe <hi>I</hi> had made in being
Superiour there.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>I</hi> been an evill edifier by my vicious converſation, could
the Provincials have been compelled to have returned me where
I had dwelt, to dry the eyes of the better ſort of that Order of
the tears they ſo plentifully ſhed for my abſence in the preſence
of them all? <hi>I</hi> require no other teſtimony for this truth then the
Provinciall himſelfe. 'Tis reported that the Jeſuites know all
to the leaſt of things, even which paſſe betweene man and wife;
if ſo, would they have ſelected me Preacher in their Temples for
above ſix moneths upon their moſt Solemne Feſtivals, and
which is more, the laſt yeare in the Church of <hi>Roüen,</hi> if <hi>I</hi> had
been held a man either diſhoneſt or irreligious?</p>
               <p>Had <hi>I</hi> not lived in eſteeme in the Capuchin Order, why
ſhould Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> (that great wit) have by ſundry Letters
ſolicited me, which <hi>I</hi> ſhewed to this my Defamer, to accept the
Superiority of the Covent of <hi>London</hi> which is the Queene of
<hi>Englands</hi> Chappell? And albeit the oppoſition of this Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
and the Cuſtos of the Capuchins of <hi>Normandy,</hi> tis poſſible
I had conſented, but was willing to be judged more neceſſary
for their Province, being then both Guardian and Divinity
Reader.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>I</hi> not beene well reputed among the Capuchins, and
exemplary according to in my Profeſſion, would the Generals,
Provincials, and Definers, who better underſtood their people
then any body elſe, have continued me above twelve yeares ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
in the Guardianſhip of the moſt eminent Covents, in
many whereof they placed <hi>Definers</hi> after <hi>I</hi> was gone?</p>
               <p>If it be objected, <hi>I</hi> was not Superiour when <hi>I</hi> became a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
I anſwer, <hi>I</hi> was ſuch but the yeere before, and that <hi>I</hi> could
againe be the next: For as the Conſtitutions of the Order or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
that a Provinciall cannot continue in office above three
yeares, and after to be diſcharged for one whole yeare, ſo is it
ordered againe, that a Guardian cannot be in place above ſix
yeares, and thoſe ended, is voided of his charge for one whole
yeare: So <hi>I</hi> had accompliſhed the ſix yeares of my Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93281:10"/>
and it then followed, <hi>I</hi> muſt be quit of my charge by courſe.
But <hi>I</hi> can eaſily make appeare, notwithſtanding that, <hi>I</hi> was ſtill
in good requeſt among them, for they aſſigned me for my abode
the moſt honourable Covent of all the Province, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall

Preach in all the yeare; and a ſtage ordered in a Pariſh of the
City where <hi>I</hi> preached every Sunday. All <hi>Rouen</hi> can tell that I
was the moſt imployed of all the Covent. Let me give this Smut,
this laſt touch with the Spunge, as the moſt conſiderable. The
<hi>Pope</hi> having deſtinated twenty Capuchins, to ſend them with
extraordinary authority to Preach and Confeſſe in thoſe parts
that had moſt need, and charged the Provinciall to chuſe them
with mature deliberation, and advice of the moſt noted Fathers

               <p>THe laſt ſlander in the Letter aforeſaid, containes the moſt
untruth, as it is the moſt outragious, and uncivill, tis thus:
If the Church and our Order in particular uſed not the more
purity and holineſſe of life, he would never have eſcaped us to
have caſt himſelfe into Miniſteriall bonds, who have furniſhed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93281:11"/>
him with what he ſought, a glut of his ſenſuall delights among
them, and a promiſe of aſſiſtance and protection in his vices.</p>
               <p>This poore man muſt be pardoned, for it appeares either he
ſinnes through ignorance, or that his paſſion hath blindfolded
him. He ſhewes you that he knew not how I made my retreat, nor
how Miniſters behave themſelves upon thoſe occaſions, for he
never came ſo neere to know ſo much. His Sword was ſomewhat
of the ſhorteſt. But to ſhew that he ſpeaks as a man ignorant, and
to inſtruct them that deſire to imitate me, behold here the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
I kept to atchieve the quiet of my conſcience by a true
converſion.</p>
               <p>After I had a long time ſtriven with the troubles and pricks
of conſcience, which tortured and grievouſly afflicted my heart,
and urged my departure from the Romiſh Church, where I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the Hierarchicall and Priviledged ready to devoure one
another, and thouſands of ſuperſtitions, I addreſſed my ſelfe to
the Father of Lights, after whoſe heavenly aſsiſtance, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of holy Scripture, and the bookes of <hi>Mr du Moulin</hi>
(among the reſt) his Novelty of Popery and Buckler of Faith,
gave ſome ſtay to my tired ſoule, and guided me in framing my
laſt reſolution. But becauſe I could not put it in execution
without knowing what Order I ought to keepe of ſome one of
the Religion, nor was acquainted with any body at <hi>Roüen,</hi> to
whom in this caſe I might addreſſe my ſelfe, I made uſe of the
occaſion of my going to <hi>Breſſe</hi> neare <hi>Mount S. Michel</hi> whereof
I have ſpoke before. By the way I ſaw a Gentleman of the
Religion, at whoſe houſe I was halfe a day, and learned
from him how to comport my ſelfe therein, I finiſhed my voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and a moneth after my returne to <hi>Roüen,</hi> I went from the
Covent without either ſeeing ſpeaking or writing to any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
whatſoever. True it is, that while I ſtayed a little at <hi>Roüen,</hi>
after my going from them, I had the honour to ſee two Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
who gave me the viſit at my lodging, but our diſcourſe was
ſo ſhort, that I had no leiſure but to unfold my purpoſe, and
they to tell me I muſt prepare to beare the Croſſe of Jeſus Chriſt
in profeſsing the true Religion, and that if I quitted the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
to finde more freedome or means to comply with evill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
I was very ill beſtead. I was indeed extreamly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93281:11"/>
I went forth of <hi>Rouen</hi> at ſhutting the gate, and in day and a
halfe arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> whence I am hither come in the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Almighty. Who report mee a man engaged in
wenching or wiving, ſhall accuſe themſelves of this ſinne next
Eaſter. I regard not his prate, as being uſual among the Papiſts
upon the like occaſions. See how the Miniſters have furniſhed
me with what ſatisfaction I ſought, not of my ſenſes, but my
poore ſoule which ſighed after its deliverance. I would prolong
the diſcourſe to make apparant the cheats of this Detractor, who
ſpeaks of the Miniſters, as of men who have furniſhed me with
what I ſought for among them, ſenſual and beaſtly ſatisfaction,
and promiſed protection for my vices: But becauſe I cannot do
it without I ſet forth the vertues I obſerved in them ſince I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
them, and knowing that their modeſties would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it, I will content my ſelfe with this onely, ſince it is fit
ſomething be ſaid, That I obſerved nothing in their words and
actions which did not tend to my ſpiritual edification, and folly
perſwaded me that they are altogether free from that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
rabble doth, like it ſelfe, injuriouſly put upon them; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
I never ſaw any of them go from houſe to houſe to prattle
with, and court young maids, and joyne under pretence of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ghoſtly counſel; if Miniſters go abroad, it is to viſit the ſick,
comfort the afflicted, treat in conſiſtory of the means for reliefe
of the poore, or elſe ſomewhat very beſeeming their being or
their callings when they goe from home. I ſee them not laden
with gay ſhewes, Croſſes, <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> kneaded with relicks, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
graines, mother <hi>Lewis's</hi> croſſe, nor Medals, nor any of that
which they call <hi>Aucupia Monachorum,</hi> Friers toyles to catch
thoſe who ſnatch at them, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> nets they reach forth principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to thoſe of the femall ſex, as the ſimpler and more enclined
to ſuperſtitious devotion. They cannot complaine of Miniſters,
that in their common talke we never heare them uſe the Name
of God ſo vainly in good or bad, as divers Seculars have noted
in the vaine diſcourſes of Monks, and complained thereof. Nor
doe we ſee them complement with wenches and women three
or foure houres together in their portalls, as doe the Friers,
but above all the begging ones. The Miniſters intents of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with any women, are examined; and if they give an ill
example, it is not borne with. I marvell not that the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93281:12"/>
infuſeth into them ſuch profound notions of holy Writ, and that
it beſtowes upon them ſuch excellent illuminations in Divinity,
as the Profeſſors of this Univerſity deliver unto all that will
come to heare them; I can never forget what I noted from one
of them, who handling in his Lecture the Commandement,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I never ſaw ſo grave a ſtayedneſſe
in words, nor ſo much carefulneſſe in diſcovering this ſubject;
which gave mee occaſion to deteſt the Romiſh Caſuiſts, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other <hi>Sanchez</hi> a Jeſuit, who in a ſordid manner turnes to
and againe the filth that comes along with this uncleanneſſe, for
there is nothing foule or baſe in the moſt execrable exceſſes of
beaſtlineſſe and ſenſuality which is not toſſed to and fro in his
imagination, and found in his moſt prodigious and horrible
booke of Marriage. See now what in my conſcience I knew
of them, in whoſe bande, they ſay, I am caſt. Hee to whom this
invective againſt them and my ſele is written, can judge of theſe
impoſtures, and of the truth of what I aſſever, who forſooke the
reformed Church at threeſcore yeares of age, and therefore had
time enough to be well acquainted with the behaviours of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.
What this reverend Sir addes in his letter, the Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
of <hi>Rouen</hi> themſelves ſay, if I had been an honeſt man, I
had not left the Capuchins, is a lye, by which he makes himſelfe
a laughing ſtock, and abuſeth him he writes to, by making a
baby of him. For can any man of judgement bee perſwaded
that he is no honeſt man that avoids Idolatry and ſuperſtition
to embrace a true Religion? the Reader may judge by this ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
the reſt of the Stuffe. To conclude this ſmall apologie, and
to refute what can be objected againſt the ſincerity of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
in the work of my converſion, I preſent unto you this
laſt reaſon which deſerves to be well weighed.</p>
               <p>Adverſity is a triall whereby God is acquainted with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of his children: I have paſſed by it twice ſince my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a feebleneſſe of body which came upon me
before I came hither; the ſecond, by a violent diſeaſe a while
ſince, which brought me ſo low that I verily thought to dye.
'Tis then or never that we ſhould deale ſincerely with God, and
manifeſt the true reſentments of the ſoule. Is it credible that a
man that hath ſeparated himſelfe from the Romiſh Church
for no other end but to take a fuller ſwinge in diſhoneſt liberty,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93281:12"/>
that he was not ſeazed at the inſtant with ſome terrour of Gods
judgments, or ſhewed not a miſrule in his conſcience tormented
with remorſe, by ſome words or deeds? But I may truly averre
that I never before felt my heart at more eaſe, which being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with heavenly comfort, ſeeing my ſelfe freed from papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
hereſie, and brought into a religion wherein I could not
dye ill, ſince that I apprehended by a lively faith the merits of
my Saviour &amp; the premiſſes of life eternall which he hath made
to all them that confeſſe and beleeve his holy Name.</p>
               <p>It is very true, that in this eſtate I was ſeazed with an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
griefe for my life paſſed, and the breaches I made in the
Church of God in the time of my ignorance: I cannot think on,
without great griefe and diſcontent, the great number of thoſe
whom I have perverted, in being the cauſe they deſerted the
true Religion. But this confidence I have, that if they be the
choſen of God, he will raiſe them up from their fallen eſtate,
and be mercifull unto them. This diſeaſe was very profitable
unto me, for beſides the exerciſe of humility and patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Lords fatherly chaſtiſements, the frequent viſits of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
which came to comfort and pray with me, made me ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
how ſweet and powerfull are thoſe conſolations that are
drawen from the doctrine of the Goſpell, in compariſon of ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the croſſe, anealing, &amp; ſprinkling of holy water, among
which there is not one ſillable of true comfort. But the principal
effect of this triall is, that by it I was the more ſtrengthened in
my reſolution, for I find my ſelfe more ſtable and more reſolved
than ever, to perſevere in that holy religion which I have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
freely without conſtraint, with a heart void of pride, or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
or malice. Such iſſues are the undoubted markes of Gods
ſpirituall calling. And for ſo much as they who endevor to ſhake
my ſtability by contumelious reports, or make me bow by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
or flatteries, ſhall doe better hereafter to conſider their
owne conſciences, and ſpeedily ſeeke after the means to get forth
from the errours wherein they are enſnared, than to labour the
change of this my unchangeable reſolution: proteſting unto
them that by the grace of God I will rather ſuffer thouſands of
tortures, than breake the vow I have made unto my God, to live
and dye in the confeſſion and profeſſion of the faith into which
he hath brought me of his pure mercy.</p>
