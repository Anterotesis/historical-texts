            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt all ſignes of
ſicknes or health wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the skilfull Phyſitian is led into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſtate of the body, two are of moſt general and certain ſignification which are taken from the pulſe and urine, without which all the knowledge of phyſicke beſides, is obſcure, doubtfull, and uncertain. Whereof the firſt
ſheweth the eſtate of the heart and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the ſecond of the liver and veins. Both of ſuch ſpeciall uſe in ſignification of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes incident to mans body; that joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they certainly inſtruct the Phyſitian whether the diſeaſe tendeth to health or death, but whether of theſe two ſeverally conſidered doth give more certain ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I had rather leave it to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of others who can better doe it then my ſelfe: yet under their correction me thinke that the urine giveth the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt certaine and generall ſignification of
<pb facs="tcp:49277:5"/> all diſeaſes; becauſe with the blood it is conveyed into all parts of the body, and from thence returneth backe againe in the veines to the liver and veſſels of urine, bringing with it ſome note of the ſtate and diſpoſition of all thoſe parts from whence it commeth. Neither is there any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement that hath ſo many differences as the urine, neither from which ſo many
ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may be taken as from it, in the
ſubſtance, colour, quantity, contents, ſmell, manner of piſſing, &amp;c. in which the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian may with more profit exerciſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe then in the ſix differences of pulſes, the art whereof <hi>Hippocrates</hi> either never knew, or neglected. And <hi>Galon</hi> confeſſeth of himſelfe, that he ſpent 20. yeares in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that way, before he could attaine the knowledge of the (<hi>ſyſtole</hi>) or contraction of the pulſe in the arteries, which being unknowne, the pulſe alſo muſt remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne; and yet it is uncertaine whether
<hi>Galen</hi> indeed ever did attain therto. From
<hi>Galens</hi> time for 1200. yeares after, this knowledge lay buried in the black dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ignorance, untill <hi>Ioſephus Struthius</hi> brought it to ſome light: and no marvel; for the continuall mutability and alteration of the pulſe cannot be comprehended by art.
<pb facs="tcp:49277:5"/> For as the affections of mans minde, anger, feare, joy, ſorrow, love, hatred, ſpringing from the heart doe vary; ſo the pulſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in every moment. So we read that
<hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> the Phyſitian perceived by the pulſe of <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſon to the King of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria and Perſia, that he was in love with
<hi>Stratonica</hi> his ſtep-mother. And <hi>Galen</hi>
ſaith that hee perceived by the often change of the pulſe of a woman, that ſhe was in love with <hi>Pylades.</hi> Beſides that, the tunicles of the arteries, the skin and fleſh in the wreſt of the hand where the pulſe is felt, and the skin and fleſh of the Phyſitians hand feeling the pulſe, are in ſome harder and in ſome ſofter. Againe, the patients hand differing in heate or cold, or manner of poſition, higher, lower, or on the one
ſide, and the Phyſitians hand touching the arteries ſoftly, or preſſing them, and infinit other circumſtances which make ſuch ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and momentary alteration of the pulſe that as in ancient time, ſo at this preſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us there be very few skilfull in this part of judgement. But on the contrary
ſide in urine there is no ſuch labour or cauſe of doubt, for we may ſee it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well of it, for many houres together, and find no alteration therein. And of this
<pb facs="tcp:49277:6"/>
               <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Aegideus, Actuarius, Avicen,</hi> and infinite others in all ages have delivered precepts, and gathered judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therefore as a part of phyſicke better knowne, and of more certainty then the pulſe, I have in this ſhort Treatiſe handled, divided into his differences, and to every difference I have added his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together with a reaſon thereof. And in many places I have more eſpecially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed it, not onely by other differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the urine, but alſo by other accidents of the diſeaſe it ſelfe. As for example, <hi>pag.
47.</hi> one ſignification of much urine is a conſumption of the whole body, whereto I have added other ſignes by the urine, as that it is ſomewhat fatty, in colour palew, reddiſh, high coloured, and without other
ſigns of concoction. And hereof I preſently annexe this cauſe; for ſo the profitable fat, moiſture, humors, and ſubſtantiall parts of the body are molten, diſſolved, and voided by urine. The reſt I leave to the diligence of the ſtudious reader, who with ſmal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration may eaſily conceive the ſame. And here I would make an end, but that I thinke it not amiſſe in few words to ſhew the generation of urine in mans body, and the veſſels thereto belonging.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49277:6"/> The meat and drinke received by the mouth, and deſcending downe into the
ſtomacke, and there concocted together, incorporated and made one ſubſtance
(<hi>chylus</hi>) and thence paſſing by an iſſue in the bottome of the ſtomacke (<hi>pylorus</hi>) to the firſt gut (<hi>duodenum</hi>) and from thence to the hungry gut (<hi>ieiunum</hi>) from thence againe five of the eight meſaraicall veines
ſucke ſo much as is profitable nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(the reſt being unprofitable for nouriſhment is voided by ſtoole) which againe is conveyed into <hi>vena porta,</hi> and at length after many purifications and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions in the parts before mentioned; to the liver, where it is converted into blood, and thence ſent into the hollow veine, where it is againe more purified, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious parts being ſequeſtred,
ſeparated, and ſent to other places, as the choler to the gall, melancholy to the ſpleen and the watery or wheyiſh part to the emulgent or ſucking veines, from whence againe it is drawne of the reines where it is altered perfectly into urine, which as unprofitable deſcendeth into the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduits
(<hi>ureteres</hi>) and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which at length at a mans pleaſure by help of the muſcle ſhutting the necke of

ſome part of this thin wheyiſh humor is not after this ſort conveyed from the liver to the bladder, but as I have ſhewed, <hi>cap.</hi> 12. is together with the blood in the veines derived into all parts of the body, and at length returning backe againe the ſame way, is expelled by the yard. Seeing then urine paſſeth through ſo many veſſels, and receiveth ſo many concoctions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations before it can be expelled, it muſt needs admit many alterations. And yet we
ſee by daily experience that great drinkers, thoſe which drinke ſome diuretike potion, and eſpecially thoſe who are troubled with the piſſing evill, doe piſſe out preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drinke not concoct, nor much altered from the drinke received. Hereof <hi>Galen 3. de facult. nat. cap.</hi> 15. yeeldeth theſe reaſons. The great deſire of the ſtomack to receive drinke, the thin, piercing, and ſubtle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the drinke ſpeedily running into all parts: the wideneſſe of the paſſages, and laſtly the ſtrong attractive faculty of the reines, all which concurring together, doe cauſe the drinke received ſo quickly to paſſe through the parts of the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great alteration. Yet ſome the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſatisfie theſe doubts have deviſed,
<pb facs="tcp:49277:7"/> and by arguments laboured to confirme a readier and ſhorter courſe for the drinke received to paſſe to the reins by the wind-pipe, great artery (<hi>aorta</hi>) emulgent veines, and bladder. But becauſe this opinion is ſo contrary to the reputed and received truth of <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and all Phyſitians, as alſo that it imagineth another free paſſage
(beſide the meat-pipe, through the wind-pipe and lungs: whereas we find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that a little duſt in travelling, or a crum of bread in eating falling into the
ſame is ready to choke a man, as a kernell of a raiſon did <hi>Anacreon</hi> the Poet; and that therefore nature hath ordained a cover for the wind-pipe (<hi>epiglottis</hi>) leſt in eating or drinking ſomething ſhould paſſe that way. And the Phyſitians doe forbid much talke or diſputation at meat, leſt the cover being opened thereby ſhould let ſomthing paſſe that way. I ceaſe further to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it.</p>

               <p>All urine (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib. 10. de ſimpl. medie. facult. de urina</hi>) is hot and ſharp (as

               <p>A mans urine is good for diverſe diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the wombe and bowels, eſpecially for the collicke: becauſe that partly with provoking of vomit, and partly by occaſion of ſieges, it expelleth ſtrongly all noyſome humors, and for the ſame cauſe doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practitioners keep it ſtill in daily uſe.

ſaith thus of urine: mens urine is of a ſtrong clenſing vertue as any thing els, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with doe fullers uſe to ſcoure and clenſe their cloath, which abſterſive faculty Phyſitians perceiving, did uſe it to ſoke, and waſh mangineſſe and ſcabbedneſſe, and running ſores that are full of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and filth, and eſpecially if they have in them putrefied matter, &amp; for ſuch ſores on the privy members it is good, and for mattering eares, and for ſcales and

ſcurfe, if the head be waſhed therewith. I have healed with it many times ſores on the tooes, namely which came of brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and were without inflammation, and that in ſervants and husbandmen, which had a journey to goe, and no Phyſitian with them, bidding them to wet a ſmall clout with it, and put it into the ſores, and then to binde a cloth about it: and as often as they liſted to make water, to let it fall on their ſore toes, and not to take the cloath away till it were quite whole. That medicine which is made of childes urine, called <hi>chryſocolla,</hi> or gold ſouder, which <hi>Galen</hi> there teacheth to make, is exceeding good for ſores that are hard to heale: for this medicine doe I uſe for the chiefeſt, mixing therewith ſuch other things, as are good for ſuch like ſores.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49277:71"/> impertinent to this treatiſe: I have likewiſe collected a briefe hiſtory of the ſaid diſeaſes with ſome medicines thereof. And firſt of the ſtone.</p>
               <p>The ſtone is engendred in mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as a bricke which is firſt made of tough clay, and put into an hot furnace where it waxeth hard; ſo a ſtone is made of tough, viſcous, and ſlimy flegme in the reines or bladder, where through heate thereof it is parched and baked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the hardneſſe of a ſtone. But that I may ſpeake ſomewhat fullier thereof, and yet briefly, the materiall cauſe of the ſtone is, as I ſaid, a tough
ſlimy flegme, and all cauſes which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſame, as all crudities and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, all meats groſſe, ſlimy, and hard of digeſtion, as milke, new cheeſe, all white meats made of milke, all cruſts of flower wherein meat is baked, bread not well baked, unleavened. All fleſh of great beaſts, eſpecially old, as beefe, veniſon: and all water-foule. Great fiſhes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe who abound in ſlimy moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as eeles, all ſhell-fiſh, oyſters, coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, lopſters, creviſes. All fruits which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender groſſe humors, peares, apples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:49277:71"/> gourds. Roots which breed winde, as parſneps, turneps. Alſo all new and thicke wine and drinke. Likewiſe becauſe heate of the reines doth bake and harden the
ſaid flegme, and all cauſes which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe heate in the reines, as too warme apparell whereby the backe and reines are kept too hot, running, leaping, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exerciſe: alſo riding eſpecially with his backe towards the Sunne, ſtanding againſt the fire with his backe, and meats, drinks, and ſpices which increaſe heate. Alſo when the veſſels of urine, the reines,
&amp;c. have too ſtrait paſſages, whereby that ſlimy flegme cannot have iſſue to be expelled, but ſtaieth within, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough heate waxeth hard, whereupon fat men through moiſtneſſe, and old men through drineſſe, having ſtraight paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the reines, are more ſubject to the
ſtone in the reines, and leſſe in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: contrariwiſe, children though they are hot and abound with flegme tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ill diet, yet becauſe their reines are wider and expulſive faculty ſtrong, whereby that flegmy matter is voyded, are leſſe troubled with the ſtone of the reines, neither leane men for the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame cauſe, but both of them are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49277:72"/> troubled with ſtone of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>Hippor. 3. Aphoriſ.</hi> 26. Laſtly, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall cauſe of the ſtone are the parents, from whom this grievous hereditary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe doth deſcend upon the childe: and this of all other is hardeſt to be cuerd. Now with like brevity to come to the cure, ſeeing there be foure cauſes which help to breed the ſtone, tough and ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my flegme, heate to parch and drie it,
ſtraitneſſe of the paſſage, and weakneſſe of the expulſive faculty. So many things as take away any of theſe, helpe for the cure thereof, as firſt a good diet, brothes wherein borage, fenell, parſley, endive, or ſuccory is ſodden, bread well baked and leavened, hennes, capons, partridge, mutton. Of fiſh, ſoles, plaice, trouts, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Of herbs, borage, endive, ſucco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
ſperage, beetes. And to come to the cure. A vomit at the beginning and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe times, is of eſpeciall uſe to draw the flegmy matter away from the reines and bladder: then a ſuppoſitary, to draw
ſome ſuperfluous excrements downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and a clyſter is to be preferred before a purgation becauſe it draweth the excrements downewards from the reines, whereas a purgation taken by the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49277:72"/> mouth doth alwaies draw ſome impurity downewards to the reines, but yet the cliſter may not be too great in quantity, leſt it fill the guts, and diſtend the reines, and ſo increaſe the paine, and ſtop the paſſage. After that, if the body be full of blood, open the veine under the anckle and not in the arme (as ſome would) for all parts of the body grieved above the liver, would be eaſed by opening a veine in the arme, but under the liver, by opening the veine under the anckle or under the knee. <hi>Galen Comment. lib. 9. Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. de morbis vulneribus. Galen de vena ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione,</hi> and then if the body abound with other humors a purgation is convenient, but not ſtrong at the firſt, leſt it ſtirre the humors too much out of ſeaſon before the paſſages be open. After this ſeeke to open the paſſages of urine about the reines partly with clyſter, partly outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſome fomentation, lineaments, inſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but yet too much uſe of theſe doth effoeminate the reines, and make them more ſubject to the humors deſcending. Then at length you may miniſter medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which provoke urine, breake and expell the ſtone. Of which medicines there is great diverſity. For ſome help to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49277:73"/> mitigate the heate of the reins, aſſwage the inflammation, and hinder the gravell to grow together into a ſtone, and ſuch be cooling, ſenifiers of roughneſſe, but not aſtringent, as the foure leſſe cold ſeeds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some provoke urine either for that they augment it by attenuating the blood, and ſeparating it from the wheyiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and carrying it to the reins, &amp; theſe are hot and dry towards the third degree.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or ſome provoke urine, becauſe they miniſter much watery and wheyiſh moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to the body, which the reins drawing to them, doe alſo draw ſome humors out of the veines, as white wine, plantaine, and melons ſeed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Or ſome againe provoke urine, not by augmenting the quantity, but by clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, skouring the reines, and diſſolving and expelling gravell now beginning to grow together. As turpentine, root of reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harrow, betony, fenell ſeed and root, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, juice of limmons, root of ſorrell, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den haire, ceterac.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some againe provoke urine by both theſe qualities, in miniſtring much whey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh matter, &amp; alſo by clenſing the paſſages.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some provoke urine by their rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, clenſing the reines, and robbing or
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49277:73"/> fretting on the ſtone or gravell, as glaſſe burned and beaten into pouder, eggeſhels, gromill, the ſtone it ſelf which came from a man beaten into pouder.</p>
               <p n="7">7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Laſtly, ſome provoke urine by an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſecret property, as lapis Iudaicus, caſſia, rheubarbe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe medicines which provoke urine in the ſecond ſignification by augmenting the quantity, are never to be uſed in any diſeaſe of the veſſels of urine as emulgent veines, reines, water-conduits, bladder or yard, for thereby they are more hurt and obſtructed by much quantity of urine paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that way. But ſuch medicines which doe coole the heate of the reins, or which do clenſe and mundefie them from impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, already gathered, and neither exceed in heat or drineſſe, but in ſubtle and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing quality. Or which by propriety of their ſubſtance help that way, as thoſe in the fourth and ſeventh ſignification, and yet theſe are not at all, or ſeldome to be uſed, when the body is leane or in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, or full of blood and ill humors, neither when the veſſels of urine are exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated or obſtructed, or the paſſages
ſtrait, or when the wombe or privy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have any ſwelling or ulcer; or when
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49277:74"/> the urine is ſuppreſſed, the bladder being full, or iſſueth with ſmart burning. For in all theſe the medicines bring more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the places grieved, and ſo increaſe the diſeaſe, neither are they to be uſed in
ſwellings or breakings out of the skin, leſt they draw the griefe to the inward parts.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the ſtrangury.</head>
               <p>The ſtrangury is cauſed either for that the urine is too ſharp, which doth provoke the expulſive faculty to expell it, before any quantity be gathered together. Or for that the retentive faculty to the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is weakened through ſome diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, eſpecially of cold. Or elſe through
ſome ulcer or inflammation of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to which the urine comming doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timulate the expulſive faculty. Or laſtly, when the wombe or bowels being infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or ſwollen, do trouble or diſtend the bladder, as in women great with childe, who oftentimes piſſe little and often. Now as the cauſe of the griefe is diverſe, ſo the medicines is likewiſe diverſe for ſharpnes of the urine, whether it come of hot and
ſalt meats, too much heating the liver and reines, or of medicines which burne the blood, or of exerciſe which likewiſe heate
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49277:74"/> the reines and bladder, or laſtly, that the moiſture in the glandulous parts is dried up by too much uſe of venery, leaneneſſe or drineſſe of the body, muſt bee cured with contrary diet, and medicine which moiſten, take away the ſharpneſſe and coole the blood as new laid egges, chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, veale, meats made of wheat and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley meale, alſo lettuce, purſlane, endive,
ſorrell, prunes, cherries, ſweet apples, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers, melons, but mixe not here with too much ſalt, vineger, or other hot ſpices, and if the body abound with ſharp humors a gentle purgation is good of caſſia, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, whey, dieſebaſten, alſo decoctions of lettuce, violets, ſorrell, purſlane, adding thereto ſome licorize or prunes, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or leaves of malowes, the root of holihoke. And if the paine be raging, it is good to make an injection by a ſyringe, of the white of an egge, with roſe water or womans milke, or the juice of purſlane, or plantaine, &amp;c. But if the glandulous moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture be too much dried up, you muſt uſe
ſuch meats and medicines inwardly and outwardly as doe moiſten the parts, as oyle of violets, almonds, hennes greaſe, new butter alſo to make plaiſters to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the places about the privy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49277:75"/> or injections, to be ſquirted up into the yard or cliſters to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the piſſing evill.</head>
               <p>The piſſing evill is called, when the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient piſſeth as faſt as he drinketh, and in like quantity. Or when he piſſeth againſt his will, and it chanceth either through default of the bladder or reines. As when the retentive faculty of the bladder is decaied through diſtemperature of cold and moiſtneſſe: for too much cold doth extinguiſh the naturall heate of it, which is of a cold and ſinewie ſubſtance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood, and too much moiſtneſſe doth looſen the ſmall ſtrings, ſerving to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive faculty, or when the expulſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is hurt through quantity or quality of the urine. Or laſtly, when the muſcle
(<hi>ſphincter</hi> ſerving for voluntary motion, is decaied or weakened either through cold or moiſtneſſe, looſening, or obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting or benumming the muſcle, as in the paulſie, or is rent or wounded that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe his duty, as ſome time happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to thoſe, who are cut for the ſtone in the bladder, where either the unskilfull Surgeon doth make too great inciſion, or the ſtone too big doth rent the muſcle in comming out. Whereupon though
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49277:75"/> the wound groweth whole againe, yet the weakneſſe of the muſcle remaineth: this griefe is almoſt familiar to children who bepiſſe their beds in ſleep through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and looſeneſſe. Or this griefe happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth through default of the reines being too hot, and ſo draw the urine too faſt from the liver and veines, and the retentive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty weak cannot hold the urine, but ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it as faſt to the bladder.</p>
               <p>Now for the cure (but I can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the cure of the muſcle of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for that being cut or wounded, &amp;c. incurable.) Firſt the humor offending muſt be removed, and then the diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture corrected, the humor offending if it be heate, muſt be removed by opening the liver veine in the right arme, or by a gentle purgation of manna caſſia, tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindes,
ſirupe of roſes ſolutine, diaſebeſten, and diaprunon, but all without ſcammony and rather often to be uſed, then much at once, that thereby nature by little and little may be framed to void thoſe humors by ſtoole which deſcend to the reines, alſo a vomite ſtronger for to draw the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors from the reines, and a ſweat is not inconvenient to draw them to the skin, and laſtly to correct the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49277:76"/> and ſtrengthen the parts, uſe
ſome of theſe cooling medicines, as let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce, endive, ſuckory, forrell, alſo decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſirups of the ſame, and beſides of purſlane, roſes, violets, and cooling meats and drinks. For ſtrong wines, and which have power to provoke urine are not good. Alſo a ceare-cloth applyed to the backe, loynes and veines to coole them, ceratum refrigerans, unguentum roſaceum &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talinam meſue. But if the cauſe came of cold, a vomit and ſweat is likewiſe good, alſo clyſters, wherein oyle of cammomill, dill and bitter almonds muſt be uſed. And now and then it is good to uſe pils of aloes and rheubarbe. The diet muſt be of hote things, and wherein ſome hot ſpices are put. Laſtly, uſe of cupping glaſſes without inciſion, friction of the outward parts, and moderate exerciſe is convenient, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they heate the body, as alſo draw the humor away from the inward parts. And thus much briefly of theſe diſeaſes, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending fully to handle the ſame.</p>
