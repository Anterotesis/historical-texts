         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas We have been long ſince driven by Force and Violence from Our Pallace at Weſtminſter (the place of ſitting for Us, and Our two Houſes of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſo that We could not with ſafety of Our Life be preſent with Our great Councell, and much the greater part of the Members of both Houſes of Parliament have been likewiſe driven by Tumults and Force for their ſafety from their attendance upon that Councell, the ſaid Members having been threatned and aſſaulted for delivering their Opinions freely in the Houſes; or have out of Conſcience and Duty withdrawne themſelves from being preſent at the Debates and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they have well knowne to be ſo contrary to their Duty and Allegiance, or for ſo withdrawing, or for freely ſpeaking in the Houſes, have been expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or ſuſpended from being Members of that Councell, contrary to the ancient Practice, and juſt Priviledges of Parliament. Since which time, and by which meanes, a great and Rebellious Army hath been raiſed againſt Us, under the Command of <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which Army hath not onely endeavoured to take away Our Life from Us in a ſet Battle, but the ſame, and other Forces raiſed by the like meanes, hath committed all the Acts of Outrage, Robbery, and Murder, upon Our good Subjects throughout the Kingdome, and ſtill continues to doe the ſame. And though in truth, a very ſmall part of that great Councell remaine there to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet under pretence of having the countenance of Our two Houſes of Parliament, ſome ſeditious perſons aſſume to themſelves (with the aſſiſtance of thoſe Rebellious Armies, and of divers mutinous and deſperate Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, and other ill affected perſons in Our City of London, by whoſe meanes they awe ſuch Members of both Houſes who yet continue amongſt them) a power to doe things abſlolutely contrary to the Lawes of the Land, and deſtructive to Our Rights, and to the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and to alter the whole Frame and Government of this Kingdome, diſpoſing of the Lives and Fortunes of Us, and Our good Subjects, according to their diſcretion, ſubjecting both to their owne unlimited ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power and Government: We have only accuſed ſome particular perſons, whom We well know to be the Authours and Contrivers of theſe deſperate Counſels, and Actions, and have forborne to cenſure or charge the whole number of the Members remaining, by whoſe Orders and Authority the evils have been pretended to be done, We hoping that the ſenſe of the miſerable Diſtractions of the Kingdom would at length have brought them to diſcern where they had erred, and Our  <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ften Meſſages, and Complaints of the violence offered to Us, and to the Members of both Houſes, would have procured juſtice &amp; Redreſſe and that the Power and Reputation of ſuch amongſt them, who wiſhed well to the Peace of the Kingdom, and Honor &amp; Dignity of Parliaments, would at laſt ſo far prevailed, that a right underſtanding might have been begotten betwixt Us and Our People, and all ſhew of Force and Violence ſo taken away and ſuppreſſed, that We might in a full and peaceable convention of Parliament, with the advice of that Our great Councell, have ſo ſetled the preſent diſtempers, that there might be no feare left ofthe like for the future. But finding to Our great Griefe, that the power of thoſe ſeditious perſons, who firſt contrived theſe deſperate and bloody Diſtractions, continues ſo great, that as they have driven, and now keep Us, and the much greater part of both Houſes, from being preſent at that Councell, ſo they ſo far awe thoſe who remaine there, that they cannot with freedome give their Votes and Reſolutions according to their Conſciences, and the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Kingdome, that the Members of both Houſes have beene compelled to make Proteſtations to live and dye with the Earle of Eſſex, the Generall of the Rebellious Army, and other unlawfull and Treaſonable Proteſtations; and that ſuch who have refuſed to take the ſaid Proteſtations, have been expelled and impriſoned for ſuch their refuſall. That the great affaires of the Kingdome are managed and concluded by a private Committee without being ever reported to the Houſes, contrary to the Laws and Rules of Parliament. That the Common-Councell of London (moſt of them being perſons factiouſly choſen out of Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, and ſuch who oppoſe the regular wholeſome Government of that City, and have promiſed themſelves the deſtruction of the Church, are grown the ſuperintendents over both Houſes, and obtrude upon them what concluſions and reſolutions they pleaſe. That they take upon them to juſtifie this Rebellion againſt Us; And have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed under pretence of the Order of both Houſes, to invite forraigne Forces to invade this Kingdome. To ſend Agents to forraigne Princes to Negotiate and Treat with them in their owne names. To impriſon Our good Subjects contrary to Law, prohibiting Our Judges to grant <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> according to Law. To introduce a new Clergy throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by diſplacing godly learned Divines, Without the leaſt colour of Law, or judiciall, proceedings, and putting ignorant and ſeditious Preachers in their places to poyſon the hearts of the People. To countenance the vilifying of the Booke of Common-Prayer eſtabliſhed by the Law of the Land. To ſeize, leavy, and take away what they pleaſe of the Eſtates and Fortunes of Our Subjects by diſpoſing of the twentieth part of their Eſtates, by exhauſting them with unſupportable weekly Taxes for the maintenance of their Rebellious Army; and by endeavouring to lay odious Exciſes upon Victuals, Goods and Marchandiſe of Our People for the ſame purpoſe, while they ſuffer Our poor Proteſtant Subjects of Our Kingdome of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, whoſe defence was undertaken by Our two Houſes, and that Army raiſed for the ſuppreſſing of that horrid Rebellion, to be ſtarved, and in danger of disbanding, or neceſſitated to deſert that Kingdome for want of money, victuall, and ſuch other neceſſaries as were to be provided for them by Act of Parliament, out of thoſe moneys which they have ſpent to deſtroy Us and this Kingdome, by exacting from Marchants Tunnage and Poundage, and other impoſitions upon Marchandiſes, as well Native as forraigne, contrary to an Act made this preſent Parliament, with a penalty of premunire on thoſe who ſhall pay or receive it. And laſtly, That they have (after the breaking of the late Treaty, by a peremptory recalling the Committee, who in truth, during their abode with Us, had no power to Treat by reaſon of their ſtrict limitation) ſo far rejected all poſſible meanes and overtures of Treaty and Accommodation, that inſtead of anſwering Our Gracious Meſſages, the Houſe of Commons hath impriſoned Our Meſſenger ſent by us to them, to invite both Houſes to an Accommodation, and eſpecially to move them to take ſuch a courſe for the freedome of Parliament which we might ſafely adviſe with that Our great Councell for the ſetling thoſe miſerable Diſtractions, and Diſtempers. And hath maliciouſly and in contempt of Us (and after an attempt to murder Her at Burlington Rode, the place of Her landing) impeached Our Royall Conſort of High Treaſon, for aſſiſting Us with Armes and Ammunition to defend Us from this Rebellion. Tis time now to let Our good Subjects know, that they may no longer looke upon the Votes and Actions of the perſons now remaining, as upon Our two Houſes of Parliament, Freedome and Liberty to be preſent, and of opinion and debate there, being eſſentiall to a Parliament, which Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Liberty, all men muſt confeſſe to be taken away from this Aſſembly, when they remember the great Tumults brought downe to awe and terrifie both Houſes, and that they were then brought downe when any great Debate was in either Houſe, and not like to be ſo carried as ſome ſeditious perſons who governed thoſe Tumults did deſire; that in the greateſt heat and fury of thoſe Tumults the principall governours amongſt them directed the unruly people to goe to White-Hall, where Our owne Perſon then was, and deſigned by force to have ſurpriſed the Perſon of Our Son the Prince; that when it was deſired that a Declaration might be made againſt ſuch Tumults, in ſtead of conſenting thereunto, the Tumults themſelves were juſtified; and when a legall courſe was preſcribed by the Lords, and taken by the proper Miniſters of Juſtice to ſuppreſſe and prevent ſuch Tumults, and Riots, that legall courſe was ſuperſeaded by thoſe who were then preſent of the Houſe of Commons, and the Miniſters of Juſtice puniſhed and impriſoned for executing the Law, when they remember that ſeverall Members of either Houſe have been threatned and aſſaulted in thoſe Tumults, and their owne names preſcribed as perſons diſaffected, becauſe they freely uſed to ſpeake their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in both Houſes. That the Houſe of Peers have been ſo far threatned and menaced, that the names of thoſe have been with threats demanded by the Houſe of Commons at the Bar of the Lords Houſe, who refuſed to conſent to this or that Propoſition which had been in debate before them: And tumultuous petitions countenanced which have been preſented to that ſame purpoſe. That the Members of both Houſes have been impriſoned, and forbid to be preſent at thoſe Councels, for no reaſons but becauſe their opinion have not been liked. That Our Negative Voice (Our greateſt and moſt Soveraigne Priviledge) is boldly denyed. That a preſumptuous attempt hath been made by the major part of the remaining part of the Houſe of Commons to make Our Great Seale of England, the making of which by the expreſſe letter of the Law, is high Treaſon, and would ſubvert the ancient and fundamentall adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtice. That at this time, We and the Major part of both Houſes are kept by a ſtrong and Rebellious Army from being preſent at that Councell, and that thoſe who are preſent, are by the ſame Army awed and forced to take unlawfull and Treaſonable Proteſtations to engage their Votes. And that ſuch Reſolutions and Directions which concerne the Property and Liberty of the Subjects are tranſacted and concluded by a few perſons (under the name of a cloſe Committee conſiſting of the Earle of Mancheſter, the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hampden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Strood,</hi> Mr. <hi>Martyn,</hi> and others, the whole number not exceeding the number of 17 perſons) without reporting the ſame to the Houſes, or having the ſame confirmed by the Houſes, contrary to the expreſſe Law and Cuſtomes of Parliament. All which for the matter of fact, We are ready to make proofe of, and deſire nothing but to bring the Contrivers of all the aforeſaid miſchiefes o their triall by Law, and till that be ſubmitted to, We muſt purſue them by Armes or any other way, in which Our good Subjects ought to give Us aſſiſtance to that purpoſe. The imagining the death of Us, Our Royall Confort, or Our eldeſt Son, the leavying War againſt Us in Our Realme, giving to them aid of comfort, the counterfeiting Our great Seal or Money, being by the expreſſe words of the Stat. of the 25 yeare of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.

And for their better encouragement to reſort to Us, We do hereby will and command all the Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Our Army to ſuffer all ſuch perſons who are Members of either Houſe, with their attendants and ſervants to come to Us to this Our City of Oxford: And that none of Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may believe that by this Our neceſſary Declaration againſt the freedom &amp; liberty of that preſent Aſſembly, We may have the leaſt intention to violate or to avoid any Act or Acts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Us for the good and benefit of Our people this Parliament: We doe hereby declare to all the world, That We ſhall, as We have often promiſed as inviolably obſerve all thoſe Acts, as if no ſuch unhappy interruption had happened of the freedom and liberty in that Councell: And deſire nothing more then to have ſuch a free convention in Parliament, that We may add ſuch further Acts of Grace as ſhall be thought neceſſary for the advancement of the true Proteſtant Religion, for the maintenance of the Liberty &amp; Property of the Subjects, and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Liberty, Freedome and Priviledges of Parliament. And that all the world may ſee how willing and deſirous We are to forget all the Injuries and Indignities offered to Us by ſuch who have been miſled through weakneſſe or fear, or who have not been the principall Contrivers of the preſent miſeries: We do offer a free and generall pardon to all the Members of either Houſe (except <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Eſſex, Ro<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
