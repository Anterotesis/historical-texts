            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THough it be no ways needful to usher in this little Treatise, with a Preface or Epistle, yet I will premise a few things concerning the occasion, matter, method, use, and end thereof. When I considered the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes amongst us, who profess their Faith in Christ, own the name of Christian, and seem to glory in that title, and yet are ignorant, not only of the original and ground of Christianity, but of the very first Principles and Rudiments of Religion, and also highly guilty of the breach of that Covenant, whereby they solemnly in the sight of men and Angels bound themselves to be loyal and obedient unto Christ their Saviour, I thought it might be a service acceptable to God, and profitable unto the Church, to mind them of their sin, and give them some directions, with an exhortation to amend betimes, that so they may avert Gods judgments, and escape the wrath to come; therefore I took occasion to single out this Text, compose this brief Treatise, submit it to the judgment of the Church, and upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation make it publick: And first I bring
<pb facs="tcp:105988:3"/>
the Reader into the sacred Arches, where the Monuments of eternal saving truth are kept; and shew him the very place, where the grand Charter of our profession is enroled; for we find it in the words of our blessed Saviour, related by the Evangelist St. <hi>Mat. ch. 28. v. 18, 19, 20.</hi> Where we have a commission issued out from Christ to his Apostles and Successors, and the same grounded upon a far higher Patent, whereby all power in heaven and earth is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived immediately from his heavenly Father, and given unto him: And seeing (as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> observes) we receive our Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Faith from the Apostles, the Apostles from Christ, and Christ from God, it must needs be from heaven: and here we should take special notice of, and admire the excellent wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of  Christ our Lord and Saviour, as far above all the wisdom of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who could in so few words, and in such excellent order contract so many high mysteries and matters of greatest weight and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for here' in a very narrow compass we may find the (<hi>Credenda</hi>) all the Articles of our Faith, and the (<hi>Agenda</hi>) all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Christ: Here we have the original Creed, and perfect form of Confession, which was the ground of all the ancient and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Creeds: here we have the sum and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb facs="tcp:105988:3"/>
of all that excellent Doctrine, which is dispersed here and there through all the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets, Evangelists, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. Here we have the institution of sacred Orders for the dispensation of Word and Sacraments, and the application of the benefits of Redemption. Here we have the institution of Baptism, with a certain form of words; the Eucharist and Prayer as parts of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship are to be reckon'd amongst the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christ: So that here is a Rule of Faith, of Obedience, of Worship, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Discipline implied. All these things I make clear, &amp; then proceed to say something of that form of Confession we call (<hi>The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Creed,</hi>) and of the principal points of Scripture in order to the same; teach the Reader how to refer the several parts and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of Scripture unto the general heads of the Creed, and reduce the matters of Faith into a form of a larger Confession. This I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a ready way to understand the publick Catechism, so much despised by many, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our knowledge of the Word of God, and of the particulars of that Faith, which by our Baptism we are bound to hold and profess unto the end. After this I go on to the (<hi>Agenda</hi>) the Commandments of Christ, and shew how they are in several parts of Scripture contracted,
<pb facs="tcp:105988:4"/>
how all are performed in Love; give a more full explication of the moral Law, which is to be understood Evangelically, as including Repentance and Faith in Christ, and then bring them into the form of a Vow, that so we may have a more explicite knowledge of the last part of our promise made to God in Baptism; be more sensible of our obligation, and more careful of performance, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, formerly urged upon most effectual rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Amongst the (<hi>Agenda</hi>) I reckon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and Prayer; and after I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the nature, end, and use of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Institution, I single out that Prayer of Prayers, the pattern of all our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is commonly called the <hi>Lords Prayer:</hi> and having explained it in all the parts, I reduce the particulars into a larger form of Prayer: The former makes it clear how comprehensive and methodical it is, as being a wonderful abridgment of all Scripture Prayers; the latter teacheth us how to reduce all the parts of our publick Prayers unto the heads thereof, and to enlarge upon them in our private Devotions. Somethings in my (<hi>Theopolitica</hi>) are here repeated; yet they are but few, and are here improved; handled there more largely, here more briefly; there in one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, here in another, and for another use and
<pb facs="tcp:105988:4"/>
immediate end. Here I single out a certain Text, and confine my self unto it, and fit it to the capacity of the common sort, and weaker Christians, for whom it was principally intended. I further concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that many who will not meddle with a greater Volume, may yet buy a lesser Book, or Manual, such as this is, and read it through. Now if after these, and many other helps, we continue ignorant, or if not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yet impenitent, we shall render our selves highly guilty of Rebellion against Christ's Power, of Disobedience to his Commands, and of perfidious violation of the Covenant of God: but if we diligently use the means, and exercise the power God hath given us, and pray continually for Grace, there is comfort, and hope of mercy; for here we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, That Christ will be present with the Church unto the end, and assist us with his blessed Spirit; to whom, with the Father and the Son, be given all Glory, Honour, Praise, and Thanks, for ever and ever.</p>

                  <head>Section 1:</head>
                  <p>THese are the words of our blessed Saviour, which he spake unto his Apostles and Disciples, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Resurrection he was ready to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into Heaven; for they pre-suppose Man's Sin, Christ's Suffering, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; Man by sin had made himself miserable, and liable to temporal and eternal death; yet God was willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him: Sin and Satan cast him down,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105988:6"/>
yet God in his abundant mercy was pleased to raise him up again. The way which his eternal Wisdom had contrived to effect this great deliverance was strange &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful; his only begotten Son, even that word which was God, and by which he made the world must be made flesh, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the nature of man, and in that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture must take upon him the form of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, be obedient unto death, the death of the Cross, rise again, and be advanced to the highest pitch of glory: so that the means of mans salvation are the humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and exaltation of the Son of God. By his humiliation and sacrifice of himself he expiates mans sin, satisfies Divine Justice, and merits all mercies and blessings neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the full and eternal happiness of man. By his exaltation he makes his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings effectual, and communicates the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits he had merited; for we read, <hi>That he was delivered for our offences, and was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed again for our justification, Rom.</hi> 4. 25. To be delivered for our offences was his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation unto death for our sins, to render them pardonable. To be raised again for our justification, was his exaltation for the obtaining of actual remission: his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation begins, his exaltation consummates
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105988:6"/>
our salvation. For being advanced to the right hand of his Father, he sends down the Holy Ghost, reveals the Gospel, causeth it to be preached to all Nations, and by his Word and Spirit converts man, and plants the heavenly vertue of Faith in his heart; and upon Conversion and Faith makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession in Heaven, and procures his actual pardon, reconciliation with his God; and in the end the enjoyment of eternal glory: so that without his humiliation man is not savable, and without his exaltation he is not actually saved. And thus we must understand that of the same Apostle; <hi>For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. where we must observe, That the death of Christ is his humiliation, his life is his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation. 2. That reconciliation is ascribed to his death, salvation to his life. For the Death and Blood of Christ was the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our sins, and the foundation of our reconciliation: the life and exaltation of Christ by his Word and Spirit convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and making intercession for us, is the cause of actual salvation.</p>

                  <p>As in the two former Chapters
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105988:7"/>
we may read of Christs suffering, death, and humiliation, whereby he mirited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable mercies and blessings; so in this we read of his resurrection, and the manner how he will apply and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his blessings, and that is by a commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and power received, and a commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and power given; for the subject of the words are a two-fold commission.</p>
                  <p>The first granted by God to Christ, The second by Christ to his Apostles.</p>
                  <p>These agree in some things, differ in others. 1. They agree as commissions giving great power. 2. As expressing an unspeakable love unto, and a tender care of sinful man. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As issuing from the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and universal Lord. 4. As tending to the same end, mans eternal salvation: yet they differ in these things. 1. The former commission is granted by God immediately to Christ; the latter is granted from God by Christ unto the Apostles. 2. The former is the cause of the latter, the latter an effect of the former. 3. By the former Christ receives an universal power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth; and by the latter the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles receive only a limited power on earth.</p>

                  <p>I will not say much of the first commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expressed in these words, Ver. 18. <hi>All power in heaven and earth is given unto me.</hi> Wherein he signifies that he had large power, and it was given him; where we must consider, 1. Power given. 2. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to whom it was given. 3. The donor, or the Donation of it from the Donour.</p>
                  <p>In the power we may observe, 1. The nature and quality of it. 2. The measure of it.</p>
                  <p>1. For the nature and quality of it, it is spiritual and divine; for Christ said, <hi>My kingdom is not of this world,</hi> John 18. 36. That is, its no secular power like that of the Princes of the world; its far more excellent and above it in respect of the subjects, the laws, the judgments, the end thereof. The subjects besides Angels are men considered in a spiritual notion, and as capable of an eternal estate. The Laws also are spiritual, and bind not only Angels, but the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal souls and consciences of men. Such are the judgments which determine and accord not only temporal but eternal punishments and rewards. The end in respect of all loyal and obedient subjects, is eternal peace and felicity: for God gave
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105988:8"/>
Christ power over all flesh, <hi>that he should give eternal life to as many as he had given him,</hi> John 17. 2.</p>
                  <p>2. The measure of this power is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and intensive. Extensive in respect of the territory which is very large, even the whole world; whereof there be two parts, heaven and earth; so that it extends to all places, and all things, and so is universal; yet the principal subjects are Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and men on earth, both intellectual and immortal creatures. Intensive: for its (all) power; one may have some power, or all power on earth, and none in heaven, or some, or all power in heaven, and none on earth; but this is all power in heaven, all power on earth, all power on both; so that Christ is over all persons, in all causes supream Governour, without any created superiour, without any competitour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any partner; its all in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree invested and inherent in one. This is concernig the power.</p>
                  <p>2. The person invested with it is Christ; <hi>For all power</hi> (saith he) <hi>is given to me:</hi> it was not given to any Angel, or Angels, nor to any Monarch, or Monarchs of the world, but to Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a man nearer to God then any of the Princes of the earth,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105988:8"/>
or any Principalities and Powers of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; one more beloved of God, and who had done a greater service than any other; for he had humbled himself at his Fathers command so low as to be a servant, and a servant obedient unto the death of the Cross; therefore he, and none other, was thus highly exalted, and received a name above every name.</p>
                  <p>3. The Donour was God the Father. As none but Christ was capable, none was worthy of this transcendent power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that universal acknowledgment of Saints and Angels; <hi>Rev.</hi> 5, 10. <hi>The Lamb slain was worthy to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</hi> And as he was only worthy, so God his Father alone was able to give so great power: for it was given; which implies, that Christ as man had it not of himself: it was not an original and primitive, but a delegate and derivative power. 2. He was no usurper, he did not glorifie himself; he had a fair and clear title by donation from the universal, supream, and eternal Soveraign, who might justly dispose of it as he pleased; he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to this place from of old, designed to it from his Birth and Conception, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105988:9"/>
began to act in it after his Baptism. But upon his resurrection he was declared more solemnly to be King and Priest. The words of the decree and patent were these, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee: for then God set him his King upon his holy hill of Zion, &amp; gave him the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession.</hi> And as by these words he was made King, so by the same he was made Priest: for so we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>He glorified not himself, nor took upon him to be high Priest, but he was made such by him who said, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> This day is the day of resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and for God to beget him that day, was not only to raise him from the dead, but to create him universal King and Priest: When he was ascended into heaven, he was set at the right hand of God, took more full possession of his Kingdom, and by oath was confirmed an eternal Priest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from that time began to exercise his universal power, to command the Angels, and to rule over men.</p>

                  <head>Sect. 3.</head>
                  <p>The end wby Christ signified unto them the receiving of this power, was, 1. To let them know that now in part he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105988:9"/>
his glorious reward for his deep hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and great service performed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross, and the time of his full glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification was at hand; and that suffering was the way to glory. 2. That he had full power to grant them a large commission; and therefore as his Father sent him, so he sends them: and as he could, so he would make good whatsoever they did according to this patent: for upon this universal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er received by Christ depends the ministry of the Gospel: and the efficacy of Word and Sacraments, which must continue unto the worlds end: and by vertue thereof, the Apostles and their successours, shut and open the gates of heaven; and what they bind or loose on earth, is ratified in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and this is the great comfort to the universal Church, and especially to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters thereof, that the blessed Lord and Saviour who hath made so many and great promises, is enabled by this great power to make them all good.</p>

                  <p>NOw follows the second commission granted by Christ unto his Apostles,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105988:10"/>
wherein we have the institution of the Ministry for the dispensation of Word and Sacraments tending to the conversion, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and eternal salvation of sinful man: and in the text with the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing three things are observable.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The party granting the commission.</item>
                     <item>2. The parties to whom its granted.</item>
                     <item>3. The parts of it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. The party granting it is Christ, as risen from the dead, having received all power in heaven and earth, and ready to ascend into heaven, that he might send down the Holy Ghost to enable the persons commissioned more fully to discharge their trust.</p>
                  <p>2. The parties to whom it was granted were first the Apostles, and in them all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters lawfully called to succeed them in the dispensation of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>3. The parts of the commission are two. 1. A mandate. 2. A promise.</p>
                  <p>1. The mandate we have in these words, <hi>Go teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have commanded you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This mandate in respect of the matter hath four parts.</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105988:10"/>
                     <item>1. They must go to all Nations.</item>
                     <item>2. They must preach and disciple them.</item>
                     <item>3. They must baptize them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</item>
                     <item>4. They must teach them to observe all the commandments of Christ.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The promise also for the matter is twofold; for Christ engageth himself unto them for, 1. His presence and assistance, <hi>I will be with you.</hi> 2. The continuance of his presence and assistance: for he <hi>will be with you to the worlds end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The mandate did give them power, and bound them to exercise it: The promise did encourage to go on with the work, and gave them hope of success. The mandate bound them to Christ, the promise bound Christ to them. The words of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and promise may be reduced to three propositions, or divine axioms.</p>
                  <p>The 1. Christ grants a commission to the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>2. In this commission <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se commands them to go, disciple, baptize, teach all Nations.</p>
                  <p>3. He promiseth certainly to be with them always unto the worlds end.</p>
                  <p>The 1. (Christ grants a commission to the Apostles) is to be handled briefly, to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105988:11"/>
make way for the enisung discourse. A commission issuing out from some eminent power hath two effects for it.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Gives authority and power to the party commissioned.</item>
                     <item>2. Binds to exercise that power accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the instructions given.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This Authority and the obligation u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually follow upon a Mandate; for when God or higher powers command any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their power to do any thing expressed in the mandate, then the party commanded hath not only power, but is bound to do it; when Christ therefore as universal Lord and Soveraign had signified his will and pleasure unto the Apostles, and expressed what their work was, this signification was not only a sufficient warrant for the dispensation of Word and Sacraments in the administration of his heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but also bound to the performance of their duty. And now if they do any thing specified in the mandate, it must needs he valid according to the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the universal Empire, and they must be indemnified as no ways guilty of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous usurpation or intrusion into their Office. And if they be diligent and faithful in their place, and perform their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105988:11"/>
duty, they may make a good account, and expect a reward. By vertue of this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the Apostles received an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and all Ministers duly qualified, elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, approved, an ordinary power. And its a great comfort and content unto a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, when he can truly say, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science testifie it; I did not go before I was sent; and the word of the Lord came to me before I did presume to declare it to others. I did not assume power before it was given me; neither have I done any thing for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I have not my Masters command. As Christ gave, so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles received this commission; yet this was not the first, for Christ had formerly sent them and consined them to the lost sheep of <hi>Israel;</hi> but now he enlargeth their patent, and they must go to all Nations. And here its observable that when he sent them first to the Jews only, he gave them not only authority but the ability of Apostles, and when he sends them the second time  20. 21, 22. he breaths upon them say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Receive ye the holy ghost,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to stay at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> till the spirit from on high should be poured upon them, which should fully enable them for the discharge of their high office; for they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105988:12"/>
received &amp; were endued with all heavenly wisdom, and the knowledge of languages and all other gifts requisite for their place. Christ did in this proceed by degrees; first, he makes them Disciples, then Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, then Messengers fit to be sent unto all Nations: and he never required any thing at their hands but according to their ability, which he had given them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Humane commissions if rightly granted, do not make the persons to be commissioned able and rightly qualified, but find them such. And though men may chuse and advance insufficient and unworthy persons, yet Christ never did so; but if they be not fit, he makes them able before he sends them or puts them in office; otherwise he knows power should be given in vain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though they should be very willing, yet they shall not be able to do their duty. Therefore if God send any man, there will be found in him not only authority but ability too. Let no man therefore take upon him the charge of a Minister except he find himself qualified; for insufficiency in any person is evidence enough that God never intended him for his service in this kind. As the mandate presupposing ability as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, gave authority; so it did induce an
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105988:12"/>
obligation of the person commanded to do his work. Therefore the Apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a command for to perform the works proper to their place and office, were not at liberty, but as they had received power so they must exercise it; otherwise they cannot be faithful to their trust, nor make any good account, nor expect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; nay, they will be guilty and liable to punishment. This <hi>Paul</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted an Apostle knew full well, and doth confess it, saying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. (<hi>A necessity is laid upon me, and woe unto me if I preach not the Gospel</hi>) where we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, 1. An obligation to preach the Gospel, and this a necessity from the command. 2. Another obligation unto punishment, if he discharge not his duty.</p>
                  <p>From this commission we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve many things. 1. In respect of Christ. 2. of Ministers. 3. Of People to whom they are sent; In Christs giving this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date is manifested his great care of the Church, and his tender love to our poor souls ready to perish. 1. He redeems us by his precious blood, and merits unspeakable mercies for us. 2. Least this blood should be shed in vain, and these mercies never imparted unto us, he giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s commission to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105988:13"/>
his Apostles and Messengers, furnisheth them with gifts, gives them authority and power, binds them to dispence the Word, administer the Sacraments, and use all means which he hath appointed for our conversion, confirmation and eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that we in the end may attain the ultimate benefit of his death and passion; and be fully and for ever saved. And woe unto them if they be not diligent and faithful; for he will be highly offended with them, and require their blood at their hands.</p>
                  <p>2. For Ministers, let them consider whether they have ability, and be rightly qualified, before they enter upon the place, whether they have authority and be sent, and if they take the charge upon them, let them remember their duty, and the strict obligation that lies upon them. If they have not ability, Christ never intended to trust them; they cannot discharge the place; if they have not a clear call and mandate, they cannot expect his assistance, success or comfort; if they neglect their duty, woe unto them; they shall be called to an account, and shall be found more guilty then other men, and punished with more grievous punishments; and they must know
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105988:13"/>
that the Office of a Minister is not a place of ease, worldly honour, filthy gain, much less of tyranny over mens consciences, and proudly domineering over Christs flock.</p>
                  <p>3. As for the people, they must consider Christs dearest love unto them, highly esteem their Ministers in love for the works sake, hearken to their Doctrine, obey their commands, follow their directions. And if they despise them, they despise Christ who sent them; and shall severely be punished.</p>

                  <p>THe second proposition is concerning the Mandate the 1. part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and it is to this purpose: <hi>Christ commanded the Apostles to preach, baptize, teach all Nations.</hi> And because this is a copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late compound axiom &amp; divisable into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral simple axioms; therefore according to the four several parts of the work and matter commanded, I will deliver them in four distinct propositions which are these.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Christ commanded the Apostle to go to all Nations.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:105988:14"/>2. Christ commanded them to teach all Nations to whom they went.</item>
                     <item>3. Christ commanded them to baptize all Nations taught.</item>
                     <item>4. Christ commanded them to teach all Nations baptized to observe all things which he had commanded them.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Before I enter upon these particulars, let me inform you. 1. That those actions commanded are subordinate one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the first to the second, the second to the third, the third to the last, For they must go that they may teach or disciple: They must teach or disciple that they may baptize; they must baptize that they may teach the parties baptized the observation of all Christs commands.</p>
                  <p>2. The general object of these actions is <hi>all nations;</hi> that is, the men of <hi>all nations;</hi> the object of their preaching is the number of them in <hi>all nations</hi> who hear them; the object of their Baptism are such as being taught are Disciples; the subject or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of teaching are the baptized.</p>
                  <p>3. The whole work charged upon these Apostles and their successours is reducible to the dispensation of Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>4. That in these words we have a clear
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105988:14"/>
institution of the ministery, and directions for Doctrine, Worship, and discipline Christian.</p>
                  <p>5. The end of the ministery is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Christs Redemption; and of his Redemption applyed remission of sins and eternal life.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 2. The Proposition.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Christ commands his Apostles to go to all Nations.</head>
                  <p>Here is not determined the particular time and day when thy should begin the work, what Nation or Nations they should first go unto; whether they should go se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally or joyntly: whether they should do the whole work in their own persons, or some of it by assistants qualified for that purpose, when their work should be finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether in their own time, or much was to be left unto their successours; yet these things though not here expressed are certain. 1. They must go to all Nations, for none are excepted or excluded. 2. They must begin at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and first ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der salvation to the Jew. 3. They must begin in this place immediately upon the receiving of the Holy Ghost, and the gift of Languages. 4. They must go to other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105988:15"/>
Nations as providence did direct them, and the Spirit did reveal unto them. 5. They might go severally and have their several assignations; yet so that sometimes two or more might go together, or meet at the same place. 6. They might do and did many things by assistants. 7. The principal work of the Apostles was to plant and lay the foundation of the Christian Church and Religion. 8. Seeing the work could not be finished before the Worlds end; therefore much must be left to their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours. 9. Christ did not so limit himself to the eleven Apostles then present as that he could not commission others and invest them with Apostolical power: for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward St. <hi>Mathias</hi> was substituted in the place of <hi>Judas,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> made a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Apostle. 10. This universal power in respect of all Nations was not so limited to the Apostles or any extraordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that the ordinary might not do Christ service in the universal Church, or any Nation whether God should call him according to the opportunity and ability which God should give him.</p>
                  <p>But to be brief and hasten to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of the commission, I will in this proposition briefly observe four things.</p>

                     <item>1. The preventing grace of God.</item>

                     <item>3. The benefits which redound unto us thereupon.</item>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 3.</head>
                  <p>1. The preventing grace of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, that the Nations did not pray to God to send them, nor seek to the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to come unto them, nor did they come unto the Apostles; but the Apostles were commanded to go to them, and did go, and came to all Nations. They must not take their ease, and make <hi>Jerusalem</hi> the place of their residence in one College, Consistory or palace there. They must not stand upon terms of Honour, and send out their Edicts to cite and summon the Nations to come unto them and appear before them. Its true, that hitherto the Jew had taken State upon him; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of Gods Election of that City and the Temple, the Gentiles must assemble there, &amp; appear before God in that holy place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If thus he refuse to do, he must stand at a distance and continue without Christ, without honour, without God in the World. If the Gentile will not come
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105988:16"/>
over to the Jew, the Jew will not, must not go over unto him. But the time of this dispensation was expired, and God will take another course; and in his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy he will prevent the Gentiles of all Nations. The Apostles must part asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, take several ways; and with great labour, peril, charge, visit the Nations of the World; and seek their souls in every climate. And God by them did bring the Gospel, Christ and Salvation to their doors; and offer Heaven and Eternity of bliss un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to most unworthy wretches, who never sought or thought of any such thing. Then began to be fulfilled, that which was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Prophet long before. <hi>Esay</hi> 65. 1. <hi>I am sought of them that asked not for me: I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a Nation not called by my Name.</hi> The distance between God and sinful man is very great: and would for ever so continue, if God should deal with him in strict justice: nay, if he should not shew him great mercy. For man would never think of God as he ought, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver desire him, never come unto him, if God should not prevent him, call him and come unto him first. For man will never seek his God, if God do not seek him first.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105988:16"/>
For mans salvation must begin in Gods free love and preventing grace, whereby he seeks him, finds him, and finds him dead in sins and trespasses, and ready for to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. This is Gods preventing grace.</p>
                  <p>2. His enlarging mercy appears in that the Apostles must go not only to the Jew, but to the Gentile; and not only to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles of some few Nations, but of all; and seek to gather them into one body, and close them up into one fold. For formerly his special mercy was confined to a single Nation, the people of the Jews, the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Jacob,</hi> but now it must be extended to all Nations, and to all sorts of all Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No Nation in particular by name is excepted, excluded, or to be omitted and passed by. God for a long time inclosed the Jew, and by a partition wall severed him from all Nations in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion. His Oracles, his Covenant, the promise of Christ, the sanctifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and all the means of conversion were the priviledges of this people. But now Gods mercies will not be thus straitned and contained in such narrow bounds The partition wall must be broken down, and his saving grace will overflow these petty Banks, and like the Ocean compass the whole Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:105988:17"/>3. But for what end must this mercy thus enlarge, and why must they go unto all Nations of the Gentiles? They might have gone to denounce most fearful judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For what could Idolatrous Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, who had forsaken their God who made them, and every moment preserved them, expect but some fearful punishments to be executed upon them. Yet such was Gods mercy towards them that they were not sent to denounce judgement, but to proclaim an act of Eternal Indemnity and Pardon of all their many grievous sins, and promise, and that upon fairest terms, Eternal life. Therefore the benefit of this preventing grace and enlarging mercy, which did redound to all people of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was very great. They sate in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and the shadow of death under the power of Satan, ignorant, blind, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hardned, without any means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version or hope of salvation. But by the Apostles God sends unto them light, life, peace, joy, comfort; Heaven gates are opened, Eternal Life offered, and Christ is very willing and desirous to save us, and give us eternal bliss. O that men would consider how great a mercy it is for God to come so near unto us, and put us in a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105988:17"/>
capacity of salvation. 1. This benefit would appear to be the greater, if we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how unworthy we are. 2. The sad condition of others to whom God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vouchsafed the light of the Gospel: without this preventing grace Salvation is impossible to all; without this enlarging mercy impossible to many, especially to us who live at so great a distance in a corner of the World. But it hath been so enlarged that it reached us, God hath found us, Christ is come unto us; and the heavenly light of saving truth doth clearly shine upon us; So that if we perish, we are deeply guilty, and the cause of our own eternal misery.</p>
                  <p>4. If the benefit be so great, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to us that we have a great part and share in it; then our obligation to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness is very great. If we knew our own unworthiness, and our woful condition, the greatness of the benefit would more clearly appear, and stir us up to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Therefore lets consider these things more seriously and acknowledge the benefit with all humble thankfulness; use the means of grace vouchsafed unto us, and receive Christ upon those gracious terms he is offered unto us. Shall God
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105988:18"/>
come so near to us, and shall not we come near to him? Shall he seek us first, and we not seek him? this were a grievous sin; and the highest degree of ingratitude. I must needs tell you that to receive a message of eternal peace from heaven, and not acknowledge so great a mercy, to enjoy the means of conversion, and not use them, to have Christ offered and resist him, are the greatest sins, deserve the greatest punishments, make salvation impossible, and damnation unavoidable.</p>

much more; and the persons to whom they must go, the same they must teach. But for the better understanding of this Proposition, we must enquire.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What this teaching is.</item>
                     <item>2. What's the matter to be taught.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. Teaching is a communicating our knowledge to others, and this done by certain outward signs and expressions, which God hath appointed for that end. For he hath given us the gift of speech and writing to signifie our mind unto others. To teach in St. <hi>Mathew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> is to Preach, which seems to be somewhat more: But both imply, that they were endued with certain and sufficient knowledge of such things as they must make known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nations of the World; and as their knowledge was certain, so Christ had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the Spirit for to guide them infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in their teaching and preaching, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or writing. And there was a special reason why Christ should thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them: for their doctrine must be the rule of Faith and practise unto the whole Church, not only for a time, but till time shall be no more. But to teach in this place seems to be teaching with success, so as to cause the persons taught to learn;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105988:19"/>
that is, to receive their Doctrine, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, approve it, be convinced of the truth of it, and be converted by it so far as to be made Christians. Therefore some have thought fit to turn the place thus, <hi>Go and Disciple all Nations,</hi> and the Persian translator so understands it. For he makes this work to be a reducing of the whole World to the Religion and Faith of Jesus Christ. Its true, that their Doctrine had not this success with all persons to whom it was sent. For some opposed and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemed it, some heard it and neglected it; to some it was foolishness, to others very offensive and a scandal; but by vertue of the spirit it was to many the power of God unto Salvation. This is teaching which must be not only private but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; they must Preach. Preachers anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently were called amongst the Heathens <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Messengers from Heaven; and also publick Officers imployed by their Soveraigns to signifie their Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure unto their sujects. Their work was to go into all parts of their Dominions, and solemnly with a loud voice and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with sound of Trumpet to publish their Edicts, and let their subjects know their Princes mind. But it its very likely
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105988:19"/>
the Evangelists took the expression out of the Old Testament, and therein did allude to the Proclaiming of the year of Jubilee, as may appear from the Prophet. <hi>Esay</hi> 61. 1, 2. where the word is used. In respect of this act the Apostles might be truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated Messengers, Cryers, Publick Officers; yet sent from Heaven and not from Earth, From God and not from Men. They were eminent Officers of Christs kingdom. Their works was to Proclaim and publish his Laws, promise peace, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men to Repentance and Faith, and so make them Subjects unto their blessed Saviour and Redeemer. This teaching both for the matter and mannor was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, wonderful and plainly Divine, was accompanied with the blessed spirit, and wrought wonderfully upon the hearts of men, and had rare effects, and proved the mighty power of God unto Salvation. This will be more evident from the</p>
                  <p>2. Thing, which is the matter comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be taught; which according to St. <hi>Mark</hi> is in one word the Gospel, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Go ye unto all the World, and preach the Gospel unto every creature. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:105988:20"/>The matter therefore in general is the Gospel, in particular the Doctrine of Christ, Faith, Baptism, and Salvation of Unbelief and Damnation. According to <hi>Luke, Luke</hi> 16. 46, 47. its concerning Christs suffering, Resurrection, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Faith, Remission of sins. In this Evangelist its the Doctrine of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who made heaven and earth, and so loved sinful man, that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son for his salvation: concerning Jesus Christ who was incarnate, suffered, died, rose again for our Resurrection; concerning the Holy Ghost by the word converting us, making us capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and sanctifying us to Eternal Life.</p>

                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:105988:20"/>1. This is our Saviours Creed delivered in these words unto his Apostles, as the substance of the Doctrine which they must teach, and a form of Faith to be professed by all such as by Baptism are to be solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted into the number of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Not that he had not often and more at large taught the same, as we may read in his Sermons and conferences related by the Evangelists. I will instance in one passage of his discourse with <hi>Nicod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mus.</hi> The words are these,  3. 16. <hi>God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> This Text begins with God, and ends with everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, as many confessions do. And therein we may observe. 1. God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who created the World, loving sinful man. 2. His only begotten Son given to redeem us. 3. The Holy Ghost regenerating us and working Faith in us; that by faith we may escape eternal death, and attain eternal life. For this is the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine sense of these words; we read of many forms of faith and confession; some called Apostolical related by many of the Ancients, and of the Nicene, Ephesine, Constantinopolitan, Roman, Athanasian,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105988:21"/>
and others; yet this is before them all, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them all, the ground of them all, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately divine, delivered by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, recorded in holy Scipture; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no unwritten Tradition. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>Tertullian</hi> might well say that the Apostles had the rule of Faith from Christ, and Christ from God. For from whom he received his power, from him he received this Doctrine which he commands his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to teach, and all Nations to believe.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 3.</head>
                  <p>This is the ground of the ancient and Apostolical Creed delivered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to the Churches, which they planted, as by several of the first Primitive Writers we are informed. For they for matter and method agree with this, and in both are conformable unto it. The matter of them all is God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and the method is to begin with the Father, go on with the Son, and end with the Holy Ghost, though not in express terms, yet by consequence. By which it appears they took their rise from these words.</p>
                  <p>1. They begin with God the Father, and under this part bring in that first great work of Creation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:105988:21"/>2. They proceed to the Son the eternal word of the Father, who was made flesh and redeemed mankind, created righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy, and faln in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. They speak of the Holy Ghost, who as <hi>Tertullian</hi> expresseth it, is (<hi>Sanctificator fidei</hi>)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by whom Christ was conceived, the Prophets inspired, the Church comforted. Divers of them conclude with the final judgment wherein Christ shall render to all such as being sanctified by the spirit do believe, eternal rewards, &amp; to the devil and wicked men eternal punishments; where we must observe. 1. That creation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to all things: for God created heaven and earth, and all things therein. 2. Redemption reacheth only man, for Christ redeemed not the Angels, nor any other creature but sinful mankind. 3. Sanctification is confined to the Church and the Elect people of God. So that the Spirit sanctifies not all men but the Church; Christ reedeems man, but not all creatures; God the Father createth all things and all persons. The first part of the Creed concerning one God, is against all Atheists and Heathen Idolaters. The second concerning the Son Jesus Christ is against all Mahumetans and Unbelieving
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105988:22"/>
Jews. The third concerning the Holy Ghost is against all Pelagians, enimies of grace and counterfeit Christians.</p>
                  <p>And here it is to be noted that the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost was never so clearly and distinctly made manifest, as it was when the Father out of Love gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, and sent him into the World; and when the Son and eternal word was made flesh and redeemed man: and when the holy Ghost descended in the likeness of a Dove, and rested upon our Saviour Jesus Christ and came upon the Apostles and sanctified believers.</p>

                  <p>After it hath been manifested that in this Doctrine concerning God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. 1. We have Christs own Creed, and 2. That this was the ground of the ancient Apostolical Creeds and Confessions; it remains 3. that I say something of that which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Apostles Creed, which we find in <hi>Ruffinus</hi> with an Exposition, and which is used in the Catechisms and Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the Roman and reformed Churches. In this we may observe</p>
                  <p>1. That for the principal matter and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105988:22"/>
method its grounded upon our Saviours Creed, and exactly agrees with the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and primitive Confessions. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have three principal parts, the 1. Concerning God the Father and the work of Creation of the world; the 2. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God the Son, and the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of man; the 3. concerning God the Holy Ghost and sanctification of the Church and the Elect people of God. This appears by that brief contraction of it in our publick Catechism, which is a prime peice in this particular of antiquity; and gives great light how to understand the confession, and implies that it was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our Saviours Creed.</p>
                  <p>2. To understand this Creed the better, we must observe. 1. The object. 2. The act of man about this object. 1. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost considered.</p>

                  <p>2. As these things are the object of our Faith, and the (<hi>Credenda</hi>) so the act is to believe. To believe is 1. To be certainly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105988:24"/>
perswaded of the truth of these things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as revealed by God, and certainly known to be so. For the ground of a divine infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible faith, must be a divine Testimony known certainly to be divine. 2. To relie upon God thus represented and believed as able and promising eternal life unto sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man upon fairest terms. 3. To profess this our faith. God is the efficient cause by his Spirit of this faith; he is the object, his word is the rule.</p>
                  <p>3. This faith we Protestants do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, this faith they of <hi>Rome</hi> do profess; and both agree not only in the words, but for the most part in the sense of this Creed, as appears by the exposition thereof given in their <hi>Trent</hi> Catechism. This is not so to be understood as though there were no errours in that, except in these three particulars. For besides the many truths delivered in that part of the Catechism, there are several errours intermixt, though none of them so gross as these three.</p>

in Scripture or in the writings of purest Antiquity, are no ways necessary or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to Sanctification and Salvation; and are more like Fancies and Fables then any solid truth: yet we must be condemned as Innovators, Hereticks, Schismaticks, as having no hope of salvation till reconciled to their Church; and having no existence of a Church before <hi>Luther:</hi> this is their charity, but this is our comfort; God will be Judge, and they as well as we must be judged: and they cannot prove that by our publick Doctrine we have added any new Article to the Ancient, Catholick, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Faith; nor rejected any matter of doctrine or practice which is necessary or effectually conducing to salvation.</p>
                  <p>4. Though this form of confession be generally received amongst us; yet we find in it two additions not expressed in many former Creeds.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Is the descent of Christ into Hell.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:105988:25"/>1. We find it not in many of the ancien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and Apostolical forms of confession; not in the Nicene, or Ephesiene, or Constantinopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan Creed, nor yet in the Roman. Therefore <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in his exposition of this Creed, confesseth that this article of Christs descent into Hell is not found either in the Roman or Oriential Creeds. Besides, some inform us that it is not found in genuine Copies of <hi>Athanasius</hi> his form therefore some say, that it was brought in by a Synod held at <hi>Aquileia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. As for the sense, its much controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For some will have the words to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no more then that he was buryed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others, that Christ suffered in his soul the pains of Hell; others that he passed into the estate and place of the dead; others that in his soul he passed locally and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially into Hell to preach unto the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and souls there imprisoned. Thus <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in his exposition, thus <hi>Stromat. Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> thus the first Reformers wko in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> 6th. composed the Articles of Subscription; for which they out of <hi>Clemens Alexandr.</hi> alledged the Text, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18, 19. yet that explication was omitted in after-times, when the Articles were reduced to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105988:25"/>
humber of 39. as now they are without any addition to the words of the Creed; for the words of the Article are only these; <hi>As Christ dyed for us and was buryed, so also is it to be believed that he went down into hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second addition is concerning the holy Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints. For though there is no Creed but implies that there a number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who being called do believe, and are partakers of the benefits of Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, yet in many ancient forms we find no mention of these words. Yet the sense of them is plain, and the matter clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed in Scripture. The occasion of the inserting of them might be the Schism of the Donatists (or some others like them) who confined the Church to themselves at <hi>Cartenna</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> and like many in our days refused Communion with any other Christian but of their own party. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Article according to the Scriptures signifies that the Church since this commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in my Text was put in execution by the Apostles going into all Nations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing many unto Christ, became univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal. And these reduced are all of them Saints; and though they be many living at a distance without any interview or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105988:26"/>
converse civil one with another; yet they are but one Body, Society, Corporation under Christ their Head, and have spiritual communion one with another in the same Faith, Sacraments, and Spirit. This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst not only the Jew, but the Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Donatist, and also <hi>Rome</hi> it self as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the term Catholick to her own party, and engrossing the priviledges of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church, as though they did only belong to her, who is but a little part or particle of the same.</p>

                  <p>For God beholding himself and his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, and knowing that he could do many great and glorious things out of himself, and that nothing was impossible to him, did before the foundation of the world exercise 1.

of all things, in his Will decreeing, the certain and unmoveable foundation of the future existence. Thus all things being prepared before hand by the counsel of his will, when he thought good, he issues out of himself with his Almighty executive power, and begins to effect what he had thus contrived and decreed. And the works effected are two.</p>

The stuff and matter was nothing, the workmanship most curious, the work it self wonderful, the beauty was pure and glorious, and the order excellent and far above all expressions of the tongue of man. The principal and most noble creatures amongst all the rest were Men and Angels immortal, intellectual and free creatures, created holy and righteous and capable of Eternity felicity; when God fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished this great work and saw that all &amp; every thing that he had made was very
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105988:28"/>
good, he ceaseth from this work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and kept his Sabbath, which was a rest, not from all working, but only from this first; for he did not leave his creatures to themselves, but took care of all and every one, and continued to work though in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, and is working still. For saith Christ, <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>My Father worketh hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and I work.</hi> For he did exercise his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in preserving and ordering all things created.

For by him all things do subsist. If he either withhold his hand, or stretch out to destroy them, they perish and cease to be what they were.</p>
                  <p>2. Because all things were made in an excellent order, and had their ends for which they were created; therefore he doth not only preserve them, but directs every thing unto its end. The principal subject of this Ordination are Men and Angels and especially Men; and in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of men the principal work of all was Redemption, which God before the

world did decree, and in the beginning of the world upon the fall of man did promise, and in fulness of time issued out of himself by his eternal word made flesh to redeem man performed.

                           <item>2. The party redeeming was the word made flesh, anointed with the Holy Ghost, so that for his person he was the eternal word and Son of God: for his Natures
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105988:29"/>
nited in one person, and eternally distinct, which were his Godhead and his Manhood; for his Offices they are three, for he was made a Prophet, a Priest, a King, who as man was coceived by the Holy Ghost and born of the Virgin Mary. This was the way whereby the word was made flesh.</item>
                           <item>3. The work of Redemption, which was begun in his humiliation, and accomplished by his exaltation. For the Scriptures tell us that it was the will of God according to the contrivance of his wisdom, that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Son made flesh should so humble himself in this flesh assumed as to become a servant; and in that low estate be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto death, the death of the Cross; which he suffered with greatest patience in obedience to his heavenly Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for to expiate the sin of man. This he did as a Priest, sacrificing himself unto God the supreme Judge; and by this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering he so pleased God and was so much accepted, as that by his own blood he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the holy place of heaven, and obtained eternal Redemption, purged the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from dead works, and confirmed the new covenant for ever.

for the eternal salvation of man. That this Redemption might be complete, he that was humbled so low, was advanced as high, and the degrees of this advancement and exaltation were,

                  <p>When Christ was set at the right hand of God, and confirmed in his everlasting Priesthood, the Scriptures inform us that to make his sacrifice and death effectual, and communicate the blessings which he thereby had merited, he first sends down from heaven the holy Ghost. God from the beginning, and the first promise of a Redeemer, issued out of Eternity to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie sinful man; but when the great high Priest had offered his great sacrifice, and rose again, and was established in his Throne at his right hand, this spirit was poured out in great abundance upon all flesh, reveals the Gospel, makes it effectual upon the hearts of men, converts them, by faith, ingrafts them into Christ; upon his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105988:30"/>
intercession regenerates them, sanctifies, adopts them, raiseth them up at the last day, makes them fully holy, and fills them with eternal joy before the face and Throne of God for ever. All this is to be understood in the last word of this Creed (the Holy Ghost) who is thus represented to us in the Scriptures of God.</p>

                  <p>Yet here its to be observed. 1. That though Creation and Providence be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, and as it were appropriated unto the Father; yet the Father doth neither create, nor preserve, nor govern the world but by the Son &amp; by the Holy Ghost. 2. That though the work of Redemption be appropriated to the Son and the word made flesh, yet this work also was from the Father by the Son, and not without the Holy Ghost to whom the Conception and Incarnation of Christ is ascribed. 3. That though Sanctification and the eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of sinful man redeemed be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Spirit; yet this work also is from the Father and the Son both, doing this by the Spirit. The order of their working is evident, the distinct manner is hidden and more Mysterious.</p>
                  <p>4. The beginning of mans salvation is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105988:30"/>
from the love of the Father giving Christꝰ the progress is in the Son given and made flesh; the consummation is by the holy Ghost sanctifying man redeemed.</p>
                  <p>5. If man had not been created, he had never been; if he had been created and then faln and not been redeemed, he had been for ever miserable; if he had been redeemed and not sanctified, Redemption had been in vain to him, and his eternal ruine hand been unavoidable. This is the pith and marrow of the Scriptures, as they who read them with due consideration may understand; and the whole summe and substance of it is wonderfully abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, secretly couched, and methodically disposed in these few words, of (God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.)</p>

                  <p>To the exercise of his Wisdom we must refer such places as speak of his excellent and wonderful contriving and ordering all things within himself; to that concerning the acts of his will such as speak of his thoughts, purposes, decrees; and amongst these decrees those especially of Election and Reprobation; whereby he predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and ordered in himself according to his free-will, yet in justice and mercy, Men and Angels to their eternal estates: to that of the exercise of his power, such as speak of his mighty strength, according to which all things are possible unto him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impossible.</p>
                  <p>4. These began to be exercised first in Creation, to which refer all such places as speak of the first beginning and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these things in the first six days of the world, the order according to which, the end for which they were made, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

kinds of creatures, their variety, their nature, properties, and perfections, their unity whereby they make one body and systeme of the world consisting of two cheif places, Heaven and Earth with all their ornaments, and the hosts of them; such as speak of the attributes and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons manifested in this work of the good will and pleasure of God which moved God to make the world, of the power of God acquired unto himself thereby, of the subjection of all things created unto him and their dependance upon him; of the use men must make of the doctrine of this creation, which is to know God by the things made and to worship him. But we must take more notice of such places as speak of the creation, nature, qualities, place, function, imployment of Angels, and most especially such as inform us of the making of man, of his body, soul, and union of both, the sex, the image of God in him, his excellency and dominion over the creatures, the place prepared for his habitation and his imployment; of the creation of woman, the institution of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and all other things which did agree or belong unto men and Angels by vertue of their creation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:105988:32"/>5. To that Head of preservation we must reduce all such Scriptures as speak of Gods supporting, upholding, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and continuing all things created in their being; of the means which he useth to that end, and the ordinary and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, mediate and immediate ways he taketh in this work, how all things live, move and have their being in him, who is in all creatures, in all places, providing all things necessary for the continuance of their exsistence, of deliverance of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from destruction by preventing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or removing destructive causes. The places which speak of wasting, consuming, destroying man, beast, or any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either in some ordinary or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way; by powerful or by weak and inconsiderable causes, or by withdrawing his hand.</p>
                  <p>6. Under that Head of Ordination come such Scriptures as speak of the order wherein God created all things, their ends, and his disposing and directing every thing to his proper end, and all to the supreme and last; of the subordination of creatures and their several ends to which they tend; of the changing of this order by his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power and wisdom when and how he pleaseth.</p>

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:105988:33"/>7. In this respect the Sea doth not pass his bounds, the Stars and Lights of heaven observe their order in their motion, and do that service for which he made them; and all and every creature are at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and beck to effect what he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; and so subject all things are unto him, that when he pleaseth they must change their wonted order; the Sun must stand still, go back, deny his light, the fire must not burn, nor the waters come together, but must stand firm like a solid body. The Scriptures inform us that this part of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence extends to all things, the least, to the falling of a sparrow upon the ground, to the numbering of the very hairs of our heads. But chiefly to this Head must we refer such places as speak of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Men and Angels, of Laws, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Disobedience, Punishments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; of the obedience of the blessed Angels, and their Confirmation in a state of holiness and bliss, of the fall of the rest, and the wrath of God upon them, and their irrecoverable misery.</p>

                  <p>As for the effects and works of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, we must know that he with the Father and the Son is the universal cause of all things, for the Father and the Son doth all things by his Spirit; yet the Creed takes notice in this place only of those works and operations which tend to the eternal salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man</p>
                  <p>The first whereof is Vocation.</p>
                  <p>To this Head refer all Scriptures which speak of the condition of man to be called, as being blind, ignorant, senseless, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, guilty, not thinking of any danger, not desiring, not seeking any remedy yet redeemed, and by Redemption made save<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For Redemption found man in no capacity of salvation; vocation finds the foundation of his salvation laid. To this Topick also bring such places as speak of preventing grace, and the means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, of the Word, Sacraments, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, Ministery, of Information and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, Promises, Threatnings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,

Reproofs, Exhortation, good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, Afflictions, and many other things used by God in the vocation; the power of the spirit accompanying these means and working upon the heart; of the sight and sence of sin; of godly sorrow, fear, hope, prayers, tears, hearkning unto the word, receiving it into the heart, longing after Christ, some beginning of comfort, faith and conversion. To this place also reduce the Scriptures which speak of the contrary, as God passing by a people and denying them the means of conversion, of such as to whom the means is vouchsafed, yet they refuse to receive them, despise them, blaspheme, rebel, persecute Gods messengers, and seek the abolition of Gods Laws and Kingdom. Of such as seem to receive these means yet do not use them, or if they use them, yet not diligently and aright, but are like to the high way, the stony or the thorny ground. Such places as speak of impenitency, hardness of heart, unbelief, neglecting the day of Visitation, unfruitfulness under the means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Hypocrisie, Apostacy, all neglect or resistence of any motives unto repentance, deferring the time of conversion after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and falling off from any resolutions to repent, or any degree of grace.</p>

from all sin, temptation, sorrow, songs of praise, and the certainty and security of the continuance and perpetuity of full bliss. Here also must come in those parts of Gods word, which speak of the contrary; as of the resurrection of such as are designed to eternal death upon their final impenitency, of the immortality of their bodies, that they may eternally suffer in body and soul, their appearance before the dreadful Judge, their condemnation, their ejection out of Gods blessed presence into utter darkness and unquenchable fire, their society with the Devil and his Angels, their everlasting and intollerable sorrows and pains, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the continuance thereof without any hope of ease, intermission, deliverance.</p>

                  <p>After that I have first declared the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Scripture abridged in the Creed, and secondly given some directions how to reduce the principal particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the word of God unto the heads of the Creed: I now proceed to reduce the former particulars into the form of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in this manner.</p>
                  <p>I believe in God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who is only One,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105988:38"/>
Infinite, Incomprehensible, Eternal, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely and eternally Wise, Just, Holy, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, Glorious, and every way Perfect, and perfectly knows and loves himself from everlasting, and is blessed in himself unto all eternity.</p>
                  <p>I believe that this One Glorious God did by his wisdom contrive, and by his will decree to do many things out of himself; and when he thought good, he issued out with his Almighty Power to effect those things which he had before contrived; and first he created Heaven, and Earth, and all things therein; and the most glorious place which he made was the Heaven of heavens, and the most excellent creatures were Men and Angels, intellectual, immortal, free, capable of Laws, and of an eternal estate. Man for his body was created of the dust of the earth, and by the breath of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a living soul, and he was sanctified by the holy Spirit, endued with heavenly gifts and virtues, whereby he was righteous and holy, and like unto his God, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of eternal bliss; tho his present estate was not immutable, he might stand, he might fall. When this great work was finished by his Word &amp; Spirit, without any pre-existent stuff, any assistant, any tool or instrument,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105988:39"/>
he continued by his Almighty power to support and preserve all things, which do subsist by that word whereby they were created at the first. By creation he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested his eternal power and God-head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the absolute, surpreme, and universal Lord of all things, and so continues by his preservation.</p>
                  <p>I believe, that as he preserves all things created, so he orders all things, preserved in such a manner, as that a Sparrow falls not to the ground without his will: And as he created all things in an excellent order, and gave them their inclinations, &amp; power, moving and tending to some end; so he by his wonderful Wisdom directs every thing unto its several end, and all things to the supream, which is the manifestation of his glory. In this ordination, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his most noble creatures, Men and Angels, which he orders by certain Laws and Judgements, unto an eternal estate, as most excellent and wonderful; to both he gave certain laws, which they were able to observe; and upon the observation they might certainly expect a confirmation in that blessed estate, for which they were created; many of the Angels sinned, and were irrecoverably lost, and are delivered
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105988:39"/>
into chains of darkness, reserved for the judgment of the great day. Man recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Laws both moral and positive, by which he was bound to perform perfect and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual obedience, or else to suffer death: yet man being tempted by the Devil, fell; and by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death, and death passed over all men, in that all men have sinned: This was the just judgment of God, who cursed the Serpent and the Devil, punished man and woman, yet promised them a Saviour, the seed of the woman, who should break the Serpents head, and take away his kingdom and power over mankind. This was the judgment of the supream Lord, whereby many of the Angels continuing obedientin the day of their great trial were confirmed in an estate of holiness and bliss: the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state wretches were condemned to eternal death, and so fell as never to rise again; yet man had hope of recovery, because God by his infinite mercy was willing to prevent his eternal ruine.</p>
                  <p>I believe that God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him, should not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, but have everlasting life. This Son, who is our Redeemer, is that word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105988:40"/>
all things in Heaven and Earth, even the Principalities, Powers, Thrones, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Heaven were created, who is the brightness of his Fathers Glory, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Image of his Person. This word issued out of Eternity, and in fulness of time was made flesh, dwelt amongst men, who saw his glory as the glory of the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God full of Grace &amp; Truth: So that he is truly God, and truly Man, in whom conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> we have One Person, Two Natures, eternally distinct, and inseparably united. He was conceived at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> bornat <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> saved in <hi>Egypt</hi> from bloody <hi>Herod,</hi> and brought up in the place of his conception, and his very birth was matter of joy and melody to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven.

                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:105988:40"/>I believe that Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh, did humble himself very low, took upon him the form of a servant, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto death, the death of the Cross, and both in life and death did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest his Divine excellency, and glorifie his heavenly Father. In the day of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation he did hunger, thirst, fast, pray, weep, and took upon him the infirmities of man, yet without sin, and was mortal. His conversation was holy and spotless, and was so ordered, that both in life and death he was a Mirrour of all heavenly Virtues. His Doctrine whereby he revealed the Mysteries of Heavens Kingdom, was pure, and full of profoundest Wisdom, and of sovereign power to save mens souls; and his words such as never man spake, and were confirm'd by signs, and wonders, and glorious miracles, by which he declared himself to be the Son of the living God. He by himself, his Apostles, and other assistants whom he had chosen and qualified for this work, began to gather Disciples, and lay the foundation of his everlasting Kingdom; yet, notwithstanding these so many Divine excellencies, he suffers many indignities from his unworthy and ungrateful Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whom he loved above all other
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105988:41"/>
People in the world; though he was a Son, yet he learned obedience by the things he suffered. For many did not believe in him, many were offended with him. The ambitious, covetous, corrupt, hypocritical High-Priests, Rulers, Scribes, Pharisees, Sadduces being discovered unto the people, and by him reproved for their sins, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted by many of the people, did envy him, hate him, persecute him, revile him, blaspheme him, and designed his death, which they often and many ways attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and in the end prevailed.</p>
                  <p>In the last night of his mortal life on earth after the eating of the Passover, the institution of the Sacrament of his blessed body and blood, his consolatory speech un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Disciples, his heavenly prayer, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the fatal place and garden where his greatest sufferings began. Then upon his serious consideration and lively appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the bitter Cup he was to drink, and the fearful passion and tempattion now at hand, he falls into a grievous and extreme Agony, wherein with earnest prayers, tears, and loud cries he desires his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to spare him, and to let the Cup pass from him; yet so that he wholly resigns himself unto his will. He desires his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105988:41"/>
especially three of them to watch with him and to pray for an hour, yet they fail him; he falls upon the ground, depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the Cup three several times, sweats drops as it were of bloud, and at length an Angel was sent from heaven to comfort the Lords of Angels; so deeply was he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, so greatly was he afflicted so much was he difcomforted, while he prepares himself to encounter the powers of Hell and expiate the sin of man. This woful fit was no sooner passed over, but he is betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the hands of sinners, apprehended, bound, brought before the Council, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, condemned as a plasphemer worthy of death, and so the judg of Men and Angels was judged; he is hoodwink't, buffeted, blasphemed, spit upon, and most fearfully aboused, and being formerly betrayed by <hi>s,</hi> and now with cursing, swearing, and forswearing, denyed by S. <hi>Peter</hi> and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of all his Disciples. As for this he is brought before <hi>Pilate,</hi> falsly charged with heinous crimes, yet justified as having done nothing worthy of death. The Judge is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to condem him, willing to release him, scourgeth him, and at the importuniy of his bloudy enemies he at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dems him to the cruel, cursed, ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105988:42"/>
death of the Cross, and delivers him to the Souldiers, who deride him, abuse him, torment him, and lead him to the place of execution. There he is stripped, crucified, endures open shame, cruel pains, revilings, bitter taunts from the High-Priests, the People, the Malefactors crucified with him, and the Souldiers; yet he reviles not again, nor threatens, but in respect of wrong received he is silent and dumb as the sheep before the shearer, prays for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, provides for his disconsolate Mother, comforts such as do bewail him, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells their future misery. In the height of his passion he cries out, (such was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity) <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!</hi> commends his Spirit into his Fathers hands, and so dies. This suffering and death was such as never any before it, never any after it, like unto it. So much was signified at that time, when the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were darkned, the Earth did quake, the Rocks did rend, the Graves were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Veil of the Temple was rent in the midst from the top to the bottom to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that the great High-Priest having offered himself by the eternal Spirit without spot
was entring with his own Blood into the Holy Place of Heaven, to obtain eternal
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105988:42"/>
Redemption, and the expiation of mans sin for ever. The very frame of Heaven and Earth seem'd to be shaken in the time of this great suffering; men were astonished, women wept, many beat their breasts, the Centurion who had the charge of this exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was convinced that the party exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted was the Son of God. Our blessed Saviour suffered this death with unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd patience &amp; meekness, he laid down his life willingly in obedience to his heavenly Father, and out of love and a longing desire of sinful mans salvation: No man could take it from him till the hour was come, and he was willing to part with it, because he as a Priest, and general head and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative of mankind, offered his life unto his heavenly Father as supreme Judge, as a ransom for sinful man; therefore his death was the greatest Sacrifice, and the highest piece of service and obedience that ever was performed, and was so highly accepted of God, that it made him propitious, satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Justice, merited his favour to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, made his sin pardonable, and his salvation possible upon fairest terms, whil'st he was by his own blood entring the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of heaven, his side is pierced, and out of the same issue water and blood: His body is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105988:43"/>
taken from the Cross, decently interred in a new Sepulchre where never any man was laid before; his soul abides for a time separate, and under the power of death, and his humiliation did continue till the Resurrection, and by his burial he hallows the grave to all believers. By this Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation thus finished the foundation of our eternal salvation is laid, and a way prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and opened for a passage into heavens Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>I believe that Jesus Christ who was thus humbled, who suffered cruel pains, and was delivered to death for our transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was raised for our justification, and so to communicate the mercies merited by his death, converts us and procures the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remission of all the sins of such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe in him, and by his life saves such as he had reconciled by his death. He that did rise was the very same who died upon the Cross; and the same body and soul which were separated by Death, were united again by Resurrection; as man he was raised, as God he raised himself; he rose never to die again, but to live for evermore. The time was the third day, according to the predictions and prefigurations of old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the decree of God's eternal wisdom;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105988:43"/>
God did not suffer his Holy One to see cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The manner of this Resurrection was glorious; God then shook the Earth, sent from Heaven an Angel appearing in great glory, who terrified the Guard, rouls away the stone which closed up the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, and made way for Christs Disciples to come freely, and see that he was not there. The Graves were opened, divers of the Saints raised, and appear'd in the holy City; Death was conquered, and divers of his Captives rescued out of his hands. This his Resurrection was made manifest by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Angels, and of divers others who saw him, spake with him, and were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of it; he appears unto many, and that many times, and especially to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Apostles, who saw him, heard him, did eat and drink with him, touched him with their hands. To these he unfolds the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Kingdom, gives them commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to go into all Nations, and commands them to stay at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> till they received the Holy Ghost, according to the promise of his Father. God by thus raising him did manifest that he had accepted his Sufferings and Death as a full propitiation of the sins of men, and by saying, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> made him universal
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105988:44"/>
King and Priest, fully consecrated for ever. He rose as head and representative of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, especially of his Church, and became not only the pattern, but the first fruits and cause of our Resurrection; so that as in <hi>Adam</hi> dying all died, so in Him rising we shall all be made alive, first to newness of life, then to eternal glory. The same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that raised Christ from the dead, shall raise us from the death of sin unto newness of life, and raise our bodies to immortality; forty days he stays on Earth to comfort his Disciples, strengthen their Faith, make evident his Resurrection, and give orders for the administration of his future King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; then he ascends from Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> in a Cloud up into the Heaven of Heavens, Men and Angels being witnesses according to a former Vision, that one like the Son of man came with the Clouds of Heaven, and came unto the ancient of days, and that the Angels brought him peace before him. He ascended, that he might fulfill all things, send down the Holy Ghost, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy full joy in his Fathers presence, and pleasures at his right hand for ever; make intercession for his Saints, prepare eternal blessed mansions for them, raise up their thoughts and affections to that heavenly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105988:44"/>
estate he had merited and prepared for them, that where he is, our hearts might be also; and that he might receive a place at his Fathers right hand; so it was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied of old, that when the Son of man was brought before the ancient of days, there was given him Dominion and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all People, and Nations, and Languages should serve him, his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away, and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroy'd. For his Father said unto him, <hi>Sit at my right hand till I make thy foes thy footstool,</hi> and gave him a name above all names, and set him far above all Principalities and Powers, and Might and Dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come. He was solemnly invested with a supreme &amp; universal power above all men and Angels established in his Kingdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Oath in his everlasting Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, sent down the holy Ghost; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, the rod of his power, went out of <hi>Zion;</hi> he reigned in the midst of his enemies, and many thousands did willingly submit unto him, and his people for number were like drops of dew which fall from the womb of the morning. When all things are fulfilled,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105988:45"/>
all enemies subdued, the number of his Saints finished, he will come from Heaven to determine of the final estate of men and Angels, and judg both quick and dead; And then he will deliver up his Kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all.</p>
                  <p>I believe that the Holy Ghost, which is One God with the Father and the Son, and is the Spirit of the Father and the Son, by whom all things in Heaven and Earth are effected, was always in the Church to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the same, and prepare it for eternal Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when Christ was set at the right hand of God, came down upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in the likeness of fiery cloven Tongues, gave them power to speak in all Languages, enlightned them, gave them full and perfect knowledge of the Gospel, endued them with all gifts and power requisite for the laying of the foundation of the Christian Religion, the plantation of the Church in all Nations, and did direct them in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the Gospel, that both by word and writing, they might publish and declare it infallibly. By this doctrine, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the power of this Spirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to the hearts of men, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were called, converted, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and made up the body of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105988:45"/>
Church, which is the number of all believers in all Nations; a community of Saints Militant first on Earth, and then Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in Heaven. These are the best so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in the world, have the greatest privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, are the Children of God, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, the Temples of the Holy Ghost, the Candidates of Heaven, the Heroes of Eternal Glory, baptized by one Spirit into one body, and by Baptism ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Subjects of an everlasting Kingdom. Those, tho' dispersed through several parts of the world, and mixed with counterfeit Christians, and profane persons, are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, regenerated, reconciled, the adopted Sons of God, have a title unto eternal Life, the earnest of the Spirit, and the first fruits of glory; are guarded by Angels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God; enemies to Sin, Satan, and the World; tempted often; sometimes wounded and foiled, yet sin reigns not in them, and in the end they attain a full and final victory: They suffer Persecution, and bear the Cross with patience, deny themselves, are constant in the Covenant; nothing can separate them from the love of God; all things work together for their good; they increase in heavenly Virtues, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in good works, rejoyce in the hope
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105988:46"/>
of Glory, watch and pray, and with sighs and groans wait for the adoption, which is the redemption of the body. When they depart this world, they commend their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into their Fathers hands, who sends his Angels to receive them; they are with Christ, and secure of the resurrection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal bliss, rest from their labours, and their works follow them; when the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of these is finished, Christ will come down from Heaven in the Glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with all the holy Angels, and shall descend with a shout, with the voice of the Arch-Angel, and the Trump of God. Then all the dead shall rise, the living shall be changed, and made immortal; all shall be summoned, appear, be judged; the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous shall be justified for ever, receive the glorious reward of an everlasting Kingdom, be admitted into God's presence, behold his glory, be filled with eternal joy, and made fully, and for ever happy; such as know not God, or obeyed not the Gospel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unbelievers, and unrighteous, shall be sentenced to everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels, shall be cast out of God's presence, imprisoned in Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the worm never dieth, and the fire is never quenched, and shall there be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented

in soul and body continually, and of their extreme misery there shall be no end.</p>
                  <p>These things I believe to be most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, and as reveal'd from Heaven, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by many signs and wonders, and the rare effects of this Doctrine in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and consolation of many souls.</p>
                  <p>This Faith of my heart I profess with my mouth, and according to this belief and profession I rely for everlasting life upon God the Father, who loved me, and the Son, who gave himself for me, and the Holy Ghost, who sanctifies and comforts me.</p>

                  <p>After this enlargement, I return again unto the Proposition, <hi>That Christ comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Apostles to teach or disciple all Nations,</hi> and thence infer some practical conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a few words, and so conclude this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>1. If Apostles, and so all Ministers of the Gospel who take the charge of souls upon them, be subject to Christ's power, and bound by this command, then it is their duty to teach, to teach this Doctrine, to teach all this Doctrine; they must teach
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105988:47"/>
this, and none other, because it is the only converting, saving, comforting truth; if they teach other, it will be either unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or, which is worse, pernicious; though they teach this, and yet conceal some part thereof, and declare not the whole counsel of God, though it may be good so far as they make use of it, yet it will be insufficient, and never reach the end for which it was revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for it's the Gospel, the whole Gospel, that is the power of God unto Salvation; yet it must not be taught confusedly, but as it was delivered by our Saviour in a certain and exact method, so it must in the same manner be dispensed by the Man of God, who must not only be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous, that his Doctrine may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, but also methodical, that it may be remembred: therefore if we will manifest our love to Christ, be faithful to our trust, pity poor Souls, redeeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>2. If this be our duty, then the people whom we teach are bound to receive this, all this Doctrine, and thus as it is taught: and if ever they will be converted unto God, comforted by the Spirit, attain unto eternal life, and not be adjudged to eternal Fire, for Ignorance, or Disobedience to the Gospel, let them hear this Doctrine attentively, learn the whole counsel of God, lay it up in their hearts, remember it, obey it, and make it the joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of their hearts, and the subject of their constant Meditations; let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all other Doctrine which shall not be agreeable to this our Saviour's Creed.</p>

commanded the Apostles to <hi>Baptize all Nations</hi> taught and discipled.

And because there be many and several kinds of Rites which have their several ends, and the end of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and these Mysteries is distinct and different from the end of other Rites; therefore in strict sense a Sacrament is a Rite instituted of God to confirm his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, where we have</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>1. The general nature is, that it's a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Rite; there are Civil and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rites, and both are used as additions to some other things or actions, to which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105988:49"/>
they are accidental, and no ways essential; and they usually signifie something to the understanding, besides that which they represent to the senses. The reason why they are added is, the greater solemnity. Thus the Sacraments are Religious Rites added to the Covenant of Grace, and in themselves are some outward things and actions which represent some things and actions which are Sacred and Divine. And this signification is not Natural, but from Institution; in this respect they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally make two material parts of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, 1. An outward sensible sign. 2. An inward hidden spiritual thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. So that the things and actions which are Rites, are to be considered, 1. In themselves. 2. In their significative nature as signs. These Sacramental Rites are annexed to the Covenant, that it may be made and renewed with the greater so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. Thus Circumcision is said to be a sign added to the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, and in these cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial religious signs we usually have things, actions, words, which usually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of the hidden mystical part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:105988:50"/>2. The efficient cause of these Rites to be observed by all Christians, is God, who by his Son Jesus Christ hath not only spoken unto us, and revealed the Gospel, but also instituted these Sacraments. There are Rites invented by Men, and also by Devils, and some of them are abominable; and from the multiplication of these in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Divine Service, spring so many Superstitions, when such things as God never appointed, or required at our hands, are conceited to be holy, or necessary, or of a sanctifying power; therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us all to consider what Rites are of Divine Institution, whether they be Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Old or New Testament; for God instituted Rites of old, as well as in these latter times of the Gospel. 2. What Rites instituted by him are now in force so as that we are bound to the observation of them. By reason of Divine Institution and Command they are positive Laws of God, which do not bind by reason of the matter of them, which is indifferent, but of God's Command, from whose Institution, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and Command, but not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they conduce to our sanctification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:105988:50"/>3. The end of a Sacrament is to confirm the Covenant in Christ, made between God and man. This presupposeth, 1. The death and redemption by Christ as the foundation of the Covenant; for if there be no Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, there is no promise of life unto sinful man. 2. A Covenant; and this Covenant presupposeth a Law wherein God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands man to repent, and believe in Christ; and upon this Repentance and Faith promiseth remission of sin, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happiness. And because God will deal with Man as with a rational free Creature, he proposeth the conditions required in his Law, and expects his assent and voluntary obligation of himself. 3. When a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth his consent, and promiseth freely unto God that he will believe and repent, then this Covenant is made. The Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by Christ, the Covenant in it self, and the making of the Covenant, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed, the Sacrament is added, that by it the Covenant may be solemnly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed both on God's part and Mans, as though they put to it their hands and seals, and so mutually engage themselves one unto another. Thus Circumcision, which was a Sacrament, is said to be <hi>not</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:105988:51"/>
                     <hi>only a Sign, but a Seal,</hi> because as a Seal is put to an Indenture, or other Evidences, and particularly to Leagues, to confirm them, so a Sacrament is added to this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for confirmation, so that neither part can draw back, or neglect to perform, except they will go against their own act and deed, and solemn engagement. This confirmation doth limit the general nature of Sacraments as they are Ceremonies, and differenceth them from all other Rites, which were but Signs or Types, and not instituted to this end.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 2.</head>
                  <p>Thus you have heard what a Sacrament is: The second thing affirmed is, that it is a Sacrament of the New Testament or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. This doth difference Baptism from all the Sacraments used by man, &amp; institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God before Christ's Incarnation; for there were extraordinary Sacraments of old, as Baptism under the Cloud, and in the <hi>Red-Sea, Manna,</hi> and water out of the Rock; there were ordinary Rites, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and the Passover; yet these might be said to be Sacraments of the Old Testament, which differ in many things
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105988:51"/>
from these of the New, and that not only in the signs and circumstance of time, but chiefly in this, that the former Sacraments did presuppose Christ to come, and faith in him as not yet exhibited, but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the New Testament look at Christ as already come, having shed his blood, and finished the work of Redemption, and require <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith in him under that notion, and in that respect. As it differs from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by this, that it's a Sacrament of the New Testament, so in this particular it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Eucharist; so that from hence we may describe a Sacrament of the New Testament to be a Rite instituted by Christ to confirm the Covenant of Grace in the blood of Christ already shed, wherein we may observe, 1. The blood of Christ shed. 2. A Covenant confirmed in and by this blood of Christ, and Sacrifice already offered. 3. A confirmation of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made between God and particular persons by these holy Rites.</p>

                  <p>Baptism, as it is 1. a Sacrament. 2. a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the New Testament; so 3. it is the initiating Sacrament of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105988:52"/>
For there are but two Sacraments of the Gospel instituted by Christ, and this is the first in order, and first to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred; it presupposeth the party to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized as an Alien, and not yet solemnly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church and Kingdom of God, though he may be prepared for this admission and incorporation. In respect of this initiation it differs from the Eucharist, which cannot lawfully be administred to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but such as are members of the Church, and incorporated already: For as under the Law no stranger might be admitted to the Passover, so under the Gospel no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized person may come unto the Lords Table. This is the reason why this Rite is called the Laver of Regeneration, the Sacrament of our New Birth, and of our ingrafting into Christ: And as we are but once born, so we are but once baptized; for this Sacrament once rightly administred is not to be reiterated, whereas the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, being a Sacrament of our spiritual nourishment and growth, is often to be celebrated.</p>

                  <p>Thus you have heard that Baptism is an initiating Sacrament of the New Testament; it remains that I inform you of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Rite of Initiation, which is by washing with water, <hi>In the Name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</hi> For this is the instruction and command of our Saviour in this Commission in these words, <hi>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> where we have three things to be considered.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Water, the Element.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>1. Water in it self is a natural substance, and a liquid Element, granted unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as a special blessing, and to be used according to several virtues thereof for several ends; one end is washing and cleansing bodies, and other things that are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ullied or defiled; and this according to the purging and cleansing virtue thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Water, according to this natural vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, was singled out by a Divine Institution and determination for an higher end; and that is to signifie and confirm a spiritual
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105988:53"/>
cleansing: And though some make this in Baptism to be a sign of Christ's blood, which hath a power to cleanse and purge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science from dead works to serve the living God, yet in this Sacrament it rather signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Holy Ghost, which sanctifies and regenerates the Church. Therefore our Saviour saith, <hi>.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Verily, verily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born of the Spirit and Water, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> In this respect Baptism is said to be the <hi>Laver of Regeneration,</hi> by the renewing of the Holy Ghost, which God shed on us abundantly, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 6. In both which places the Spirit is assimilated to Water, as washing, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, renewing; yet here it's to be noted, that the Spirit doth not renew and cleanse us, but by virtue of Christ's blood, which merited the renovation and purification of the soul. For if Christ's blood had not been shed, the Spirit had never been given to sanctifie us.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 5.</head>
                  <p>The action is Washing, expressed in this word [<hi>Baptize</hi>] which word, as you heard before, signifies to wash, and that often washing is the use and application of this
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105988:53"/>
Elemement for to cleanse, which may be done many ways, as by plunging the thing to be washed into the water wholly, or by dipping, or by pouring water upon it; and sometimes by sprinkling; for many things under the Law were cleansed by sprinkling of water or blood. This action for this end implies the party to be baptized as pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with sin, and so unfit to have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and to be admitted into his heavenly Kingdom. Therefore he must be renewed, purified, and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that by the Holy Ghost ingrafting him into Christ, and planting him into the similitude of Christs death and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thence we have two parts of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. 1. Remission, 2. Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; in sanctification a death unto sin, and a life unto righteousness. In some kind of washing, the death and Resurrection of Christ, and also a death unto sin, and a life unto righteousness, were more clearly represented; yet there is hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of washing but doth in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure resemble these things. But we must not in this Sacrament stand upon the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or imperfect representation of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual part thereof. The principal thing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible &amp; sensible is washing &amp; cleansing; the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105988:54"/>
principal thing signified is the sanctification and purging of the soul and conscience.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 6.</head>
                  <p>The words are, <hi>In the name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> Where we must observe, 1. That to be baptized in the name, into the name, unto the name of the Father, &amp; of the Son, &amp; of the Holy Ghost, are the same. 2. That as the name of Christ, and Christ, are often the same, so the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 3. That though Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost are three, and some ways distinct, yet they are but one and the same God. 4. That the Baptism in this name presupposeth the party to be baptized, to have professed his faith in, and his obedience unto the name of God the Father, and the Son, and Holy Ghost, that his sins may be forgiven, and that he may attain eternal life according to the promise of the Covenant on Gods part; so that the Covenant is actually made between God and the party to be baptized. These things premised, the meaning is, that in the name and person of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize thee in this water, and by this solemn rite admit thee to be one of Gods people, &amp;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105988:54"/>
a subject of his blessed Kingdom of grace, to enjoy all the priviledges thereof, and assure thee of the performance of the promises of the Covenant according to the profession and promise thou hast made; and by this same rite solemnly bind thee to make good the profession, and perform the vows which thou hast made unto God the Father who hath made thee, and God the Son who hath redeemed thee, and God the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost who sanctifieth thee; so that the Covenant of grace which was made effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and immutual by the death and blood of Christ, being first made between God and the party to be baptized, the proper effect of this rite of Baptism is a solemn confirmation of this Covenant in respect of both parties. This confirmation being finished, both the parties are more strictly and highly bound to performance; God to make good his promises, man to make goods his vows: For God is bound not only by his promise in general, but by this rite to the person baptized in particular. And man is bound not only in general, but by name; not only by the command of God and his own vow, but also by receiving of this solemn rite and being baptized. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this obligation follows a more particular
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105988:55"/>
and certain right unto the mercies merited by Christ, and promised in the Covenant, and a nearer relation unto, and a more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial interest in that God who made him, &amp; loved him, and redeemed him by Christ, and sanctifies him by the Spirit; yet the actual enjoyment of these mercies depends upon the performance of the conditions to which man is bound; yet because this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance depends upon the sanctifying power of the Spirit, therefore God in his infinite mercy gives the Spirit to the party baptized, that so the Covenant should not be in vain. For God nulling the Covenant of works which had no promise of grace, and making a Covenant of free-grace as a Father, a Redeemer, and Sanctifier, and promising, and really intending to save man, must needs by vertue of this promise give him the Spirit, which is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation, and also merited by Christ for such as believe in Christ, to abid? in them, and enable them to perform all duties necessary to Salvation. This is the reason why Baptism and the Spirit are s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> often joyned together; yet the giving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> this Spirit is not absolutely tyed and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the very time of Baptism, but is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven sometimes after, and sometimes before
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105988:55"/>
and sometimes in or at the time of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. This Covenant is made by way of stipulation and restipulation; and when the answer of a good conscience is made, the Spirit may be received the more speedily. By all this we may easily understand how willing God is to strengthen our weakness and confirm our hope; and how deeply we that are baptized are bound and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to our God, and to him alone, so as to renounce all other confidences, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon him as a Father loving us, and his Son redeeming us, and the Holy Ghost san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying us. And here its to be remembred that those supernatural effects which in the Scripture are given to Baptism, are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and principally to be ascribed to the love of the Father, the merit of Christ, and the power of the Spirit; as by this Sacrament we subject our selves unto God alone as our Supreme Lord, so we renounce the Devil, all other false Gods; profess our selves Christians, and separate from all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions. For Baptism is one of the bonds which ties the members of the Church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one body; a badge of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and character whereby we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguished from all Idolaters, Mahumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and unbelieving Jews.</p>

                  <p>Thus we understand what Baptism is, the next thing to be inquired into, is, who may lawfully by this commission administer this Sacrament; The Text doth plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the person: For he that must teach, the same must baptize. It's true that this power as universal and extending to the Gentiles, was given immediately unto the Apostles; yet unto them as first dispensing the word; yet because the word was to be dispensed and preached, not only by them, but also by their successours unto the worlds end; therefore the ordinary pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The third and last thing to be examined, is, who are subjects capable of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and have a right unto Baptism by the rules of divine institution; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Text they are such as are taught and made Disciples; for neither the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles nor their successours have any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from Christ to baptize any but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples: for here it's said, <hi>Go and teach or disciple all Nations, baptizing them;</hi> that is, these who are discipled. For we must know that the Apostles were sent not to gather Churches out of Churches, and to find the Nations made Christians to their hand, but to call men out of darkness into light, and perswade men unbelievers to believe that of no Christians they might be made Christians. They must not first bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105988:57"/>
and then teach, but first teach and then baptize, and so prepare them for Baptism; yet to be taught was not sufficient; they must learn, understand, profess their faith in God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, promise to obey Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and desire by Baptism to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church; yet a <hi>Simon Magus</hi> may do all this, and so obtain Baptism, and <hi>Phillip</hi> was bound to receive him; for God doth not bind the Minister of the Gospel to try the hearts and reins of any man, for that he could not do; but he must perswade them in the name of Christ to profess and promise sincerely from their hearts; yet if they do not this, and it appear to him to do it, so that he knows nothing to the contrary, he not only may, but must bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize such if they desire it; yet Baptism is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle advantage unto such; for though they may be admitted and received into the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church; yet they are not members of Christ, nor heirs of Gods Kingdom; but such as come with an upright heart, and make the answer of a good conscience, &amp; inwardly believe with their souls as they profess with their lips, may certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Spirit of Regeneration and the benefits promised in the Covenant.</p>

                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:105988:57"/>But in all this discourse upon this part of the Text, I may seem to exclude Infants from Baptism; and this place is alledged by divers against their admission; yet nothing in the Text, nor any thing in my Discourse doth debar them from this Sacrament. For the Apostles were sent to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel both to the unbelieving Jew, and also to the Gentiles, neither of these, much less their Children, were inclosed in the pale of the Christian Church as believing in Christ already come; and not only the Gentile, but the proselyte and native Jew must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and profess their faith before they were baptized; and this is evident out of the history of the new Testament: And can any man infer from hence, that because those who were adult, and at age, &amp; out of the Church, might not be baptized before they were taught, and confessed the faith: therefore the Infants of Christian parents, who are actual members of the Church, may not be baptized? Its evident, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel is not good: Some doubt might be made of Infants born of Parents before they were made Christians; and yet we find no question made of them in the Scriptures. But of such as are born in the Church, &amp; of Christian parents, after they were Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105988:58"/>
there is less doubt; for these are part of their parents; not only as their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents by nature, but as Christians; and were always so accounted, as born under the Covenant, and in their parents bound to the condition thereof: and so far as they were bound, so far they had right to the priviledges and promises which might be sealed unto them. God did not require any profession or promise personal from them, because they had not the use of reason: and all the duty for the present lay upon the parents and the Church, till the Infant came to age, and was capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; for then being taught, they were bound in their own persons to make their confession, and vow, and so own their Baptism; and this was the end of Confirmation, which is an act performed by the Bishop with imposition of hands, &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain words, according to a certain form pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the ritual part of our Liturgy. The covenant of Righteousness by Faith was sealed to infants by circumcision from the times of <hi>Abraham,</hi> untill this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was granted by Jesus Christ, who neither by himself, nor his Apostles except them or exclude them: but of this see more in my <hi>Theopolitica, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 15.

                  <p>THE fourth proposition is, Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Apostles to teach all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons baptized to observe whatsoever Christ commands them.</p>

                     </gap>zed must not only profess their faith, but promise obedience to Christs commands. In the words we may observe a two-fold duty. 1. Of the people, which was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Christs commandments. 2. Of the Minister, who must teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to observe these commandments. In the first we have</p>

                     <item>1. Christs laws and precepts.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>1. Laws are moral acts of a superiour power, which bind the parties subject to obedience, or upon disobedience to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty. The sovereign and universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerch is God, who by creation, preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and redemption hath a total and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power over man, and especially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his piritual capacity as he is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105988:59"/>
ordinable to an eternal estate: After Christ was risen from the dead, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates a transcendent power unto him, especially as redeemer of man: therefore as Christ had received this glorious power, so he did exercise the same by making laws, and binding all the subjects of his spiritual and eternal kingdom to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the same. For these laws are not only a rule to direct them what to do, but of a binding force; and the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is so strict, that whosoever shall refuse to obey, shall be liable to eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for those Laws being written in the Scripture, are far more excellent then any humane decrees and statutes; not only because they are the Laws of God, and the other of men, but also because they are made in exact wisdom, are most fitted for man, so as to direct all acts and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of soul and body, bind the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and immortal soul, promise eternal rewards, and threaten eternal punishments, and aree very way so perfect, that upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience eternal peace and happiness will certainly follow. The ignorance of these things, and want of consideration, is the cause why these laws are so little regarded, so much neglected, and disobeyed, though
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105988:59"/>
they shall be the rule, according to which Christ shall judge the world, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of mens final and eternal estate.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 2.</head>
                  <p>There are divers laws therefore of Christ as is here implyed, and the same published, not only by word, but writing, and that long ago: and if so, it's the duty of all, to whom these laws are made known, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of persons baptized, to obey these; and because this duty concerns us all, and that very much, therefore I will, first, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of the duty more particularly, that you may know what it is; and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, stir you up unto performance by certain reasons, and motives. This obedience doth presuppose our submission unto Christ, as our superiour Lord, upon our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his power; and this is the condition of admission into his kingdom, and is the foundation of all obedience: for we may do many things which another wills us to do, and yet the doing of them is no obedience, because he hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over us, neither do we acknowledg him as our superiour.</p>
                  <p>2. As it presupposeth submission to his legal power, so it doth the promulgation of his Laws; for where there is no law,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105988:60"/>
as there can be no sin, so there can be no obedience.</p>
                  <p>3. These Laws must be known to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can observe them; for the laws of Christ, as in our understanding, and known by us, are the immediate rule of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet when they are sufficiently pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, it may be our own fault to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them, as through our own negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence it may so come to pass.</p>
                  <p>4. This obedience is properly an act of the will of man, freely conforming to the will of Christ, and is required in the first Commandment.</p>
                  <p>5. The matter of this obedience is the law and command of God; the proper and formal object is Christ as our supreme Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.</p>
                  <p>6. When the will of Christ is once made known unto us, our liberty is so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, nay altogether taken away in those things that are commanded, and we must have no will of our own, but his will must be ours. These things observed, we must know, 1. That this obedience must be yeilded out of love unto our Sovereign, yet with humble reverence to his Majesty, and joyned with a fear to offend him; and the more we love him, the more willingly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105988:60"/>
and freely we shall obey, and it will be our joy and delight to do his Commandments. 2. This obedience must be universal; we must do whatsoever our Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us; for though there may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of things commanded; yet there is the same reason why we should obey one as well as another, the least as well as the greatest, and that is the will and command of our Saviour. In this respect it's said, that he that offends in one, offends in all, because of the contempt of the will of the Lawgiver; we must not pick and chuse to do what we please, obey some, and disobey other commands; we must not expect from Christ any liberty, indulgence, tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, dispensation to transgress any of the least of Gods Laws. 3. It must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and continued to the end; for there are no days nor hours of intermission; we must always be doing, and we must not rest till we have finished our work, &amp; that will not be till this mortal life is ended: we must serve our God day and night whilst we have any being. And as God did not rest till he finished his work of Creation, so we must not expect our Sabbath till we have finished the work of our Salvation; our obedience must be one line drawn out
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105988:61"/>
and continued from the first moment of our conversion, to the last day of our disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. 4. As we must be constant, so we must be diligent, zealous, active, watchful. God loves not lazie servants, and the work is great and difficult, and we meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies, much opposition, and must wrestle with many difficulties, which are the greater, because of the Devil and the World without, and the Relicks of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within us. Therefore our Christian life is a race, and a continual warfare; therefore we must not only put on the complete armour of God, but we must strive, and fight, and put forth all our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and never think of rest till we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a final and ful victory: And though we cannot reach, yet we must aim at the perfection of Angels, according to that prayer, <hi>Thy will be done on Earth, as it is done in Heaven;</hi> that is, by those immortal blessed spirits, who never sinned, but do his Commandments, hearkning to the voice of his word. 5. Yet we must know that of our selves we are frail, weak, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ we can do nothing, and can do all things through Christ who strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth us. Christ must give us his Spirit and strengthen us within, and by this Spirit
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105988:61"/>
support us and assist us without. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must continually pray, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promise he would put his Laws in our inward parts, and write them in our hearts; and to do this more and more according to his promise, we must not presume upon our strength, but always humbly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> depend upon him who worketh both the will and deed of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. If he but a little desert us, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his hand, how suddenly may <hi>David</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> fall and sin grievously? 6. Yet though we may transgress, and sometimes fall grievously, yet we must not despair nor be secure, but presently renew our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, return unto God, &amp; muster up all our power, and fight, and work, and strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and this with the greater force and power. And this is our comfort, we are not under the Law of Works, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth perfect &amp; perpetual obedience, or else threatneth certain and unavoidable death and destruction; but under Grace, which ministreth power, and when we fall, upon our repentance promiseth pardon &amp; life; ane Christ will plead our Cause, &amp; procure our Peace. From all this it doth appear that baptized Christians must not be <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105988:62"/>
we must be loyal and obedient, and not live like base earthly worldlings, but like Citizens of Heaven, for upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition we are admitted Subjects of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom. Thus we understand that our duty is to submit to Christ our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, know his Laws, remember them, observe them all out of Faith, Love, Fear, with all our hearts, carefully, constantly, depending always upon our Saviour, and renewing our repentance daily. For this obedience must be universal, perpetual, sincere, free, and we must obey not only in doing good, but suffering evil, if we be put unto it.</p>

                  <p>By this time we know what our duty is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now follows the reasons why we should perform it; And lest any man should be discourag'd with the difficulty of the work, or think it: impossible, I must first prove that it may be done. It was a famous que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of old, <hi>Whether it be possible by Grace to observe and fulfil all the Commandment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of God?</hi> And it hath been determined in the affirmative, that by Grace it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; for what cannot Grace do? <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I can do all things.</hi> A Christian hath a kind of Omnipotency in things necessary
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105988:62"/>
to Salvation, and may truly say, <hi>That these things which are impossible with men, are possible with God; and if God be for us, who can be against us?</hi> It's true, that to deny our selves, to subdue our native and deeply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooted corruptions, and our sins confirm'd by custom, to bear the heavy burthen of the Cross, and suffer reproaches and bitter afflictions and persecutions for Christ's sake; to forsake all, and hate Father, Mother, dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est relations, and life it self, to offer an <hi>Isaac,</hi> to rejoyce in the midst of fiery trials, are very difficult things, and far above the power of nature, and so indeed they are. Yet there is a divine power in Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all this may be done, and hath been through the assistance of Christ: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let none of us despair, but let us be assured, that whil'st Christ sits at the right hand of God, and his holy Spirit abideth in the Church, we shall be enabled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Mountains, subdue Sin, and conquer Satan, the great enemy of our Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ did never intend to bind us to impossibilities; what we cannot do of our selves, he will enable us to do; neither did he ever require that we should observe whatsoever he hath commanded us by our own strength; but as he hath merited Grace
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105988:63"/>
and Power for us by his Death, so he will give it us by his Resurrection; and then such things as are grievous to flesh and blood, shall be sweet and delightsom to sanctified souls. This being possible, let us consider the reasons.</p>
                  <p>1. We not only by God's command, but also by our promise so solemnly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Baptism, are bound to observe these commandments: A loyal Subject will obey his Sovereigns command, and will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity; and an honest man will be as good as his word and promise made unto man; and shall not we obey our Saviour's Laws, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and confirmed with his own blood? shall we promise, and promise unto him, and not perform? shall we not only be disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, but perfidious too, and violate ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> sacred bonds? This will make our sins most heinous, and our punishment most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. O therefore let us remember our Baptism, and solemn Vows, and prove faithful unto God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, and do his Commandments, and never suffer our Baptism to be brought as a witness against us in the great day of our final Trial and Account.</p>
                  <p>2. Let us consider the nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105988:63"/>
of these Commandments, for there are no penal Statutes imposed by an arbitrary Power, intending to oppress us and undo us. There is no injustice can be charged upon them; they are no ways defective, but perfect every way, in respect of the end for which they were given; they are holy, just, and good, Laws of Equity, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and given out of dearest love, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to Heaven and everlasting happiness, and in keeping them there is great content: Nothing is so grievous to Gods Saints as to transgress them, and to keep them is the joy and delight of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>3. The reward which Christ doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is excellent, and far greater than man could expect or hope for; rich prizes, high preferments, glorious rewards, work strangely upon the hearts of mortal men, and cause them to venture life and limb, and many times Soul and all; yet if any man could gain the Kingdom of the World, and all the Glory thereof, yet this is nothing to the reward of this obedience; the least work of obedience shall be rewarded, a cup of cold water shall not be forgotten; and this reward is certain, most certain, as depending upon the promise of an Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lord, who can do what he will, and will
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105988:64"/>
do what he hath promised: and the time will not be long before it shall be rendred and received; <hi>For he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry;</hi> and it shall be eternal; and eternally enjoyed; and let all those who are obedient rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is their reward in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>4. Yet if reward should not move us so much, yet love should even constrain us, and we should have no power to resist it. Christ loved us, and gave himself for us, and greater love, greater gifts there cannot be. Therefore let us consider whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments these are, which we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve. Are they not the commands of Christ our dearest Saviour, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us with his precious blood, is the propitiation for our sins, and pleads his blood for us in Heaven? and shall he love us so much, and shall not we love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? O let us love him, love him so much as nothing more; and if we love him, we will keep his Commandments; and the more we love him, the more obedient we shall be, to the laying down of our live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

so solemnly engaged our selves by our Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism to this obedience, the Laws are so just, and tending effectually to our eternal good: the reward which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised is so glorious, and it is our Saviour who loved us so much who commands us; therefore let us be obedient in all things to the end, and let this be our great business.</p>

                  <p>The second part of the Proposition is concerning the Ministers duty, which is to <hi>teach the persons baptized</hi> to do whatsoever Christ hath commanded them. In this we must consider,</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>First, The persons teaching are first the Apostles, and after them their successors, whose duty is not only to disciple the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and baptize them, but also to inform them of the Laws of Christ; for they must not only begin the work of Grace, but must go on and finish: they must not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay the foundation, but build on, and consummate the work. The business of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105988:65"/>
Pastors and Teachers is not only to bring men to the amity of Faith, but to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Seconly, The persons to be taught, are such as having professed their Faith, and premised obedience, were baptized already, and so admitted into the Church. The former teaching respected them as out of the Church, and tended to prepare them for Baptism and Admission. This latter considers them as in the Church, and tends to the further edification. The end of the former was regeneration and conversion; and the end of the latter is spiritual nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confirmation. For the subject of this teaching are such as as had promised, but as yet not performed obedience; such as were but babes and children, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition required a tender and continual care in their teachers. And though they know some of the Commandments by a general and imperfect knowledge, yet they had not so clear and distinct knowledge of many of them in particular, and did need not only instruction, but exhortation.</p>
                  <p>3. Therefore this teaching was not a bare instruction for to inform their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but also exhortation to stir them up diligently, constantly, and zealously to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105988:65"/>
the Commandments made known unto them: and besides, with exhortation sometimes must be some admonition and reproof, with directions in particular cases. First, knowledge was necessary; for how can they obey, when they know not the particular commands to be obey'd? and to what purpose is knowledge, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so clear and distinct, if they do them not? When our Saviour had given his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles a commandment, and improved it by his own example, he adds, <hi>If you know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them, </hi> 13. 17. So that it's plain, that the end of this teaching is the doing and observation of Christ's Commandments; and therefore as they must represent them clearly to their understanding, so they must press the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience upon the strongest motives, and let them know, that though their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge should be sufficient, and they should have perfect directions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet without the continual supply of God's Grace they will not be able to perform any thing; and from all this we may observe, that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and knowledge will not be sufficient to Salvation. This is the reason why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles do labour so much, not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Disciples and Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rts, but also
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105988:66"/>
exhort them to obedience: profession and practice must go hand in hand, and never part assunder: profession and knowledge without obedience is but hypocrisie, an outward form and shadow of Christianity without the soul and power; but where obedience accompanies profession, it will be an evidence of the sincerity of their Faith, and of their happy condition, that they are passed from death to life.</p>
                  <p>4. The principal thing in this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the matter of this teaching, and that is the observation of all Christ's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The matter of the former Doctrine was, <hi>Truths to be believed and professed;</hi> the matter of this latter is, <hi>Commandments to be known and obeyed.</hi> 2. These Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments must not be the Traditions, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions, and inventions of men; nor the Laws and Edicts of Temporal Princes, but they must be the Commandments of Christ. 3. They must be all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Christ, whatsoever Christ had commanded his Apostles. 4 As these, and as these alone, and all these, must be taught, so they must be taught and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto them as to be observed, and that freely, constantly, and with delight,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105988:66"/>
out of love unto their dearest Saviour. If they teach any other Commandments but these, the knowledg of them will be in vain: if they teach some and not all, their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg will be imperfect: if they teach all these, so that their knowledg should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and yet not effectually stir them up to obedience, their knowledg will be in vain: if they exhort them to observe some, and not all, their obedience will be short, and not reach the end for which these Laws and Commandments were given.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>1. The observations are these.</p>
                  <p>1. That the Commandments of Christ are either moral, as the precepts, and the prohibitions of the moral Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:105988:67"/>
as the two Sacraments of Baptism and the Eucharist, which we call the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>2. That the morals are to be understood Evangelically, in which respect they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of divers additions, whereby they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much from the morals as given to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, or to <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for they were given to <hi>Adam</hi> by God as Creator, to <hi>Israel</hi> by God as choosing them, and bringing them out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but they are given in the Gospel, especially since the exhibition of Christ by God, as redeeming us by Christ already come; therefore called <hi>Christ's Commandments:</hi> and so obedience in them must be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto God, not only as Creator, but as Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>3. The blood of Christ's death made the transgressions against these morals pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and the punishment due unto the transgressors avoidable upon certain terms; but according to the Covenant made with <hi>Israel,</hi> and the Law of Works, neither was transgression once past remissible, nor the punishment possible to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>4. According to the Law and Covenant of Works, perfect, personal, perpetual O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105988:67"/>
was the only condition of life: according to the Gospel, Faith in Christ is the condition; so that though the sins of man against this Law may be many &amp; hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, yet upon Faith in Christ they are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> only pardonable, but shall be pardoned.</p>
                  <p>5. Obedience to this Law was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by <hi>Adam,</hi> according to that suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient power which he had received in his creation, and lost by his transgression; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> obedience of Believers is performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the power of the Spirit, resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in regeneration.</p>
                  <p>6. Tho' our obedience under the Gospel be imperfect, and therefore by it we cannot be justified, yet it's accepted of God, and rewarded ugon the account of Christ's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Intercession.</p>
                  <p>7. We are strictly bound under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel unto these morals; and therefore the sincere and constant obedience unto them is so much urged and professed by Christ and his Apostles in the New Testament. For Christ died not to free us from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to these Laws, but to sanctifie us that we may keep them better; and that upon our transgressions we should renew our Repentance and Faith.</p>
                  <p>8. Though these moral Laws are more
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105988:68"/>
at large expressed and made known unto us by <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets, the Evangelists, both in the Old and New Testament; yet in many places they are contracted in a few words, and reduced to a few heads.</p>

                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:105988:68"/>
of the Law is reduced to these two heads, according to that of the Prophet: <hi>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? Micah</hi> 6. 8. Where to do justly and love mercy, is our whole duty to man; to walk humbly with God, is our whole duty to God. 4. But that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the whole to one head, which is Love, is most excellent; yet this Love is two-fold. 1. <hi>The Love of God.</hi> 2. <hi>Of our Neighbour.</hi> For our blessed Saviour deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the first and great Commandment to be <hi>the Love of the Lord our God;</hi> and the second, which is like unto it, is <hi>to love our Neighbour as our selves.</hi> Yet, though this latter be like unto, yet it's not equal with the first; for there is so great an inequality between the love we owe to God, and that which we owe unto man, that if the love of man come in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with our love to God, so that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not consist together, we must hate Father, and Mother, and nearest Relations, for Christ's sake. Our Saviour further adds, that <hi>upon these two Commandments hang the Law and the Prophets;</hi> that is, all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duties mentioned in the Law and the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105988:69"/>
Prophets are comprized in these two, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37, 38, 39, 40. The Apostle tells us, <hi>that love is the fulfilling of the Law, Rom.</hi> 13. 10. that is, of the second Table.</p>
                  <p>5. Because man is indebted to himself, to his Neighbour, to his God, therefore some think the Law is contracted in the words of the Gospel, which teacheth us to <hi>live soberly</hi> in respect of our selves, <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> towards man, and <hi>godly</hi> towards God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>6. The Divine Apostle &amp; Disciple whom Christ loved, comprehends all in two Commandments, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> saying, <hi>And this is his Commandment, That we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and that we love one another, as he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us,</hi> 1  3. 23.</p>
                  <p>7. And here we must observe, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, reproofs, threatnings, examples, exhortations, dehortations, promises, denuntiations, and executions of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belong, and are to be referred to the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>8. Repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nce, Faith in Christ, Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, bearing Christ's Cross, are duties not naturally, but supernaturally moral, and may be reduced to the first Commandment Evangelically understood. Repentance,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105988:69"/>
as it hath God Creator and Governour in general for it's object; faith as it is an assent to God as the first truth, revealing his mind to man, or a reliance upon him as promising some thing to men; Self-denial and bearing the Cross, as they are a total resignation of our selves unto the will of God made known unto us: I say, all these in this sense are naturally moral. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these as terminated upon God as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer in Christ, either promised or exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and as conditions upon which the Salvation of sinful man depends by divine Ordination, they are not only naturally, but supernaturally moral.</p>
                  <p>9. When the Commandments of God are contracted and reduced to the love of God and our Neighbour, we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the love of God, or the love we owe to God is not only antecedent, and the first in order of nature, but also of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; far higher &amp; greater then the love of our Neighbour, or which is due unto our Neighbour: For we must love God with all our heart, soul, mind, might: and so we must love nothing else. God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of infinite love, and therefore he loves himself infinitely; yet he requires not in these words an infinite love from us who
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105988:70"/>
are infinite, yet we must love him more then any other thing, yea far more; we must love him with the highest degree of love that possibly we can, and should be willing if we could to love him infinitely; we may exceed in loving our selves or any other thing; in loving God we cannot; they that love him most, love him far less then he deserves. To love God with the whole heart is not only to love God sincerely and truly, but to love him so as that his love may take up, and fill the whole heart; &amp; this is to love God as God; &amp; if the whole heart be wholly taken up with this love, then all the powers and faculties of soul and body go along with the heart, and are taken up with it. Therefore these words, all the Soul, Mind, Strength, are added to that of the whole heart, to signifie the great measure of this divine love.</p>
                  <p>10. The love of our Neighbour as our selves pre-requireth the love of God: for if we do not love God first, we can neither love our selves or our Neighbour aright. For our love of God must measure and qualifie both the love of our selves and our Neighbours, and render it acceptable to God.</p>
                  <p>11. This love of God presupposeth our
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105988:70"/>
knowledge of God both as excellent and amiable in himself, and as good and loving to us, especially in Christ; and therefore some acts of faith in Christ must go before this love of God as God, and our God Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Sanctifier. And as it presupo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth knowledge, and in us Christians faith in Christ already come, so it vertually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all subsequent duties and acts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="7" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 7.</head>
                  <p>Therefore after 1. The general obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations premised, and 2. This discourse upon the several abridgments of the moral Law, I will in the third place manifest that love is the fulfilling of the Law.</p>
                  <p>1. The love of God is against all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, Idolatry, Apostasie; renounceth all confidence in any other thing, and will take God alone to be our God, who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us, preserveth, redeemeth, sanctifieth us unto everlasting life, and will serve him, fear him, trust in him, be loyal and obedient unto him in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and will give all praise, glory, honour, and power to him as the only supreme Lord.</p>
                  <p>2. This love will not make any image or likeness of any thing visible or sensible to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105988:71"/>
represent him, nor cause any such thing to be made for that end; neither will it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe any divine power or sanctifying vertue unto any such thing; nor make it a sign of Gods special presence, nor worship or serve it, or serve God by it. It will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all traditions of men and all superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Religious Worship, and will faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observe the institutions of God in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service.</p>
                  <p>3. This love will not swear falsly or vainly, to the dishonour of God and Christ our Saviour. It will be careful to swear the truth. It will not prophane or pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the name of God in the performance of his service, but will worship God and perform all religious duties with humility and reverence, so that God in them may be glorified.</p>
                  <p>4. This love will not prophane the times determined and hallowed by God for his more solemn worship, and will lay aside at those times, not only all sinful, but all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular imployments; and will apply it in publick and private, to the performance of holy and heavenly duties. It will observe the first day of the week in acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christs Resurrection, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down of the Holy Ghost, and by this
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105988:71"/>
observation signifie our belief of the aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law, the taking down of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wall, &amp; the uniting of Jew &amp; Gentile in one body Christian; neither will love so confine it self to one day in seven as not to observe those standing occasional times of humiliation or thanksgiving appointed by Authority both Ecclesiastical and Civil for the publick service and solemn Worship of God.</p>
                  <p>5. If we love God, we will love our selves in God; and as our selves our Neighbours, and that not only our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, Friends, near Relations, but Strangers, Enemies especially the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; and will do as we would be done unto. This love will honour, obey, and submit unto all our Superiors; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Family, or State, or Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their places, and will not disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, disobey, or any ways as such, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect them.</p>
                  <p>6. This love will not give way to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, malice, envy, implacable revenge, or any such violent and destructive passion, which tends to the endangering of limb or life: but it will account the life of our neighbour very precious, and will use all means to preserve it, and to live in peace, concord, and safety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:105988:72"/>7. This love will detest adultery, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, fornication, incest, and all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with all the causes and occasions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; it will endeavour chastity in body and spirit, and use all means to preserve it.</p>
                  <p>8. This love will not by any fraud or force take away or detain the goods of his neighbour out of covetousness, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iniquity, but will be careful to give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one their own; and so not only be just, but also merciful, and liberal when God requires it.</p>
                  <p>9. This love will not bear false witness against his Neighbour, though his Enemy, nor any way seek to hinder or pervert just judgment, but will desire and use their best means to right his Noighbour, and to promote justice in all judicial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>10. This love will not covet any thing that is his Neighbours, though he want it himself, will not envy his prosperity, will not rejoyce in the misery of an enemy; it will seek the good of every one, rejoyce in their happiness, look upon every one, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a godly man, as his brother.</p>
                  <p>This love of God and our neighbour will desire, endeavour, and intend the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all these commandments from
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105988:72"/>
the heart and soul, &amp; that in obedience to Jesus Christ, who loved us, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for us: it will repent and grieve for disobedience, and speedily return sincerely to God Redeemer, seek for pardon in the name of Christ, and pray for the Spirit of sanctification to renew us more and more.</p>

Bread did signifie his Flesh and Body which he gave and offered for the life of the world, and Wine did signifie his Blood: And as Bread must be eaten, and Wine must be drank, that we may live thereby, so by a divine Faith we must eat his Flesh, and drink his Blood, that we may live for ever. In this respect this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agrees with the Eucharistical Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and Sacrificial Feasts, wherein the Sacrifice was first slain and offered to God, and then part of it given to men to eat and drink before God in his Sanctuary. Christs Body was the Sacrifice, and was crucified, slain, and offered upon the Cross; and in this Sacrament given and received for our spiritual food. The Bread and Wine signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Body; the breaking of the Bread, &amp;

                     <item>5. The drinking of it in remembrance of Christ.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. The Blood of Christ shed, and the Body of Christ broken and given, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the Death of Christ, which he suffered upon the Cross for the expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our sins, whereby Gods justice was satisfied, his wrath appeased, sin made just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardonable, and man savable. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105988:75"/>
blood of Christ the great High Priest, was of infinite value, the great ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some whereby heaven gates were opened, and eternal life merited.</p>
                  <p>2. The end of this blood shed, and this cruel, cursed, and ignominous death was the actual remission of the sins of many; even of all such as should believe in him. The shedding of this purest blood accepted of God, made sin pardonable; the belief in this blood-shed and accepted, obtains actual remission. For God was so just that he would not pardon any sin without effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this blood, and yet so merciful, that for an inconsideration of the same belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on by guilty man on Earth, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ in heaven, he will fully and for ever pardon sin, and justifie the guilty.</p>
                  <p>3. The Testament is the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is so called, because in some respect it's like a Testament which is confirmed and made effectual by the death of the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; so the Covenant being grounded upon the death of Christ, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came mediatour of the same, is confirmed by the blood and death of Christ, and is made eternally effectual: It's called the New Testament or Covenant, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it from the Old, which was also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105988:76"/>
with blood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. And is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant not of works and strict justice, but of faith and Gods mercy; and its said to be the New Covenant in this blood, because confirmed by this blood, and to be the New Covenant in this blood, and the blood of the New Covenant, are the same. For both signifie the Confirmation of it by Christs Blood.</p>
                  <p>4. We have the Cup, that is, the Wine contained in the Cup, which signifies the Blood of Christ shed for the Remission of sins, and puts us in mind of Christs Death, and Blood shed; and its given and taken to confirm the Covenant renewed between God and the Communicant.</p>
                  <p>5. The Communicants are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to drink of this Cup in remembrance of Christs Blood shed for the remission of sin. And by this command they are bound to drink, and also to drink it in remembrance of Christ; that so by faith they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ into their hearts for their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life and comfort. In this part we have as before in the former, the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Covenant, the fealing of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The Redemption was signified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the bread broken and given; and here by the Wine in the Cup poured out:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105988:76"/>
for both signifie but one and the same death and sacrifice of Redemption. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as formerly, hath a promise of remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins, and a precept commanding to take and drink of the Cup in remembrance of his death. And this remembrance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing knowledge and faith with sense of our sins, is practical and effectual to stir up to love and thankfulness in an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. For how can we remember and seriously consider the greatest love of our Saviour unto us his enemies, his cruel suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for us, and the incomparable bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings merited thereby; and not be made sensible of our sins, relie upon his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, love our enemies, and be for ever thankful to our God!</p>
                  <p>3. The sealing of the Covenant in this part is like unto the former. And here it's to be observed, that the Covenant is sealed and confirmed in this Sacrament two seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, that God may more fully assure man that as by his Minister he gives both Bread and wine, so certainly he will give Christ and all his benefits, and continue constant in his Covenant; and as certainly as he receives bread and eats it; wine, and drinks it in remembrance of Christ; so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he shall receive remission of sins and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105988:77"/>
eternal life by Christ. And by the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of this Sacrament, doth more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engage himself to God for to continue faithful in his Covenant unto the end.</p>

               <div n="9" type="section">
                  <head>Sect 9.</head>
                  <p>Before I conclude this Doctrine of the Eucharist, I will add some observations upon the same. For,</p>
                  <p>1. As Christ in Baptism contracted all Purifications, Cleansings, and Lustrations in the Law; so in this he abridged all the Ilastical and Eucharistical sacrifices, with their Meat-offerings, Drink-offerings, and sacrificial Feasts.</p>
                  <p>2. The Author, institutor and first ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause of this Sacrament is Christ the Son of God our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>3. The subject and principal matter thereof, is the death of Christ, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits procured thereby.</p>
                  <p>4. The form is the use of the Elements, with the words according to the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p>5. The end is the continued remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the sacrifice of Christ upon which depends our eternal salvation.</p>
                  <p>6. This is one of the Laws of Christ, which we are bound to observe till his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to judgment; as appears by these
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105988:77"/>
words: <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. The dispensation of it belongs to the Minister of the Gospel; for he that must baptize, must administer the Eucharist, and he that dispenseth the one, must dispense the other Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>8. The reason why this Sacrament is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred in two several Elements, is more fully and distinctly to represent the death of Christ, to signifie the plenty of food God hath prepared for our souls; and the more strongly to confirm the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>9. It's to be celebrated not only once, but often; and is to be continued in the Church unto the worlds end.</p>
                  <p>10. In it we have many points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine concerning mans sin, Gods love, the Redemption, the Covenant, and therein of Gods promises, mans duty, as Repentance and Faith; the benefits were<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thereby, and the Confirmation of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>11. In it we have many parts of Gods worship imployed, as confession of sin, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith, prayer, charity, thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: and the whole Celebration of it, is a piece of Divine Service.</p>
                  <p>12. By receiving of this Sacrament, we
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105988:78"/>
profess our Christianity, our continuance in the Christian faith, and in the Communion with the holy Catholick Church, and the Renunciation of all other Religions.</p>
                  <p>13. By the Doctrine of this Sacrament, and the tenor of Christs commission, we understand something of Church Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. For as no man before he by the profession of his faith and promise of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience manifest himself to be a Disciple, can be baptized; so no man except he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be baptized, continue in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith, keep Christs Commandments, may be admitted to this Table: neither may one grosly ignorant before he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, or guilty of scandal, before he signifie his repentance and be absolved, be received as a guest of this heavenly Feast. They also who do neglect it when they are invited and have opportunity, are unworthy. Therefore besides the power which God gives unto the Minister, it is fit that in every Church there should be some order established, and some trusted with power to judge what persons are fit and worthy, and who are not.</p>
                  <p>14. No man can have benefit by this Sacrament, but such as are truly penitent and believing; of whom God can only
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105988:78"/>
judge, and the Minister doing his duty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his best judgment, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of such as desire to communicate, must refer all such as he admits to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, who alone knows the hearts of men. And here its to be noted that such as are habitually penitent and believing, may so come unto the Sacrament as that they may offend God because not actually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared at such a time.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="10" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 10.</head>
                  <p>The last work to be done for to close up this Chapter, is to reduce the matter of these Commandments into the form of a more explicit vow; that so every one that owns his Baptism, may know what by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof he is more particularly bound to perform.</p>
                  <p>1. I believe in one eternal infinite glorious Lord, who hath by his Almighty power created Heaven and Earth, and all things therein; Redeemed mankind by the precious blood of his Eternal Word made flesh; sanctifies his Elect people, and by a Covenant of grace is become my God in Christ; do renounce the Devil, the World, and the Flesh, and all false Gods, and Idols, and all Profane Irreligious thoughts. I deny my self, and wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105988:79"/>
up my self unto him, with all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties of my soul and body. I take him for my supreme Lord, Lawgiver, Judge, Redeemer by Jesus Christ, upon whom alone I depend for Salvation; and for whom I am ready to bear the Cross, and sacrifice my self at any time, when called unto it. He alone shall be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my great Love, Fear, Service, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, Confidence, Joy, Solace and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. To him alone I will present my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Praises, Thanksgiving, Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as only eternally worthy of it; and abhorring all Pride, I will with greatest humility adore his glorious Majesty and be nothing in my self, that I may be all in my God. I tremble to think of Apostasie or denying my Saviour, to whom I will be faithful to the end as I expect glory and life everlasting from my God by him.</p>
                  <p>2. I will not make any Image or Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of any thing in Heaven and Earth, or in the Waters under the Earth, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present his glorious and eternal excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and God-head, but will abandon all false and base conceits and apprehensions of him, and look upon him as represented in his mighty and wonderful works, and his holy and most blessed word. I will not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105988:79"/>
bow down unto any Image or Likeness for to worship it; nor perform any service unto it, as though it had any Divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency or sanctifying power in it, or were any sign of Gods special presence without his institution. I renounce all Traditions, Ceremonies, Customs, Inventions, Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men in Religious Worship that are contrary to Gods Word, or imposed and enjoyned as necessary parts of Worship. I will serve and worship my God with that kind of worship which he hath instituted in the Gospel, which shall be the rule, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which I will pray, confess, give thanks, praise, hear the word, celebrate the Sacraments, and perform all other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Service unto him in the name and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Jesus Christ, and not of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Saints, or the blessed Virgin. And this shall move me much, because the Lord my God is a jealous God, and will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Superstition in Worship; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of men which pollute and debase his service, tend unto, and many times end in Idolatry, which he will punish not only in the Fathers who begin it, give exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to others, but also in the Children unto the third and fourth Generation, and will shew mercy to such as worship him
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105988:80"/>
with a pure Virgin love according to his institution, unto a thousand Generations. Both the fear and love of my God, and the hope of Reward according to his gracious promises, shall work much upon me.</p>
                  <p>3. I will not swear vainly or falsly, nor call upon my God to be a witness against my soul, in affirming or denying any thing which I do not certainly know to be so, as it is affirmed or denyed by me, or in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that which I know I have no power to do, or no sincere intention to perform; for so I should dishonour his glorious name, deceive and disappoint my neighbour, lose my interest in my God, and bring his curse upon me: for he will certainly punish, and severely revenge all such iniquity. I promise that when I take up the name of my God in swearing, praying unto him, praising of his name, and in performing all other his religious service, I will do it with humility, reverence, deliberation, due preparation, the sincerity of my heart, that so I may be innocent before God, just towards men, and that my service may be accepted of him, and effectually conducing to his glory. I will abhor all prophane cursing, all blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous thoughts and words against his Majesty, his word, and holy Institution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:105988:80"/>4. Seeing my God requires a set and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate time to be set apart for religious worship, and his more solemn service, I will remember, and have a special care to observe that holy rest, and apply it to the performance of more holy duties, converse with my God, and prepare my self for that eternal sabbath, and full communion with him, which he hath promised and prepared to be enjoyned by his people in the place of eternal glory. And seeing he hath grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mesix days for my wordly business, and secular imployments, I will endeavour in that time so to order and dispatch my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, that I may not be distracted in his service upon that day, which he hath appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to himself, and in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner made his own: And I will have a care not only to rest and sanctifie that time in mine own person, but I will command such as are under my power, and use all means to cause them both to rest and sanctifie it with me. And seeing according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel the first day of the week is honoured, blessed, hallowed by the Resurrection of my Saviour, and the coming down of the Holy Ghost, upon both which depends our eternal Salvation, I will weekly observe and sanctifie that day in remembrance of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105988:81"/>
the great benefits of Redemption by Christ and of sanctification by the Holy Ghost and of taking down the partition-wall and the shadows of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, the body and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance whereof is Christ. And by the observation of this time, I will renounce all Heathenism, Mahometism, and Judaism; and testifie my self a Christian believing in Christ already come. This day I will not neglect or profane by idleness or any works, and so profanely mispend it to the dishonour of my God, and the hindrance of my Salvation. As for works of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, of charity towards man or beast, or such as tend to the sanctification of the day, I will take liberty to do them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as my God hath allowed; neither will I neglect those solemn times of prayer and thanksgiving appointed by Ecclesiastical and Civil Authority for the publick service of God. And I shall account the free and quiet enjoyment of these holy times, and the Communion of Saints to be a great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
                  <p>5. Next unto my God, I must love my Neighbour, made in his image, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with the precious blood of Christ; and I must love him as my self. These are natural Parents, civil Powers, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105988:81"/>
in the State, Ministers in the Church, and all such as God hath set over us for our good. These I promise to reverence and honour according to their excellency and dignity; I will submit unto their lawful power, obey their just commands, and give them and all others my superiours due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect according to their places. If I my self be either Father, or Mother, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or Magistrate, or Minister, Tutor, Guardian and Governour, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in these several relations to do my duty and seek the good of these that shall be under my power, and committed to my charge. I will not dishonour, or disobey, or resist, and rebel against my lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; neither will I be perfidious unto them, nor vex and discomfort them, but so carry my self towards them, as I desire my inferiours to carry themselves towards me, that so my God may bless me in that place of my pilgrimage where he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me to live and sojourn on Earth. For I know that upon the performance of these duties, according to the promise of God, the peace and welfare of Family, Church, and State, and all other Societies do much depend; and that God will curse and punish all disobedient, rebellious, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105988:82"/>
unthankful wretches, and such as envy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise, mock, dishonour, vex, discomfort their betters.</p>
                  <p>6. I will put away all wrath, anger, violent passion; and will beware of all quarrels, dissentions, batteries, wicked thoughts, words, deeds; all secret plots, designs, and enterprises which may any ways prejudice or endanger the life, limbs, safety, health of my Neighbour. I will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor hatred, malice, purposes to revenge my self, and endeavor to keep my self inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and free every way from the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood of others, even of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. I will neither be principal or accesso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, either by neglect or doing any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any mans life. The health, peace, safety, life and blood of my Neighbour shall be as precious to me as mine own. I will be patient, meek, loving, kind, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ready to be reconciled, forbear, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer long, forgive, and every lawful way seek to perserve and keep the life of my Neighbour as mine own.</p>
                  <p>7. I will abhor all leud, wanton, unchast thoughts, purposes, words, deeds, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, apparel, books, immodest compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; all adultery, whordom, fornication, incest, and other kinds of uncleanness.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105988:82"/>
And because idleness, glottony, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and all other kind of intemperance give advantage to the Devil to tempt us to this sin; therefore I will take heed of them, and all other things which may be causes and occasions of the same. Marriage with me shall be honourable, and the marriage bed undefiled. My thoughts, words, deeds, gestures and carriage shall be chast; and seeing my body being redeemed with a price, should be a member of Christ, and the Temple of the Holy Ghost, I will not defile and dishonour it. I will endeavour chastity in body and spirit, in marriage or single life; I will not joyn with any other in this sin, and so bring the judgments of God upon me.</p>
                  <p>8. Seeing God hath made the Earth and the fulness thereof, given it to the Sons of men, disposeth and dispenseth of these Earthly goods as it pleaseth him; maketh rich and poor, and giveth to men some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is justly their own: I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore renounce all unjust thoughts, words, deeds, which tend unjustly to endammage and impair the estate of my Neighbour. I will neither by fraud or force, secretly or openly take away or detain that which is anothers right. I will not be unjust to any
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105988:83"/>
man, nor unmerciful unto the poor, the fatherless, the widow, or any that are in need, and cannot help themselves; and I will endeavour to deliver them out of the hand of such as do oppress them. And that I may be free from this sin of injustice, I will shun idleness and prodigal courses, and vain and unnecessary expences. I will not be covetous, and use any unlawful means to enrich my self; neither will I be improvident, or unbelieving, orimmode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, orinordinately careful. I will not be unjust, or unfaithfull in my contracts, commerce, and dealing with other men: nor carelesly waste my estate by gaming, unnecessary law-suits or rash suretiship. I promise to be just, honest, faithful in all my dealing, give every man his due, restore that which is unjustly taken away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold no mans goods trusted in my hands. I will rather lose then gain to the wrong and dammage of another man. I will not only be just, but merciful and charitable to the poor and needy, and especially to the indigint and persecuted Saints of God, and to them I will be liberal according to mine ability. I will be careful that God, the Church, the State, and every private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may have their due. And that I be not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105988:83"/>
tempted to injustice, I will painfully labour in some honest way that I may maintain me and mine; and will be frugal, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately sparing, provident, and use just and lawful means of getting and keeping a competent estate, I will be content with little, and trust in God for these earthly necessaries.</p>
                  <p>9. God hath appointed in all Common-Wealths Courts of Judicature, to relieve the oppressed, right such as are wronged, punish offenders, and rightly judge all causes, and determine all controversies. And the end of all judgment is justice; and one means, and the same principal, tending to that end, is evidence, which often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon witnesses; therefore I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise neither as Party, Plaintiff, or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, nor as Witness, nor Juror, nor Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitour, nor Atturney, nor Advocate, or Counsellour, nor Judge, nor Register, to cause men to believe that which is false, conceal the truth, oppose a just cause, or by forgery, neglect, infidelity, out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, fear, favour, partiality, covetousness, go about to hinder or pervert just judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I will endeavour to discover the truth, to oppose the unjust cause of a friend, promote the just cause of an enemy
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105988:84"/>
or stranger I will use all means both by my self and others to do what I can, to take away all needless and unjust delays, help the helpless, punish offenders, right the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and endeavour to my power that justice and judgment may have a free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage and flow down like a mighty stream. I will pray for just Judges, and for integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all such as act in judicial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>10. Many times it falls out that my Neighbour hath such things as I want, or somthing better then I have; is in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition then I am, and in prosperity, when I am in adversity; and then such is, or may be the corruption of my heart and self-love, that I begin to envy him and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet that which is duly his, and I have no right unto. And out of this envy, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting that which is another mans, much wickedness, if not prevented, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, therefore I promise and vow by the help of Gods grace to mortifie and suppress betimes these envious thoughts, and unjust covetings, will be content with mine own estate though poor and mean; I will neither envy anothers prosperity, nor rejoyce in his Adversity. But I will love my Neighbours as my self, rejoyce
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:105988:84"/>
with them that do rejoyce, and mourn with them that mourn, and will be inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched with their misery. I will seek their temporal and eternal good, relieve mine enemies, do good for evil, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come evil with good, pray for them that despitefully use me, bless them that curse me, think none evil, and have charitable thoughts till I have evidence of the truth to the contrary. I will endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form such as do amiss, and wander out of the right way. I will do all the acts and good offices of love, and will not do any thing contrary to true love and charity. Thus I will love, not only my private but my publick Neighbour, and I will not deny it to strangers or enemies: and out of this love will endeavour to do as I would be done unto, and be perfect as my heavenly Father is perfect, and follow the example of my dearest Saviour.</p>
                  <p>These are the moral Laws of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which by my Baptism I am bound to observe. By them I understand my sins to be many, and grievous, and my self guilty, and liable not only to temporal but eternal punishments; even the regenerate Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God cannot obey them perfectly; but have their failings, and sometimes grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105988:85"/>
fall, so that by the works of the law no man living can be justified; yet this is my comfort, that my Saviour by suffering for these my sins, hath made them pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and the punishments deserved by them avoidable. And he not only dyed for mine offences, but rose again for my justification, makes intercession in heaven, and pleads his blood for all penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. These things I verily believe, and according to this belief I rely upon my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virous propitiation and intercession; and renewing daily my supplications before the throne of grace, hope to obtain remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all my sins against this Law and his other commands. I acknowledge it a great unspeakable mercy, that my God hath made faith and not perfect obedience the condition of life. As this Law doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my sins, so it is a rule of my life; and as I will renew my repentance daily, and seek remission of sin past, so I will daily pray for the sanctifying power of his Spirit to write th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se Laws more and more in my heart, to strengthen me against all temptations, enable me to observe them willingly and with delight; beseeching him to accept my poor endeavours and to look upon me as washed in the blood of my Saviour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:105988:85"/>There is another positive and ceremonial Law of my Saviour, which I by Baptism am bound to observe together with these morals; and that is the Sacrament of the Eucharist, which is to be Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all Christians to the worlds end, in remembrance of the Sacrifice sof Christ death. Therefore I promise with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, penitent, and believing heart to come unto this heavenly Table, when I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited and called to eat the blessed Bread in remembrance of my Saviours body, which was broken and offered for me, and drink the blessed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cup in remembrance of his blood, whereby the New Covenant is confirmed, as being shed for the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my sins. And as my God by his Ministers giving this Bread and this Cup, doth seal and confirm anew his promises unto me to strengthen my faith and hope, so I will by receiving these Elements accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the first institution, solemnly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and confirm my engagement for the performance of the conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and thereby I will testifie my union with the Church, my charity to all, my thankfulness to Christ, and will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his unspeakable love to my poor soul, manifested in his sacrifice of everlasting
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105988:86"/>
vertue, and will hope according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of my heart, though my failings be many, that he will increase my graces and heavenly comforts upon the receiving of the same.</p>

                  <p>PRayer is a duty required in the moral Law of God, especially as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood Evangelically: and is to be used both by every Christian both in private and publick, and also by the universal Church whilst Militant on Earth, until it become triumphant in Heaven, when all prayers shall be turned into praises, and petitions into thanksgiving. Its a part of Gods worship both moral and ritual; for neither Word nor Sacraments can be rightly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dispensed without it: and this is the reason why it takes up so great a part of our Liturgies and Forms of Worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To pray alwaies is one of Christs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and without prayer we can neither observe his Commandments, nor persevere in our profession; because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayer we cannot expect grace, which
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105988:86"/>
is necessary to enable us to do both. And because it is continual, a necessary, and an excellent piece of service, I intend to speak of it more particularly and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And for order sake I will,</p>
                  <list>

                  </list>
                  <p>1. Prayer may be described thus. It's a part of God's Worship wherein we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our minds unto God. As it is a part of God's Worship, it's to be ranked amongst the duties of the first Table, and in several respects to be referred to the several com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of it. It looks at God as supreme Lord of infinite and eternal excellency and perfection, as all other religious acts do; yet it considers in God some particular perfections more then others, as shall be shewed hereafter. The more particular nature of it is a presentation of our minds to God. The matter thereof is something in our minds, which we desire and propose to make known to God; and the act of it is the representations of these to his glorious Majesty. Therefore the School-men make prayer to be an act of the understanding, presupposing the heart
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105988:87"/>
first affected with those things which are the matter of our prayers, which were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpose without the affection of the heart, which may be said to animate and give life unto them; yet we must not think that we can inform God (who knows our thoughts afar off) of any thing which he is ignorant of. Therefore the intention of prayer is not only to honour him, but to move and affect him with the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented. This is the nature of prayer largely taken, so as to include in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Speech, Petition, Praise, Thansgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Therefore Praise and Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving are said to be parts of Prayer, which in respect of the representation of our minds is said to be a speaking unto God, and a conference with him: For in all these we address our selves to God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to his Throne, and express our minds unto him, and pour our hearts out before him. Petition ascends, mercies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, praise and thanksgiving are retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto him again. Prayer strictly taken, is an humble presentation of our petition unto God as able and willing to effects them. This may be made either unto a false God or the true God: and to the true God either according to the Law of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:105988:87"/>
Nature, or the Light of Grace; and that either implicitly in the name of Christ as before his Ascension, or explicitly as after. They must be made especially by us Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the name of Christ, who by his blood hath satisfied Gods justice, made him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, the Throne of grace accessible, hath merited all mercies, promised to be our Advocate, and to sollicite our cause in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and procure for us whatsoever we ask in his name. They must also be made by the Spirit, who alone doth sanctify us and qualifie our hearts for this duty, and enables us to perform it so as that it may be effectual, and when we know not how to pray as we ought, he stirs up in us sighs, and groans, which cannot be uttered; by which he makes intercession for us to the Father, who not only understands these dark expressions, but is much moved and affected with them: So that a Christian ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual prayer is a presenting of our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God the Father, in the name of Christ by the Spirit! And how powerful must that prayer be which is offered to the Father in the name of his Son, by the power and grace of his Spirit! A prayer may be made inwardly in the soul, without any words of the Mouth, and it may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105988:88"/>
qualified as to prevail very much with God, who principally looks at the heart. It may be made outwardly, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any understanding, sense and inward affection: and this is but a Carkase of prayer, and not regarded of God, though delivered in most excellent expressions, and as it were in the language of Angels. This outward prayer whether said or sung, in Prose or Verse, if made in publick or in company, must be in a language, and in terms more easily understood by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with whom we pray, that they may say <hi>Amen,</hi> which they cannot, if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not. And though they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, yet if their hearts be not affected with the matter, and rightly disposed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, its to no purpose. For all outward prayer should be joyned with the inward, and issue from an heart rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed. A prayer of a righteous man may sometimes be ineffectual, because its not made by him as righteous.</p>

                  <p>These things concerning prayer in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral observed, I proceed unto the Lords prayer; we find many particular prayers, praises, and thanksgivings in the Scripture, and many forms both for publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105988:88"/>
devotion taken out of this blessed Book; yet all these seem to be but so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny branches of that excellent form, which our Saviour taught his Disciples, wherein he contracted the substance of all lawful prayers, and that in an excellent method. It was taught and prescribed in the days of his humiliation, and was suitable unto their present light and condition. For herein he gives no direction how to ask any thing in his name: and the reason was, he was not yet glorified, nor made Advocate general in heaven, nor possessed of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Kingdom. This may seem to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in that petition, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> For then to him and so to them it was to come. In it we may observe.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>1. The parties who must perform this duty, are persons living on Earth, who
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105988:89"/>
have not lost their interest in God, upon whom all and every one depends; and our necessities are many and great, and prayer is Ordained as a means whereby all things we need may be obtained, and that more certainly, because we have a Promise. Besides its an universal Command, and all Men are bound in that respect to pray, and by prayer to worship and glorifie God. For by it we acknowledge that God is the supreme Lord, the fountain of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Father of Mercies, willing freely to give us what we need; and that we are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable and indigent persons, and that God is no ways bound to relieve us or supply our wants, but only he promised to hear and help, and this promise was freely made. Some will not pray, some cannot; some can pray, but not effectually; yet all these are bound to pray, and therefore their sin or misery must be very great.</p>
                  <p>2. The persons for whom we must pray, are our selves and all others, who are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any benefit by our prayers. For we are directed to say, (<hi>Our Father</hi>) and in this word (<hi>Our</hi>) we include our selves and others too. As we must love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our selves, so we must pray for our Neighbour as for our selves. And by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:105988:89"/>
Neighbour we must understand, not only our Acquaintance and Friends but strangers and Enemies. For we must pray for them which despitefully use us. So Christ pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for such as did Crucifie him; saying, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do;</hi> yet as we must love some more then others, so we must pray more especially for some then others, most of all for the Church and our persecuted Brethren. For Christian charity in our prayers doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it self, and abhors partiality and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love.</p>
                  <p>3. The person to whom we must pray is God, and God is our Father in heaven. Father is a word of power and pity; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaven is a term of supreme power and infinite pity. And if all the power and pity of all Fathers, even the best, were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one, yet all were nothing to the pity and power of our God. This Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and gave his Son for us, when we were Enemies, and called us, when we were dead in Sins and Trespasses; greater love never was manifested to any creature, and greater love to any creature there cannot be. And how much must he love us, when once we begin to love him as our God! What cannot a Father in heaven, what will
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105988:90"/>
not a father in Christ do for his Children? seeing in him meet in one power and pity, might and mercy, greatness and goodness, which include all his perfections. Thus we must conceive of God, to whom we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress our selves, to whom we direct our prayers.</p>
                  <p>4. The qualifications of prayers are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 1. One is faith, whereby we believe that he is present in all places at all times; hears all prayers, knows all things, and with what heart we pray; that he is just, holy, wise, of infinite goodness, and unspeakable mercy in Christ, who makes intercession for us in heaven, that his power is Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his dominion over all things is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme. 2. In respect of his infinite and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal excellency and supreme dominion, we must come into his presence with all humility and reverence adoring his eternal Majesty. 3. As he is holy, we must be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and draw near with pure and upright hearts. 4. As he is just, we must petition for just things. 5. As he is a father, we must be obedient Children. 6. As he is full of love, so we must pray in charity and love towards others. 7. As he is Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Almerciful in Christ, in whom he hath promised all things, we must pray in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:105988:90"/>
greatest confidence. 8. Because our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity is great, and we seek great and necessary things from him, so we must be instant, importunate, wrastle with him, and not let him be quiet till he hear, help, and bless us.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 3.</head>
                  <p>In the body of the prayer we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Method and excellent order, to which he hath reduced all matters to be prayed for. To understand this, we must consider that he hath made two general heads and parts of petition: the 1. Of supplication, the 2. Of deprecation. In the former we petition for all good we can justly desire: In the latter we seek delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from all evil, where unto we are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The good we pray for is spiritual or temporal; the spiritual respects Gods glory in 1. (<hi>Hollowed be thy name</hi>) or our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual happiness in the coming of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 2. In doing of his will. Temporal good we pray for, when we say, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread.</hi> Deliverance from evil is two fold, either from sin or afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The evil of sin is either guilt of sin past, or temptation to sin in time to come. The former we seek in these words, <hi>Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trepass</hi>

                  <p>We begin our petitions with these words, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name;</hi> where by name we must understand the excellent Majesty, and supream Dominion of God our heavenly Father; in respect of which all honour, glory, power and praise are due to him, and ought to be ascribed unto him by men and Angels for ever: yet all this doth not make him more glorious and excellent then he is in himself: for what can be added to that which is infinite? This excellency and supream dominion we profess to believe in the first Article of our Creed, and promise to acknowledge in the first commandment of the moral Law. And here we pray for the universal acknowledgment in the first Petition; for such must be our respect to him, as that above all things his name may be glorified: therefore in these words we pray that his name and supream excellency may be manifested more and more both by his Ordinary and Extraordinary works of creation and providence; and also by his blessed word, especially by the Gospel of Christ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. That being manifested to us and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105988:91"/>
to all others, it may be more and more clearly known. 3. That being known, we and all others may acknowledge it, and submit with all our hearts to him as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Lord; and that he may be glorified in the eternal destruction of such as will not honour him as supream Lord. In these words we pray against all Atheism, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Profaneness, Rebellion, Apostasie, and the usurpation of divine power.</p>
                  <p>2. We pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> where we have 1. A kingdom. 2. The coming of it. 3. A petition for the coming of it. Gods Kingdom is two-fold, 1. Universal and general over all. 2. Special over men. The latter here is meant; this second King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom respects Men as sinful and ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; yet as having some hope of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Redemption of Jesus Christ; therefore its the kingdom of God Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, looking upon Man as first redeemed, and so ordinable unto everlasting salvation: for sinful Mans happiness begins in Gods love, which moved him to give Christ to death for the Expiation of our sins: for this was the laying the foundation of Eternal Life. The coming of this Kingdom is the exercise of his power to make redemption effectual; for then this kingdom comes to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105988:92"/>
any person or persons, when God Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er begins to reign by his Word and Spirit, and by them calls men to repentance and faith. The end where at this government aims is the ruine of all enemies, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal peace of all such as shall submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his power, and continue to be loyal and obedient subjects. Thus God did alwayes reign since the first promise of Christ made unto <hi>Adam,</hi> but this reign advanced and became more glorious after that Christ was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et at the right hand of God, sent down the Holy Ghost, revealed the Gospel, and it shall be consummate when all enemies shall be subdued, and Gods chosen Saints fully and for ever glorified. Some make two degrees of this Government; the first of grace, and the second of glory: The one begins with our first conversation, the other with the resurrection. In this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore we do not seek of God the coming of Christ, nor the conquest of Sin, and Satan upon the Cross, nor of death by his resurrection, nor his exaltation to the right hand of God, nor the beginning of his reign: for all these are past. But we pray that our heavenly Father would, 1. Send his Ministers with the Gospel, and the power of his Spirit into all nations, <hi>who</hi>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:105988:92"/>
                     <hi>sit in darkness, and the shadow of death,</hi> and contrive the means of conversion to all people who enjoy them, and in particular to us. 2. That he would make these means effectual to the conversion of many. 3. That he would justifie, sanctifie adopt all such as are converted. 4. That he would do these things more and more till he hath subdued all sin in them. 5. That he would hasten to subdue death, the last enemy, by the resurrection, and the last change of mortal bodies. 6. That all enemies being conquered, he may reign perfectly, and that when Christ hath delivered up the kingdom, God may be all in all his Saints, and give them perfect holiness, full joy, and peace everlasting. 7. That he would by degrees, and at last totally and finally destroy all the power of Satan, Sin, Death, wicked Men, which oppose our Salvation and Eternal Peace. The principal thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired is first eternal life, then all means which conduce unto the end. The principal effect of this Government is destruction of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Enemies, and the conversion and salvation of his People. To this head may be referred all Petitions for the ruine of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> and Antichrist, persecuting Enemies, both open and secret, for good Magistrates,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105988:93"/>
Ministers, and Governours in Church and State; for powerful preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, for good discipline, and due admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments: and here is to be observed, that the more his Kingdom comes, the more his name is hallowed and glorified.</p>
                  <p>3. Yet because no man can enjoy the benefits, peace, and priviledges of any Kingdom, tho never so excellent, except he will submit unto the power of the Prince, observe his Laws, and do his will; therefore that we may attain to the eternal peace and felicity of this Kingdom, we pray that the will of our heavenly Father may be done; where we have,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The will of God.</item>
                     <item>2. The doing of it.</item>
                     <item>3. The manner or pattern of doing,</item>
                     <item>4. The thing petitioned for in these words.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. The will of God is sometimes his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, sometimes his command, or law; this will here intended is not his decree, but his law: the matter of the decree is something that God will do; the matter of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is something that man must do: and the effect of this will once signified, is the obligation of man unto obedience, or upon
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:105988:93"/>
disobedience unto punishment: and by this will here is meant the Laws of God Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer in force under the Gospel. And these Laws by some are reduced to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith, obedience to Gods Laws, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued after our first faith and conversion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this according to the parts of the vow made in Baptism. All well ordered King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have their laws, which all such as will be admitted subjects, or will receive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and enjoy the priviledges of that Government, must observe. And so it is in the Kingdom of God Redeemer; and these Laws are moral, yet Evangelically under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, or positive and ceremonial. The moral are fundamental or superstructive. The fundamental is that which requires subjection aad fealtv to the Soveraign Christ Jesus, and submission to his power; the superstructive are such Laws moral as are grounded upon this; such are all the Commandments following the first. And whereas some understand this will as well of the Executive will, as the Legislative; yet thats not proper, though true in some sense.</p>
                  <p>2. To do this will, doth presuppose that the Laws be published, and that by the same the will of God be made known,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105988:94"/>
that none but such as are negligent or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, may be ignorant. This being presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, 1. We must have a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Will of our heavenly Father. For if in every action of a man as he is a man and a rational creature, knowledge be requisite and necessary, much more in this obedience. To do that which is commanded by God, and not to know its Gods command, is no obedience unto God. 2. After this Will is once known, there must be a free and full consent and stedfast resolution for to conform unto it, and that not only because the commands of God are just, and holy, the doing them is pleasing unto him, and beneficial unto man; but for this very reason, because we know them to be the commands of God. 3. Because neither of these can be done except we renounce our own conceits, imaginations, lusts and corrupt inclinations of our own hearts; therefore we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign up our understandings to the wisdom, and our own wills wholly to the Will of God. 4. This doing doth not stay and rest in knowledge and good affection, but must proceed to endeavours, and if our power fail not, to the doing, prosecuting and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of the things commanded: for
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:105988:94"/>
our obedience should reach to the full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the command. 5. This will is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, not only in doing good, but in suffering evil, and that with patience and thankfulness. 6. We must submit unto the executive will of God, and be content therewith, even then when the works of Gods providence do cross us, and seem to be contrary to his Laws. For they may seem sometimes to be so, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are so; yet they may be above these Laws, and beyond the reach of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. No man can do this will by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture except he be regenerate by grace. And because our knowledge is imperfect at the first, and our spiritual ability poor, therefore we must improve them more and more.</p>
                  <p>3. The manner how this will must be performed, and the measure of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is expressed by a pattern given us in heaven. For we are taught to pray, <hi>Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> This implies, that God hath Subjects in Heaven. 2. That these do his will more perfectly. 3. That we must follow this Example, and aim at that perfection. These Subjects are not the Stars and Lights of Heaven as some do understand the words: Though
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105988:95"/>
its true that these observe a constant regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Motion, according to an order prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Creation, and never were Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant or swerved from the rule since the beginning. Only if God do command them to stand, they stand; or go back, they go back: or withhold their light, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to give it. But these are not intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible creatures or capable of Laws; yet they may be witnesses against us, confound us, and make us for ever ashamed of our disobedience. Therefore the words are meant of Angels, which are Spirits Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual, and most noble creatures, and their proper place is Heaven; and therefore sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture the Angels of Heaven. Of these its written, <hi>That they do Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments hearkning to the voice of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Psal.</hi> 103. 20. The perfection of their obedience is in this, that they never sinned but always obeyed God from the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their creation. They did Gods will. 1. Always and in all times 2. They did it in all things. 3. They did it freely, readily, and with joy and delight. 4. They did it in the highest degree of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. So that their obedience was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, universal, free, and perfect. This example we must follow, striving to attain
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:105988:95"/>
their perfection, though we cannot reach it, and never rest till God hath fully sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us, and made us perfectly Righteous and Holy as they are. This pattern doth not exclude that of Sanits and Martyrs, though it come short; yet we have a more excellent and glorious example of Christ, which is more perfect then that of theirs, because they never denied themselves, and bare the Cross as he did.</p>
                  <p>4. In these words. 1. We confess our ignorance, errours, blindness, corruption, inclination to sin, aversness to good, and our impotency, which by nature is such, that of our selves we can do nothing. 2. We pray for Gods preventing, regene rating, co-operating, assisting, and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating grace, and that he would enlighten us, inspire and sanctifie us so, that we may clearly unsterstand, and effectually do his will from our hearts, aiming at his glory. 3. That we would sanctifie us more and more, that we may dayly improve our knowledge and Obedience. 4. That he would strengthen and assist us continually, that we may persevere in an universal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the end. This sanctifying grace we desire as merited by Christ, to be given us by the Spirit according to his promise;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105988:96"/>
yet we do not expect it so from him, as though he should do all things, and we do nothing; we must use the means he hath appointed, exercise the power he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, hearken unto the Doctrine of the Gospel, meditate in the same, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pray for his assistance; we must be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, careful, watchful, continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon him. To this position we may and must refer all the prayers of Gods Saints recorded in Scripture, wherein they seek of God, knowledge, understanding, wisdom, faith, charity, and all other heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertues, with the increase of them, and Gods perpetual assistance and direction. And though our perfection be very little, our imperfections many, yet we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and endeavour to be perfectly obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the end.</p>
                  <p>4. We pray, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread:</hi> In the former part of this form of prayer we sought of God spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and such as tended more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Gods glory, and our salvation: And in this we sue for temporal mercies, and the necessary comforts of this life, whilst we are seeking a better: and the order here observed by our Saviour doth teach us that we must prefer spiritual graces before tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105988:96"/>
blessings, and seek Gods Kingdom, and his righteousness first: which if we do, we may more certainly expect our daily Bread, according to his promise. In the words we have,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Bread.</item>
                     <item>2. Our daily Bread.</item>
                     <item>3. This day.</item>
                     <item>4. Our petition for this to be given us.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. By bread is meant all necessary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this life, which are given us, that we may more chearfully and freely without distraction serve our God, seek his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and do his will. Bread which is the staff of Life, and hath great affinity with Mans Body, is only namely to signifie that we must not seek unnecessary dainties, rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, variety, superfluity, and abundance to expend them in maintaining our Pride, pomp, and pleasure. These necessaries sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by bread are private or publick, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Commodities, Goods, Blessings, as health, food, raiment, house, lands, cattle, and other things whereby Mans life is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; and also good government, peace, seasonable and plentiful times, safety, quiet, enjoyment of that we have, and Gods blessing upon our labours.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Our daily bread,</hi> that is the bread of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:105988:97"/>
our indigency, which we daily want; so the Syriack: our Bread for to morrow, so the Arabick our Food of every day, so the Ethiopick, our Bread which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the day. The meaning of all is, that by daily bread is meant a competent portion of necessaries fit for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our lives; so that we need not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, or be distracted with fear of want.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>This day,</hi> that is the present time of our life, and doth imply that our life is not long, neither must we expect to live many daies; and though we have not provision beforehand, but from hand to mouth, as the Proverb is, yet we should be content, and trust in God; we must not perplex, or distract our selves with thoughts of future times, nor promise to our selves long life, and torment our souls with needless and ineffectual cares, as tho we had no faith, no Father in heaven, no Interest in him, or think that he that feeds the Ravens who make no provision for time to come, nor have any thing laid up in store, will be so careless of us as to see his Children want bread.</p>
                  <p>4. We in these words petition our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father to give us this bread. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, 1. That we have nothing, not one
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:105988:97"/>
morsel of bread but from our God. 2. That he gives us this, and all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, freely; we do not deserve or buy it, but beg it at his hands; therefore 1. we seek it of him by prayer for our selves and others. 2. That he would continue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for us still. 3. That he would bless that which he gives; and we possess, unto us; for if he give it not, we have nothing: if he continue it not, its easily took from us; and tho we be as rich as <hi>Job,</hi> yet we may be as poor as he was in a day; have much this hour, and have nothing the next; and that our best and most wholsom food without his blessing can do us no good. 4. We pray that God would deliver us from Diseases, sickness, famine; nakedness, sword, oppression, drought, inundation, unseasonable times, and all such things as deprive us of our daily bread: and because we never knew what want of bread is nor ever considered how much we depend for these things upon our God; therefore we so little prize these earthly comforts, and are unthankful for these mercies. 5. We must with our prayers labour, and use law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means for the attaining of these things, be provident, frugal, liberal, charitable, and expend as much as we can spare in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105988:98"/>
pious uses: and then that Father who will give us Eternal, will surely give us Temporal blessings; he that will give us an heavenly kingdom, will give us earthly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries; and he that hath given us Christ, will with him give us all things.</p>
                  <p>5. We pray for forgiveness of our sins in these words, <hi>Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us.</hi> Here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the deprecatory part of this prayer, whereby we seek deliverance from evil, and that which is contrary to our happiness. This kind of prayer is sometimes joyned with weeping, fasting, complaints, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and confession of sins. The first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is that of sin past, which remains in the guilt; for to understand this petition we must consider,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Trespasses.</item>
                     <item>2. Our trespasses.</item>
                     <item>3. The forgiveness of trespasses.</item>
                     <item>4. The party forgiving.</item>
                     <item>5. The party capable of forgiveness.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. By trespasses we must understand sin and disobedience to Gods Laws: the word which in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> signifies debts, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in <hi>Luke</hi> by a word which signifies sins, and all sins are debts: or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract debts: for first we owe unto God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:105988:98"/>
and by the Law are bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it: but if we pay not this, but prove disobedient, we run into another debt, and owe a punishment to God; and by the same law are bound to suffer it: for we are bound unto obedience by the precept, and to punishment by the commination of the law. When sin is once past, the guilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is an obligation unto punishment, remains. The punishments which man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, and God doth threaten, are not only bodily and temporal, but spiritual and eternal: The reason and cause why sin doth render the sinner liable to the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God, and to so many and fearful penalties, not only of the loss of all those mercies God hath promised, but of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all those evils God doth threaten, is because it is so base and vile, and so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and unbeseeming so noble a creature as man is by Gods creation, that it must needs offend God, pollute man, and deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e him very much: its contrary to Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and holiness, and includes in it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods power and of his law, which is a mirrour of wisdom and righteousness. The sins of men are many, and of different sorts; there is sin original, sin actual, sin of omission, sin of commission, sin against
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105988:99"/>
the law of nature, sin against the law of grace, and a great inequality between these actual transgressions; some less, some more hainous, and such as may be several wayes fearfully agravated; and the more of will there is in any sin, the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous it is.</p>
                  <p>2. These sins and trespasses are said to be (Ours) so that we are chargeable with them and punishable for them. For though the Devil may tempt us, yet he cannot force us, cannot necessitate us. Though our wants, defects, and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be many, and our corruptions, what by nature, what by custom, be great, yet they are some ways from our selves. And we make our selves guilty by consent, so that our hearts are the chiefest subject, and also either the sole, or principal, or acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary causes of our sins. This consent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by our continuance in them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto them; and that especially, when we contrary to the light of nature, the law of God, and other means and motives of repentance walk according to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and lusts of our hearts. Therefore we must say <hi>Our trespasses,</hi> that we may charge our selves, and justifie God.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Forgiveness of Sins,</hi> the freeing of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:105988:99"/>
the party sinning from the sad and woful consequents of sin, and especially from the guilt, and so from the punishment; in this respect its called remission, or absolution, loosing, because pardon takes away the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation unto penalty. This act of forgivness presupposeth first, that sin is pardonable, and that without any violation or breach of justice; yet according to the rules of Gods proceeding with sinful man, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without satisfaction made unto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine justice. Therefore God to signifie that he was just and hated sin, yet willing to shew mercy to the sinner, required the bloody sacrifice of his dearest Son to be offered without spot unto his eternal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, before he would grant that any sin of man should be pardonable; and this blood must be pleaded by Christ in heaven before he would actually pardon any. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would this blood-shed pleaded be accepted for any but such as were peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and believing, and did rely upon this satisfaction and intercession. And this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from guilt doth not leave the party pardoned under the dominion of sin, which is the greatest penalty, but is alwaies joyned with sanctification of the divine Spirit, without which remission is to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:105988:100"/>
because the root of sin remains, and will be a cause of new sin, which will make man punishable again; when man is thus pardoned and purified, the greatest cause of shame, of fear, of grief, is taken away, Gods wrath averted, the sinner reconciled, adopted, and in a state of salvation, of peace, and joy, in hope of everlasting life. There is no sin but is pardonable in respect of Christ, death, Gods mercy, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral promise; yet upon impenitency and unbelief no sin, not the least shall actually be pardoned. There are some sins so hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and so directly contrary to the blood of Christ and the holy Spirit, and no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit can be expected from the blood, nor any hope of repentance to be wrought by that Spirit, which was never promised to renew such persons. These are sins to death, for which we must not pray. By forgiveness we are freed from the eternal punishment by way of prevention, from present pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment lying upon us by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval.</p>
                  <p>4. The party which can forgive, and to whom we sue for pardon, is God, yet as atoned and propitiated by the blood of Christ. This is proper unto him; for as he is the supreme Law-giver, so he is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:105988:100"/>
Judge, whose peremptory sentence is irrevocable; from him lies no appeal; who only knows the hearts of men seeking pardon, who alone can free not only from temporal but eternal punishments, and can execute his sentence to the full, which none else can do. He may make use of men to declare his sentence, and apply his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to such as by them being prepared may seem capable of pardon; yet their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and absolution on earth is so far good and valid, as he shall ratifie and make it effectual in heaven. This absolution by some is said to be only declarative, by others to be judicial; yet if it be passed by vertue of their commission and according to the rules of that commission from Christ, its judicially declarative. Therefore if man believe, Christ plead, the Church ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, and God justifie, who can condemn? who can lay any thing to our charge?</p>
                  <p>5. The parties who being capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, upon their prayers shall obtain mercy, are such as being conscious and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of their sins, are grieved, because they have offended God, hate sin, loath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, are willing to amend their lives, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves guilty, offer the sacrifice of an humble and contrite spirit, rely upon the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105988:101"/>
Death and Intercession of Christ, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and mercy of God, and are as willing to be merciful to their offending Brethren, returning unto them, as they desire God to be merciful unto them. These, and only these, are they who shall be washed in the Blood of Christ, and justified before the throne of God, and being justified, shall have peace with God, and joy in the hope of glory. In these words therefore we in all humility and godly sorrow, confessing our sins, and daily renewing our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, do earnestly pray that God for Christs sake would forgive our many and grievous sins, turn away his wrath, receive us into favour, look upon us as his children, give us joy and comfort, seal unto us a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by giving us his blessed Spirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, and sanctification, that so we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered from the terrours of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the accusations of the devil, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of hell, and fear of eternal death, may magnifie his mercy, and glorifie his name for evermore.</p>
                  <p>6. We pray, <hi>Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</hi> This petition is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin, and respects it as to come, and us as in danger to contract new guilt: for as before, so after our-penitent and believing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:105988:101"/>
Prayers made in this name of Christ, we have obtained remission of sin past, we may be tempted and overcom, and so sin again: therefore we pray <hi>to be delivered from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</hi> And here we must consider,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What temptation is.</item>
                     <item>2. What it is to be led into temptation.</item>
                     <item>3. What we pray for in these words.</item>
                     <item>4. What it is to be delivered from evil.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. To <hi>tempt</hi> in this place is taken in an ill sense, and to tempt is to sollicite and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade man to sin, and disobey the just and good and holy Laws of God: and seeing man is endued with understanding and free-will, the way is to delude his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and pervert his will, by represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that which is evil as good, and that which is good as evil, and by taking away the fear of punishment, and promising some happiness to follow, that so the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may assent to that which is false, and the will consent to that which is evil. Those suggestions are always false, and contrary to the holy Scriptures; and the thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded unto is against the Laws of God, which always should be the rule of our thoughts, words, and deeds: So likewise the swasives and motives are contrary to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105988:102"/>
the promises and the comminations of the word. And if we be ignorant of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, depraved in our hearts, or rash and inconsiderate, the tempter will have great advantage against us. The great tempter the devil, that old subtle serpent who delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our first mother <hi>Eve,</hi> perswaded her, that in transgressing Gods law, there was no fear of death, but certain hope of high advancement, as he is subtle, so he is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, restless, raging, knows our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, takes all advantages, and seeks our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting ruine. Besides the Devil, there are the wicked men of the world, who are his agents, who by their evil example, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, laws, promises, threats, preferments, persecutions, and many other ways seek to draw us unto sin: therefore if any person either fear men more then God, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral miseries more then eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or love himself more then God, and the world more then heavenly glory and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, then a little temptation will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily draw such an one into transgression. We are also said to be tempted in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect by our own lust or concupiscence; for when any occasion is offered, we are easily moved and overcome. Such is our ignorance and blindness, that our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:105988:102"/>
is easily deluded. Such is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our wills, that we are easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. This makes us like tinder, and we take fire at every spark of temptation: nay, we are so vile by nature, that our own corruption inclines us unto sin, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when there is no temptation from without, carries us violently into iniquity.</p>
                  <p>2. To be led into temptation is not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be tempted, but something more; for one may be tempted, and yet be in no great danger, because the party tempted may be so armed and prepared, that the temptation may be overcome, and that sometimes with ease: so that in such a case there is no great danger: but one may be said to be led into temptation, when the party tempted is weak, or surprized, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, or over-powred, or brought into such straits, that there is great fear of a foil, and little hope of escape, because of the advantage gained by the tempter, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage befallen the person tempted. In this case the danger is great, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation difficult, if not impossible to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercom. This is to be brought into the midst of potent enemies, plunged into the depth of great waters, and cast into the mouth of the Lion, and so sin is unavoidable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:105988:103"/>3. In these words we pray, 1. That God would so order all occurrences and events, that we may not be brought into straights; for this petition implies that nothing can come to pass without the providence of God, doing or permitting what he pleaseth, and ordering all events. Without his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission neither man nor devil can tempt us; without it Satan could not touch <hi>Job,</hi> nor be a lying Spirit in the mouth of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, nor enter so much as into the Herd of Swine. And the event of all temptations depends upon his will. 2. That when we are too weak, he would restrain the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and power of Satan. 3. That he would not suffer us to be secure, and so easily sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized. 4. That he would continually arm and strengthen us, that we may not only resist, but overcome. 5: That he would not suffer us to presume upon our own strength, or despair of his assistance. 6. That he would not desert us in the day of trial and great danger. 7. That he would so inflame us with the zeal of his glory, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess us with the fear of sin and his wrath, and the desire of heavens glory, that no earthly prosperity may much affect us, or any earthly affliction much daunt us; yet he requires that we acknowledg all our
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:105988:103"/>
strength to be from him, that the issue of all temptations depends upon him, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing our own strength we trust in him, that we continually watch and pray, and use all means to provide for our safety; and when we see and consider the fall of <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and other eminent Saints, how great cause have we to fear and be careful! This must be our daily prayer, and our earnest petition.</p>
                  <p>4. To <hi>deliver us from evil</hi> may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be a distinct petition from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or part of the same. In the former sense evil is not the evil of sin from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but the evil of affliction. And in this sense we desire God so to perfect and bless us, as either to prevent the miseries, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, afflictions, and adversities, of the world; or if we fall into them, that he would sanctifie them unto us, for our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good, give us strength to bear them with patience, and in the end deliver us out of them, and hasten that day and time, when there shall be no sorrow, pain, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but eternal peace and joy, when all sorrow shall flee away, and all tears be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from all faces, yet though God by these doth chastise and try us, yet the devil by them takes advantage to tempt us unto
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:105988:104"/>
many sins, and discourage us in the ways of godliness: So great is the frailty of man, that both in prosperity and adversity he is in danger, and in both hath need to pray to be delivered from evil: therefore the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God mixeth our joys with sorrow, and our prosperity with adversity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For thine is the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. Some make this no part of the body, but the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prayer. We find not these words in <hi>Luke,</hi> nor in many <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, nor in the <hi>Arabick,</hi> and therefore it may be a question whether our Saviour added them to this form of Prayer or no: but suppose them to be the words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, it's doubted whether that be a form of <hi>Doxology,</hi> or contain certain reasons for to move God to hear our petitions, or both. The words are found in Scripture, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 11. and there used in form of a Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and praising of God, which is a part of divine Worship, and sometimes joyned with petition, and oftentimes concludes the same; and in this sense it may be a part of prayer, and fit to be used when we depart out of his presence, and take our leave with our heavenly Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amen</hi> is made the conclusion, and by it we signifie our desire, that God would hear
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:105988:104"/>
us, and put his hand and seal to our petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and also our joynt consent in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires with him, who is the mouth of the people praying together; which implies that we understand the Prayers made, have attended to them, and approve them, and by this word make them Our Prayers. It's oftentimes a word of confirmation, and then it signifies [<hi>so it is;</hi>] sometimes a word of petition, and then it signifies [<hi>so be it.</hi>]</p>

                  <head>Sect. 5.</head>
                  <p>The matter of all these petitions may be reduced into the form of a Prayer in this manner.</p>
                  <p>1. O Almighty Lord, and in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus our most gracious Father, we thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Servants do here present our selves before the throne of Grace, and desire in the first place, and above all things, <hi>that thy name be hallowed,</hi> and thine eternal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and supreme dominion being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested more and more, both by thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed word and glorious works, we and all others may know thee to be God alone, who dost wonders, and glorifie thy name for ever, and give all glory, praise, and thanks to thee, that so all Atheists, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, prophane persons, Apostates, and rebellious wretches, may be convinced or confounded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:105988:105"/>2. That thy name be the more hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we sinful wretches eternally saved, let thy Kingdom come; that Christ at thy right hand may powerfully and gloriously reign, till all his enemies be made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool. O let thy word and spirit so mightily prevail, that all Nations may be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, submit themselves to Christ their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, thy Church enlarged from Sea to Sea, and from the river to the worlds-end, till the number of thy Saints be finished, and made perfect, and thou mayest rule in our hearts, till sin and the power of Satan be wholly and forever destroyed. Raise up a continual supply of faithful and godly Ministers, and good Kings, and Magistrates, which may be Defenders of the Faith, and nursing Fathers to thy Church, and pour down the gifts of thy Spirit in great plenty upon all flesh: break in peices the power of Satan, and all persecuting enemies: let death the last enemy be destroyed; make all thy Saints immortal, and bless them with eternal joy and peace, that so they may sing an eternal Hallelujah to thy name in the heaven of heavens, where there shall be no sin, no sorrow, no pain, but fulness of joy in thy presence, and pleasures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more at thy right hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:105988:105"/>3. That we may enjoy the priviledges, and attain the eternal felicity of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we desire that <hi>thy will may be done on earth as it in heaven;</hi> we do confess that by nature we are blind and ignorant, and have no power to do thy heavenly will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All our spiritual knowledge, wisdom, and power of obedience is from thee our God, and the good spirit of Christ. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is our condition as born of <hi>Adam,</hi> and brought up in a wicked world, and Christ hath given himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himself a peculier people zealous of good works; we beseech thee open our eyes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our understanding, that we may more clearly know thy heavenly Laws; and sanctifie our hearts more and more, that we may constantly and freely with joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, observe all thy holy and blessed Laws, O raise up our thoughts and affections that we may seek that glorious and eternal estate which thou hath prepared for those that love thee, and so renew our hearts that we may be zealous of thy glory, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie sin, bring forth the fruits of thy spirit, abound in good works, give good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto others, make our calling an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection sure, manifest that we are born
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:105988:106"/>
from Heaven, that so following the example of thy blessed Angels, and aiming at their perfection, may in the end be partakers of eternal bliss together with them.</p>
                  <p>4. Whil'st in this vale of tears we seek thy Kingdom, and endeavour to do thy holy will, we have need of many earthly comforts, as food, and raiment, and such things as without which we cannot live; we therefore pray thee <hi>give us this day our daily bread;</hi> we acknowledge that we have neither life, nor health, nor a morsel of bread, nor any place where to lay our heads but from thee our heavenly father. Be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therefore out of our fatherly goodness to give us good government, peace, safety, seasonable times, a comfortable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Estate, and a quiet enjoyment of the same. If we should ask for superfluities, dainties, and abundance, to spend them for to maintain our pride and seusual pleasures, we confess it were just with thee not to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto us, thou mights justly deny them: but we are contented with food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and other necessaries, and seek them from thee, that we may without distraction seek thy heavenly Kingdom. O pity the sick, the poor, the weak, the widow, and the fatherless, the stranger, and such as are
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:105988:106"/>
in want and oppressed; feed the hungry cloath the naked, deliver poor captives and relieve thy persecuted and distressed Saints! These mercies thou hast promised in order to our eternal happiness, whil'st we are in this vale of tears, until we come to our abiding city, where we shall have no need of these things. And we seek these at thy hands with hope to receive them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast promised them; yet we are resolved, that howsoever thou shalt deal with us, we will submit unto thy will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be contented.</p>
                  <p>5. O heavenly Father, tho' we should do thy will always, and from our heart in all things, yet we have often sinned, and done evil in thy sight, made our selves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and liable to eternal death, and have great need of thy mercy in Jesus Christ: therefore we pray thee, <hi>forgive us our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, as we forgive them that trespass against us.</hi> We do confess, that both in the state of Nature &amp; of Grace we often offend thee, and transgress thy holy laws; and besides the guilt of the first sin, which lies heavy upon us, and our inbred corruption, we are guilty of many actual transgressions. And these have been committed, not only
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:105988:107"/>
out of ignorance, or infirmity, or upon sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal, or violence of temptation, but many of them against knowledg, and some of them are very hainous, and of a crimson die; some are publick, some private, som open, some secret: neither is this all, but we har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den our hearts in them against the light of thy Gospel, the dictates of thy Spirit, thy patience and long-suffering, against thy mercies and deliverances, against thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements, and many gracious invitations, against thy dearest love, and the bitter suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Saviour. And these are the more hainous, because committed by us who have received so many mercies, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a long time so many powerful means of conversion, and have vowed better things. O how much hath thou done to convert us, and we are not converted! how miserable have we made our selves! what fearful punishments have we deserved! Oh take away these stony hearts of ours, give us hearts of flesh, and make us sensible of our sins, that we may loath our selves, and that our hearts may inwardly bleed, because we have offended thee so good a God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy tender mercies, the bitter suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Saviour, and thy gracious promises in him unto poor sinners. Shall he
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:105988:107"/>
dye on earth, and plead his blood in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we confess our sins, and yet not obtain mercy! O pity, spare, forgive, turn away thy wrath, cast us not out of thy presence, take not thy holy Spirit from us, deny us not the joy of thy salvation. And this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy we desire with the greater hope, because we desire to forsake our sins, put our sole and whole confidence in our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and are willing to forgive, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to such as trespass against our selves.</p>
                  <p>6. O Lord, thou knoweth our frailty, the great danger of temptation, which is such, that though we be sanctified, and sin past pardoned, yet we may fall into sin again, and so contract new guilt; therefore we humbly beseech thee, <hi>Lead us not into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</hi> Satan is cruel, subtle, raging; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations many times very violent: we live in a wicked world, weich is full of snares; there is no time or place of absalute safety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O therefore strengthen our faith, arm us with thy compleat armour from heaven, support us, assist us, watch over us continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that we mast stand firm against all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of the enemy, keep the faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing watchful, and humbly depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee our God, may obtain a final
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:105988:108"/>
victory by the power of our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who hath overcome the world, and triumphed over the powers and principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of hell: Desert us not at any time, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially not in the day of fiery persecutions, bloody conflicts, and the hour of greatest trial: Order all occurrences and events by thy wise providence in such a manner, as that in greatest straits we may find a way to escape; and tho' we cannot avoid always the evil of afflictions, yet we may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the evil of sin: Sanctifie all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions both of prosperity and adversity unto us so, that Satan by them may not gain any advantage against us. Tread him shortly under our feet, and put an end to all our troubles, and hasten to give us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal peace and safety. Lord hearken unto these our prayers, which we offer unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ; to whom with thee and thy Spirit, all praise, glory, honour, and thanks, be given now and for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Prayer may be contracted into four words, yet retaining the principal matter; or more enlarged in the several heads, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, if we consider the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies pray'd for once received, we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a form of thanksgiving, and the same
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:105988:108"/>
may be reduced to order, so as to render thanks for blessings and deliverances; which may be considered as publick of Church or State, or private, as of Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, Families, persons: the blessings are either spiritual or temporal, the deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are so too; for they are from sin, or guilt, or from temptation, or from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of this life, And here it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, 1. That all the Prayers in Scriptuer may be reduced to the several heads of this form, which, tho' it contracts the matter of Prayer unto a few heads, disposed in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order, yet leaves it indifferent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will begin our more general Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with Thanksgiving or Petition, and in presenting our petitions, whether we shall begin with supplication for blessings, or with deprecations for deliverance from evil. The principal thing is to pray to God alone with an upright heart in the name of Christ for such things as God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that we may be accepted and heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>YOu heard before that there were two parts of the Commission granted by
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:105988:109"/>
Christ unto his Apostles; the first was a mandate to go to all Nations, to disciple them, to baptize them discipled, to teach them baptized to observe all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the second a promise, of which I will now speak in a few words, and so conclude. And we must observe,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The reasons why Christ made this promise.</item>
                     <item>2. The words of the promise partly exprssed here, partly <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 17, 18.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>There were several reasons, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Christ to add this promise: For 1. as the death of Christ did trouble them much, so did his departure; he must go and leave them behind him: he was their dearest Lord, whom they loved; he was their joy, their solace, their guide, and their protector, and to part with him went near their hearts. All this Christ under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; and therefore to comfort and revive their sinking spirit, that so, though he withdraw his bodily presence, yet they may be encouraged to go on with the work, he adds this promise, because he would be present with them in another and more effectual way. 2. The work was very difficult, and seemed to be far above their power, and they should be encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:105988:109"/>
with many fearful enemies, from whom they should suffer very much: the devil and the world would oppose them with all their strength; lest therefore they should be terrified, dejected, and depsair, he lets them know he will be with them, not only to strengthen and assist them, but to preserve them in the midst of greatest danger, and deliver them out of all their troubles. 3.

                  <p>In the words (which are) <hi>Loe I am with you always unto the end of the world,</hi> we may consider,</p>

                  <p>1. The persons to whom this promise is made, are first the Apostles; for to whom the commission is granted to them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:105988:110"/>
is made; and these are easily known to be all such as Christ intended to trust with the dispensation of Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. These were of two sorts, 1. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. 2. Ordinary. The extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, are the Apostles to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was made immediately and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for their place was high and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, their power great, and of large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, their work very difficult, their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings greivous, their enemies many, potent, cruel: these must lay the foundation, and plant the Christian Church in all Nations, confirm the doctrine of the Gospel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them with many signs, wonders, and gifts of the Holy Ghost: they must be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in word and writing, and leave their doctrine upon record to be a rule of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, faith, and life unto the worlds end: yet these must die, and when they had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished rhe great work, leave the world, and the Church which they had planted must continue, and must have her pastours and teachers, who must dispence both Word and Sacraments, in the generations follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till time shall be no more: Therefore the promise must be understood as made to all their lawful successors in the Ministry, till the number of Gods Saints be made
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:105988:110"/>
up: for what can those do, except Christ in their successive generations be with them? how should they go through with the great work without him? His presence thefore was necessary unto them also, without this promise, both made and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto them, their Ministry cannot be successful and effectual, for the conversion, edification, and salvation of the Church: yet here we must observe, that though Christ promise his extraordinary presence to the Apostles, yet his ordinary presence will be sufficient for their successours.</p>

                  <p>The person who made this promise was Christ otherwise, the promise of Man or Angel had been to no purpose: he that had all power in heaven and earth, and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the four fold mandate, did give the promise, and he was only fit to do it; for there can be no doubt either of his fidelity or power; as he was able, so he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make good what he had said, and his word was his deed, and will be so unto the end. He, and he alone could procure the Spirit, and send him down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; the Angels were at his command, all creatures at his beck; and as he had begun, so he was resolved to finish the work of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:105988:111"/>
mans salvation: This his purpose he might have concealed, or reserved to himself a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; yet he was willing to promise, and by a promise not only to signifie his mind, that they might know it to their comfort, but also to bind himself unto them: And now he cannot go back. This promise is a ground of unspeakable comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to all faithful Ministers, and doth assure us the Church shall continue to this worlds end.</p>

                  <head>Sect. 4.</head>
                  <p>The third thing to be considered is the thing promised, and that is Christs certain presence with them to the worlds end where we have</p>
                  <list>

                  </list>
                  <p>1. His presence is signified in these words, <hi>I am with you,</hi> which implies, that he will not be against them, nor will he be absent from them; for there are enemies who are against us, and there are friends which are absent and far from us, but Christ will not be an enemy, or a Friend at distance. 2. It's Christ that will be present, <hi>I will be with you,</hi> and thats more then if all men and Angels should be for us, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:105988:111"/>
ever present with us. 3. This presence is not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, for Christ was justly after this promise taken up into Heaven bodily, and the Heavens must contain him till the restitution of all things. 4. Its a spiritual presence, and the same far more excellent than that of his body: for though a body may at several Times be present in many places, yet it cannot be present in more places than one at one time: but Christ by his Spirit might be with them in all places, at all times; for he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised before his death and passion to send the Comforter, which should comfort their hearts in his absence, teach them and lead them into all truth: and upon Penticost he sent down his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon the Apostles, which hath continued, and will continue in the Church for ever. 5. This is not a bare or meer presence, for so this Spirit is present in all places at all times; neither is it a presence with some general power: for so he is with all things to preserve them: But its a special presence with a special active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for spiritual ends to produce spiritual and supernatural effects. It is a presence not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to comfort, strengthen, assist and deliver them, but also a powerful presence to make their Ministrry effectual for the eternal Salvation of mens Souls. This Holy Ghost discended and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Christ, when he was ready to preach the Gospel, and execute publickly his Offices. When he first sent these Apostles, he gave them the gifts of this Spirit. After his Resurrection he breathed on them saying, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghost,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to stay at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and wait for this Spirit; upon the day of Pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecost, as before, this Spirit came upon them. By this Spirit all the Members of the Church are sanctified, the Ministers qualified, the Word and Sacraments
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:105988:112"/>
made effectual, and sentence of the Church so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and of such mighty force. Take away this spirit, you take away the life and soul of the Church, the power of the Ministry, the efficacy of Word and Sacraments, and without it all the Preaching, Praying, and other works of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry will not be able to convert or comfort one Soul. Its said, <hi>I will be with you,</hi> that is, with you mine Apostles, and your Successors in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, to assist, and bless, and guide you in the discharge of your trust, and execution of your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Dispense you the Word and Sacraments, &amp; by the faithful observance of my mandate endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to save poor Souls, and in that work I am with you, no ways else; so that such as are most faithful and diligent, are most certain of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious presence. Here is no promise made unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular Church or Ministers more than to others; here is no express mention or intimation of the Bishop or Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or <hi>Antioch,</hi> or <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The promise is made to the Church in general and their Ministers, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to such as are most faithful in their place and office.</p>

                  <p>This is the presence: the continuance of this presence is the second thing observed, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in two words.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Always, or every day.</item>
                     <item>2. To the worlds end.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. Always signifies that there shall be no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission or interruption of Christs presence and assistance. He will not absent himself, or neglect them, or desert them for a day; so that they shall never have any cause to complain,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:105988:112"/>
or say, where is my Saviour now? whether is he gon? why hath he forsaken me? There may be sad and woful times, wherein Christ may seem to hide his face, and to have forgotten them for a certain time; yet even then Christ is with them and his faithful Ministers, though he doth not appear, and instantly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest himself. He must be with them always, or else he breaks his promise, and that he will never do: Let us therefore do our duty always, and Christ will be always with us.</p>
                  <p>2. He will be with us to the worlds end: this may be a longer, this may be a shorter time: Some understand the last period, and end of that present generation, the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the death of the Apostles: and the reason of this opinion may be because some take the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to be personal, and to be made only to the Apostles for their lives; yet this is rather a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit than any solid well grounded truth, especially seeing the end of the world in other places signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies either a far longer time than the life of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man on earth, unto the consummation of the creatures, and to all eternity. So the person or the time of the final judgment, when the world shall be no more, but Christ shall raise the dead, deliver up the Kingdom to the Father, and God shall be all in all; for when the number of Gods Saints is finished, there will be no need of Word or Sacraments, or Ministers, and then this promise is performed to the full. But whilst these continue as they shall continue to the end, Christ is bound, and will certainly be with them, that he may make his redemption effectual by them in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </p>
                  <p>3. The certainty of this perp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>

seems to be implyed in the note of attention (<hi>Loe</hi>) and in the verb of the present tense; for Christ doth not say (I will be) but (I am) with you: for nothing is more certain than that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Besides, some Copies have (<hi>Amen</hi>) added, which is a strong confirmation of the promise. But this certainly doth chiefly depend upon the power and fidelity of Christ, who hath made the promise, and hath kept it in all times unto this day: And the particle (<hi>Loe</hi>) doth require as their, so our special attention, and serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, both of the person promising, and the thing promised, that they might be fully assured of performance to the utmost. By vertue of this promise it is come to pass, that in the midst of the tumults and confusions of the world, and af ter the ruine of so many glorious kingdoms, of so many potent Empires, and of so many flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Churches of particular Nations; yet an universal Church with Word, Sacraments, and Ministry, do continue to this day, and the gates of Hell could never yet prevail against it: so that we may take up the Words of the Psalmist, <hi>Come behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth; the Lord of Hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge: for this God is our God, for ever and ever, he will be our guide unto death.</hi>
