            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT is not the sense of the mighty Favours I stand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for, that moves me to presume to dedicate this Work to Your Majesty; for Debts to Sovereigns are above all acknowledgement. Nor is it
<pb facs="tcp:54711:3"/>
Protection I sue for under so August a Patroness; the Subject carries its own Security and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence along with it, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Stile be not proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to such Glorious Matter. It is Justice that leads me to lay this most Wonderful History at Your Majesties Royal Feet. To whom could I tender the unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Undertaking of Your Kingly Progenitors, but to You their inimitable Offspring? To whom could I offer up the Most Heroick Atchievements of Your Forefathers Subjects, but to You the Most Glorious of their Line? In fine, to whom could I yield up the more than Human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests of Your Country, but to You the Most Admired of the Portugues Race? These are the Motives, these the Inducements that prevail with me, not only
<pb facs="tcp:54711:3"/>
to hope, but even to assure my self of a Gracious Acceptance of this, though seemingly Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, yet in reality most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive Tender of my First Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking in this Nature. A Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject so Glorious does not need the Ornament of Retorick. The Sacred History, than which none can be more surprizing or won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, is delivered to us in the plainest of Language. Great Actions are still Great, though exprest in the meanest Words: But mean Undertakings require a florid Stile to gain them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Reputation. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is worthy Your Majesties acceptance, though the Style may not appear equal; that will make amends for this, and the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the later will be hid by the grandeur of the former. I would not confess a Guilt by
<pb facs="tcp:54711:4"/>
begging Pardon; a wilful Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against so much Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would deserve no Mercy. God himself whose Great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute is Mercy, does not hear our Cries, if we persist to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his Wrath. Why then should I expect Forgiveness, if I knowingly Transgressed? Yet being sensible of my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, I must cast my self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Your Majesties unlimited Goodness, thence to expect my Doom; which cannot fail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happy, having its depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on so Horoick and Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Royal a Spirit. In fine, Madam, I will neither be my own Accuser, nor pretend to justifie or make good my Cause; the decision of it I can leave to no more Tender or Favourable Judge than Your Majesty, in whom my Failings
<pb facs="tcp:54711:4"/>
may be assured to find Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, from whom my Zeal may hope to reap Honour, and to whom all Increase of Glory and Happiness is wished by,</p>

                  <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Will not tire the Reader with a long Harangue in commendation of this History; it will, I hope, speak for it self. Nor will I go about to vindicate the Translation; let it take its Chance and stand or fall by the Vote of the Ingenious. My design is first, to inform the Reader, that I have reduced this Work to a much lesser compass than the Original Spanish; yet at the same time nothing of the Historical Part is diminished, perhaps some of the Ornament. I have not omitted the most inconsiderable passage, nor lessned any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial circumstances; all that has been cut off is only long Speeches, for the most part
<pb facs="tcp:54711:6"/>
never thought of by those they are father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, only added by the Author to set out his Work; tedious Lists of Officers and Gentlemens Names who were present at any Considerable Actions, which Names are of no use to us; those of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in Chief, and such as particularly signalized themselves, being sufficient for History; and some flights and reflections of the Author, which only serve to make up the bulk of a Volume. And thus much said may suffice as to the bringing this Book into so small a compass. The next thing I have to offer is, that though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Actions this History contains may at first sight appear incredible, yet we must not therefore immediately conclude it to be fabulous; for upon second thoughts we shall not only find those very things possible but very practicable. It is hard to persuade such small numbers of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses could defeat such vast Armies, and take Towns fortified and strongly Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned; but all wonder must cease when we consider the Portuguses were Europeans, always much superior to the Asiaticks for valour; that those were men enured to continual Wars with the Moors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently well train'd and disciplin'd, these raw and confused Multitudes; that though
<pb facs="tcp:54711:6"/>
the Indians had Fire Arms, they were far inferiour to the Portugueses in the handling of them; that the Portugueses overcame as much by Policyas by Strength, sowing divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among those Princes, and dividing their own Subjects from them; that the Natives weary of their subjection to the Moors, were inclinable to change Masters, and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Portugues Yoke were lighter than that till then they had born. To be short, every judicious Person will find reasons enough to convince the possibility of those Actions, since it is allowed <hi>Alexander</hi> the the Great and many others overcame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Multitudes with handfuls of Men. Besides, though the Author sets down the number of Portugueses, I believe he does not always mention the Natives that assisted them, because the Glory of the Conquest belonged to the former. Yet if there be any so hard of belief as still to doubt, I will not be so positive or zealous in the behalf of my Author, as not to grant he may have strained some points, thereby to add to the Honour of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not so but in the main the Action is real as is demonstrable by their Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Asia,</hi> but so as the Circumstances might be somewhat heightned, the more to raise the admiration of those Undertakings.
<pb facs="tcp:54711:7"/>
Let none upon this score pretend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him as Romantick; for should we examine our own, and all the Histories of the World, we should not find one which hatred or affection has not added to or diminished. I will not be tedious, and shall therefore say no more in relation to the Author; and but one word as to the Translation, which is, that if the Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Learned shall find any fault with it, by any such I shall be glad to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of its defects, that they may be amended in the second and third Tomes which will soon follow this, that is my first in this Nature, after several years spent in far different Imployments.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE narrow Bounds of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> could now no longer contain the greatness of its Natives Hearts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carried on by a Glorious Boldness, they so far extended those limits, that they infinitely exceeded the measure of the first Matter. Great undertakings are subject to the dangers of great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments. But Fortune, whose on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care it then seemed to be, not to expose them to the Eyes of the World with any disgrace, having measured their strength and capacity, found it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to encrease their Dominions by adding to them at one time great part of <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania;</hi> then a greater of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> at
<pb facs="tcp:54711:8"/>
another time that vast extent of <hi>Asia,</hi> and lastly that not inconsiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>America,</hi> called <hi>Brazil</hi> or <hi>New Lusitania.</hi> Having conquered the <hi>West,</hi> they passed to the <hi>South,</hi> and having subdued this they went on to the <hi>East.</hi> All they attempted with their Arms, they perfected with their Fortune, who seemed to be listed in their Service. Such was their Conduct in the most difficult Enterprizes, whereby they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged themselves so as to have room to breath the greatness of their Spirits, that what in other Nations by reason of its immoderate greatness would have threatned ruin, in this seems a most admirable Ornament of most various matter wherewith the Temple of the Christian Fame is illustrated and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. At length these Great Spirits spread themselves over all the Land and Seas, and to make the whole circumference of them their bounds, overrunning that vast distance that is from the Coasts of <hi>Spain</hi> to those of <hi>China,</hi> and filling both the Hemispheres with the Glory of their Name. They followed the Sun from his Setting to his Rising, and equalled his Course. The Exploits per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this wonderful Course in
<pb facs="tcp:54711:8"/>
the space of 233 Years are the subject of this Second Work, which I now take in Hand, pursuant to what I promised in the first of our <hi>Europe;</hi> the general applause that has met with, calls on me for the performance of this. Here will be seen Actions, by how much the more admirable, the less Credible, and indeed more truly real, than in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance probable. For though true, it does not seem likely, that sometimes 100 Men indifferently Armed, should encounter great Armies much better provided. These are the Actions which may justly entitle the Performers to be stiled Heroes; a Name since given gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis to whom it was not due. For a great number to overcome a lesser, though equal in Arms and Courage, is rather the effect of Number than Valour, and seems to carry more of Cowardise than Virtue. Hence it is that those who are so overcome, though they lose the Field do not lose the Glory; but if duly weighed, merit the greater Esteem, for that they dared encounter at so great a disadvantage. We may therefore with reason affirm, that the Portugueses on these occasions merited admiration, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Conquerors or Conquered; as
<pb facs="tcp:54711:9"/>
Conquerors, for having overcome; as Conquered, for having dared much. This had been before their Fate in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> against the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes that overrun all <hi>Spain.</hi> Let us see whether the same Fortune attends them in <hi>Asia.</hi> Without doubt it does. Soon shall we see innumerable Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes flying from their small Numbers, and looking back with amazement to see who pursues and destroys them. We shall see them drove by the terror of the Looks, not the Number of those who press them. We shall see Battels fought with such resolution, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Victor shall rejoice, nor the Overcome lament. In Sieges, such bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous obstinacy, that despairing of Victory, they will burn themselves with all they hold precious, that their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may reap no other Fruit of their Conquest but the dismal spectacles of the Flames. We shall see not only Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but Rage and Despair overcome. The toil of coming at the Enemies will be greater sometimes than that of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating them. We may be sometimes overpowered by Number, not overcome by Valour; for though upon some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions Fortune forsook all, yet few were
<pb facs="tcp:54711:9"/>
forsaken of their Courage. These Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirits looked upon the hardships of the Campagne, no otherwise than if they had been the conveniences of their Houses, and upon doubtful Battels, as sure Victories. With the first they began to raise, I will not say Forts, but Draughts of those they afterwards erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To these, and chiefly to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol of <hi>Goa</hi> shall be brought by force, or come through fear, many Princes in Chains, and many by their Embassadors. Nothing will appear in that Noble City but Triumphs. Nothing less in the Triumphs, than the People and Riches of all <hi>Asia;</hi> these in the Hands of the Conquerors, and those in the Chains of their Captivity. But there is nothing in them we look upon with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, than the Elephants loaded with Castles, and the Carriages with Guns, which not long before were our Terror; these for their Greatness and Number, those for their Number and Rarity. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which we value above all, and which was the chief ground of all these Undertakings, will be more exalted, trampling upon Idolatry, for at each stroke of the Evangelical Sword fell a thousand Idols of the Pagods; and a
<pb facs="tcp:54711:10"/>
thousand Pagods in the Theaters of Battle. It will appear that many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies held themselves in greater account for being overcome by us, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence thereof the Conquerors and Conquered joined and united in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bonds of frequent Marriages; and many overcoming those by whom they had before been defeated, under our Ensigns; and that the Monuments of our Victories are not now Broken-arms and Warlike Engines hanging on Trees upon Mountains, but Cities, Islands and Kingdoms, first groaning under our Feet, and then worshipping our Government. Some warned with the Example of others Ruins, shall prevent their own, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of our Proposals. For in the beginning we invited all to embrace our Amity; esteeming it a greater happiness to gain voluntary Friends, than to make forced Slaves. By express Order from our Kings, we endeavoured to heap great Riches, extend our Dominions, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Glory rather with Politick Reason, than Odious Violence. We modestly courted those, we could invade forcibly. In fine, we shall see the Portugues Arms not content with the <hi>West,</hi> piercing through and spreading over the <hi>East;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:54711:10"/>
sailing unknown Seas, trampling Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and incredible Difficulties; discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sundry Nations, planting among them firm Fortresses and other Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: And lastly, giving Honour to their Country, and Light to the World with their Discoveries and Conquests in so remote Regions. Thus taming various and obstinate Spirits and Humours, with Persuasions when they prevailed, and with Valour when they refused to hearken to us, we shall of sundry Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments compose a Body worthy those Noble Spirits that sailed thither, worthy the Zeal of those Kings who sent, and the Magnificence of the Captains that Commanded them. All the Actions shall be such as deserve not only to be equalized with the most Heroick of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, but even that these should be forgot to celebrate those, were not Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind subject to give more applause to what he hears, than what he sees. What is past is celebrated with Memory and Admiration, the present is treated with Oblivion and Envy. We are persuaded the one lessens, the other instructs us; and even in the present there are Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as proper for our instructions, as the most famous in decayed Antiquity.
<pb facs="tcp:54711:11"/>
This Book without doubt will prove it. I will answer it. As the Power of Man is by so much the weaker, by how much God declares himself more offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at them; so it is the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by how much he is the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious. His Omnipotence seemed now to be pleased with these his Conquerors, (for indeed they were his) so that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it will always be doubtful which was most to be admired, whether their Conquering so much, being so few, or the daring Attempt, it being no greater a Number. Such was the success where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they gained every thing, it looked as if the World had chose them to be the Universal Lords. Nor did they seem to be sent as Souldiers, with Arms to wage War, but as Leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rs, with power to give Laws. Who then will admire that the whole circumference of the Earth should submit to so small a number of such Heroick Spirits, they being rather led by Auspicious Fates, than Valiant Generals? Never had they fallen from this height, had not their own oversights and distractions been the cause of their fall, that Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that had so much exalted being no longer able to bear with them. This
<pb facs="tcp:54711:11"/>
will oblige me to relate some things, which it were more proper for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my Country should be buried in oblivion than published; but the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of History requires nakedness, and gives as good an Example to Posterity, condemning vicious and base Actions, as commending the Just and Virtuous. Fortune having been lavishly liberal to us, we had no less than reason to suspect she could not be very durable. For Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Affairs having no fixt point, it is plain that those who arrive at the height, must again fall as low as the various ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of volubility it self can carry them. As great as the Exploits, were the Riches obtained by them, and as great as these the Vices they ushered in. The cause of these great Evils is, that there are Men, who not content to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess what they only could have wished, would obtain what even in wishes ought not to be sought after. We shall see some, who coming poor into the wealthy Indies, left them poor that they might come out most wealthy. This is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, but much more to be lamented it is, that the Example of many who came from thence without Fortunes when in its splendor, was of no force to curb
<pb facs="tcp:54711:12"/>
others from making vast Estates when groaning under its Calamities. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings will not be very bulky, for the greatest things never had great begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. All things in their Original are small and almost contemptible. The greatest Exploit and most glorious Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory had its beginning in the Stable of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> fifth Son of King <hi>Iohn</hi> the First, accompanied his Father in the glorious taking of <hi>Ceuta,</hi> which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1415. and had a considerable share in the honour of this Victory, as well in regard of his Courage as Conduct, it being doubtful which was most predominant in him, and therefore the more to be admired, for that at this time he was but in the <hi>21th</hi> year of his Age. At his return from thence, he brought so great an inclination (being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready most skilful in the Mathematicks) to discover New Lands and Seas, that he spent above 40 years in this study, and vast Sums of Mony in bringing Masters from all parts, and Discoverers, and sending Vessels to his Discoveries. Being very well read in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, and having examined many who had travelled much of the World (chiefly the Moors of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco)</hi> he got some information of the <hi>Arabs</hi> who border on the Desarts of <hi>Africk,</hi> and of the <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagi</hi> and Kingdom of <hi>Ialof,</hi> near the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Guinea.</hi> That he might more wholly apply himself to these affairs, he chose for his abode the Town of <hi>Ternacabal</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Algarve,</hi> on Cape <hi>Sagres,</hi> whence the prospect of the Ocean stirred up his Hopes and Endeavours. Going to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54711:18"/>
Bed one night, with his thoughts fixt on these Designs; in the morning (as if he had received some heavenly assurance of success) he with all haste gave Orders for fitting out two Ships, which, and some other, passed not beyond Cape <hi>Bojador,</hi> 60 <note place="margin">1412.</note> Leagues beyond Cape <hi>Nam,</hi> then the Bounds of the Spanish Navigation. This Cape was <note place="margin">1415.</note> so called by <hi>Gilianes,</hi> who first passed it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it stretches it self out so far, <hi>viz.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most 40 Leagues to the Westward, which in Spanish is called <hi>Bojar,</hi> and thence the Cape <hi>Bojador.</hi> Its running so far Westward was also the cause that none passed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; as also that off of it for about 6 Leagues, runs a strong Current, which breaking upon the Sands, rises high and makes a great Sea. This terrified all, not considering, that keeping off at Sea they might turn the Point. The Prince encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the greatest difficulty, sent <hi>Iohn Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zales Zarco</hi> and <hi>Tristan Vaz</hi> in a small Ship, with Orders to coast along the <hi>Barbary</hi> shore, till they had passed that formidable Cape, discovering all the Land, which according to the Opinions of Learned Men and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Arabs,</hi> was concluded to run on till under the Equinoctial. Before they <note place="margin">1418.</note> reached the Coast of <hi>Africk,</hi> they met with such violent Storms, they doubted not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing swallowed by the Waves. The Weather obliged them not to follow their Orders, and without knowing where they were, fell in with the Island, which they called <hi>Puerto Santo,</hi> or Holy Haven, for such it appeared
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54711:19"/>
to them after the Storm. This is a little Island, not far to the Northward of the <hi>Madera.</hi> The Inhabitants they found nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well Civiliz'd nor quite Barbarous, but the Soil very fertile. The Prince joyful with this News and the hopes the Discoverers gave him, sent them again, and with them <hi>Bartholomew Perestrello,</hi> with three Ships, with Seeds to sow, and Cattle to stock the Place. They put in two Rabbets, which increased in such manner in two years space, that the Corn and Plants being destroyed by them, it was found more convenient to unpeople, than inhabit the Island.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Perestrello</hi> returned home. <hi>Iohn Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zales</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1419.</note> and <hi>Tristan Vaz,</hi> making another Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, discovered afar off something like a Cloud, and directing their Course to it, found an Island covered with all manner of Trees, whence they gave it the name <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera,</hi> which in Spanish is Wood. This Island for Extent, pleasant Air and Plenty is the chief in that Western Ocean. Each Discoverer entred a different part of the Island, and each had a Grant of that Part from the Prince, with the Title of Captain. <hi>Tristan</hi> gave his name to that Point where he landed, and <hi>Iohn Gonzales</hi> took to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Title of <hi>Camara de Lobos,</hi> or Den of Wolves, because of a Cave he found at landing, which seemed to be the habitation of those Beasts. The Prince gave the Island of <hi>Puerto Santo</hi> to <hi>Perestrello</hi> to people, which proved in vain by reason of the vast multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Rabbets. The Discoverers of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54711:19"/>
began to settle their Plantation, by firing part of that Wood that filled the Island; and the Flame took such possession, that it burnt seven years continually, and was seen far off in Smoak and Sparks like <hi>Mount Aetna;</hi> so that afterwards the Island being plentiful of Grain, the greatest want the Inhabitants suffered was of Wood, there having been nothing else in it before. There were Churches built, and now there is a Cathedral. King <hi>Duarte,</hi> Brother to the Prince, gave him the Island, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Spiritualities thereof to the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Order of Christ.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Prince had spent twelve years en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the discovery of <hi>Guinea,</hi> and was now much encouraged by the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of these two Islands, though many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned his undertakings, objecting, That the Land he looked for, was only Deserts, like those of <hi>Libia;</hi> that if any reached those Parts, they would turn black; that King <hi>Iohn,</hi> his Father, had invited Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to plant in <hi>Portugal,</hi> so far from send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out people, of which the Country was in want; that God had appointed those Countries for the habitation of Wild Beasts, which might appear by that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled that new Island by the Rabbets. All this time the Prince's undertakings were not only censured, but almost fruitless, till he sent <hi>Galianez</hi> in a Barque, who passed that, till then, Invincible Cape <hi>Boxador,</hi> which action was then in the common Opinion looked upon not inferior to the labours of <hi>Hercules.</hi>

5. <hi>Gilianes</hi> returned in his Barque with <note place="margin">1434.</note> 
                        <hi>Alonso Gonzales Balday,</hi> in a bigger Vessel than the former, and passed 30 Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Cape, where landing, they saw a great track of Men and Camels. Without any further knowledge they returned home, giving the name of <hi>Angra de Ruyvos</hi> to that Bay, (in English, <hi>Bay of Gurnets)</hi> because they found there great quantity of that Fish. The next year the Design was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <note place="margin">1435.</note> and they passed twelve Leagues far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Here putting ashore two Men on Horseback, who going on till the Afternoon, saw nineteen Men with Javelins, who fled and were pursued, and some wounded, and one of the Portugueses; the first Blood spilt in those Parts. <hi>Baldaya</hi> having notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, went ashore, but in vain, for the Moors fled; in the Cave where the Moors had been were found some things of inconsiderable value, but esteemed as an Omen of greater advantages. They run on twelve Leagues farther, where at the Mouth of a River they saw so many Sea-Wolves, they judged them to be 5000; they killed many, and brought the Skins, which being a novelty, were then had in esteem. Going farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land, they found Fishing Nets dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but no People, and their Provisions being spent, they were obliged to return to their Prince without any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Antony Gonzales</hi> was sent back to the <note place="margin">1440.</note> place of the Sea-Wolves, with orders to load his Vessel with their Skins. One night
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54711:20"/>
he went up the Country eight Leagues with ten Men, and spying a naked Man with two Darts in his hand driving a Camel, he came up and took him, the Man with the fright neither defending himself, nor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to escape. In his return he met a company of forty Moors, and one Woman, whom they also took in their sight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resistance; these were the first taken on that Coast. Returning aboard they found another Ship was arrived there from <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> under Command of <hi>Nunno Tristan;</hi> with this addition of strength they went ashore again, and met people at night, and being so close that they lost the use of their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, clasped each other in Arms, and knew not whom they held, but by being naked and cloathed, and the strangeness of the Language; they killed three and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their Ships with ten Prisoners. This Place they called <hi>Puerto del Cavallero,</hi> or <hi>the Knights Port, Antony Gonzales</hi> being there knighted by <hi>Nunno Tristan.</hi> An Arab that was on board understood these Moors; him and the Woman they put ashore to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the Inhabitants to redeem the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Next day appeared about 150, some on Camels, some on Horseback, provoking our Men to Land, but finding they did not, discharged a Volley of Stones at them and went off. <hi>Antony Gonzales</hi> returned to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> with some Slaves. <hi>Tristan</hi> having first careen'd, coasted on as far as <hi>Cabo Blanco,</hi> or <hi>White Cape,</hi> where though he saw the track of People, meeting none, he returned home.</p>

7. <hi>Antony Gonzales</hi> returns, carrying with <note place="margin">1442.</note> him the chief of the Moors he had brought, he promising to give seven <hi>Guinea</hi> Slaves for his ransom, but once ashore forgot his promise, yet giving notice in the Country, others came to redeem the two Young Men that were Prisoners, giving for them ten Blacks of several Countries, and a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity of Gold Dust, which was the first brought from those parts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Rivulet that runs up about six Leagues was called <hi>Rio del Oro,</hi> or <hi>River of Gold.</hi> This and a Shield of Buck-skin and some Ostriches Eggs they brought home, all men admiring the colour of the Slaves.

                        <hi>Nunno Tristan</hi> to undertake again the Voyage, and passing farther, discovered the Island <hi>Adeget,</hi> one of those of <hi>Arguim,</hi> and saw twenty Almadies or Boats passing over from the Continent, four men in each, sitting in such manner that they rowed with their Legs. <hi>Tristan</hi> launching his Boat with seven men, chased them and brought fourteen aboard, and going back for the rest, they had reached the Island. Hence they went over to another Island, which they called <hi>De las Garcas,</hi> or Island of Hauks, because of the vast numbers they saw there, and took some.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Profit encreasing, the desire of it also encreased. Some came from several <note place="margin">1444.</note> parts to <hi>Portugal</hi> to admire those Rarities the Natives brought. <hi>Lancelot</hi> the Prince's Servant, <hi>Galianes</hi> who first passed Cape <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jador,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54711:21"/>
Stephen Alonso, Roderick Alvarez</hi> and <hi>Iohn Diaz</hi> erected a Company in the Town of <hi>Lagos,</hi> paying an acknowledgment to the Prince, they asked leave to pursue these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and set out with six Caravels, whereof the first was Commander in chief; arriving at the Island, <hi>de las Garzas, Martin Vincent</hi> and <hi>Giles Vasquez</hi> with each fourteen Souldiers in their Boats, went over to the Island <hi>Nar,</hi> where falling upon a Town, they killed many and brought away 155 Prisoners, all Moors. The Captain <hi>Lancelot</hi> desiring to do the like, attacked <hi>Tider</hi> and other Islands, where he took above forty Prisoners, which he presented to the Prince, and was well rewarded.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Gonzalo de Cintra</hi> set out with one Ship, and coming to the Island <hi>Arguim,</hi> run up <note place="margin">1445.</note> a Creek at night, intending to go ashore, but the Tide ebbing he stuck, and in the morning 200 Moors coming upon him, he was killed with seven of his company. These were the first Portugueses killed in these Attempts, and from the Captain that place took name, being called <hi>Angra de Gonçalo de Cintra,</hi> fourteen Leagues beyond <hi>Rio del Oro. Antony Gonzales, Iames Alonso</hi> and <hi>Gomez Perez</hi> set out in three Caravels <note place="margin">1446.</note> bound for that River, with orders to treat of the conversion of these Barbarians, of Peace and Trade. The Proposals were not received, and they returned, bringing back one of the People of the Continent who came voluntarily to see our Country; and one of ours, called <hi>Iohn Fernandez</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54711:22"/>
there with the same design. Next <hi>Nunno Tristan</hi> made another Voyage, and brought twenty Slaves from a neighbouring Village, <hi>Dinis Fernandez</hi> in another Vessel passing the Mouth of the River <hi>Sanaga,</hi> which divides the <hi>Azanagi</hi> from <hi>Ialof,</hi> took four Blacks who were fishing in an <hi>Almadie</hi> or Boat. Sailing forward, he discovered the famous <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> and returned satisfied with this exploit, and having killed a great many Goats in an Island.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Antony Gonzales, Garcia Mendez</hi> and <hi>Iames Alonso,</hi> though separated by a Storm, <note place="margin">1447.</note> met again in the Islands of <hi>Arguim:</hi> Falling upon a Village they took 25 Moors, they flying, he that ran best took most, as <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Diaz</hi> who took seven, whilst others took but one, and some none. They called this Point, <hi>Cabo del Resoate,</hi> or <hi>Cape of Ransom,</hi> because some Blacks were ransomed there. The joy was the more for that they found <hi>Iohn Fernandez,</hi> who was left there the last Voyage, he was fat and in health, though rough like the Inhabitants. He told them, that the Country being all plane and open they often lost their way, and therefore were guided, as at Sea, by the Stars, the Winds, and by Birds. That the Inhabitants lived miserably, feeding on a certain Grain which the Earth produces without tilling, on some Herbs, Lizards and Locusts, all scorched in the Sun, which is predominant, that place lying under the Tropick of <hi>Cancer.</hi> That they used much Milk, not only as Meat, but Drink, by reason of the scarcity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54711:22"/>
of Water; and therefore when they eat any Meat they never kill the Female, because of the Milk; those near the Sea eat some Fish. When they were acquainted with our People, and they gave them Corn, they eat it whole. The Land is Barren being all Sand, bears a few Palm and Wild Fig-trees, they have no Houses but Tents, their Cloaths are Skins, and the better and neater sort wear Alhaiques, which is not unlike our Crape, and the best, some better sort of Cloath, but none good; their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the care of Cattle, their Language and Writings the same with those of the Coasts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> with only about as much difference as is between the <hi>Castillians</hi> and those of <hi>Gallicia;</hi> they have no King, and live by Hords or Companies. Returning home with this Account of <hi>Iohn Fernandez,</hi> at <hi>Cabo Blanco</hi> they killed some Moors and took 55.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Dinisianez da Gram, Alvaro Gil</hi> and <hi>Mafaldo de Setubal,</hi> with each a Caravel, landed in the Island <hi>Arguim,</hi> where they took seven Moors, and by the help of them forty seven afterwards. They ran along the Coast of the Continent eighty Leagues, and at several times took fifty Slaves, losing seven Portugueses, whose Boat being left dry by the Ebb in the Island <hi>de las Garzas,</hi> they were all killed. <hi>Lancelot,</hi> who once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had commanded a small Fleet, sailed from <hi>Lagos</hi> again towards <hi>Arguim</hi> as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of fourteen Vessels. At the same time set out from <hi>Madera, Alvaro</hi> and <hi>Dinis
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54711:23"/>
Fernandez</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Castilla</hi> and others, who all together with the former fourteen, made up twenty seven Sail: Nine of the fourteen of <hi>Lagos</hi> came to <hi>Arguim,</hi> where <hi>Dinisianez</hi> was, who persuaded them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Island in revenge of the seven that had been killed, but the Moors under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the danger, fled; so that only twelve were found, whereof only four could be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the rest killed, as also one of our men. <hi>Alvaro de Freytas</hi> returned with his three Ships. <hi>Lancelot</hi> with his sailed to the Island <hi>Tider,</hi> landed, and finding no People, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aboard, where seeing some Moors from the Shoar jearing our men, because they could not find them, two of our men were so provoked that they leaped into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their Arms, and swam to shoar to the Moors, who ran down to receive them. Others of our men seeing the danger those two were in, leaped after them, and on the shoar was a sharp skirmish; many of the Moors were killed and sixty taken. This done <hi>Suero da Costa</hi> and three more return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home. In a Village at Cape <hi>Blanco</hi> they took nine Moors, among them a Woman, who, promising a great Ransom, deceived <hi>Suero,</hi> for at the Island <hi>Tider</hi> the bold Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who could swim very well, leaped over-board and gained her liberty by swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ashoar. <hi>Lancelot</hi> and others unwilling to return without some Loading, as light as they came out, designed to sail to <hi>Zahara</hi> of the <hi>Azanagi</hi> and <hi>Guinea,</hi> but after some small attempts resolved for the Island of

They returned to <hi>Gomera,</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Castilla</hi> dissatisfied with the small Prize, base and ingratefully carried away Captives about twenty Islanders who were his Friends and had assisted him.

This was Prince <hi>Henric</hi>'s Motto, whereby he expressed his designs, and gave <hi>Lancelot</hi> to understand the <hi>Portugueses</hi> had been there before; - it was <hi>Alvaro Fernandez</hi> of <hi>Madera</hi> that was there. He stood along the Shoar, whilst <hi>Gomez Perez</hi> going up close in a Boat, threw a Looking-Glass and a Sheet of Paper with a Crucifix on it upon the Land to some Blacks that were there, who breaking and tearing them to pieces, poured in a Volley of Arrows, for which our men design'd to be revenged next day; but a great Storm which dispersed all our Ships prevented the execution. <hi>Laurence Diaz</hi> got home first, <hi>Gomez Perez</hi> put in at <hi>Rio del Oro,</hi> whence he brought one Slave, and many Skins of Sea-Wolves, and found the people there somewhat tractable. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varo Freytas</hi> and <hi>Vincent Diaz</hi> in the Island <hi>Tider</hi> took fifty nine Slaves. <hi>Diniz Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez</hi> and <hi>Palacano</hi> at Cape St. <hi>Ann,</hi> took nine more; twelve of our men swimming ashore for them.

He was well recommended by his King to the Prince, who at his Suit sent him with <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand Alonso</hi> who then went Embassador to the King of Cape <hi>Verde.</hi> They were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive him in hostile manner, but were appealed when two Blacks, who were the Interpreters, told them our design, the chief points whereof were the shewing them the Light of the Gospel, and teaching them a more civilized way of living. Their Farim or Governour, being informed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of came down to the Shoar, and sent an account of our arrival to his King. Mean while they began peaceably to trade. Some Elephants Teeth stirred up a desire in <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larte</hi> to see one alive. A Black offered to shew him one, and treacherously slew him and some of our men, which obliged us not to stay the coming of that King.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. KING <hi>Alfonso</hi> the Fifth took upon him the Government, and prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as his Uncle had done, those discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The first step he gave was a grant <note place="margin">1448.</note> to the Prince, that none without his leave should pass Cape <hi>Bojador;</hi> and also the fifth and tenth of all things brought from thence. The differences between the King and his Uncle Prince <hi>Peter,</hi> were a great stop to these affairs. Leave was granted the Prince to plant the Islands <hi>Azores,</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <note place="margin">1449.</note> by <hi>Gonzalo Vello;</hi> they are seven in number, their Names St. <hi>Michael,</hi> St. <hi>Mary, Iesus</hi> or <hi>Tercera, Graciosa, Pico, Fayall, Flores</hi> and <hi>Cuervo,</hi> which lies farthest to the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as does the first to the Eastward. They differ not much in Latitude, being about the same with <hi>Lisbon.</hi> The reason why they were so called, is from a great number of Hauks, which they call Azores, that were seen there when first discovered. In the last was found the Statue of a Man on Horseback, with a Cloak, but no Hat, his Left Hand on the Horses Main, the Right pointing to the <hi>West;</hi> there were some Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters carved on the lower Rock, but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.

trading for Gold and Blacks; the King or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Fort to be built in one of the Islands, and called by the same name; it was erected by <hi>Suero Mendez,</hi> who was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of it. At this time also were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Islands of Cape <hi>Verde</hi> by <hi>Antony Nole</hi> a Genoese, sent by that Republick to <hi>Portugal.</hi> He also discovered the Island <note place="margin">1460.</note> called <hi>Mayo,</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> because he arrived there the first day of that Month. Next day he saw the other two, which he named St. <hi>Philip</hi> and St. <hi>Iacob.</hi> The names of those not yet mentioned, are <hi>Fuego, Brava, Boavista Sal,</hi> St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> St. <hi>Lucy,</hi> St. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> St. <hi>Antony,</hi> in all ten. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called of Cape <hi>Verde,</hi> for that they lie 100 Leagues to the Westward of it. <hi>Pedro de Cintra,</hi> and <hi>Suero de Costa</hi> went as far as <hi>Sierra Leona.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. So great were the hopes of the <hi>Guinea</hi> Trade, and the returns stirred up covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, so that the King farmed this Trade to <hi>Fernando Gomez</hi> for 500 Ducats, a small sum in comparison of their present great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. He was obliged to continue the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries <note place="margin">1471.</note> 500 Leagues farther in five years. He fortunately discovered the Trade of <hi>Oro de la Mina,</hi> or the Gold of the Mine by <hi>Iohn de Santaren</hi> and <hi>Peter de Escobar.</hi> They went as far as Cape St. <hi>Catharine</hi> 37 Leagues beyond Cape <hi>Lope Gonzales</hi> in two Degrees and half of <hi>South</hi> Latitude. For this discovery was added to him the Sirname of <hi>Mina,</hi> and he was made Noble. <hi>Ferdinand Po</hi> discovered the Island which he called <hi>Hermosa,</hi> or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54711:27"/>
Beautiful, which name it changed for the Discoverers. The last discovery during the reign of King <hi>Alonso,</hi> was that of Cape St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> so called because discovered on her day. There were other discoveries before this, as the Coast from whence was brought the first <hi>Cochinilla,</hi> which the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (knowing the Value, but not the Name) call <hi>Grana del Paraiso,</hi> or Scarlet of Paradise, they had it from the Moors of this part of <hi>Guinea,</hi> who crossing the Country <hi>Mandin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> and Deserts of <hi>Libia,</hi> brought it to the Port <hi>Mundibarca</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> Now were found the Islands St. <hi>Thomas, Anno Bueno,</hi> and <hi>Principe,</hi> all neglected, the King being wholy bent upon <hi>Africk.</hi> How little these places were minded, may appear by this, that a Spanish Fleet commanded by <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia de Loaysa,</hi> Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> arriving at the <hi>Maluco</hi> Islands the year 1525. he found there were Portugueses there before it was known in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and found in two degrees of <hi>South</hi> Latitude, the Island of St. <hi>Mathew</hi> not inhabited, but with footsteps of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, several Fruit-trees, and tame Cattle, carved on the Bark of a Tree, that our men had been there 87 years before, and the French Motto of Prince <hi>Henry, Talent de bien Faire.</hi> It was the custom of those Sailers to leave this Motto in all places where they landed.</p>

                        <p>Discoveries and Conquests under King <hi>John</hi> the Second, from the Tear 1481. till the Tear 1495.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. KING <hi>Iohn</hi> the Second, who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Father <hi>Alonso,</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Riches of the Countries discovered encreased his Revenue, and finding the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives inclined to receive the Faith, ordered a Fort to be raised in that part where was the Trade of Gold called <hi>Mina.</hi> To this end he fitted out twelve Vessels laden with all Materials for the Work, from the Stones of the Foundation to the Tiles, with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for 600 Men, 500 of them Souldiers, the rest Workmen. The Commander was <hi>Iames de Azambuja.</hi> At his arrival he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Peace some time before conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with that People. He acquainted the Prince of it (called <hi>Camaransa)</hi> with his arrival and intention. He landed to take possession, and set up the Portugal Colours upon a Tree; at the Foot of it he made an Altar, and caused to be celebrated the first Mass that had been in those parts. He prepared himself to receive the Black King, who came attended with many of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects naked, save that from their Waste downward, hung Monkies Skins or cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of Palm-leaves: All armed, some with Shields and Javelins, others Bows and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54711:28"/>
Arrows; some had Skins for Helmets, in such manner they appeared more ridiculous than terrible. The Prince's Legs and Arms were covered with plates of Gold; on his Neck a Chain, with many small Bells, and Tags to his Beard. Before him went a great number of Instruments, more noisie than harmonious; all that were known were Tabors, Horns and Bells. He met the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with a grave and pleasing Countenance; the Captain received him with Gravity and Magnificence. The Black took his hand in token of Peace, the same the chief Men about him: After the Ceremonies (different in the Nations, but all vain and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent) <hi>Azambuja</hi> laid open his Kings design, which was first to instruct him in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, and conceal our Covetousness, asking leave to build a House for our Men to live in, which was to be a Fort to offend them upon occasion. I do not pretend to persuade the World, our only design was to Preach, on condition it be believed it was not only to Trade.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Portuges Captain was heard with wonderful attention, and the proposal of Religion admitted, but that of the House or Fort rejected; for they are Barbarians in our conceit, but not for their own Interests. <hi>Azambuja</hi> pressed, and <hi>Caramansa</hi> yielded and retired. The Workmen began to break a Rock for the Work, and the Blacks who adored it (taking that as an Affront) drove them away. <hi>Azambuja</hi> took the wisest course, and running to them, pacified them
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54711:29"/>
with many Gifts, not of value, but such as pleased. The Fort finished was called St. <hi>George,</hi> for the particular devotion the King had to that Saint. As it encreased it gained the name and priviledge of a City. <hi>Azam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buja</hi> remained there with 60 men, and sent back the Fleet laden with Gold. He held that Government three years, he gave it up with Honour (a thing rare among the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses) and was honourably rewarded.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The King began to take the Title of Lord of <hi>Guinea.</hi> The Custom till now had been to set up Wooden Crosses in all the new Discoveries; the King ordered for the future to carry them of Stone with the Kings and Captains Names, the Time when, by whom, and by whose Order erected. The first of <note place="margin">1484.</note> these was <hi>Iames Cam,</hi> who passing Cape <hi>Catharine</hi> (the last of King <hi>Alonso</hi>'s disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries) came to the River <hi>Congo</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the same Name, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Zagre.</hi> He went up the River, and saw on both sides Blacks, but were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by those he carried with him. By signs he found they had a King, and that he resided far off. He sent him Presents (the most powerful Arguments of Embassadors) but finding the Men that carried them stay long, he set sail, bringing some Blacks home with him. King <hi>Iohn</hi> was well pleased to see them, and dispatched again the same <hi>Iames Cam,</hi> sending back with him the Blacks joyful, with many Presents he gave them, but above all with the recovery of their Liberty. The first part of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54711:29"/>
was the Conversion of those Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. At his arrival he restored those Blacks to their Prince, and received the Men he left behind, with mutual admiration. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing on the Discovery, he ran 20 Leagues farther, setting up the Cross he called St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> in 13 degrees of <hi>South</hi> Latitude, and another in 22. At his return to <hi>Congo,</hi> having seen the King, he found in him such an affection to our People and Religion, that he sent with him to <hi>Portugal</hi> some Sons of his Chief Men, desiring they should be baptized, and being made Christians return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with them Ministers to instruct them in the Faith. They were baptized at <hi>Beja,</hi> where the King and Queen were God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father and Godmother to the chief of them, and he called <hi>D. Iohn,</hi> his Heathen Name being <hi>Zacuta;</hi> the same was done by the Nobility, with the others, whose Names and Sirnames they took. Betwixt the Fort of St. <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Congo,</hi> is the Kingdom of <hi>Benin.</hi> The King hereof covetous of the advantages he saw others reap by our Trade, feigned he would be converted, and desired Priests for his instruction; but they being sent, the design was discovered, and so the effect ceased, but not the covetousness; for those Heathens bought Christned Slaves, and we with the same avarice sold them, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized, knowing their new Masters would again make them fall into Idolatry. This lasted till the Religious King, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Third, forbid it, though to his great loss; but God who gives an hundred for

one, to requite him ordered that another Gold Mine should be discovered below that of St. <hi>George,</hi> whence much more was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a Crime, than had been before by that so scandalous a Trafick.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. King <hi>Iohn</hi> was informed by the <hi>Benin</hi> Embassador, who came to desire the Priests should be sent them, that 250 Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them was the most powerful Prince of all those Countries, called <hi>Ogane,</hi> by whom the Kings of <hi>Benin</hi> for their security were confirmed, receiving of him a Staff with a Head and a Cross like that of <hi>Malta,</hi> all of Brass curiously wrought. An Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador went with Rich Presents to solicit these Ensigns of Royalty, who never saw <hi>Ogane,</hi> because he speaks from behind Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, but at their departure shews a Foot, in token that he grants their Request. Our King imagined this Prince might be he that is vulgarly called <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these Formalities with what he had heard reported of him. He fitted out three Ships, commanded by <hi>Bartholomew Dias;</hi> he set up a Cross in 24 degrees of <hi>South</hi> Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, 120 Leagues beyond the other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers in <hi>Sierra Parda.</hi> He sailed in sight of the Bay they called <hi>de los Vaqueros,</hi> or of Herdsmen, because of the many Cows they saw there; beyond this they touched at the small Island <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> or Holy Cross, so called from one he set up: 25 Leagues far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they came into the mouth of a River which they called <hi>del Infante,</hi> the Sirname of the second Captain, who was the first
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54711:33"/>
that saw it. Being about returning they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that so many Ages unknown Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, which they called <hi>Tormentoso,</hi> or Stormy, because of a great Tempest they met with there; but our King gave it the name of <hi>Cabo de Buena Esperança,</hi> or Cape of Good Hope, for the great hopes it gave of discovering the Indies. There was set up the Cross St. <hi>Philip.</hi> The two first Ships coasting along met the third with only three men aboard, having lost it nine Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with nine Men in it then. With meer joy of seeing the others (a strange, but not unheard of death) one of the three died, the other six had been killed by the Blacks. With various fortune observing the discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Country they arrived in their own, the extent of Land till then found out, being 750 Leagues.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Whilst these Discoverers conquered the difficulties of the Seas; <hi>Peter de Covillam</hi> and <hi>Alfonso de Payva</hi> travelled by Land, who came first to <hi>Naples,</hi> then to <hi>Rodes,</hi> to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, Grand Cair,</hi> then with a Caravan of Moors to <hi>Toro</hi> on the Coasts of <hi>Arabia.</hi> Here they parted, <hi>Payva</hi> towards <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Covillam</hi> for <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> having appointed a time when to meet again at <hi>Grand Cair. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villam</hi> went to <hi>Cananor, Calecut</hi> and <hi>Goa</hi> (fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cities in the <hi>East)</hi> passed thence to <hi>Zofala</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> then to <hi>Aden</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> on the side of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and at last to <hi>Grand Cair,</hi> where he found his Companion had died. After these had been sent out two Jews, <hi>Rabbi Abraham</hi> of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54711:34"/>
                        <hi>Beja,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Lamego. Covillam</hi> sent back the latter to inform the King of his success, with the other he embarqued for <hi>Ormuz,</hi> where having observed what was most remarkable, he left the Jew to follow the Caravans of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and returning to the <hi>Red Sea</hi> came to discover the Court of <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> who detained him there as a Spie. But while he was detained, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from <hi>Rome, Luke Mark,</hi> an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Priest, sent by <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> to our King. This Priest's information revived the Kings hopes and desires, and he was sent back with an Account of what means had been used to settle a Correspondence, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for the perfecting of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Before <hi>Luke Mark</hi> parted from <hi>Portugal,</hi> was arrived <hi>Bemoi</hi> Prince of <hi>Ialof.</hi> He came with State, and was received accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, being conducted to Court by <hi>Don Francisco Coutinno</hi> Count of <hi>Marialva.</hi> His strangeness did not cause so much admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he conceived of the Majesty and Grandeur with which the King received him under his Royal Canopy. This was the cause of his coming. <hi>Biran</hi> who reigned in <hi>Ialof,</hi> giving himself up to all manner of Vice, resigned the Kingdom to his Brother <hi>Bemoi,</hi> with the reputation of delivering it to a Person in all respects worthy of the Royal-dignity. But <hi>Cibitah</hi> the elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, envious of <hi>Bemoi</hi>'s happiness, kills <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> and seizing the Government, makes War upon <hi>Bemoi,</hi> who with the assistance of <hi>Gonzalo Coello,</hi> sent by King <hi>Iohn,</hi> made
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54711:34"/>
some resistance. This relief was sent him by reason of the hopes he gave of receiving the Faith. But it being suspected he only designed to make use of the Portugues as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, the Captain was ordered to leave him, which was a great grief to <hi>Bemoi.</hi> He gave such excuses for not being presently baptized as seemed sufficient, and losing soon after a Battle, he went to <hi>Portugal</hi> to seek a more favourable turn of Fortune.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. It was no small part of his Fortune to <note place="margin">1489.</note> be received by so great a Prince, but above all to the hopes of Eternal Happiness, being soon after baptized by the name of <hi>Iohn,</hi> which he took from the King who was Godfather. Next day he gave him Arms, Purpure a Cross Or within an Orle of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi> He in return did homage to the King for all the Lands he should be posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of. Twenty four Gentlemen of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue were baptized with him. There was great rejoycing, our People shewing their grandeur in such divertisements as were most in use then; and <hi>Bemoi</hi> with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue giving a view of their Activity in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Alighting, and Mounting upon a Speed, standing upright on the Saddle Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping, and some in their Career took up Stones off the Ground, and much more, worthy admiration. The King furnished him with twenty Caravels well manned and armed, as well to forward his Restoration as to build a Fort on the River <hi>Zanaga.</hi>

                     <p n="8">8. The Province of <hi>Ialof</hi> lies between the two famous Rivers <hi>Gambea,</hi> or rather <hi>Rio

It is navigable 150 Leagues up, where a ridge of perpendicular Rocks crosses it in such manner, that the Water falling down, forms an Arch, under which Travellers pass dry, and pleasant to behold, but makes a hideous noise with the fall. The <hi>Gambea,</hi> or <hi>Rio Grande,</hi> runs 180 Leagues, and carries more Water; it is not all Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, but runs with less noise, though fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many Rivers that water the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>Mandinga.</hi> Both these Rivers flow out of the famous <hi>Niger,</hi> and may as well be esteemed but so many Mouths thereof. There is great variety of Fish in these Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and several other Creatures along them, as Horses, Crocodiles and Serpents with Wings; the other Beasts that abound are Elephants, Ounces, Wild Boars, and a many more. Great are the numbers of them, and wonderful their variety and different forms. The Waters of the two Rivers mixt cause Vomiting, yet each asunder does not. In this part is that great Cape called <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> by <hi>Ptolome C. Assinarium,</hi> in about 14 degrees of <hi>North</hi> Latitude. The Country runs 170 Leagues Eastward, is most fruitful, and has many populous Cities.

This trade moved King <hi>Iohn</hi> to build the Fort on the River <hi>Zanaga.</hi> The 20 Caravels were commanded by <hi>Peter Vaz de Cunna,</hi> who landing with D. <hi>Iohn Bemoi</hi> the King, and beginning to raise the Fort in the place assigned, either suspecting that he deceived him, or fearing to die in that Country, basely killed the King, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring with that Foul Crime to hide another not so hainous, which was to return without finishing the Work, and in fine he came back without any effect.</p>

From the Waste upwards he was naked, the lower part wrapt in Sky-colour Damask, on the Left Arm a Bracelet of Brass; from his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54711:36"/>
Shoulder hung a curious Horse-tail, a Royal Badge among them; on his Head a thing like a Miter, of a delicate Webb, made of Palm, which resembles wrought Velvet. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ceremonies, he desired to see the Holy Vestments: He viewed them with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and respect, in presence of his Queen, Children and the Chief of the Court. Then he gave leave to build a Church, which was done in few days, of the invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Cross, because begun the day of that Feast in <hi>May.</hi> In this Church was baptized the King, and some of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there being above 100000 present, as well for that they flocked to see the Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as because they were preparing for a Neighbouring War. The King was called <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Queen <hi>Ellenor,</hi> in honour of our Sovereigns. Afterwards were baptized the greatest part of those had flocked thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The New Christian King went to meet his Enemy, relying more on his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and the Cross in the Colours he had received from <hi>Ruy de Sousa,</hi> than in 80000 men he had in Arms, nor were his hopes vain, he returned with Victory, and <hi>Ruy de Sousa</hi> to <hi>Portugal</hi> with the honour of having compleated one of the most famous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of this Crown, leaving in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom People capable to labour the New Vineyard.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Afterwards was baptized the Prince, who had been absent in the Wars, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Alfonso. Panso Aquitimo,</hi> the King's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son, would not receive the Faith, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54711:36"/>
the Father falling off, because as a Christian he could be allowed but one Wife, resolved to leave the Crown to the Heathen <hi>Aquitimo,</hi> in wrong of the Prince who continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in the Faith. <hi>Alfonso</hi> was abroad in banishment when his Father died, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Court was received as King. <hi>Aquitimo</hi> having recourse to the Sword, fell upon him when he had but thirty seven Christians, as well-Portugueses as Blacks; yet under the Banner of the Cross <hi>Alfonso</hi> overcame a vast multitude of Infidels, <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo</hi> being taken and then slain. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that accompanied <hi>Aquitimo</hi> desired to be baptized immediately, declaring they had been overcome by a Glorious Army that was lead by a Cross, and not by the thirty seven Christians. <hi>Alfonso</hi> established in peace, destroyed all Idols, and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Faith with great zeal. He sent his Sons, Grandsons and Nephews to <hi>Portugal</hi> to study. Two of them were worthily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Bishops in those parts. In memory of that Victory, and of the first Colours sent this King, as also that the Faith was first planted on the day of the invention of the Cross; he took for his Arms, Gules, a Cross Fleury Argent between two Crosses Pattee, charged with the Arms of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54711:37"/>
Great Man some time before had offered his service to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who having slighted him then, looked on him now with some regret, and he provoked him with some extravagant words in revenge of the small regard made of him. There were some who offered to kill him, as well to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his Boldness, as to conceal from <hi>Spain</hi> his Discoveries. But the King sent him away with honour: <hi>Columbus</hi> was a <hi>Genoese,</hi> and learned Navigation in <hi>Portugal;</hi> he was employed by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and he had sent him to the Discovery he now came from. King <hi>Iohn</hi> did not envy the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Spain,</hi> but feared that Discovery was part of what the Portugueses had been so long in quest of. This caused him to fit out a Fleet commanded by D. <hi>Francisco de Almeyda</hi> in order to oppose those proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, judging he had right on his side, but it proved not so. Several Embassies passed on both sides to agree the business, and at last came to a conclusion.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Though Prince <hi>Bemoi</hi> was dead, the hopes of making a farther progress in that Country about <hi>Zanaga</hi> died not with him. They who went in that Fleet had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what they were sent for, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered more Land, and gained the good will of the Natives. The Trade was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards continued, and a good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between our King and those Princes. <hi>Peter de Evora</hi> and <hi>Goncalo Anez</hi> went to those of <hi>Turucol</hi> and <hi>Tombotu.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54711:37"/>
carried Presents to <hi>Mandimansa</hi> and <hi>Temala</hi> of the <hi>Fouli,</hi> the most warlike of all those People. The King had also correspondence with him of the <hi>Moses,</hi> very famous in that Age; and with <hi>Mahomet Ben Manzugul,</hi> Grandson of <hi>Muza,</hi> and King of <hi>Songo</hi> (a populous City of <hi>Mandinga)</hi> who receiving a full account of our King said, That none of 444 from whom he was descended, had any knowledge of more powerful Kings than four, which were those of <hi>Alimaen, Baldac, Grand Cayre</hi> and <hi>Tucurol.</hi> At this same time the King laboured to settle a Factory in the City <hi>Huadem,</hi> 70 Leagues to the Eastward of <hi>Arguim,</hi> as well for the Trade of Gold, as to have some intelligence of <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> which he solicited by all means.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Discoveries under King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> from the Year 1497, when he sent out <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co de Gama,</hi> till the Year 1500.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. KING <hi>Emanuel</hi> inherited not only <note place="margin">1497.</note> his Predecessors Kingdom, but his earnest desire of finding a shorter passage by Sea to the <hi>East Indies.</hi> This attempt was generally condemned by the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but carried by the more prevalent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The King being in the Town of <hi>Estremoz,</hi> when he appointed <hi>Vasco de Gama</hi> to Command the Fleet he designed to send. This was a Gentleman of sufficient Quality, Ability and Spirit for such a difficult En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise. The King honour'd him expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the great confidence he had in him, and delivered the Colours he was to carry, on which was the Cross of the Military Order of Christ, and on which this worthy Hero took the Oath of Fidelity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Having received Letters for the Princes of the <hi>East,</hi> among others <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Zamori</hi> or the King of <hi>Calicut;</hi> he sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> with only three small Ships and 160 men. The Names of the Ships, St. <hi>Gabriel,</hi> St. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> and <hi>Berrio;</hi> the Captains <hi>Paul de Gama,</hi> Brother to <hi>Vasco,</hi> and <hi>Nicolas Nunnez;</hi> there went also a Barque laden with Provisions,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54711:38"/>
Commanded by <hi>Goncalo Nunnez.</hi> Having passed the Seas already known to Portugues Sailers, they discovered others, and after five Months sail, landed on the Sands of a Bay, now called <hi>Angra de Santa Elena,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause first seen on that Saints day. Here they took one of two Blacks who were busie gathering Hony in the Mountain, little thinking how far human Boldness carries men. This man pleased with some Glasses and small Bells, brought some others from a Village, in hopes of getting some of those things, and these being furnished brought many more.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Fernando Veloso,</hi> a daring Young Man, asked leave to go see the habitation of the Blacks; but he returned with more speed than he went, being pursued to the shore, and a Shower of Arrows following as he got into the Boat. <hi>Vasco de Gama</hi> endeavouring to appease them, was wounded in the Leg, and because they would not hearken to him, he revenged himself with Cross-bows from aboard. The third day being the twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> he weighed and passed the <hi>Great Cape of Good Hope.</hi> On St. <hi>Catharines</hi> day they touched at <hi>Angra de San Blas,</hi> which is near the Island, where are found the Birds called <hi>Soliticairos</hi> made like a Goose, but with Wings like Batts; this is 60 Leagues beyond the Cape. Here they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed some Merchandise, and observed the People garding their Cattle, some Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men riding on Oxen, and some dancing to Pipes that made no contemptible Musick.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54711:39"/>
But because as they coasted in order to find some Port, they found the Blacks appeared in greater numbers and warlike manner, he terrified them with firing some Guns. He took all the Provisions out of the Barque and burnt it. On St. <hi>Lucies</hi> day hapned a Storm, the more terrible because it was the <note place="margin">1498.</note> first. On <hi>Christmas-day</hi> they saw the Land, which for that reason they called <hi>Terra de Natal,</hi> or <hi>Christmas-land,</hi> as also the River they named <hi>de los Reyes,</hi> or <hi>of the Kings,</hi> for being first seen on the day of <hi>Epiphany.</hi> Here <hi>Gama</hi> left two Men to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Country, and give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at his return. To this purpose he carried some Malefactors, their punishment being changed for these dangers. After dealing for some Ivory and Provisions, so much to the satisfaction of the Blacks, that their King came aboard, he went on as far as <hi>Cabo de Corrientes,</hi> and without seeing the Town of <hi>Zofala,</hi> passed 50 Leagues farther, and went up a River where were several Boats with Sails made of Palm. It was an encouragement to our Men to see these Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for that they understood something of sailing, a thing they had not seen in all those Coasts, and because they were not so black as the others, and understood the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> Letter. They concluded them more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized by their Habit of several Colours, and divers sorts of Stuffs both Cotten and Silk. They said that to the Eastward lived White People, who sailed in Vessels like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. This River <hi>Gama</hi> called <hi>de Bons Sinays,</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:54711:39"/>
or <hi>of good Signs,</hi> for the information he got of what he looked for; though he lost some Men, and many sickned, their Gums swelling out of their Mouths, and there was no cure but cutting, which proceeded from the badness of the Provisions. Sailing hence they again cast Anchor among the Islands of St. <hi>George,</hi> opposite to <hi>Mozambique,</hi> whence came several Zambucos or Boats in jovial manner, the Musick of several Instruments sounding in them. As they came near were seen some Black others almost White, all had Persian Veils, and were cloathed with Cotton of sundry Colours. They asked our Men boldly who they were, and what they wanted. <hi>Gama</hi> answered to the first part, and said he would answer to the rest when he knew whose that Town was. They said the Lord of it was <hi>Zacoeja,</hi> to whom all Vessels sent notice of their Arrival. Then <hi>Gama</hi> replied, that his Voyage was to <hi>India,</hi> and wanted a Pilot to conduct him to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licut,</hi> that this was what he desired of the <hi>Xeque</hi> or Lord. He sent him some Presents, though not of great value, valuable for their rarity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A Moor who carried the advice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with many thanks for the Presents with some fresh Meats, making excuses that the great distance was what hindred the Lord from visiting him. These Lucky be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings moved <hi>Gama</hi> to attempt entring the Harbour, but meeting some danger he Anchored above the Town, which lies in 14 Degrees and half of <hi>South</hi> Latitude, and is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54711:40"/>
encompassed by the Sea; the Land about it is low and unhealthy, the Houses of Hurdles, that of the Lord and the Mosque of Mud Walls; the Inhabitants were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Moors: this being between <hi>Quiloa,</hi> which lies above, and the Mine of <hi>Zofala</hi> below it. This place was ever much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of by our Seamen, being a most secure place to Winter in. The Natives of the Continent are Black. Here came aboard <hi>Gama</hi> three Ethiopians, who as soon as they spied St. <hi>Gabriel</hi> painted on the Poop, sell on their Knees, as those who had always preserved Christianity, which was preached among th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They sailed hence the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> with one Morish Pilot; he had hired two, but the other fled. Bad Weather obliged him to come to an Anchor again at St. <hi>Georges</hi> Island. He took in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by force of Arms, the Blacks opposing it. And they encreasing to 2000, he fired some Cannon, which killing some, the other with the fright fled to the Continent, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many in our hands.</p>

5. The <hi>Xeque</hi> or Governour at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused a Pilot, he they had being fled, but fearing it might be revenged, sent another so wicked, that he run the Ships among some Islands, which were called <hi>del Acotado,</hi> because the Pilot was there severely whipped for this fault. This punishment instead of amendment, provoked him to another fraud. He persuaded <hi>Gama</hi> to take the Port of <hi>Quiloa,</hi> by telling him there were Christians there; but believing our Ships might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. The Currents drove the Ships off, and they came to an Anchor at the City <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baza,</hi> which is an Island made by a River that falls into the Sea by two Mouths: The Buildings like those of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants all Moors, without any mixture of Christians, as the Pilot affirmed. Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander sent a Present to the King, and he deceitfully offered a kind reception. This inclined <hi>Gama</hi> to enter the Port, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Will to deliver him, the Ships fell off, and our Seamen making some extraordinary cry to bring them about, some Moors, who were aboard, thought they were discovered, taking this for a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Battle, they all leaped overboard, which undeceived the Commander, who sailing on, and chasing two Boats, he took one with 13 Moors. By them he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that not far off was the City <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde,</hi> and there several Vessels from <hi>India.</hi>

Buildings great and sightly; the Country as well stored with Cattle as Fruit; the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives Pagans, of Colour Swarthy, of Body Strong; the Women are counted beautiful; from the Waste downwards they wear Silks and Cottons; on the Head, Veils with Gold-Laces. Most of the Merchants who trade here are of <hi>Guzarat,</hi> who in return of their Spice, carry Gold, Ivory, Amber and Wax. The King is a Mahometan, and is served with State and Splendor. <hi>Gama</hi> gave him an account of his Voyage by a Souldier, and how he stood in need of a Pilot. Some Presents and Complements having passed between them, they met on the Sea, where the King was pleased above all with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> gift of the 13 Moors not long before taken. The Portugues feared the Moors kindness was deceitful; but it proved otherwise, for the effect of this interview was a lasting Peace faithfully observed by the Portugueses and Moors. Here <hi>Gama</hi> discoursed with some Merchants of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> who aboard his Ship were seen to worship an Image of our Lady; which shewed there were yet among them some foot-steps of the Preaching of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle. He carried with him <hi>Melemo Cana</hi> of <hi>Guzarat,</hi> finding him so expert in Navigation, that being shewn an Astrolabe, he took little notice of it, as one who was used to more considerable Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. With this Able Pilot <hi>Gama</hi> set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, having first erected a Cross, which he called of the Holy Ghost; and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that great Gulph of 700 Leagues, in

Whilst our Discoverers rejoice at their arrival in <hi>India,</hi> let us give a general des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of it, referring the particulars to the arrival of our Ships in those parts. The Region properly called <hi>India,</hi> is that which lies between the two noble Rivers, <hi>Indus</hi> or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>West,</hi> and <hi>Ganges</hi> on the <hi>East.</hi> Of the first it takes Name, as does the most Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Kingdom of <hi>Delhi,</hi> the best and most powerful of this Country. Hence the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians call it <hi>Indostan.</hi> On the <hi>South</hi> it is all girt by the vast Ocean. Encompassed by those Rivers it makes a sort of Peninsula, almost in the form of a Lozenge, or Rhom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus of equal Sides, but not equal Angles. The two most distant opposite Angles lie <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South;</hi> the latter is made by Cape <hi>Comori,</hi> the other towards the Fountains of the Rivers, which though distant in the Mountains, called by <hi>Ptolomy Imao,</hi> yet run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down the Rivers come almost to meet. The distance between these Angles in a streight Line is about 400 Leagues. The other two opposite Angles, which lie <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> and are distant 300 Leagues, are formed by the Mouths of the Rivers. They encompass as much Land on their two sides, as does the Ocean on the other two. Though all this Country be inhabited by Heathens and Mahometans, yet they differ in their Opinions and Customs, as they are divided into several Kingdoms, as <hi>Multan, Delli, Cospetir, Bengala, Orixa, Mando, Chitor,</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:54711:42"/>
and <hi>Guzarat,</hi> commonly called <hi>Cambaya</hi> The Kingdom of <hi>Decan</hi> is divided into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sovereignties, with Character of Kings, with that of Pale divided between both. That of <hi>Bisnagat,</hi> to whom are subject ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Petty Princes; and all the Province of <hi>Malabar</hi> divided into small Territories, some absolute, some subject to those already named. Had not Nature set Bounds to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ambition, separating these Countries with vast Rivers, Mountains, Lakes, Woods and Deserts, inhabited by sundry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Wild Beasts, they had all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less been under the Command of one Lord. The most remarkable Bounder of this vast Continent, is a long Ridge of Hills, which the Natives call <hi>Gate,</hi> that is, Mountains; they run about 200 Leagues from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South:</hi> on both sides between the Sea and the Hill run two long, but narrow Plains for about 80 Leagues, that on the <hi>West</hi> is called <hi>Malabar,</hi> on the shoar whereof is seated the City <hi>Calicut.</hi> It was then inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by Pagans, and resorted to by Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Merchants. Their Kings were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of the Family of the <hi>Bramenes,</hi> among them esteemed most Religious and Learned, and great Observers of the Doctrine of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras.</hi> The People is divided into two Degrees, the Commons, whom they call <hi>Poleas;</hi> and the Nobles called <hi>Nayres,</hi> who are valiant and skil'd in the Arms they use, and always wear Sword and Buckler; so proud, that if but touched by a Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they hold it as a great misfortune, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54711:42"/>
cleanse themselves by washing. This King of <hi>Calicut</hi> is the most powerful of all the Coast, and therefore for distinction called <hi>Zamori,</hi> as much as Emperor. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom took its name from the Metropolis, in which are many Stately Buildings of the Natives, for the Merchants do not mind it. It has no shelter for Ships, which are forced to Ride it out at Anchor in the Road. This is the place where we left the Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Gama</hi> arrived here on the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>May;</hi> he gave advice to the King, who was not then in the City, but sent him a Pilot to bring the Ships to a safer place. During this interval came acquainted with the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses a Moor called <hi>Monzayde,</hi> who lived there, and told them in Spanish he had known them in <hi>Oran,</hi> and would be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them there. So it proved, for from that time he passed between <hi>Vasco de Gama</hi> and <hi>Zamori,</hi> upon all occasions with great fidelity, and at last died a Christian in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi> The third day our Commander went ashore with twelve others, a Catual, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour coming from the King to conduct him; they were carried on Mens Backs with such ease, that the motion, though swift, is hardly to be perceived. Thus they were carried, many flocking about them, to a Pagod or Temple, equal, including all its Offices, to the greatest of our Monasteries. On the top of the Front were five Bells, and opposite to it a high Pillar of Brass, with a Cock on the top. Within the Gate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54711:43"/>
four <hi>Bramens,</hi> covered from the Waste to the Knees with Cotten Cloaths; and for a Badge of their Profession each had three Threads cross his Shoulders, hank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a Shoulder Belt. They sprinkled them with Water, and gave Powder of Sandal to put on their Foreheads, all with great Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and no less Reverence than is used among us in taking the Holy Water in Church. About the Walls were painted se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral horrid Figures of Monsters and Wild Beasts. In the middle was a round Chappel of good Structure with Brass Gates; within it was the Statue of a Woman, which by reason of the darkness could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly discovered. The Portugueses looking upon it, and asking what it was, the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars answered aloud, and with a joyful Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Mary, Mary, Mary,</hi> and prostrated themselves on the ground. Our Men did the same, judging that to be the Image of our Lady, nor were they deceived, for it could be no other, those People many Ages before having professed Christianity. The throng of the People grew so great, they stopped the way, and with the eager desire of seeing the new Guests, almost stifled them. Having gone thus 5 Leagues, they came to the Palace, where they saw the King on a Rich Bed set out with Silk and Gold, his Looks full of Majesty, Cloathed with White Cotton strewed with Branches and Roses of Beaten Gold; on his Head a thing like a Mitre set with many Pearls, his Arms and Legs naked, but on them Bracelets
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54711:43"/>
and Rings of Gold set with Rich Jewels. A Grave Person by his side held a Gold Plate with some Leaves of Betele, an Herb comfortable to the Stomach, which the Eastern Princes much use, chewing and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Juice of it. The eldest <hi>Bramen,</hi> who was next the Bed, and whose Age, Grey Hairs and Garb were Venerable, arose, and taking <hi>Vasco de Gama</hi> by the Hand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him to that Great Emperor, who looked upon him friendly, but saluted him so scantly, that the motion of his Head could scarce be perceived, and made signs to the <hi>Bramen</hi> to make him sit down on the Steps of the Ascent whereon the Bed stood. He heard him, and answered in general Terms; then took the Letter sent by King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> which was writ in Portugues and Arabick, keeping it to consult with his Ministers about the Answer, promising it should be speedy. The substance was only to settle a friendly correspondence between the two Crowns in order to a Free Trade, which might be to the advantage of both. <hi>Gama</hi> was entertained in the House of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, or Governour, where the next day he endeavoured to gain him and the other Ministers with Presents, but they being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to their Avarice, he found next time he spoke with them, that he had not won them; but the King seemed more pleased than the first time, whence may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the Good Will of a Prince is bought at a cheaper rate, than those who would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them when raised to their Favour. In
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54711:44"/>
fine, he was content that a free Commerce should be setled between the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Moors understanding this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, envious of our success, and fearing the damage must ensue to their Trade, made many Objections against our admittance, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring, that we who came now suing, would settle our selves forcibly in time to come. They bribed the Catual or Governour, and he perswaded the King, our Men were Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats and not Embassadors. It was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that the King, not knowing how to proceed, because there was none could sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him of the truth of this Business, he resolved to rely upon the Faith of him whom his Ministers accused; for, as if he had known how odious a Lie, though to their advantage, was to the Portugueses, he sent for <hi>Vasco de Gama,</hi> declaring to him at large how he was informed his Embassie was feigned, and that he was some banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or fugitive Person, making him great offers of a kind reception in case it were so, and promising to rely upon his information for the credit of the whole matter. <hi>Gama</hi> heard the King with a great deal of firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in his Countenance, and declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self highly sensible of the great confidence the King reposed in him, in a most learned Speech, with powerful Arguments answered to all that had been laid to his Charge, and concluded with the same gravity and staid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he had kept through his long discourse. The King who had kept his Eyes fixed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54711:44"/>
upon him all the time his harangue lasted, hoping by exteriour signs to discover the truth of his assertions, drew a conclusion from the security of his Looks, the elegancy of his Words and gravity of his Person, that there could no deceit be couched under such fair appearances, that the Moors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded malitiously, and his Ministers were imposed upon. Then very frankly bid him return to his Ships to land what Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise he brought, if any, and while that was disposed of, he would prepare such an Answer for the King, as should be to his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Vasco de Gama</hi> providing to return to his Ships, was detained by Order of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and finding himself Prisoner, left seven of the twelve he had brought as Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. He complained, but to no effect, the faithful Moor <hi>Moncayde</hi> solliciting for him with all possible diligence. <hi>Gama</hi> being abroad and finding no fair means could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to have his men restored, having called a Council, it was resolved to apply force; accordingly he sent out after some Fishermen and took twenty of them: Immediately he let fly his Sails, making shew of departing, that they might send to stay him. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it succeeded, for the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the reason why his Subjects were taken, ordered the seven Portugueses to be exchanged for them, and sent the Answer for our King, and excused the treachery of his People. The fortunate <hi>Gama</hi> steers home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Moor <hi>Moncayde</hi> came voluntarily
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54711:45"/>
with him, and some of the Prisoners by force, who were not restor'd, it being thought convenient to bring some to shew, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them they should return.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. As he was leaving the Sea of <hi>Calicut,</hi> sixty Vessels, full of Armed Men, set upon and pressed him, but the Cannon being well played, they went off. Sailing along in sight of Land, he set up the Cross of St. <hi>Mary</hi> in an Island between <hi>Baranor</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticale,</hi> which thence took name, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the Inhabitants. This was the sixth and last he set up this Voyage, they were St. <hi>Raphael,</hi> in the River <hi>Bons Sinays;</hi> St. <hi>George,</hi> at <hi>Mozambique;</hi> St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> at <hi>Melinde;</hi> and St. <hi>Gabriel,</hi> at <hi>Calicut.</hi> Whilst he was erecting the last Cross, he writ a Letter to the <hi>Zamori</hi> or King of <hi>Calicut,</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moncayde,</hi> and sent it by a Fisherman of that place: In this Letter he excuses himself for carrying away those Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, which he did not in satisfaction of the Merchandise taken from him, but as an earnest that he would return with them, when he had shewed them to his Prince, and they informed him of the state of their Country; and that in recompence he would bring a perfect account of <hi>Spain.</hi> In this Voyage he discovered 1200 Leagues, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a strait Line from the River <hi>del Infante,</hi> found by <hi>Bartholomew Diaz,</hi> to the Port of <hi>Calicut;</hi> for in sailing it is much more. Here he found the Island, the People of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nara</hi> call <hi>Anchediva,</hi> near the Continent, it is small, well shaded with Trees, of a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som

He was here careening his Ships, taking water, and some respite, when a Pirat attacked him with eight small Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, so linked and covered with Boughs, that they looked like a small floating Island. He was somewhat surprized at first sight, but perceiving the danger that approached under those Leaves, he attacked it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put to flight seven, took one Vessel. The Name of this Pirat was <hi>Timoja,</hi> we shall hear of him hereafter. The Prince of <hi>Goa,</hi> by means of a Jew, endeavoured to draw <hi>Gama</hi> to his ruin; the Jew from shoar making signs with a Cross, who being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken aboard, and put upon the Wrack, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed he was sent with an ill design, and repenting, was baptized, and called <hi>Gaspar de Gama.</hi> Some of the men died whilst they were sailing acro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Not far from thence came out against him eight Boats well manned, but were soon repulsed. He came to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde,</hi> and was received by that King as a Friend. Being again under sail, the Ship St. <hi>Raphael</hi> struck and was lost, leaving that Name to those Sands.

He carried out 160 men, and returned only with 55. They were all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by the King. <hi>Vasco de Gama</hi> had the priviledge of being called <hi>Don,</hi> annexed to his Family; to his Arms was added part of the Kings; he had the Title of Admiral of the Eastern Seas, 3000 Ducats yearly, and afterwards the Title of Count <hi>Vidigueyra.

And all mens expectation being raised with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Action and hope of ensuing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, it was consulted how to prosecute what was begun, and resolved, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the disposition they had found in the People of those Countries there was more need of Force than Intreaty, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereunto thirteen Vesses of several sizes were fitted, and <hi>Peter Alvarez Cabral</hi> was named Admiral. On the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> the King delivered with his own hand to the Admiral the Flag of the Cross. The Shoar was covered with People, who flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to see the Fleet sail. It contained 1200 Men, 8 Franciscan Friers, 8 Chaplains, and a Chaplain Major. The substance of their Instructions was, to begin by Preaching, and if that failed, to proceed to the decision of the Sword.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Twelve days the Fleet sailed with a fair Gale, but at Cape <hi>Verde</hi> a Storm arose, and one of the Vessels returned to <hi>Lisbon.</hi> In 10 degrees of <hi>South</hi> Latitude they saw a

                        </gap>n eminence, they were spoke to in several Languages and by Signs, but all in vain. The Fleet passed on, and Anchored upon <hi>Easter</hi> Eve in a Port they called <hi>Seguro,</hi> or Safe, because it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so to them. The People being affable, our Men landed and set up an Altar under a Tree, where there was Mass said and a Sermon preached, to which those Heathens were present with wonderful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The Admiral sent a Vessel to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise the King of this discovery, and erected a Cross on a great Tree, calling the Country <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> or Holy Cross. He also left there two Portugueses to enquire into the Customs, Language and Product of the Country. This is that large Province of <hi>America,</hi> called <hi>Brazill,</hi> for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of that Wood which it produces, and hither had he been drove by Storms. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left this Port, on the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> he saw a Comet stretching its Tail to the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> which vanished in eight days, and was the forerunner of a terrible Storm, insomuch that the day growing dark, they could not see each other or hear, with the horrid noise of the Winds; 20 days this Tempest lasted, and swallowed four Ships. The Admiral arrived with only six Ships of all his Fleet upon the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Zofala.</hi> He chased two Ships, the one was stranded, the other ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they belonged to Moors, and came
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54711:47"/>
from the Mine of <hi>Zofala,</hi> commanded by <hi>Xeque Foteyma.</hi> The Admiral treated him courteously, restoring all that was taken, because he was Uncle to the King of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde,</hi> who deserved well of the Portugueses for the kind Offices <hi>Vasco de Gama</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him in time of need. Having quitted the Moor, he arrived at <hi>Mozambique</hi> on the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> where he refitted and held on his Voyage.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Coasting along, he came to an Anchor before the antient and noble City <hi>Quiloa. Abraham,</hi> a Man renowed among his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and rich with the Trade of <hi>Zofala,</hi> then reigned there. The Admiral sent him word, he had important Affairs to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to him from our King. The Answer was, that he should come ashoar and he would hear him. He replied, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Instructions it was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to land, unless to fight such as refused the Friendship of <hi>Portugal;</hi> but that in respect to such a Prince, he would meet him in a Boat in the middle of that Bay. This Answer was surprising, and Fear wrought more than Kindness. Several Boats were set out on both sides, richly adorned and filled with Musick. Our Commander proposed Amity, Trade and Religion. The Moor gave good words, but disguised ill designs. This known, a Councel was held, the Resolution was to go on, leaving the Revenge for a fitter opportunity, and thus they arrived at <hi>Melinde</hi> the second of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> where they were received with all
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54711:48"/>
kindness, not only upon account of the Friendship established with <hi>Vasco de Gama,</hi> but also for the Generosity wherewith <hi>Xeque Foteyma</hi> had been treated. They visited and presented each other. Ours which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, was carried by the Factor <hi>Ayres Correa,</hi> together with a Letter from our King, writ in Arabick, which was so highly prised by that King, that to the end he might keep the Bearer ashoar that night, he sent the Admiral the Ring whereon was his Seal, the greatest security of those Kings. He told how much he was infested by the King of <hi>Monbaça</hi> for having admitted our Friendship, renewed and confirmed it with words and actions. Soon after our Ships sailed, having taken in two <hi>Guzarat</hi> Pilots, and set ashoar two Men in order to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Prester Iohn</hi>'s Country, the antient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of our Princes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. On St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Eve they reached <hi>Anchediva.</hi> The Vessels were wash'd and tallow'd, they watered and dealt with the People by signs, and left them satisfied. Then they stood over for <hi>Calicut,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>September.</hi> The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives beheld us with Pleasure and Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; our Cannon was fired for joy, but struck a terror into the People on the Shoar, who fled. <hi>Ayres Correa,</hi> who had this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment at <hi>Melinde,</hi> went to advertise the King <hi>Zamori.</hi> He setled the manner how the King and Admiral should meet, which was done with much circumspection. There were given as Hostages for the safety of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54711:48"/>
the Admiral, and such as should land with him, six of the Kings principal Ministers of the Family of the <hi>Bramenes,</hi> whose Names he brought from <hi>Portugal</hi> by the advice of <hi>Moncayde.</hi> The Prisoners that <hi>Vasco de Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> took, were also returned in performance of what he had writ to <hi>Zamori,</hi> and that they might give an account of what they had seen in <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Embassie was delivered with much state, it tending only to the settling Peace and Commerce. After much delay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Jealousie, Peace was conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sworn to, and a House in the Town, with much difficulty, granted for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Trade. <hi>Ayres Correa</hi> took pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it with sixty able Men. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Meca</hi> obstructed our getting la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, complaint was made to the King, but no redress.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The cause of it was the enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Moorish Governours, one of the Sea, the other of the Land Affairs, the first called <hi>Coje Bequi,</hi> the other <hi>Coje Cemireci.</hi> This last was offended that our Factor had made greater application to the other than to him, and contrived to be revenged, as follows. He was informed there sailed from <hi>Cochin,</hi> a City distant about 30 Leagues, a very great Ship of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> bound for <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya</hi> with Elephants, who must pass before us. He therefore told the Factor, that the King having desired one of those Beasts, was refused it by the Owners; that if our Men would take the Ship they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54711:49"/>
the King, forward their own business, and possess themselves of a great quantity of Spice which the Merchants of <hi>Meca</hi> had there. His design was, that we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive damage in the attempt, that Ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great bulk; and to this purpose gave notice to the Owners, that they might be the better provided; and in case that did not succeed, at least hereby we should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige the Merchants of <hi>Cochin.</hi> The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral sent after the Ship, <hi>Peter de Ataide</hi> in the St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who gave her chase, she made no account of our Vessel till some of our Balls reaching her, she bore upon us pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her shot, then made away, and was pursued and taken out of the Bay of <hi>Cananor.</hi> There were aboard seven Elephants, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one was killed by a Cannon Ball, and eaten by our men. This contrivance was of advantage to discover the Author, to terrifie the King, seeing such a Vessel taken by one that was not above the sixth part of her bulk, and to gain the Friendship of the King of <hi>Cochin;</hi> for the Admiral discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fraud, restored the Ship to the Owners, making satisfaction for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Here it was that <hi>Duarte Pacheco Pereyra</hi> gave the first marks of that Heroick Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which after made him renowned in all the World.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This evil design turned to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but not the next; for the Ships having been there three Months, there were but two laden, and at a dear rate; and the Factor suspecting that the Ships of <hi>Meca</hi>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54711:49"/>
laded by night, which hindred ours, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the King, who ordered him to make Prize of such Boats. They entred and found nothing, for it was a contrivance of the Moors to incense the People against the Portugueses, and so it fell out, for the attempt being divulged, the Rabble rises in search of the Factor and his Company, whereof they suddenly slew forty; the others with five Franciscan Fryers escaped that Storm. The Admiral before the blood of those slain was cool, in a rage burnt fifteen great Vessels in the Port, and battered the Town two days from the Ships, doing great damage, and killing above 500 men.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Then sailed to <hi>Cochin</hi> the Metropolis of the Kingdom, of the same Name, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the way burnt two Ships they met belonging to <hi>Calicut.</hi> The King lived out of Town. The Admiral sent to advertise him of his coming by a <hi>Bramen,</hi> a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Malabar, one of those who wander na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, girt with Chains and daubed with Filth, who, if Heathens, are called <hi>Iogues,</hi> and if Moors, <hi>Calandars;</hi> this man was afterwards baptized and called <hi>Michael.</hi> The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a favourable answer, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to lade Spice. It was done slowly, but without interruption. At <hi>Cranganor</hi> were found some Christians of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> under Armenian Bishops. Two were brought to <hi>Portugal,</hi> one died and the other returned. <hi>Zamori</hi> of <hi>Calicut</hi> had gained the ill will of the Neighbouring Princes by his ill manner of proceeding with our men. Those of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54711:50"/>
                        <hi>Cochin</hi> and <hi>Cananor</hi> desiring an opportunity of breaking with him, strove to draw the Portugues Fleet to their Ports. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of <hi>Coulan,</hi> on the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Cochin,</hi> sent to this effect to the Admiral, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thanks, though the Offer was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, having already sufficient lading. He left <hi>Goncalo Gil Barbosa</hi> as Factor at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin</hi> with others, to provide lading for the next Ships should come.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. He had promised to take in some <hi>Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> at <hi>Cananor,</hi> he went thither to perform his word, and shew he was not afraid to appear before <hi>Calicut;</hi> he found that King well affected towards us, who sent with him an Embassador (he of <hi>Cochin</hi> sent two) to King <hi>Emanuel</hi> with Presents, and offer of a Free Trade. About the middle of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the Admiral set out in order to return home. On the Coast of <hi>Melinde,</hi> one of the Ships was drove by bad Weather upon a Bank, the men saved. At <hi>Mozambique</hi> the rest were refitted, and one sent to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a Trade at the Mine of <hi>Zofala.</hi> At <hi>Cabo Verde</hi> they found <hi>Peter Diaz,</hi> and his Vessel, which had been parted from them; he had escaped many dangers by Sea and Land, chiefly in Port <hi>Magadoxa</hi> near Cape <hi>Guardafu.</hi> After the Admiral arrived also in <hi>Portugal, Peter de Ataide,</hi> who had been parted, and the other sent to the discovery of <hi>Zofala,</hi> with an account of it.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. In <hi>March</hi> before this Fleet returned, sailed out of <hi>Lisbon</hi> four Ships with 400 men, commanded by <hi>Iohn de Nova,</hi> an
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54711:50"/>
able Seaman. In eight Degrees of <hi>South</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude he found the Island he called of the Conception. Beyond the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> at the place called <hi>Agoado de St. Bras,</hi> they found in a Shoe a Letter writ by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter de Ataide,</hi> who Anchored there after the Storm before spoken of; it gave an account of the Voyage of <hi>Peter Alvarez Cabrall.</hi> In <hi>August</hi> they arrived at <hi>Mozambique,</hi> then at <hi>Quiloa,</hi> having found an Island, which from the Commander was called of <hi>Iohn de Nova.</hi> Short of <hi>Melinde</hi> they gave chase to two great Ships, one was taken, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and then burnt. At length they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Cananor;</hi> and that King desirous they should stay there, to oblige them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> was send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against him forty great Ships. This which he thought would detain them, hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their departure; for <hi>Iohn de Nova,</hi> lest the King should think he staid for fear, sailed on towards <hi>Cochin,</hi> leaving ashoar four Factors, to prepare Goods against his return. In the Road of <hi>Calicut</hi> they found the Fleet ready, and falling on it lost ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Shot, pouring it in all that day and night, and part of the next; there were sunk five great Vessels and nine Paraos, which are small ones, the rest fled to the City with the news. At <hi>Cochin, Nova</hi> took in his lading with speed, it being provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Officers <hi>Cabrall</hi> had left there to that purpose. He returned to <hi>Cananor</hi> and took the rest of his lading; at his entrance into that Port he took a Ship of <hi>Calicut,</hi>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:54711:51"/>
plundered and burnt it; the same hapned to another as he came out. In his return having passed the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> he found the Island of St. <hi>Helena</hi> not inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; it has proved since a most advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious place to all that use the <hi>India</hi> Trade, being provided with most excellent Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It lies in 15 Degrees of <hi>South</hi> Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, distant from <hi>Goa</hi> 1549 Leagues, from <hi>Mozambique</hi> 1100, from the Cape of <hi>Good Hope</hi> 520, from <hi>Angola</hi> 370, from St. <hi>George de la Mina</hi> 375, from <hi>Brazil</hi> 540. from <hi>Lisbon</hi> 1100.</p>

                        <p>Conquests under King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> from the Tear <hi>1501,</hi> to the Tear <hi>1503.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Account <hi>Peter Alvarez Cabral</hi> brought, shewed it was requisite either to attempt making a great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with a great Force, or else to quit the attempt. Some were of Opinion to desist, but the credit of so great an Action prevailed; and though many were lost, the gain of those who returned was so great, that it outweighed the consideration of the damage. The King was inspired with the hope of carrying on what the Apostle St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had begun, and planting the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion in those Countries, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging his Royal Titles by adding to them, as he did, those of Lord of the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation Conquests and Trade of <hi>Aethiopia, Arabia, Persia,</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Pope.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The King was sensible, that to obtain a Great Name among so many, so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and so distant Nations, it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to shew great Power; therefore in <note place="margin">1502.</note> 
                        <hi>March</hi> he set out Three Squadrons; the first of ten Ships, commanded by <hi>Vasco de Gama,</hi> now on his Second Voyage. The second of five Ships under <hi>Vincent Sodre,</hi> which was to scour the Coast of <hi>Cochin</hi> and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54711:52"/>
                        <hi>Cananor,</hi> and hinder the Trade of the Ships of <hi>Meca,</hi> watching the Mouth of the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> The third was under <hi>Stephen de Gama,</hi> but all subordinate to <hi>Vasco de Gama.</hi> The whole consisted of twenty Ships, and were gone before <hi>Iohn de Nova</hi> arrived. The King delivered to <hi>Vasco de Gama</hi> the Flag with great Honour in the Cathedral Church, giving him the Title of Admiral of the Eastern Seas. With him returned the Embassadors of <hi>Cochin</hi> and <hi>Cananor,</hi> much honoured by our King. They met off <hi>Cabo Verde</hi> a Caravel bound for <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with much Gold from the Mine. <hi>Don Vasco</hi> shewed some to the Embassadors, and they surprized, said it did not agree with the account the Venetian Embassador in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> had given them, that the Portugueses without the help of <hi>Venice</hi> could scarce put Ships to Sea. This was envy, because they were like to lose their Trade with <hi>Grand Cayre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Admiral arrived the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> at <hi>Quiloa,</hi> having lost two Ships in bad Weather. He entred furiously, firing all his Canon, and battering the Town in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the ill usage others had received from that King. But he to prevent his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ruin, came in a Boat to appease the Admiral, offering to be subject, and pay Tribute to King <hi>Emanuel.</hi> Thus the Storm was converted into Joy. Sailing thence he was put by the Port of <hi>Melinde,</hi> and forced to anchor 8 Leagues below it in a Bay, whence spreading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Fleet that no Ship might
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54711:52"/>
escape him, he took several, but was most severe with those of <hi>Calicut.</hi> A Ship of great bulk called <hi>Meri,</hi> belonging to the Sultan of <hi>Cayre,</hi> most richly laden, and full of many Moors of Quality, who went Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims to <hi>Meca,</hi> fell so unexpectedly into our hands, that she was taken without the least resistance, and all the Goods shifted into our Ships. But when 260 Moors perceived we were going to force the Vessel, in which, besides them, were above 50 Women and Children, laying hold of what Weapons were at hand, they beat the Boats from the sides; a Ship coming to her assistance was almost taken, till another relieved it, and the Admiral coming up, the Enemies Vessel was boarded, and after a couragious resistance taken and burnt with all that were in her, except twenty Children who were afterwards baptized.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Admiral sailed to <hi>Cananor,</hi> and had a meeting with the King upon the Shoar, and Persons were appointed to confer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the business of Trade. Then he sent a Letter to the King of <hi>Calicut,</hi> signifying to him, that the 260 Moors burnt in the Ship, were upon account for the Portugueses killed by his People; and the twenty Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren made Christians, for one Portugues turned Mahometan. That this was but the earnest of revenge he would soon take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his City. Mean while they differed at <hi>Cananor</hi> about the Price of Spice, and at last some few men were left there to agree the matter, and many Threats sent the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54711:53"/>
King for this usage. Then he set forward to perform what he had promised at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licut.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. As he coasted along, there met him a Boat, and in it four Noblemen sent by <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mori</hi> with offers extorted by fear. <hi>Don Vasco</hi> thought they might be advantagious; but resenting that the Proposal was to rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the dustruction of almost 300 Moors and a rich Ship, in satisfaction for the loss of the Portugueses, he returned answer, that at his arrival he would burn and destroy the City. The Fleet spread, and took one Ship at anchor, and some Boats. The King prepared himself, but to no purpose; for the Cannon playing, there was great distraction and confusion. He hanged thirty Moors at the Yard Arms; then cutting off their Heads Hands and Feet, threw them into the Sea to be cast upon the Shoar by the Tide, warning them it was but a merciful death to what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for the Murderers of the Portugueses. Next, the Ship taken was fired, and then he sailed, leaving that Prince and City in a Consternation.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The King of <hi>Cananor,</hi> through fear, granted all he had denied to Entreaties. And the Admiral arriving at <hi>Cochin,</hi> and having seen the King, perceived it was true (as he had been informed) that those three Kings had combined to make him winter there by fraud, hoping thereby to destroy him, finding a Fleet of 200 Sail they had fitted out for that purpose was utterly lost
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54711:53"/>
by Storms. At length Peace and Amity was concluded with the King of <hi>Cochin,</hi> which proved not only advantagious then, but afterwards durable. <hi>Don Vasco</hi> among other Presents, gave him a Crown of Gold; and he besides many other things of value, sent the King a Stone of great worth, as being a Sovereign Antidote against all Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. This Stone of the bigness of a Hazle Nut, is found in the Head of that Creature the Indians call <hi>Bulgodalf.</hi> The King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanor</hi> understanding the good Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there was between <hi>Vasco de Gama</hi> and him of <hi>Cochin,</hi> and fearing our Fleet would not return to his Port, declared he was as ready to comply with the Admiral as the other, and received a satisfactory answer. Here <hi>Don Vasco</hi> received Embassadors, who said they came from some Christian Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that Neighbouring Country, the Metropolis whereof was <hi>Cranganor,</hi> and they to the number of 30000: That St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had preached to their Forefathers; that they were subject to the Patriarch of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> that they were infested by the Pagans; that they knew he was an Officer of the most Catholick King of <hi>Europe,</hi> to whom they submitted themselves, delivering into his hands the Rod of Justice. This Rod was Red, about the length of a Scepter, the ends tipt with Silver, with three Bells at the top. They were dispatched with hopes of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful assistance.</p>

                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:54711:54"/>
7. Whilst the Ships were lading at <hi>Cochin,</hi> a <hi>Bramen</hi> of Note, with his Son and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, offered himself to <hi>Don Vasco,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a desire of coming to <hi>Portugal</hi> to be instructed in the Faith, and proposing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of reconciliation with the King of <hi>Calicut.</hi> He found credit, because his Son and Nephew were to remain as Hostages; and the Admiral sailed for <hi>Calicut</hi> in a great Ship, accompanied by only one Caravel, hoping to meet <hi>Vincent Sodre,</hi> who was gon to set the Embassadors ashore. But he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attacked by the Moors, though he worst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, was gone to <hi>Cananor.</hi> The <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> was landed, and carrying several Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages back and forward, gave time for fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting 100 Paros or great Boats, which sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly one morning hemmed in the Admiral so boldly, that many offered to board him with Fireworks to burn the Ship. It began to take fire, when cutting the Cable she put off the Fireship, and the Boats to avoid it were discovered, but much more by our Cannon, which being at good distance took effect. <hi>Sodre</hi> receiving advice by the Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel the Admiral had sent, when first he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, came in good season, and all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charged the Enemy in such manner, they were put to flight with great loss. The Hostages were hanged at the Yard Arms in sight of the City, and then put into a Boat with a Letter for the King, desiring him to accept of that Present in return for his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers contrivance. The Admiral returned to <hi>Cochin,</hi> and being dispatched, left there
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54711:54"/>
in a wooden House built for that purpose with the King's leave, a Factor and 32 Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses. Then sailed with his ten Ships for <hi>Cananor;</hi> not far from <hi>Pandarane</hi> there met him twenty nine of the King of <hi>Calicut.</hi> He sent out three Vessels to engage the two foremost of the Enemies, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with such vigour, that when the Admiral came up, the two were taken, the rest fled, 300 Moors killed. The Booty was considerable, the chief thing an Idol of Gold, weighing 30 pound, of monstrous shape, his Eyes were two Emrauds, on his Breast was a very large Ruby, and part of him covered with a Cloak of Gold set with Jewels. <hi>Sodre</hi> was left there to guard the Coast and Factories; the Admiral continued his Voyage. He arrived at <hi>Lisbon</hi> with nine Ships richly laden, and with publick pomp carried the Tribute he with much honour had received of <hi>Quiloa,</hi> whereof the King ordered to be made a Custodium of Gold for the Church of our Lady of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and gave all his share of such Prizes as should be taken, to the use of that Structure.</p>

                        <p>Conquests under King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> from the Year 1503, till the Year 1505.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE King of <hi>Calicut</hi> envying the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he of <hi>Cochin</hi> made of our Trade, got together 50000 men at <hi>Patane</hi> 16 Leagues from <hi>Cochin,</hi> with other prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for War. The People of <hi>Cochin</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Power, were for delivering up the Portugueses to him of <hi>Calicut,</hi> who demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing more. But <hi>Triumpara,</hi> King of <hi>Cochin,</hi> refused, and went out with three Nephews, and small force to meet the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. At the first charge he was forsaken by some of his Nobles, yet assisted by the Portugueses, valiantly maintained a Pass, till his Nephews being killed, whereof one was General, he was forced to fly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himself in the Island <hi>Vaipi,</hi> near to and more tenable than <hi>Cochin,</hi> which was burnt; and he persisted in not delivering up the Portugueses; a notable example of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in a Heathen, scarce to be parallel'd among Christians.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whilst the People of <hi>Cochin</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seiged in the Island, there sailed from <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> nine Ships under three distinct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders. The first was <hi>Alfonso de Albur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque,</hi> the second <hi>Francis de Alburquerque,</hi> and the third <hi>Antony de Saldanna.</hi> The three
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54711:55"/>
last were to cruise in the Mouth of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> against the Ships of <hi>Meca;</hi> the others to return with their lading. <hi>Francis de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burquerque</hi> arrived first with more Ships than he brought out, having met with those of <hi>Vincent Sodre,</hi> who was cruising upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Coast and distressed by Storm; as also a Vessel that had been separated from <hi>D. Vasco de Gama. Sodre</hi> had taken four Ships of <hi>Calicut,</hi> which he carried to <hi>Cananor,</hi> and burnt several small Vessels; but this hapned before the invasion of <hi>Cochin,</hi> to whose King he had offered his assistance, but was not admitted; and sailing thence touched at <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotora</hi> and <hi>Guardafu,</hi> and on the Coast of <hi>Arabia</hi> took some Vessels of <hi>Cambaya</hi> and <hi>Calicut. Winter</hi> coming on he took shelter in a Bay near the Islands <hi>Curiamuria,</hi> and found the Moors of that Coast called <hi>Baduiis,</hi> who live by their Cattle, were tractable; and after two Months they advised <hi>Sodre</hi> to seek a better Harbour, because about that time there arose such Storms in that place that he would be lost. He would not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit them, believing they said it only to be rid of him, but sound they spoke truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lost with his Brother, and all the men in a sudden Tempest, the other Vessels with great danger, and suffering much through hunger and thirst escaped, met <hi>Francis de Alburquerque,</hi> and arrived with him at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin.</hi> The Commander sent the King a Present into the Island, part whereof was 10000 Ducats in Mony. Then going ashoar the King ran and embraced him, crying,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54711:56"/>
                        <hi>Portugal, Portugal;</hi> and all the People with great cries repeat <hi>Portugal, Portugal;</hi> and the Portugueses to return the civility, cried <hi>Cochin, Cochin.</hi> The Commander comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King, giving him assured hopes in the assistance of his Ships and the others he expected. Not to lose time, he fell upon those who held the Island of <hi>Cochin</hi> for the King of <hi>Calicut,</hi> and killing many expelled the remainder; then passed to <hi>Vaipi,</hi> resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Country to its lawful Prince. The Lord of <hi>Repelim</hi> his Lands were wasted with Fire and Sword, and only four Portugueses lost in this action. The joy <hi>Triumpara</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in being restored by our assistance, moved him to grant us leave to build a Fort in <hi>Cochin.</hi> The work was begun when <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso de Albuquerque</hi> arrived, and it was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fort of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> and a Church then built, dedicated to St. <hi>Bartholomew.</hi> 500 men were put aboard some Vessels ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Enemy, who burnt <hi>Repelim</hi> after a stout defence made by 2000 <hi>Nayres. Alfonso de Albuquerque</hi> ambitious of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some notable Exploit by himself, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against a Town, when a multitude of expert Heathens issuing, brought him into great danger, and the more by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of thirty three Vessels of <hi>Calicut;</hi> but <hi>Francis</hi> his Brother coming up, they were put to flight, and many killed, as were 700 in the Island <hi>Cabalam,</hi> where they thought to secure themselves. <hi>Duarte Pacheco</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed another Town, killing many of the Inhabitants. As our men sailed (though
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54711:56"/>
victorious) spent with fatigue, fifty Ships of <hi>Calicut</hi> met them, the number surprized them, but our Cannon being well played, the Enemy fled. <hi>Antonio do Campo</hi> carried the news of this success to <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Pepper was bought with some expence of blood. The Queen of <hi>Coulam</hi> offered la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for two Ships, <hi>Alburquerque</hi> went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and setled a Trade as in <hi>Cochin;</hi> and to manage it left there a Factor and twenty six men. The King of <hi>Calicut</hi> perceiving our success, desired Peace, it was granted upon our Conditions, some being put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, he put a stop to the rest. He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Conveniency, but hated the Means, and again prosecuted the War. The King of <hi>Cochin</hi> representing how just he had been to us, desired some able Commander might be left there with a number of men to his assistance. The demand was reasonable, it was therefore resolved that <hi>Duarte Pacheco</hi> with his Ship and two Caravels, and 100 men should be left there. <hi>Alfonso</hi> and <hi>Francis de Alburquerque</hi> returned towards home. The first arrived safe, and among other things brought the King forty pound of Pearls, and four hundred of the small; a Diamond of wonderful bigness, and two Horses, one a <hi>Persian</hi> the other an <hi>Arab,</hi> which were held in great esteem, being the first that were brought to the Kingdom. <hi>Francis de Alburquerque,</hi> and the Ships under his Command were never more heard of <hi>Peter de Ataide,</hi> who followed them, having escaped a Storm, was found with his men at <hi>Melinde.</hi>

An ambition of doing something more remarkable, carried him to the Island <hi>Zanzibar,</hi> 20 Leagues short of <hi>Monbaça,</hi> where he took twenty small Vessels. Then he appeared before the Town of that name. The King of it designed to take the Ship with a number of Paraos, or Boats; but our Long Boat going out with thirty men, killed several, and took four Paraos. The King appeared on the Shoar with 4000 men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Son, who was killed with some others by the first Volley.

7. Great were the preparations the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> made, and the mean time fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued <hi>Pacheco</hi> with several stratagems and treacheries. The <hi>Bramen</hi> Conjurers propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the making a Powder, which being thrown in our mens Eyes, would blind them, and so they would be easily overcome; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides they had a new invention of Castles that were to destroy them; and the Moors of <hi>Cochin</hi> were underhand bribed to poyson the water of the Island. The Powder was looked upon as ridiculous, but great care was taken by <hi>Pacheco</hi> to prevent the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The Castles began to appear, and were eight in number, fifteen foot high, and placed upon two Boats each, and carried many men. <hi>Pacheco</hi> had a 160 men divided into four parts, the Foord, the Fort, the Caravels and the Ship, and herein consisted the principal strength of the Kingdom of <hi>Cochin;</hi> for of the 30000 men the King had at first, there were now but 8000 left, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Principal Men having deserted. <hi>Zamori</hi> had brought 80000 men, and lost 20000. Whilst the Towers were preparing <hi>Pacheco</hi> was attacked by a number of Paraos, in one attack he killed some men, and took five Boats; in another eight with thirteen Cannons. Six bold <hi>Nayres</hi> offered to kill him, and in order thereto came over as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serters, but he having intelligence, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and sent them to the King. <hi>Zamori</hi> gave out that the Portugueses at <hi>Cochin</hi> were all killed, to the intent those who resided at <hi>Cananor</hi> and <hi>Coulam</hi> should be destroyed;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54711:59"/>
they were in great danger, one or two kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and many wounded. The King of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi> though he saw the great danger that threatned him, was resolved to endure the utmost miseries, rather than abandon the Portugueses, but feared those few must at last be overpowred by the multitude of the Enemy, and the danger of those brave men grieved him more than his own; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most earnestly entreated <hi>Pacheco</hi> to quit that enterprize, and save himself and men for some opportunity wherein he might do his Prince greater service. But <hi>Pacheco</hi> bid the King be of good courage, and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten his Subjects with any signs of fear, but exhort them to stand firm, and thereby they should overcome all difficulties. And fearing lest some <hi>Portugueses,</hi> by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, might faulter in his resolution of dying or conquering, he went aboad the Ship, and made to them a most learned, copious and resolute Speech, which gave new vigour to them all; but much more his speedy Orders, and Couragious Activity shewn at that very time; for scarce was the Speech ended, when the Enemy came to assail him; the Enemies design was to burn our Ships, and therefore those Castles were drove towards them, all the Front flaming. But <hi>Pacheco</hi> who perceived their intent, threw over long Beams, one end whereof resting against the Ship, the other hindred the approach of those burning Castles.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Enemy appeared with 290 small Vessels, well stored with Men and Artillery,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54711:59"/>
and eight Castles, one carrying 40 men, two 35 each, and every one of the other five 30 men, before all came the Fireworks. The Shoar was covered by 30000 men, with good Artillery; at the Head of them the Lord of <hi>Repelim,</hi> with a vast number of Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers. The Fight began, the odds being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most 300 Vessels to three. At first the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery wrought no effect, but being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued tore those Towers, and the Smoak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing somewhat allayed, the Sea appeared covered with broken Boats, Arms, dead Bodies, and others strugling with Death; the Fight was renewed with great loss to the Enemy, and not one Portugues killed. Next day <hi>Zamori</hi> returned, and was beaten off with greater damage, having lost 18000 men in the space of five Months that this service lasted. The King by the advice of his <hi>Bramens,</hi> retired to do Pennance, and by consent of his Councel desired a Peace, which the King of <hi>Cochin</hi> granted. At this time <hi>Pacheco</hi> received a Message from the Factor at <hi>Coulam,</hi> desiring he would come to assist him against five Ships of Moors who obstructed his Market of Pepper. <hi>Pacheco</hi> went with all speed, and they submitting, he took the Pepper at their own rate, without doing them any harm. He hindred others from coming into that Harbour, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Cochin</hi> with the Glory of having struck a general terror through all that Coast.</p>

who discovered it accidentally. Thence they spread themselves, but never durst pass Cape <hi>Corrientes,</hi> a Point opposite to the Westermost part of the Island <hi>Madagascar</hi> or St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> and takes its name from the violent Current of Water which often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers Ships there. But along these Coasts they possessed themselves of <hi>Quiloa, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baça, Melinde,</hi> the Isles of <hi>Pemba, Zanzibar, Monfia, Comoro,</hi> and others. <hi>Quiloa</hi> was the chief of all their Plantations, and thence many were spread, particularly on the Coast of <hi>Madagascar.</hi> The Sea by degrees wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away both sides, made <hi>Quiloa</hi> an Island. It bears many Palm and Thorn-trees, and divers Herbs and Plants; Cattle, Wild Beasts, and Birds, much after the same manner as <hi>Spain;</hi> the Buildings also after our manner, flat at the Top, with Gardens and Orchards behind. On one side is the Royal Palace, built in the manner of a Fort; the Gate to the Sea opposite to the Anchoring place, where ours at that time were.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Don Francisco de Almeyda,</hi> having resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to land, was the first that touched the Shoar with 500 men. He and his Son <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> at the same time attacked the City in two places. Our men had enough to do to cover themselves with their Shields from the showers of Arrows that flew, yet they advanced; but finding the greatest damage they received was from the tops of the Houses, they entred and gained some of them, and thereby so much advantage, that the King fled, and set up in the Field Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugues
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54711:64"/>
Colours, which stopt the Current of the Conquerors, till he had got over to the Continent with his Wives and Riches. The City was plundered, and not one man lost in this Action, though a considerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Enemies was killed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Mir Abraham</hi> now overcome, was but an Usurper, but the <hi>44th</hi> Possessor of that Island, of which number many were Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants like him. A Kinsman of this <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> called <hi>Mahomet Anconii</hi> had been very faithful and serviceable to the Portugueses; to requite him <hi>Don Francisco</hi> ordered when the City was plundered, that nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to him should be touched. And after all was setled, sent for, and declared him King of that place, putting a Crown of Gold upon his Head with much Pomp and Ceremony. It was a wonderful act of Moderation in this Barbarian, that as soon as the Crown was on his Head, he declared, that had the lawful King <hi>Alfudail,</hi> murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the late Usurper, been living, he would have resigned that Crown to him, but since he could not do it, he desired the Son of the said <hi>Alfudail</hi> might be sworn here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Prince, though he himself had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for whom he might covet that Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. This Example in a Heathen might confound the inhuman insolence and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Christians (at least those who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the name) who wade through Seas of Blood, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="7">7. All things being again setled, <hi>Don Francisco</hi> in twenty days raised a Fort, the Gentlemen, Captains and he himself work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at it. He put into it 550 men, and left a Caravel and a Brigantine to cruise there. The <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> he set sail for <hi>Mombaça,</hi> and arrived there with 13 Sail. The City <hi>Mombaça</hi> is seated in an Island, which is about 14 Leagues in circumference; it is beautiful and strong; before it is a large Bay capable of many Ships. Before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, two Vessels were sent to sound the Bar, which is commanded by a Platform with eight Pieces of Cannon, which began to play upon them that were fadoming, but they repaid the Courtesie so fortunately, that a Ball falling among the Enemies Powder did great harm, and they quitted the Work. The like success was against two lesser Works, so that our Fleet entred without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther resistance. <hi>Don Francisco</hi> was told the King was prepared, and had hired 1500 Archers of the <hi>Cafres</hi> besides his own men. He sent a message to him, but was not hearkned to, and only answered, that the Moors of <hi>Mombaça</hi> were not to be frighted with the noise of Cannon, like those of <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loa. Don Francisco</hi> enraged that some men had been wounded, attempting to burn the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54711:65"/>
Ships of <hi>Cambaya</hi> in the Port, without suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, landed his men and marched to the City.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. He entred the Town the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> and drove the Enemy out at the other end, and among them the King, whose Pallace he had possessed himself of, and planted thereon a Cross, and here received the News of the Victory at Sea, the Ships having been burnt as he ordered. In this Action were lost five Portugueses; of the Moors 1513 killed, and 1200 taken, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he kept but 200, discharging the rest, the Ships being heavy with Plunder; after which the City was burnt to the ground. Some of the Ships which had been separated by the Storm, joyned the Fleet here. <hi>Don Francisco</hi> dispatched two before him to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the News of what he had done, and the necessary Orders till he came. He set out for <hi>India</hi> with 14 Ships, and anchored in the Bay called <hi>Angra de Santa Elena,</hi> where he found <hi>Iohn Homem,</hi> Captain of a Caravel, who having been distressed by Weather had discovered some Islands, and met some of the Ships that had lost the Fleet. Sailing thence, the first Port of <hi>India</hi> where he touched, was <hi>Anchediva.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Anchediva</hi> (as was said before) is the chiefest of five Islands, where the King had ordered a Fort to be built, which was now put in execution. Hither the King of <hi>Onor</hi> sent Embassadors to <hi>Don Francisco</hi> with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents. Hither came to meet him Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Men, though Merchants, assuring him
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54711:65"/>
of the Good Affection of their Prince to the Portugueses. Hither the Neighbouring Moors of <hi>Cincatora</hi> brought Gifts to him. All was the effects of Fear, produced by the Fame of his Actions. He was informed there was not far from him a Fort, strong by Nature as well as Art, built by the Prince <hi>Sabago,</hi> and garrisoned with 800 men, being seated on the Banks of the River <hi>Aliga</hi> and Borders of <hi>Onor;</hi> he sent his Son <hi>Don Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renço</hi> on pretence of a Friendly Visit to take a view of it, which he effected, remaining there some days.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Fort being finished, he put a Captain and 80 men into it, leaving a Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon and two Brigantines to cruise there, and then sailed to the Port of <hi>Onor.</hi> He was ill received, and resolved to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as terrible there as he had done at <hi>Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baça</hi> and <hi>Quiloa.</hi> The Inhabitants percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, amused him with excuses till they had secured their Wives, Children and Goods in a neighbouring Mountain, and then appeared with shouts and motions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to terrifie rather than seem fearful. <hi>Don Francisco</hi> marched by land, and sent his Son with 150 men in Boats to burn some Ships; and though innumerable Arrows flew, and <hi>Don Francisco</hi> was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one, the Town and Ships were fired at the same time. The Wind being in our mens Faces, the Smoak of the Fire did them much harm; but <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> taking a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass avoided it, and fell upon 1500 of the Enemy. The confusion was great on both

sides, but more on ours, our men beginning to give ground, till <hi>Don Francisco</hi> coming up, they took heart and drove the Enemy to the Mountain. <hi>Timoja</hi> Governour of the City, and Owner of some of the Ships that were burnt, and a man of Graceful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, with discreet words appeased <hi>Don Francisco,</hi> and stopt the ensuing ruin.

                     <p n="1">1. BEcause the Government of <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco de Almeyda</hi> was the Foundation of our Security and Conquests in <hi>India,</hi> it will be necessary here to say some things of its Ports and Chief Places along the Sea Coasts. <hi>Asia</hi> is divided from <hi>Europe</hi> by the River <hi>Don</hi> or <hi>Tanais,</hi> and the <hi>Euxine</hi> or <hi>Black Sea,</hi> and Streights of the <hi>Dardanels.</hi> From <hi>Africk</hi> by the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and a Line drawn from <hi>Suez,</hi> the utmost Port thereof, to the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> cross that narrow Neck of Land which joyns these two parts of the World, and is 24 Leagues in length. The different Religions there practised, may be reduced to four principal ones, the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the Mahometan, the Pagan and the Jewish. That part of <hi>Asia</hi> which makes most to our purpose, may be divided into nine parts, as it runs along the Coast. The first beginning to the Westward, commences at the Mouth of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> in 12 <hi>d.</hi> 40 <hi>m.</hi> of <hi>North</hi> Latitude, and reaches to the Gulf of <hi>Persia.</hi> From the Mouth of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> to the City <hi>Aden</hi> is 44 Leagues, thence to Cape <hi>Fortaque</hi> in 14 <hi>d.</hi> 30 <hi>m.</hi> Latitude 100 Leagues, with these Towns <hi>Abian, Ax, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacan,

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54711:67"/>
This division is subdivided into three parts by two Rivers that run from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West.</hi> The first separates the Kingdom of <hi>Decan</hi> from that of <hi>Guzarat,</hi> which lies <hi>North</hi> of it; the second parts <hi>Decan</hi> from <hi>Canara</hi> on the <hi>South.</hi> There are other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers which all have their Springs in the Mountain <hi>Gate.</hi> The chief of all those Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers is called <hi>Ganga,</hi> or <hi>Guenga,</hi> and falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea near the Mouth of <hi>Ganges,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cities <hi>Angali</hi> and <hi>Pisolta,</hi> in about 22 degrees of Latitude.

This River is wonderful for the abundance of water it carries, and esteemed Holy by the Neighbouring People, who imagining it conduces to their Salvation when given over, are carried and die with their Feet in its water, which brings the King a great Revenue, for none must wash there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying a certain Duty. Though this
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54711:68"/>
River has many Mouths, the two most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable are called <hi>Satigan</hi> to the <hi>West,</hi> and <hi>Chatigan</hi> to the <hi>East,</hi> near 100 Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from each other; and here will end the fifth of the nine Districts. This may be subdivided into three parts, The first the Kingdom of <hi>Bisnaga</hi> contains 200 Leagues, and these Towns, <hi>Tarancurii, Manapar, Vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par, Trechendur, Caligrande, Charcacale, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cucurii, Benbar, Calicare, Beadala, Manan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cort</hi> and <hi>Cannameira,</hi> whence takes name that Cape that stretches out there in 10 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>North</hi> Latitude; then <hi>Negapatan, Hahor, Triminapatan, Tragambar, Trimenava, Colororam, Puducheira, Calapate, Connumeira, Sadrapatan</hi> and <hi>Meliapor,</hi> now called St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> because that Apostles Body was found there. From St. <hi>Thomas</hi> to <hi>Palicata</hi> are 9 Leagues, then go on <hi>Chiricole, Aremogan, Caleturo, Caleciro, Pentipolii,</hi> where ends the Kingdom of <hi>Bisnagur,</hi> and begins that of <hi>Orixa,</hi> the second part of this District, and contains about 120 Leagues to Cape <hi>Palmei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> with these Towns, <hi>Penacote, Calingan, Vizipatan, Bimilepatan, Narsingapatan, Pua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catan, Caregare</hi> and others.

Though there be many, and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manners of Worship in <hi>Asia,</hi> as well as sundry Nations; the chief Religions there may be reduced to these four Heads, the Christian, Jewish, Mahometan and Gentile. The first two, for the most part, under the slavery of the latter. With the two latter the Portugues waged War; their Power is thus divided. All that tract from the River <hi>Cintacora,</hi> opposite to <hi>Anchediva</hi> towards the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> is subject to Mahometans, thence Eastward, to Pagans, except the Kingdom of <hi>Malaca,</hi> part of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> and some parts of <hi>Iava</hi> and the <hi>Molucco</hi> Islands, held by the Moors.

The Moors of <hi>Sumatra, Malaca,</hi> and the Moluccoes were well disciplin'd, and much better stor'd with Artillery than we that attacked them. The Heathens were
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54711:70"/>
the Kings of <hi>Bisnagar, Orixa, Bengala, Pegu, Siam</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> all (but chiefly the last) so Powerful, it is not to be expressed, and if related scarce credible. <hi>Siam</hi> extends above 500 Leagues, and has seven King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms subject, which are <hi>Cambodia, Como, Lanchaam, Cheneray, Chencran, Chiamay, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burii</hi> and <hi>Chaypumo.</hi> The King has 30000 Elephants, whereof he carries out 3000 armed to War, and 50000 men only of the City <hi>Udia,</hi> Metropolis of his Empire. The King of <hi>China</hi> alone in extent exceeds them all, and all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> put together. <hi>China</hi> is above 700 Leagues in length, it has abundance of all sorts of Metals, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds <hi>Europe</hi> in Manufactures; some of their Works seem beyond Human Wit; the Silks, Provisions and Pleasures wherewith it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, are beyond computation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. All the Heathens of <hi>India,</hi> chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Ganges,</hi> write upon Palm Leaves (without Ink) with Wooden or Steel Pens, which easily cut the Letters on the Leaf, whereof I have seen some in <hi>Rome</hi> curiously folded; what they design should be lasting, they carve on Stone or Copper; they begin on the left Hand; their Histories are fabulous. 600 years before the arrival of the Portugueses in <hi>India,</hi> there was a King so powerful in <hi>Malabar,</hi> that the People began their Era or Computation of Time from his Reign, as they did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards from our arrival. He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded by the Moors that traded in his Ports, to turn Mahometan, and gave them leave
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54711:70"/>
to build <hi>Calicut.</hi> Being old, he divided his Kingdoms among his Kindred. To the Chief he gave that of <hi>Coulan,</hi> where he placed the Head See of the Religion of the <hi>Bramens,</hi> and called him <hi>Cobritim,</hi> that is, the same as High Priest; to his Nephew he gave <hi>Calicut,</hi> with all the Temporal Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, calling him <hi>Zamori,</hi> that is, the same with Emperour. This last Dignity conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in the same place, the other was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to <hi>Cochin.</hi> Having disposed of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, he resolved to die at <hi>Meca,</hi> but was drowned by the way. <hi>Calicut</hi> is a plain Country, well watered, plentiful of Pepper and Ginger; all other Spice it has from its Neighbours. The People are very Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and do not suffer those of one Trade or Profession to marry into another, or put their Children to Learn. The <hi>Nayres</hi> who are their Nobles, if they chance to touch any of the Commons, cleanse themselves by washing, as the Samaritans and Jews. The Women of the <hi>Nayres</hi> are common to them all, but chiefly the <hi>Bramens,</hi> therefore know no Father, nor is any bound to maintain them. They are most expert at their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, beginning to exercise them at the age of seven years. They use all the antient manners of Augury and Divination.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Viceroy, <hi>Don Francisco de Almey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> had an interview ashoar with the King of <hi>Cananor,</hi> who brought with him 5000 men well armed.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54711:71"/>
with the <hi>Zamori</hi> King of <hi>Calicut.</hi> He asked leave to build a Fort in the Harbour, and it was granted. Having begun it, he left there <hi>Lorenço</hi> de <hi>Brito</hi> to command with 150 men, and two Vessels to cruise upon the Coast. Being arrived at <hi>Cochin,</hi> he received the News that the Factor of <hi>Coulan</hi> with all his men, were killed by the Moors. He sent his Son <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> with three Ships and three Caravels, with Orders to procure Lading, without taking notice of what had past, but in case of denial, to revenge the slaughter. The Messenger was answered by a Shower of Arrows, and twenty four Ships of <hi>Calicut</hi> and other places prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ours. <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> after pouring in his Shot liberally, burnt them all, only a few of the Moors were saved by swimming. <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> then went to load in another Port.</p>
                     <p n="5">5.

He was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Solemnity with a Crown of Gold set with Jewels, carried from <hi>Portugal</hi> for that purpose.

6. King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> to secure the Trade of the Gold of <hi>Zofala,</hi> had caused a Fort to be built at <hi>Quiloa,</hi> another at <hi>Moçambique,</hi> and a Factory at <hi>Melinde.</hi> After <hi>Don Francisco</hi> he sent out <hi>Pedro de Annaya</hi> with six Ships to build a Fort at <hi>Zofala;</hi> three of the Ships were to go on to <hi>India,</hi> and return with lading, the other three to cruise on the Coast of <hi>Zofala.</hi> One of the Captains fell overboard, and was lost; another had 16 men killed in an Island where he landed. The others found <hi>Don Pedro de Annaya</hi> in the Port of <hi>Zofala.</hi> He obtained leave of that King, and raised a Fort, whereby the Trade was secured, which that King never intended, imagining that the Country being unhealthful, the Portugueses would be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to quit it. Here <hi>Annaya</hi> found twenty Portugueses in a miserable condition, after travelling with great hardships from Cape <hi>Corientes,</hi> where they were forced to run their Ship ashoar, being no longer able to keep above water. Their Captain was <hi>Lope Sanchez,</hi> whom they would not obey ashoar, but dividing, travelled in several Companies through those unknown Countries. They were all lost except these twenty, and five found by <hi>Antony de Magallanes</hi> in the River <hi>Quiloame,</hi> who brought them to <hi>Zofala.</hi>

                        <p>A Continuation of the Conquests the same Year 1506. and the Government of the same Viceroy <hi>Don Francisco de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meyda.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Kingdom of <hi>Zofala</hi> is a large tract of Land, of 750 Leagues cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, subject to the <hi>Monomotapa,</hi> that is Emperour of that <hi>South</hi> Part of <hi>Africk,</hi> called by the same Name, or <hi>Ethiopia Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior;</hi> it is watered by these two Famous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>Rio del Espiritu Santo,</hi> and <hi>Cuama,</hi> the latter Navigable 250 Leagues. These, and many other Rivers that fall into them, have Golden Sands. Most part of the Land en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a Temperate Air, pleasant, wholsom and fruitful. In part it bears great flocks of Sheep, of the Skins whereof the Natives are Cloathed, because of the cold <hi>South</hi> Winds. Along the Banks of <hi>Cuama,</hi> the Country is Mountanous, covered with Woods, and watered with many Rivers, which make it delightful, and therefore the best Peopled, and the common residence of the <hi>Monomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pata.</hi> It is abundantly stocked with Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and consequenty Ivory, and Mines of Gold encompassed 30 Leagues about, with Mountains, on the tops whereof the Air is serene and clear. They are called
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54711:72"/>
the Mines of <hi>Manica</hi> 50 Leagues <hi>South-west</hi> of <hi>Zofala,</hi> there are others 150 Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, none then much valued by their Owners. Here are some Buildings of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Structure, with Inscriptions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Characters, but the Natives know nothing of their Foundation. They believe in one God, under the Name of <hi>Mozima,</hi> and use no Idols. Witchcraft, Theft and Adultery are most severely punished by them. They have as many Wives as they can maintain; the Kings are above 1000, but the first commands the others, and her Children inherit. In their Funerals they are superstitious; their Cloathing Cotton, the better sort mixed with some Gold Threads; the Houses of Wood. The Kings Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is more ceremonious than great; his Guard 200 Dogs, and is always followed by 500 Jesters. He is Sovereign over many Princes, and because they rebel, always keeps their Heirs about him. There are no Law Suits among them; they fight a foot; their Arms are Arrows, Javelins or Darts, Daggers and small sharp Hatchets. The Women are so much respected, that if the King's Son meets one, he gives her the way, and stops till she pass.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Moors of <hi>Magadoxa</hi> were the first that possessed these Mines of <hi>Zofala;</hi> after them, those of <hi>Quiloa,</hi> whose Kings were possessed thereof, till <hi>Yçuf,</hi> one of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours rebelled, and usurped the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty to himself, with the Title of King, and was the same with whom <hi>Pedro de Annaya</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:54711:73"/>
now treated; and in this place he built the Fort so much desired by King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> strong though of Wood. The three tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ships sailed toward <hi>India,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Peter Barreto. Francisco de Annaya</hi> was ordered by his Father to secure the Coast up to Cape <hi>Guardafu</hi> with two Ships; both Vessels were lost, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains saved in their Boats.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whilst the Sea swallowed the Guard of the Coast, the Moors studied the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Peter de Annaya</hi> at <hi>Zofala.</hi> The King's Son-in-law persuaded him to get rid of them, at such time as they were so weak, through Diseases contracted by the strange Air, that they joined six of them to bend a Cross-bow. The King laying hold of this opportunity, surrounds the place with 5000 <hi>Cafres,</hi> and fills the Ditch with Faggots, then gives the assault, darkning the Sun with Showers of Arrows; but our Cannon being well played made such havock, that they filled with their Carcases the part of the Ditch they had not levelled with Wood. Only 35 Portugueses, who were able to carry Arms, did all this execution. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Peter de Annaya</hi> sallied with 15 or 20 Moors and drove the <hi>Cafres</hi> first to a Wood of Palm-trees, and then to their Dwellings, with such consternation, that they cried, out, <hi>the King of</hi> Zofala <hi>bad called them to fight against God. Peter de Annaya</hi> with a few men attacks the Town by night, and entring the King's House, he stood behind the Door with a Cimiter, and as <hi>Annaya</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54711:73"/>
wounded him in the Neck, but was soon killed with many more. Next day his Sons with all the Moors assaulted the Fort, but in vain, for the fright cured many of the sick, who joyning in the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the Enemy was repulsed. The two Brothers fell out about the Succession to the Crown, and <hi>Solyman</hi> gaining <hi>Annaya,</hi> was by him Crowned; and for his own security made a strong Alliance with, and support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Portugueses.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whilst these things hapned at <hi>Zofala,</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> the <hi>Zamori</hi> of <hi>Calicut</hi> had stirred up the Soldan of <hi>Cayre,</hi> and hoped with his assistance to drive us out of these Seas; this was not so private but the King of <hi>Cochin</hi> had intelligence of it, and advertised the Viceroy <hi>Don Francisco,</hi> who sent his Son <hi>Laurence</hi> with 11 Sail to prevent or put a stop to the design. As he visited some Ports, news was brought him, that in the Road of <hi>Cananor</hi> was a Fleet of 260 Paraos, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of 60 exceeded our Ships in bulk. He directs his course towards them, and after a very sharp engagement they were put to flight, pursued, and some taken, but many sunk and obliged to run aground, with great loss to the Enemy, and of his own only five or six men; the chiefest part of the Booty was four Ships laden with Spice. <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> had scarce time to breath after this Victory, when he understood the Fort of <hi>Anchediva</hi> was beset by 60 Vessels of Moors and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles well armed and resolute, commanded by a Renegado. The besieged behaved
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54711:74"/>
themselves gallantly, and no less the Besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; but having lost some Vessels tore by our Cannon, and hearing of the relief <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> was about to bring, they went off with all possible speed.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Moors perceiving their Trade was cut off by the Portugueses, thought to shun them by keeping out at Sea in their Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to <hi>Sumatra</hi> and <hi>Malaca</hi> where they went for Spice, striking through the <hi>Maldivy</hi> Islands, and bearing away <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Ceylon.</hi> The Viceroy sent his Son from <hi>Cochin</hi> with nine Ships to infest that Course. But the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots wandring through unknown Seas, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Island <hi>Ceylon,</hi> formerly called <hi>Trapobana.</hi> They anchored at the Port <hi>Gale,</hi> where many Moors were lading Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, and taking in Elephants for <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya.</hi> They fearful of <hi>Don Lorenço</hi>'s anger, presented him in the name of the King with 400 Bahares of Cinnamon. He well understood the contrivance, but thought it at that time better to dissemble and content himself with the Present, and discovery of the Island, planting there a Cross, with an Inscription, signifying his arrival there. In his return to <hi>Cochin</hi> he fell upon the Town of <hi>Biramjam,</hi> which he burnt down, putting all to the Sword, in revenge for the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses killed at <hi>Coulan,</hi> because this Town belonged to that Crown.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Cide Barbudo</hi> and <hi>Peter Quaresma</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with two Ships from <hi>Portugal,</hi> after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny misfortunes, arrived at <hi>Zofala,</hi> where they found <hi>Peter de Annay,</hi> and most of his

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE King had resolved to send <hi>Tristan de Cunna</hi> to Command the Trading Ships, and <hi>Alfonso de Albuquerque</hi> to cruize on the Coast of <hi>Arabia,</hi> when <hi>Iames Fernandez Piteyra</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer of the Island <hi>Zocotora</hi> in the Mouth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54711:76"/>
of the Red Sea arrived. Being by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed there were Christians there who were subject to the Moors, he ordered the two Commanders to direct their course thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and endeavour to possess themselves of the Fort, to the intent our Fleets might afterwards winter there, and so the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that Gulf might be secured. They carried with them a Wooden Fort to be set up there, in case that which was there were not found serviceable. On the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> they sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> with 13 Vessels, and 1300 Fighting-men, whereof some (being infected, the Plague at that time raging in the City) died by the way. When they came under the Line the Sickness left them. They had a sight of Cape St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in <hi>Brasil,</hi> and in crossing the vast Ocean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that place and the Cape of <hi>Good Hope, Tristan de Cuma</hi> run so far to the Southward, that some of his men perished with Cold, and discovered the Islands still called by his Name; where being assaulted by a Storm, all the Ships were parted, each running a different course, till they met again at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zambique,</hi> except <hi>Alvaro Tellez,</hi> who at Cape <hi>Guardufu</hi> took 6 Ships so laden with all sorts of Goods, that from them to his own Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel he made a Bridge of Bails thrown into the Sea, over which the men passed as on dry land. <hi>Ruy Pereyra,</hi> who fell into <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatanna,</hi> a Port in the Island <hi>Madagascar;</hi> being informed it abounded in Spice, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Ginger, invited thither <hi>Tristan de Cunna.</hi> He came and anchored in a Bay
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54711:76"/>
which <hi>Nunno de Cunna</hi> his Son called <hi>de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Maria de Cunna,</hi> a Lady he courted; others named it of the Conception, so it retained the name of <hi>Mary,</hi> either Religious or Profanely. Some Blacks appeared upon the Coast; he sent a Moor to speak to them, but they hearing he spoke of Christians, had killed him, had not our Cannon from the Ships forced them to retire. Sailing three Leagues farther, they fell upon a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage on the Bank of a River, where, among others, they took the Lord of it, whom they call <hi>Xeque.</hi> This man the next night carried our Commander to another Town in a close Bay, which receives the great River <hi>Lulangan.</hi> This was inhabited by Moors, somewhat civilized, who fearful of our Fleet, fled over to the firm Land in Boats so overladen, that many perished by the way. But our men encompassing the Island, took 500 Prisoners, whereof only 20 Men, the rest Women and Children, among them their <hi>Xeque</hi> or Lord, a man of Age and a respectful Aspect. The Morning discovered the Sea thronged with Boats with about 600 armed men, who came to release the Women and Children. The Portugues Commander notified his designs to them, and they with very discreet words persuaded him to restore their People. He was satisfied to understand the Island <hi>Madagascar</hi> was peopled by <hi>Cafres,</hi> most of them Black, and produced little Ginger, to the contrary of the account he had received. Afterwards he would have entred the Town they call

                        <hi>Zada,</hi> but it being an unseasonable hour, the People in a fury set fire to it, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged so, that from the Sea it appeared as if the whole Mountain had burnt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence he sent <hi>Alfonso de Albuquerque</hi> with 4 Sail to <hi>Moçambique,</hi> because he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed against some places on the Coast of <hi>Melinde,</hi> whilst he with 3 Ships went round to <hi>Matatana,</hi> where was Clove, Ginger and Silver. One of <hi>Tristan</hi>'s Ships was lost, the Pilot and only seven men saved, this forced him to Steer for <hi>Moçambique,</hi> but the Wind carryed him to the Island <hi>Angoxa.</hi> At night he discovered the Light of the Ship St. <hi>Iames,</hi> which he had left at <hi>Moçambique,</hi> whither they both returned, and soon after arrived <hi>Iohn de Nova,</hi> who had wintered in <hi>Angoxa,</hi> laden with Pepper. Hence he sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after meeting <hi>Alfonso de Albuquerque,</hi> and sending him before to <hi>Melinde.</hi> He met two other Ships at <hi>Quiloa,</hi> and went on to <hi>Melinde.</hi> The King obliged him to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Oja,</hi> a City, that with the assistance of the King of <hi>Monbaça</hi> infested him.

George Alfonso</hi> going up this River in the term of five days, saw on the Banks impenetrable Woods, and in the water an infinite number of Sea-Horses. <hi>Tristan de Cunna</hi> (with seven Ships less than he brought from <hi>Portugal,</hi> whereof one lost, some were separated by Storm, and others sent away) appeared before the City <hi>Oja,</hi> 17 Leagues from <hi>Melinde,</hi> on an open Shoar, secured with a Wall, which hides it from the <hi>Cafres</hi> towards the Land. He sent word to the <hi>Xeque</hi> he had important affairs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with him. Who answered, That he was a Subject of the Soldan of <hi>Cayre,</hi> head Calif of the House of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not treat with People that were so much his Enemies. <hi>Tristan</hi> considering the danger of delays, as soon as day appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, divided his men into two parts in Boats, one part commanded by <hi>Alfonso de Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque,</hi> the other by himself: And though the Sea seemed to favour the Moors, who stood on the Shoar to hinder our landing, they were forced to flie to the shelter of the Walls, and not trusting to them, entred at one Gate and run out at the other. <hi>Nunno de Cunna</hi> and <hi>Alfonso de Noronha</hi> finding the King fled with many of his men to a Wood of Palm-trees, pursued and killed him in the midst of them. <hi>George Silveyra</hi> perceiving a Grave Moor who led a Beautiful Young Woman through a Path in the Wood, made at him, and the Moor making signs to the Woman to flie whilst they fought, she fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54711:78"/>
him, signifying she had rather die or be taken with him, than escape alone; and <hi>Sylveyra</hi> seeing them strive who should give the greatest demonstrations of Love, let them both go away, saying God forbid my Sword should part so much love. The Town ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, was plundered, and then burnt with such precipitation, that some of our men perished in the flames. The City <hi>Lamo,</hi> 15 Leagues distant, knowing what had hapned to its Neighbour, submitted to the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses; and to make it the more acceptable, the <hi>Xeque</hi> came to make the submission, and offer a Tribute of 600 Meticales of Gold yearly, and paid the first year in hand; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticales are a Coin of about a Ducate value each. The Fleet went on to the City <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> a populous place, before conquered, but in rebellion, and vain-glorious now with 6000 armed men it exposed on the Shoar. But <hi>Cunna</hi> and <hi>Albuquerque</hi> next day landed in two Bodies, and in spight of Showers of Arrows, Darts and Stones, scaled the Walls and routed the Moors, after washing the Streets with their Blood, and killing so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, their number was not known; of ours 42 were lost, not half by the Sword, but through Covetousness, for overloading a Boat with the Spoil, they were drowned with it. These were they, who blind with Avarice, barbarously cut off the Hands and Ears of Women to take off their Bracelets and Earings, to save time in taking them off.</p>

3. The City Burnt and Plundered, <hi>Tristan de Cunna</hi> set sail, and met off of Cape <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dafu, Alvaro Tellez,</hi> who had been in a Storm with the rich Booty before spoken of. Having discovered the Cape, he stood for <hi>Zocotora. Zocotora</hi> is an Island 20 Leagues in length, and 9 in breadth, it lies almost <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> in the Latitude of 12 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 40 Minutes. It is the biggest about the Mouth of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> but has no Ports fit for any great number of Ships to winter. Athwart the middle of it runs a ridge of Hills as high as the Clouds, yet not free from the Sand of the Shoar, which is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the very top by the <hi>North</hi> Winds, and is therefore barren, not only of Plants but Trees, only some small Valleys that are under shelter of those Winds. It is distant from the Arabian Continent 50 Leagues, and 30 from Cape <hi>Guardafu.</hi> The Ports most used by us, are <hi>Zoco,</hi> inhabited by Moors; or <hi>Calancea</hi> to the Westward, and <hi>Beni</hi> to the Eastward. The Natives are unpolished. Those Valleys that are sheltred from the Sand, produce Apple and Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, and the best Aloes, which for its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency is called <hi>Zocotorinos.</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Food is Maiz or Indian Wheat, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marins and Milk. They are all Jacobite Christians, as the Ethiopians; the Men use the Names of the Apostles, the Women chiefly that of <hi>Mary.</hi> They worship the Cross, which they wear on their Cloaths, and set up in their Churches, where they pray thrice aday in the Caldean Language
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54711:79"/>
alternatively as in a Choir; they receive but one Wife, use Circumcision, Fasting and Tythes. The Men comly, the Women so manly, that they follow the War, and live like Amazons; some of them for Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion making use of such Men as arrive there, and even bringing some by Witchcraft. Their Cloathing, some Cloath and Skins; their Habitation in Caves, their Weapons, Stones and Slings. They were subject to the Arabian King of <hi>Caxem. Cunna</hi> found here an indifferent sort, not ill manned or unprovided. He sent a Message to the <hi>Xeque,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1508.</note> and his Answer provoked his Anger. He resolved (though it were dangerous) to land with <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> but the first who leaped ashoar, was his Nephew <hi>Don Alfonso de Noronha;</hi> who to prove himself worthy the choice the King had made of him to Command that Fort, if gained, advanced with a few, but brave men. The <hi>Xeque</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with no great number, though much Gallantry, maintaining his ground, and threatning <hi>Cunna,</hi> who, through a shower of Bullets and Stones made his approach to the Fort, and was briskly repulsed by the <hi>Xeque,</hi> whom then <hi>Don Alfonso</hi> struck down with his Lance. There was a sharp skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, the Moors endeavouring to carry him off, and ours to hinder it, till he and eight more were slain. The Enemy fled to the Castle, which was scaled, and those who entred opening the Gate, gave entrance into a very large Court, presently possessed by our men. About the inward Fort was a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54711:79"/>
bloody Fight, the Moors fighting to the last man, so that of eighty there was but one left alive, besides a Blind Man who was found in a Well, and being asked how he could get in there; answered, that Blind Men saw only one thing, which is the way to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and which even Blind Men covet. He had his liberty given him. We lost six men. The Natives who had kept off, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our success, came with their Wives and Children to thank our Commander for delivering them from the Heavy Yoke of those Infidels; and he, to their great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction received them under the protection of the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Mosque was cleansed and made a Church of the Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our Lady of Victory, and many were there baptized; in which Pious Work the Labours of <hi>F. Antony</hi> of St. <hi>Francis</hi> were very remarkable. <hi>Cunna</hi> gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Fort, now called St. <hi>Michael,</hi> to <hi>Don Alfonso de Noronha,</hi> who had well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it by his Valour, though he had not been appointed for it by the King; he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his other Officers, and gave him 100 men. After this he wintered, though with inconveniency, in those Ports, and then sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Albuquerque</hi> for the Coast of <hi>Arabia.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. Whilst these things hapned at <hi>Zocotora,</hi> the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> was arming afresh against the Portugueses, relying on the promises of his Southsayers and Wizards, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the arrival of <hi>Tristan de Cunna</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, assured him of success in that lucky

opportunity, and on account of a great change of Affairs, which they said must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow, as foretold by a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake and Eclipse of the Sun which hapned, and was so great, that the Stars appeared for a considerable time, which were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as Omens of our destruction. But the Viceroy <hi>Don Francisco</hi> shewed him a greater Power than he imagined to defend the Trade of <hi>Malabar,</hi> composing a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of ten Ships, whereof he gave the Command to his Son <hi>Don Lorenço.</hi> There remained behind at <hi>Cananor, Gonzalo Vaz</hi> with his Vessel, taking in Water, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and meeting a Ship of <hi>Cananor</hi> with a Portugues Pass, he sunk it, and all the Moors sewed up in a Sail, that they might never be seen.

The Ships were laden with Horses, and other Goods, in the sale whereof some of the Moors dealing deceitfully, <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> ordered them all to be burnt, to their great admiration, because Covetousness had not moved him
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54711:80"/>
to save any part thereof. Imagining he should find the Fleet of <hi>Calicut</hi> at <hi>Dabul,</hi> he sailed thither, and anchored at the Mouth of the River, where discovering the Fleet, and the narrowness of the place to engage, it was carried in Council to desist, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Opinion of <hi>Don Lorenço,</hi> who was inflamed with a desire of fighting. He pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on 4 Leagues, and a Brigantin and Parao that had the Van, saw a Ship sailing up the River. They pursued till it cast Anchor over against a Town, where were many other Vessels. <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> seeing the two Vessels follow the Ship, sent after them a Galley, and they three together began to clear the Shoar with their Shot, of many Moors who flocked thither. The noise of Cannon called upon <hi>Don Lorenço.</hi> He made haste, but before his coming up, the others had gained the Vessels in the Harbour, and ashoar burnt a House full of considerable Merchandise. All the Ships in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour were burnt, except two they carried away laden with Riches from <hi>Ormuz.</hi> At his return to <hi>Cochin</hi> with Victory and Spoils, he expected to be received by his Father with joy, and applause; but he on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary designed to punish him severely for not fighting the Fleet of <hi>Calicut,</hi> and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused only, because it appeared he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swayed by the Votes of all the Captains, contrary to his own Opinion. The Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy immediately broke, and sent them all to <hi>Portugal.</hi> This severity much troubled his Son, and obliged him afterwards, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54711:81"/>
to restore himself to his Fathers esteem, to lose his Life with as much Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as Valour.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The King of <hi>Cananor</hi> desiring to break with the Portugueses, was encouraged by the <hi>Zamori,</hi> and grounded this Rupture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on finding on the Shoar the Body of a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of <hi>Mamale,</hi> a rich Merchant of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> which was one of those <hi>Gonçalo Vaz</hi> had thrown into the Sea sowed up in the Sail.

But finding <hi>Brito</hi> resolved to persist in that Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, and that it might prove dangerous, he left the Relief, and returned alone to

Much Blood was spilt about the Water of a Well, but our men by the help of a Mine, made themselves Masters of it. The Moors after this loss retired to a Wood of Palm-trees, to prepare Engines to batter the Fort. Our Commander had intelligence of it by means of a Nephew of the King of <hi>Cananor,</hi> who endeavoured to gain our Friendship. He prepared to receive them, and when they gave the assault, succeeded so well, first with his Cannon, and then with the Sword, that he filled the Ditch with their Bodies, which they intended to have done with Faggots. They retired to the Wood, and <hi>Brito</hi> send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out by Night 80 men, commanded by one <hi>Guadalajara</hi> a Spaniard, who was his Lieutenant, the Sally was so vigorously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted by the firing of some small Pieces first, in a cold rainy Night, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in a consternation knew not where to save themselves, 300 were killed. But this Joy was abated by the Magazine of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions taking fire, so that Hunger began to rage, and all Vermin was eaten. The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, part sick and part famished, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extremity; but the Sea being then rough, left abundance of Lobsters when it went off on the Point of Land where our Chappel was, which were the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief our men had.

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Tristan de Cunna</hi> was upon his return home with the Merchant Ships, and the Viceroy bore him company in order to fall upon <hi>Panane,</hi> a Town subject to <hi>Calicut,</hi> where our Enemies laded under the shelter of four Ships of the <hi>Zamori,</hi> Commanded by <hi>Cutiale</hi> a Couragious Moor. The Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy and <hi>Tristan</hi> anchored at the Bar, held a Councel, and then sent both their Sons in two Barques with several Boats, and they in a Gally followed them. They all went up the River through Showers of Balls sent from the Shoar, which is high. The Moors run into the Water to meet our Boats, and killed three men. But the dispute was now come to their Trenches, which some of ours mounted, and <hi>Peter Cam</hi> set upon them <hi>Don Lorenços</hi> Colours. The Colours were flying, when the Viceroy seeing his Son <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> climing with some difficulty, cried out Ah! <hi>Laurence, Laurence,</hi> what laziness is that; and he very readily answered, Sir, I give way to him that has gained the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. A large Moor encountred and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Don Lorenço,</hi> and he gave him such a stroke, as clove his Head to his Breast. The Town being entred, all were put to the

Sword. Then all the Ships in the Haven and Docks were fired. We lost 18 Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses, none of Note; of the Enemy above 500 perished. Though the Plunder was of great value, it was all burnt to Ashes, and only the Artillery saved. After this Victory they returned to <hi>Cananor</hi> to take in some lading, and <hi>Tristan de Cunna</hi> set sail for <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi> At <hi>Moçambique</hi> he met some Ships of 12 that came from <hi>Lisbon</hi> the year before.

Iohn Chanoca,</hi> with his Ship, was lost in the River <hi>Zanaga; Iohn Gomez,</hi> and his, in another; <hi>Vasco Gomez de Abreu</hi> was cast away with four Vessels going for <hi>Moçambique.</hi> Others, with great danger and Storms, were driven to several places.

                     <p n="1">1.

The first place where he touched in the Kingdom of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz,</hi> was <hi>Calayate,</hi> a Town once more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, still Beautiful and strong, the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after the manner of <hi>Spain.</hi> He sent a Message to the Governour, who offered him Refreshment, and established a Peace. He went on to <hi>Curiate,</hi> 10 Leagues farther, and was ill received, and storming the Town, met with a Vigorous Opposition, but entred with the death of 80 of the Enemy, and loss of three Portugueses; after the Plunder, the Place was burnt, and with it 14 Vessels that were in the Harbour. Hence he sailed 8 Leagues farther to <hi>Mascate,</hi> a place stronger than any of the others, and well manned with People, who resorted to it from all
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54711:83"/>
Parts, hearing the destruction of <hi>Curiate.</hi> The Governour fearing the like disaster, made Peace, and sent great store of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and our men went ashoar for Water; but on a sudden the Cannon of the Town began to do great execution upon our Ships, which drew off hastily, not knowing the cause of this turn, till some time after they understood 2000 men, sent by the King of <hi>Ormuz</hi> for the defence of the place, were newly arrived, and their Officers refused to stand to the Peace. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no small damage from the great Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which was plaid very smartly, but landing his men at break of day, he assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Town so couragiously and fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that as our men entred in at one Gate, the Moors ran out at another. The Place was plundered, all except the Governours House, saved because he received our men friendly, and gave them notice to retire when the Relief came, though he was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the confusion, not being known. This done, he passed to <hi>Soar,</hi> all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants whereof fled, except the Governour, and some of the Principal Moors, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it up to <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> and received it back to hold of King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> paying the same Tribute he had given to him of <hi>Ormuz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 15 Leagues farther is <hi>Orfucam,</hi> where he found little to do, the Inhabitants having deserted it; he sent after them his Nephew <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> with 100 men, who having received almost equal damage to what he did, the Moors being numerous, and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54711:84"/>
for their Wives and Children, returned with 22 Prisoners. The Town was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for the space of three days, during which time he prepared to enter into the Harbour of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> which was the Principal End of this Voyage, and to which these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits were but a prelude, being small in his esteem, though to others they might appear considerable.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The City <hi>Ormuz</hi> is seated in a little Island, called <hi>Gerum,</hi> at the Mouth of the Persian Gulf, about 3 Leagues in compass, so barren, that it produces nothing but Salt and Sulphur. The Buildings of the City are sumptuous; it is the great Market of all Goods, brought thither from the <hi>East, West</hi> and <hi>North;</hi> which is the reason, that though it have nothing of its own, it abounds in all things, and is plentifully supplied from the Province <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>gostam,</hi> and the Islands <hi>Quixome, Lareque</hi> and others. About the Year 1273, King <hi>Malec Caez</hi> possessed all the Land from the Island <hi>Gerum,</hi> to that of <hi>Baharem,</hi> and bordered upon the King of <hi>Gordunxa,</hi> of the Province of <hi>Mogastam;</hi> this King subtilly obtaining of <hi>Malec</hi> the Island of <hi>Gerum,</hi> as a place of no worth; after he was fortified therein, drove him out of all his Country. And translating the City <hi>Ormuz,</hi> where the King kept his Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to this Island, he grew so formidable, that the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> fearing he would refuse to pay the Tribute the other had done, prepared to invade him. But he of <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunxa</hi> prevented him, by imposing on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54711:84"/>
a yearly Tribute, and offering to do him Homage by his Embassadors every five years. In this Tyrant began the City and Kingdom of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> afterwards possessed by his Heirs and others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the most part vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently. When <hi>Albuquerque</hi> arrived there, <hi>Ceyfadim,</hi> a Youth of 12 years of age reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and over him his Slave <hi>Coje Atar,</hi> a man subtil and couragious. Who hearing what had been done by <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> made prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, laying an embargo upon all the Ships in the Harbour, and hiring Troops from the Neighbouring Provinces, Persians, Arabians and others, so that when <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> came, there were in the Town 30000 Fighting-men, among them 4000 Persians, most expert Archers, and in the Harbour 400 Vessels, 60 of considerable bulk, with 2500 men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> was not ignorant of the reception designed him; but to shew those People the greatness of his Resolution, he entred that Port about the end of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and came to an Anchor between five of their greatest Ships. For the more terror he fired his Cannon, and the Shoar was soon covered with above 8000 men. Seeing no Message came from the King, he sent aboard the biggest of those Ships, which was of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and seemed to ride Admiral, the Captain whereof presently cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> to, and was received by him with Civility and State. He told him he had Orders from his King to take him of <hi>Ormuz</hi> into his Protection, and grant him leave to Trade in those Seas,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54711:85"/>
provided he paid a reasonable Tribute; but if he refused, his Orders were to make War. It was doubtless no small Presumption to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a King the liberty of his own Seas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and impose Conditions upon him, with that handful of 460 men against 33000, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Ships to 400; but the success justified these proceedings, and verified those Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which to some have appeared fabulous. The Moor delivered this Message to the King and his Governour <hi>Coje Atar,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently returned one <hi>Coje Beyrame,</hi> excusing their not having sent to know what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in that Port, and promising the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour would come next day to treat. He came not, but the Messages continued, only in order to gain time to sortifie the City, and receive further Supplies. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> saw into the drift, and told <hi>Beyrame,</hi> he need only return with the acceptation of Peace as offered, or the declaration of War. He brought answer, that City used not to pay, but receive Tribute. Night coming on, it appeared they prepared to fight by the noise of Warlike Instruments, and Shouts that was heard from the Walls and Ships. The Morning discovered the Walls, Shoar and Vessels covered with Armed Men; the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and tops of the Houses filled with both Sexes and all Ages, as Spectators of what should ensue. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> having held a Council, and given necessary Orders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play his Cannon furiously, and was answered by the Enemy. They taking the advantage of the Smoak, which hindred the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54711:85"/>
sight, attacked our Ships with 130 Boats well manned, which did some damage with Showers of Arrows, but received more, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being sunk, and the rest forced to retire by our Artillery. Yet they made a second onset, but were so received, that the Sea was coloured with Blood. By this time <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque</hi> had sunk two of the great Ships, and taken a third, though with great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, forcing the Moors to leap into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> Sea. The mean time the other Captains had mastered other Ships, and perceiving themselves victorious, ran along the Shoar, and set fire to above 30 Ships, which cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Cables, were drove flaming upon the Persian Coast, where they burnt others that lay aground. This struck so great a terror into all that multitude, that they fled to the shelter of the City, and <hi>Coje Atar</hi> sent to offer all that <hi>Albuquerque</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. He stopt further proceedings, but perceiving the deceitfulness of the Moor, threatned a greater effect of his Anger in case he persisted in his Wiles. And compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the damage, found, that with the loss of 10 men, most of the Enemies Vessels, with vast Riches, were either sunk, burnt or torn to pieces, and 1700 of them killed. The dead Bodies floating upon the Water, many were seen with Ornaments of beaten Gold, which our men fished for, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that many were wounded with their own Arrows, there being none used among the Portugueses.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:54711:86"/>
4. <hi>Coje Atar,</hi> considering the damage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and what might ensue, called a Council, where it was agreed to submit to what was demanded by <hi>Albuquerque.</hi> The Articles were drawn, and sworn to by both Parties; their substance was, that the King of <hi>Ormuz</hi> did submit himself to King <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> with the Tribute of 15000 Xeraphines yearly (a Xeraphin is worth about half a Crown) and should assign the Portugueses place to build a Fort. The Fort was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately begun, and much advanced in few days, but <hi>Coje Atar</hi> could not bear with it. He feigned Embassadors were come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Tribute they used to pay the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and therefore desired <hi>Albuquerque</hi> to give them an Answer, since his King was now subject to the Crown of <hi>Portugal.</hi> He guessed at the design, and bid <hi>Coje Atar</hi> send somebody to him who might carry the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; the Messengers being come, he put into their Hands Bullets and Spears, telling them that was the Coin the Tribute should be paid in. <hi>Coje Atar</hi> finding his Plot fail, endeavoured to corrupt our Men with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He prevailed with five Seamen, one of them a Founder, who cast some Cannon there; and another who informed him, that our men were not compleat 460; whereby animated he studied to break the Peace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to deliver up those men, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the same time, it was <hi>Albuquerque</hi> that broke it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> began to revenge this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, but with little success, because the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54711:86"/>
employed, opposed it. <hi>Coje Atar</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this, at Night fired a Boat we were building on the Shoar, and one of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugues Deserters cried from the Wall, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso de Albuquerque,</hi> defend the Boat with your 400 men, and you shall meet 700 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. Nor was it to be admired, those vile Wretches should offer these and other Reproaches, since some of the Captains gave intelligence to the Enemy, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded those five to desert. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Rage, attempted to fire some Ships in the Arsenal, and failed. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to besiege the City, and having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken some that carried in Provisions, cut off their Hands, Ears and Noses, and sent them in to the great terror of all. There was a hot dispute about filling up some Wells that supplied the Besieged, in so much that they were filled with Carcasses of Men and Horses, the Captain and Guard that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them being all slain. The King and <hi>Coje Atar</hi> came to second this Action, and <hi>Albuquerque</hi> was in great danger, his retreat being cut off, but a fortunate Cannon Ball opened a way, putting the Enemies Horse into confusion. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> in these Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons found his men ill disposed to obey; among the rest, three Captains resolving to leave him and sail for <hi>India,</hi> drew up a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Reasons, why he ought to desist from that Enterprize, which he gave to one of the Masons to lay under a Stone in the Work, saying, he had answered, and would be glad to see who durst remove the Stone
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54711:87"/>
to read his Answer. None replied. But offended with this, and each fearing he should not have the Command of the Fort when built, the three put in execution their design of quitting him. This troubled <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque;</hi> yet he resolved not to desist, though two Captains that staid with him opposed him, desirous to accompany the others; but he used them with such severity, that they were forced to obey him. From <hi>Baharem</hi> to <hi>Queixome</hi> sailed a Fleet with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Men and Provisions. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> having pursued, and missing of it, fell upon a Country House of the Kings, guarded by 300 Foot and 60 Horse, and beat them out, killing 80 with the loss of one man. He returned to <hi>Queixome,</hi> and fell upon 500 Archers sent to the King of <hi>Ormuz</hi> by him of <hi>Lara,</hi> under the Command of his two Nephews, and slew them and most of their men, having but 80 with him, the Brothers he sent to <hi>Coje Atar</hi> as a Present. The Town was burnt, and there being taken among the Plunder a Carpet, so big, the Souldiers were about cutting it for conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of carriage; <hi>Albuquerque</hi> bought, and sent it after to <hi>Santiago</hi> in <hi>Galicia.</hi> Finding he had but few men left wherewith to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his enterprize, and those harrased, and <hi>Winter</hi> coming on, he resolved to go to <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotora,</hi> and gave leave to <hi>Iohn de Nova</hi> to sail for <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whilst this hapned at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan of <hi>Cayre</hi> set out a Fleet of 12 Sail, and 1500 men, Commanded by <hi>Mir Hozem,</hi> to

oppose the Portugueses in <hi>India.</hi> By the way he attacked <hi>Imbo,</hi> and killed the <hi>Xeque:</hi> the same he did at <hi>Ioda,</hi> and got great Plunder; then sailed to <hi>Diu,</hi> where <hi>Melique Az</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> whom he was to joyn, and treat with, in order to oppose the Portugueses. The Timber where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of these Ships were built, was cut in the Mountains of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> by procurement of the Venetians, (as was said) because the Soldan and Turk were at variance. A Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of the Soldan carried it in 25 Ships, with 800 Mamalukes besides Seamen. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew de Amarall,</hi> a Portugues, commanded then the Galleys of <hi>Malta;</hi> he knowing that Timber was designed against us in <hi>India,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the 25 Ships of the Enemy, with 600 men in four Galleys and six Ships; and after a sharp engagement that lasted three hours, took seven and sunk five, the rest fled to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whence the Timber was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up the <hi>Nile</hi> to <hi>Cayr,</hi> and thence on Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels to <hi>Suez.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. At this time the Viceroy, <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco de Almeyda,</hi> was upon the Coast of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar,</hi> and had sent his Son <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> to guard those of <hi>Cananor</hi> and <hi>Cochin,</hi> and ran as far as <hi>Chaul</hi> with 8 Ships. On his way he took some Ships of the Moors. <hi>Chaul</hi> is seated on the Bank of a River 2 Leagues from the Sea; one of the chief of that Coast for Greatness and Trade, subject to the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zamaluco,</hi> by whose Order <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> was well received. They had some intelligence of this Fleet of the Soldan, but gave no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54711:88"/>
to it, till it appeared in sight as <hi>Don Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renço</hi> was diverting himself ashoar with his Officers. They hasted to the Ships, giving such Orders as the shortness of the time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and were scarce aboard when the Enemy entred the Harbour, with many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of Joy; for <hi>Mir Hozem</hi> thought himself secure of Victory by surprizing our Ships. He designed to board the Portugues Admiral, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> rest of his Ships to board the others. Ours were so placed, that the Enemy passed between them, and <hi>Mir Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem</hi> coming up with <hi>Don Lorenço,</hi> poured in Ball, Arrows, Granadoes, and other Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, but was so well answered, that he gave over the resolution of boarding, though the Portugues Vessel was much less than his. The others had the like success, and so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on, and Night approaching, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themselves for the next Morning.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Day appearing, <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> gave the signal of Battle, and endeavoured to board <hi>Mir Hozem,</hi> the like was done by the others, but only two Galleys succeeded, which took two of the Enemy, having put all their men to the Sword. Mean while the Cannon was furiously plaid on both sides. <hi>Don Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> seemed to have the upper-hand, when <hi>Melique Az,</hi> Lord of <hi>Diu,</hi> came with a great number of small Vessels well manned, to the assistance of <hi>Mir Hozem. Don Lorenço</hi> sent two Galleys and three Caravels to hinder the approach of that Relief. They execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it so effectually, they obliged him to fly to another place for shelter, and the Fight
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54711:88"/>
continued till Night parted them, each stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to conceal his loss from the other. The Portugues Captains met in Council, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, that it was a rashness to persist in that enterprize, <hi>Melique Az</hi> being so near with that powerful assistance, that it was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to take the open Sea, either in order to escape, or to fight with less disadvantage. <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> remembring the anger of his Father for not fighting the Fleet of <hi>Calicut</hi> in the River <hi>Dabul,</hi> and fearing his retreat might be termed a fearful flight, resolutely expected the Morning, only making some motion to save the Ships of <hi>Cochin</hi> that were in great danger. <hi>Melique Az</hi> imagining this motion was in order fly, lanched out from his retreat, not at all daunted to see many of his Vessels torn in pieces by our Cannon, and Charges briskly; then <hi>Don Lorenço</hi>'s Ship running foul of some Stakes that were drove in the River, made so much water, there was no preventing her sinking, though <hi>Don Lorenço</hi> laboured indefatigably till a Ball broke his Thigh, and ordering himself to be set against the Main Mast, where he stood encouraging his men, till another Ball broke his Back. The Body was thrown under Deck, and followed down by <hi>Laurence Freyre Gato</hi> his Page, who bewailed him with Tears of Blood as well as Water, being shot through the Eye with an Arrow. After a vigorous resistance the Moors entred the Ship, and found the Page by his Masters Body, who ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to defend it, killed as many as covered it, and then died upon them. The Ship
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54711:89"/>
sunk at last. Of above 100 men that were with <hi>Don Lorenço,</hi> only 19 escaped, in all the Ships were lost 140, of the Enemy 600.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The other Captains got to <hi>Cochin</hi> (where the Viceroy was) with the News of his Sons death, which he received with a wonderful resolution. The numbers of men slain and taken being yet doubtful; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by all means to get some intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and at that time received a Letter from <hi>Melique Az.</hi> This Man, born in Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and descended of the Heretick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of <hi>Roxia,</hi> rose by degrees to that height wherein he was then placed. The Principal Action that advanced him was, that a Kite flying over the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> dunged upon his Head, whereat in a Passion he said, I would give all I am worth that Bird were killed. <hi>Melique Az,</hi> who was a most expert Archer, no sooner heard this, but he let fly an Arrow, which brought down the Kite. The King rewarded this Action so bountifully, that <hi>Melique Az</hi> came to be made Lord of <hi>Diu,</hi> a most Famous City, which being seated on a triangular <hi>Peninsula,</hi> joyned to the Continent by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry smal Istmus, is commonly reputed an Island. This man endeavoured politickly to secure himself at one time, both with the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and the Portugueses, whose Power he feared, and hated for the damage they brought to the Trade of <hi>Din.</hi> And to this effect he assisted <hi>Mir Hozem,</hi> sent the 19 Prisoners to the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and writ to the Viceroy, condoling the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54711:89"/>
death of his Son, extolling his Bravery, and offering to ransom the Prisoners. Thus he endeavoured to appease the Wrath he knew he had provoked by assisting <hi>Mir Hozem,</hi> which was the Cause of all our Loss.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THIS same year 1508, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>April,</hi> sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> 17 Ships, which being all separated by bad Weather, at length met at <hi>Mozambique,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one that was cast away on the Islands of <hi>Tristan de Cunna;</hi> these Ships with those of the foregoing year, came together to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and added Courage to our People to resist their Enemies. The King ordered that <hi>Don Francisco de Almeyda</hi> should resign the Government to <hi>Alfonso de Albuquerque,</hi> and return home in one of the Trading Ships. But he suspended the execution of this Order, because already engaged in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king revenge of <hi>Mir Hozem. Albuquerque</hi> pressed him to obey the Order, <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:54711:90"/>
excused himself, saying the Ships were gone, and that he had in hand that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize upon the Rumes or Turks who had killed his Son. The other answered, there were more Ships ready to sail, and he would undertake to drive the Turks out of <hi>India<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Almeyda</hi> replied, that he had taken up the Sword, and had never resigned it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to revenge his Wrongs. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> offended hereat, went to <hi>Cochin;</hi> and this was the beginning of some mens protracting the time of their Command, and others pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to quit, wherein these two Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men discovered much of Human Frailty.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Precedent to this were the Actions of <hi>Albuquerque</hi> at <hi>Ormuz</hi> and <hi>Zocotora,</hi> where he wintered and relieved the Portugues, who were there oppressed by Famine. To this effect he went himself with his Ship to Cape <hi>Guardafu,</hi> and sent <hi>Francis de Tavor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </hi> towards <hi>Melinde,</hi> and two Vessels to Cape <hi>Fum,</hi> to make prize of some Ships for their Provisions; they all found what they sought, and so put a stop to the growing Evil. He then resolved for <hi>Ormuz,</hi> though too weak to effect what he intended, yet at least to sound the designs of that King and his Friend <hi>Coje Atar.</hi> By the way he resolved to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on <hi>Calayate</hi> for injuries done to some Portugueses. This Town is seated beyond Cape <hi>Siagro,</hi> called also Cape <hi>Rosalgate,</hi> at the Mouth of the Persian Gulf. On the Back of it is a Mountain, which has only some Passes, that open a Communication to the Neighbouring Country. One of these
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54711:90"/>
Passes is just opposite to the Town, through which is managed most of the Trade of that Province of the Arabs call <hi>Ayaman,</hi> because (as they say) first inhabited by <hi>Name,</hi> which signifies Plenty or Abundance, a Son of <hi>Lot;</hi> and this Land is full of Populous Cities, Fruitful, and of great Trade. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque</hi> no sooner arrived, but he landed and entred the Town, some of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants flying to the Mountains, and others being slain in the Streets. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> staid there three Nights, upon one of which 1000 Moors entred the Town by surprize, and did much hurt; but our men gathering, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many, put the rest to flight, and burnt all the place. They got great quantity of Provisions, which was most of the Booty, and arrived at <hi>Ormuz</hi> the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>September. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso de Albuquerque</hi> presently advertised the King and <hi>Coje Atar</hi> of his arrival, and they answered, that as for the Tribute of 15000 Xeraphins they were ready to pay it, but would not consent to build the Fort. He therefore resolved again to besiege the Island, and ordered <hi>Martin Coello,</hi> with his Ship, to guard the Point <hi>Turumbaca,</hi> where the Wells are; <hi>Iames de Melo</hi> he posted opposite to the Island <hi>Queixome,</hi> he and <hi>Francis de Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vora</hi> lay before the City. Thence he view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the growth of the Fort, for <hi>Coje Atar</hi> had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished it, making use of what the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses had began, the better to oppose them. The success was much the same as the other time, but he was in great danger himself, and <hi>Diego de Melo,</hi> with 8 private men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54711:91"/>
killed, he returned to <hi>India,</hi> having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a Ship that carried much Pearl from <hi>Baharem,</hi> and <hi>Francis de Tavora</hi> took one of <hi>Meca.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Viceroy having sent <hi>Albuquerque</hi> to <hi>Cochin,</hi> and dispatched the Trading Ships homeward-bound, under <hi>Fernando Soarez</hi> and <hi>Ruy de Cunna,</hi> who perished by the way, and ordered other lesser matters, he sailed on the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> from <hi>Cananor</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Diu</hi> in pursuit of <hi>Mir Hozem.</hi> He had with him 19 Vessels of several sizes, and in them 1600 Souldiers and Seamen, whereof 400 were Malabares. All <hi>India</hi> was alarmed at this motion of the Viceroy, but chiefly <hi>Zamori,</hi> and <hi>Melique Az,</hi> who had used all necessary precautions to secure himself against this danger. The Viceroy being landed with his Officers in the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Island <hi>Anchediva,</hi> made to them a grave and learned Speech, touching upon the great Actions performed, and reflecting upon the damage received from the Turks; shewed how much they were obliged to God, their King and Country, to revenge that defect, and the death of his Son, with many more circumstances, and concluded, that the more to terrifie the Enemy it were convenient first to fall upon the City <hi>Dabul</hi> their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. All that were present unanimously approved of his resolution.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The City <hi>Dabul</hi> is one of the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of that Coast, by reason of its Situation, Greatness and Trade; seated on a Navigable River, 2 Leagues from the Mouth. The Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54711:91"/>
were then stately, the Inhabitants Pagans and Moors. It is on the Boders of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Decan,</hi> subject to <hi>Sabayo</hi> the King, and was then held by a Governour of his, with a good Garrison, being in fear of our Power. Upon notice of our approach 6000 men were sent in, new Works raised, and much Artillery planted. The Viceroy appearing before it, the Inhabitants, though well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, began to send away their Goods, the Governour forbid it upon pain of death; and the more to encourage the People brought into the Town his own Wife, who was in a Country House; this example was followed by many of the Principal Men, whose Wives were abroad in the Country. On the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> our Fleet entred the Port. The Viceroy ordered <hi>Peter Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto</hi> to post himself among the Ships that were in the Harbour, and following close, endeavoured to be the first that landed; but every one being inflamed with the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, it was all confusion, leaping over one another, so that all, or none was first; of the Viceroy's Boat, the first were <hi>Fernando Perez de Andrade,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Gomez.</hi> The Works being high, the Shot flew over our Men. Our Cannon plaid not on the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my because our Men were under it. The Portugueses having gained the Shoar, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themselves in order at once to attack three Gates, which the Moors perceiving, made so brave a resistance at all three, that the dead Bodies caused a greater stop than the living Defendants, or their Works.

Place was narrow, and the Confusion great' every one thronging for fear of being last. The Viceroy cleared all by sending <hi>Nunno Vaz Pereyra</hi> to gain entrance another way, who after a hot dispute, though the Moors came on in great numbers, put them to flight, some retiring to a Mosque, others flying to the Mountain. The Commander of the Enemies did all he could to hinder their flight, seeing only ten Portugueses pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue a Multitude, who through hast falling over each other, retarded their own escape. The Fight lasted about five hours, in which time, with the loss of 16 Portugueses, were killed 1500 Enemies, all hand to hand, for the Cannon on neither side was plaid. The Viceroy remained that Night in the Mosque; he distributed his men about the Town with Orders to keep Guard. <hi>George de Melo</hi> and his Company, stood all Night at their Arms, expecting the Enemy that fled to the Mountain would return. Nor was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for they by the favour of the Night, stole into the Town, hoping to recover their Wives, Children and Goods. Little was done till Morning, when the Viceroy gave leave to Plunder, which was hindred by the sudden firing of the Town, so that in few hours it was only a heap of Ashes, and therefore the Booty exceeded not 150000 Ducats. It was afterwards known that the Viceroy was the cause of that Conflagration, fearing the men, taken up with those Riches, might retard his other Design. The Ships in the Harbour had the same end, with no small
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54711:93"/>
confusion among ours, scarce able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Flames so near them. The Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy had laid in no great store of Provisions, not doubting to get enough along that Coast; but very little was found here where most was expected, the furious Flames, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps fiercer than expected, having devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all. He thought to remedy this by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Neighbouring Villages, but to no effect, because all was destroyed by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Locusts, whereof they found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kept in Pots, that were Food to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which some Portugueses tasting found pleasing to the Pallate, not unlike our Shrimps, which made them conclude these were Shrimps of the Land, as the others of the Sea. So in some places, particularly the Vineyards about <hi>Rome</hi> are found Crabs, not unlike those of the Sea. So that if those Creatures came not so numerous as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Harvest, they might be coveted as Food, not dreaded as a Plague. Such were the Locusts the Scripture mentions the Baptist fed on in the Desert.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Viceroy parted from <hi>Dabul</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Provisions, hoping to get them along the Coast. <hi>Payo de Sousa</hi> run up a River in his Gally, having seen some Cattle upon the Shoar, and hoping to take some of it; the Owners opposed, and killed him and <hi>George Guedez. Iames Mendez</hi> succeeded in the Command of the Gally, and met ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther passing from <hi>Diu</hi> to <hi>Dabul;</hi> this was well manned, and commanded by a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and Expert Turk, who no sooner
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54711:94"/>
discovered our Gally, but keeping his men close, so that only they that rowed were in sight, he drew on <hi>Iames Mendez</hi> to board him without suspecting any danger, when immediately the Turks that were hid, rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out had almost gained our Gally; but our men recovering themselves, gained their Gally with the death of all the Turks, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out losing one of ours. The Chief Prize was a Noble Beautiful Hungarian Young Woman, who was brought to the Viceroy, and by him given to <hi>Gaspar de la India,</hi> who gave her to <hi>Iames Pereyra</hi> of <hi>Cochin,</hi> and he married her for her Virtuous Qualities, so well suiting with her Birth and Beauty; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections seldom to be found together in the World. Farther on they took in the River of <hi>Bombaim,</hi> a Barque with 24 Moors of <hi>Guzarette,</hi> by whose means the Governour sent some Sheep and Rice, whilst Cattle was brought from other places. The same was done at the Fort of <hi>Maim;</hi> for the People terrified with what had hapned at <hi>Dabul,</hi> fled to the Mountains. The Viceroy arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>February</hi> at <hi>Diu,</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing high at Sea, girt with Walls and Towers, beautiful and strong, populous and well governed, after the manner of ours in <hi>Spain,</hi> renewed in our men the memory of our Country, and that inflamed their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Vigour. <hi>Melique Az,</hi> Lord of this City, was absent 20 Leagues off, with his Army against the <hi>Resbuti,</hi> but had still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the motions of our Fleet, which scarce anchored before the City, when with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54711:94"/>
wonderful celerity he flew thither. He had already used precuation, that <hi>Mir Hozem</hi> might not perceive how little he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to assist him; and that he might not altogether exasperate the Viceroy, and both of them equally feared him. The Viceroy considered the strong situation of the Place, much improved by Art, the Courage and conduct of <hi>Melique Az,</hi> and <hi>Mir Hozem,</hi> and the number of above 200 Vessels well manned, and furnished with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. Having called a Council, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that <hi>Nunno Vaz Pereira</hi> should be the Forlorn Hope with his Ship, in which were 120 Fighting-men, most Gentlemen, and of known Valour. He was to be seconded by <hi>George de Melo,</hi> with the like number, who was to be followed by <hi>Peter Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Night was spent particularly on our sides, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their Consciences and Arms, for the danger was to be encountred next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Between 9 and 10 in the Morning, when there was Flood enough for the Ships to swim, the Admiral gave the signal for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Port. On a sudden all moved with loud Shouts, and sound of Warlike Instruments on both sides. <hi>Melique Az</hi> his Vessels ran to hinder the entrance of ours, Showring Bullets and Arrows, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately slew 10 men in <hi>Iames Perez</hi> his Gally, that led the way to <hi>Nunno Vaz.</hi> Yet
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54711:95"/>
                        <hi>Nunno</hi> pierces forward, and pouring his Shot among the Great Ships, sunk one to rights. He was in great danger between two of them, when <hi>George de Melo</hi> came up with such fury, that running foul of one of the two, he drove it upon that of <hi>Nunno Vaz,</hi> and thereby gave way to <hi>Sebastian de Miranda</hi> to board it, which he performed. Then <hi>George de Melo</hi> went on to another, in like manner the other Captains. The Viceroy in the midst of the Enemies Vessels, gave them a sufficient diversion, that they might not hinder what the others were acting; and tho' they did him some damage with their continual Shot, he destroyed them with his, till the Paraos of <hi>Calicut</hi> fled, spreading the News along the Shoar, that the Rumes or Turks were victorious. <hi>Mir Hozem</hi> being wounded, in despair slipt out of his Ship disguised into a Brigantine, and thence to Shoar, where taking Horse, he never stopt till he came before the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> no less fearful of our Fury, than the falshood of <hi>Melique Az,</hi> who had assisted him with his Vessels, but not with his Person. The absence of <hi>Mir Hozem</hi> did not discourage those in his Vessel; for being boarded, they never yielded, but were all slain. A great Ship belonging to <hi>Melique</hi> being attempted by some of ours, and not able to carry her, the Viceroy discharged all his Cannon upon, and sunk her. <hi>Antony de Campo</hi> took a Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Ruy Soarez,</hi> one of the last in order of Battel, but not in Courage, running through all, placed himself before the City, and plying
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54711:95"/>
most dexterously, took two Gallies, having forced the Defendants to quit them, in such manner, that the Viceroy seeing him at a distance, in a glorious emulation cried out, Who is that who so much excels the rest? O that I were he! The Victory being now no longer doubtful, because some harm was done us by the Artillery on the Shoar, the Viceroy made up to the Ships, where our Gallies and other lesser Vessels killed all that leaped into the Sea, so that the Water was turned to Blood. This Victory was not cheap, for we lost near 40 men. Of the Enemy above 1500 were killed. The Ships being plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there were great Riches found in them; and by the great variety of Books in several Languages, was judged, the men were of sundry Nations; among the Books were some Latin, Italian and Portugues. The Soldan and <hi>Mir Hozem</hi>'s Colours were sent to <hi>Portugal.</hi> Of all the Vessels that were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Viceroy ordered four Ships and two Gallies should be preserved, the rest were burned. The Victory had been more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, had not the Conquered been treated with such Barbarous Cruelty, that many, not without reason, judged the unhappy end of the Viceroy and other Gentlemen, to be a just punishment of that Crime. We shall soon see it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Next Morning <hi>Melique Az</hi> pretending to be much pleased with the Viceroys Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, sent <hi>Cide Ale,</hi> a Moor of <hi>Granada</hi> to wish him joy. There was a Report that the City was in a great Consternation, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54711:96"/>
the Conqueror would assault it, and that many were filled with this apprehension. Our men finding the Viceroy inclined to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Melique Az</hi> his deceitful Congratulation, began to mutter, and complain that he stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the course of his Good Fortune, which the Enemies began now to fear. He calling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Principal Men told them, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ad no regard to <hi>Melique Az,</hi> but the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> who was our Friend, and whose City that was; that the Town was strong and they tired; that of 1200 men he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, only 600 were able to bear Arms; that though the Town were taken, it could not be maintained; and that they might be revenged against <hi>Melique Az</hi> on his Trading Ships. All agreed there should be no more said of the Assault, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>nd should give ear to the Moor. The Viceroy received him cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, and told him, that two Motives chiefly brought him to that Port, the one to be revenged on the <hi>Rumes,</hi> the other to recover the Portugeses that were taken, and who were to him instead of a Son. The first Point he had obtained, and the second he must gain by having them delivered to him; that he should also deliver to him all the Artillery and Munitions belonging to the <hi>Rumes</hi> that were in the Ships haled in, and they burned, and sell him Provisions. All this seemed little to <hi>Melique Az,</hi> and was performed with such expedition and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that it setled a profitable Peace with the Viceroy, who left one of the Prisoners there to load two Ships with such things as were

wanting at <hi>Cochin</hi> and <hi>Cananor.</hi> He dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Don Antonio de Noronha</hi> with Provisions, and some of the Booty of the Ships, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Brother, <hi>Don Alfonso,</hi> at <hi>Zocotora.</hi> Then the Viceroy sailed, and arriving at <hi>Chaul;</hi> that King terrified with the late Victory, became tributary. Passing by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanor,</hi> he was there received with Honour, and at <hi>Cochin</hi> in Triumphant Manner; but before he had laid aside his Fest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Answer was, he should give him leasure to put off that Heavy Robe, and there would be time afterwards. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> pressed and the Viceroy delayed.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Some Gentlemen persuaded the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy not to resign the Government, whilst <hi>Albuquerque</hi> made instance to have it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up, Evil Spirits fomenting these Feuds.

In fine, the Viceroy sent <hi>Albuquerque</hi> Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to <hi>Cananor,</hi> where he was courteously entertained by that Governour, who then was <hi>Laurence de Brito,</hi> to whom in few days the Viceroy writ, that he should treat his Prisoner as one who soon must Govern <hi>India.</hi>

Near there he put into the Bay of <hi>Saldanna</hi> to take Water; and some men going to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change Goods with the Blacks, a Servant of the Viceroy treated two of them so ill, that they knocked out his Teeth, and sent him away bloody. Some Gentlemen looking upon this as an Affront, persuaded the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy to go ashoar, when they ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise him to punish his Servant for abusing People where they sought Relief. This had been Justice. He yielded, but so much against his Will, that as he went into the Boat he said, Ah! whether, and to what end do they now carry the 60 years? Hereby declaring, that was an Action of Raw Heads.

There went with him 150, the Flower of the Ships. They went on to a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Village, and returned with some Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Children, when 170 Blacks coming down from the Mountain, whither they had fled, attacked them in defence of their Children, casting Stakes with sharp Points, hardned at the Fire, so furiously, that in a little time they killed 50 Gentlemen, and among them the Viceroy, who died kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Sand, with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven, struck through the Throat with one of these Stakes. <hi>George de Melo</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the wounded Men to the Ships, and when he thought the Blacks were withdrawn, went ashore and buried the Viceroy and the rest. This was a manifest judgment of God, that so few unarmed Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians should overcome those who had done such Noble Actions in <hi>India. George de Melo</hi> carried the News to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where it was received with great Grief.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54711:98"/>
strove to be so posted as to land first. Our Men were at Arms all Night, and so tired in the Morning, they had more mind to sleep than to land, though the desire of landing had kept them from sleep; but they soon recovered, the signal being given, and the Cannon Playing. <hi>Coutinno</hi> had 800 men, and some Field-pieces: <hi>Albuquerque</hi> had the same number, and besides them 600 <hi>Malabares.</hi> They marched with more Confusion than Order, each striving to be foremost; the first that attacked the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of <hi>Cerame</hi> were <hi>George de Cunna</hi> and <hi>Francis de Sousa;</hi> they found there 600 men, who made a vigorous resistance, till <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> coming up, they quitted it. <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> being fearful of the disorder of his men, gave notice to <hi>Coutinno,</hi> who running with all speed to his relief, and our Colours being already set up, judging it had rather been a contrivance of the Governour, than disorder of the Men, took the liberty to say unto him, What means this Sir? Was you ambitious the Rabble of <hi>Lisbon</hi> should report you were the first at taking <hi>Calicut,</hi> which you so extol to the King? But I shall go to <hi>Lisbon</hi> and tell the King I could have entred it with only this Cane in my Hand. And since I find no body to fight with, I will not be satisfied till I enter the Pallace of <hi>Zamori,</hi> and dine in one of his Rooms. This said, without expecting the Answer <hi>Albuquerque</hi> was about to make, he marched with his men towards that Pallace, where <hi>Zamori</hi> then was not. He was tired
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54711:99"/>
when he reached it, being above 5 Leagues from the Shoar, the Road encumbred with Palm-trees, and having marched hard, and met with opposition by the way, he rested a while in a Plain before the Pallace. Which being then attacked, though well defended, was entred, the Moors flying to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Our men now possessed of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, fell to plundering, without shame or sense of honour, and with as much disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as if they had been on the Shoar, and their Enemy destroyed. The Enemy now reinforced, returned, and falling upon our disordered men, put all into great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, killing many under their Burdens, and doing great harm, though <hi>Vasco de Sylveyra</hi> signalized himself, killing two of thier Chiefs, whom they call <hi>Caymales.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Albuquerque</hi> had entred the City, and fired it; and having nothing to divert him, marched to see what <hi>Coutinno</hi> had done. He found all about the Pallace thronged with Armed Men, and that <hi>Coutinno</hi> was within in eminent danger. Finding it best to hinder the Enemies from pressing upon him, he sent him word he waited his coming. <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinno</hi> answered not till the third Message, and then returned, that <hi>Albuquerque</hi> might march, and he would follow, being busie in gathering his men, who were dispersed about the House. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> marched, and the Enemy pressed him doing much damage, till News was brought, <hi>Coutinno</hi>'s life was in great danger. He endeavoured to return to his relief, but was hindred by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54711:99"/>
of the Enemy, who slew many of his men, and wounded him with a Dart in the Throat, and a Stone in the Head, and in such manner that he was carried sensless to the Shoar. By this time <hi>Coutinno</hi> and many more were slain in the Pallace, and several on the way, being oppressed by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and spent with the labour and heat, and stifled with the great Dust. Doubtless they had all perished, if <hi>Iames Mendez Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concellos,</hi> and <hi>Simon de Andrade,</hi> whom <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque</hi> left in the City with 2000 men, had not stopt the fury of the Enemies, and obliged them to retire. There hapned as great a contest about being the last on Shoar, as had been about landing first, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all their misfortune had proceeded from that foolish dispute. At last they sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having lost 80 men, among them many of Note, whereof <hi>Coutinno</hi> was one. <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> being come to himself, gave out se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Orders at Sea, and dispatched the Trading Ships homeward-bound; and when arrived at <hi>Cochin,</hi> made preparations for a third attempt upon the Island <hi>Ormuz.</hi> While he is employed about this Business, we will give some account of what was done by two of the Captains spoken of in the beginning of the third Chapter, which could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be inserted before.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. One of these two Captains was <hi>Duarte de Lemos,</hi> who, after a Storm, arrived at the place called <hi>Medones de Oro,</hi> thence he went to <hi>Madagascar,</hi> or the Island of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> and thence to <hi>Mozambique,</hi> where the rest
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54711:100"/>
of his Squadron joyned him. <hi>George de Aguiar</hi> being lost, he took upon him the Command of the Coast of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> given him by the King, that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being then divided into three Parts. From <hi>Mozambique</hi> he sailed to <hi>Melinde;</hi> then set out to visit some Islands of that Coast that had neglected to pay the usual Tribute to <hi>Quiloa</hi> since it was taken. <hi>Monfia</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted immediately; <hi>Zanzibar</hi> made resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but they were drove to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and the Town plundered. At <hi>Pemba</hi> hapned the same, the Inhabitants flying to <hi>Monbaza,</hi> leaving nothing in their Houses; but some little plunder was taken in a Fort whether the <hi>Xeque</hi> had conveyed such things as he had not time to secure otherwise. <hi>Lemos</hi> gave the necessary Orders at <hi>Melinde,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in relation to the Factory for the Trade of <hi>Zofala.</hi> Hence he set out with seven Sail for the Coast of <hi>Arabia;</hi> one Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel Commanded by <hi>Gregory de Quadra,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly was separated from the rest in the Night on the Coast of <hi>Magadoxa,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the Current to the Mouth of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> where the City <hi>Zeila</hi> is seated, and was there taken. <hi>Lemos</hi> resolved to take a view of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and managed the Towns of that Coast more with cunning than force. The same at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> where he received of the King and <hi>Coje Atar</hi> the 15000 Xera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens, imposed on them as Tribute by <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque,</hi> and was well treated. Hence he sent to <hi>India, Vasco de Sylveyra,</hi> who was killed at <hi>Calicut.</hi> Then he sailed to <hi>Zocotora,</hi>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:54711:100"/>
and gave the Command of that Fort to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ferreira,</hi> sending to <hi>India, Don Antonio de Noronha,</hi> who took a Rich Ship of the Moors, which being manned by some Portugueses, was cast away in a Storm between <hi>Dabul</hi> and <hi>Goa,</hi> and the men made Prisoners: His own Ship was stranded in the Bay of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya,</hi> where he and some others endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to escape in the Boat, were all lost; about 30 that remained in the Ship were taken by the Moors and sent to the King of <hi>Cambaya. Lemos,</hi> on his return to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde,</hi> took a Vessel richly laden. The <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> being passed, he returned to <hi>Zocotora,</hi> and found there <hi>Francis Pantoja,</hi> who came from <hi>India</hi> with Provisions, and had taken a rich Ship of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> the great wealth whereof he shared with <hi>Lemos</hi> his men, saying they had right to it, as being taken in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of his Government. A rare example of Bounty. <hi>Lemos</hi> finding himself unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for other undertakings, sailed to <hi>India,</hi> and was received by <hi>Albuquerque</hi> with great Pomp and Civility.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The other of the two Captains menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned was <hi>Iames Lopez de Siqueira,</hi> who was entrusted with the discovery of the Island of <hi>Madagascar</hi> and <hi>Malaca.</hi> In the Island St. <hi>Laurence</hi> he arrived in the Port of St. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian.</hi> He run along the Coast, making use of a Portugues as Interpreter, who had been left there, and forced by necessity to learn the Language. He spoke with a King called <hi>Diaman.</hi> and was by him civilly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but had no intelligence of any Spice or
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54711:101"/>
Silver, the great end of his Voyage. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had much trouble and no profit, he sailed to <hi>India. Don Francisco,</hi> then Viceroy, received him well, and to assist in the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Malaca,</hi> gave him another Ship, Commanded by <hi>Garcia de Sousa.</hi> He passed by <hi>Pedir,</hi> and that King sent him some Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, and made him great Offers. The same the King of <hi>Paçem;</hi> in both places he erected Crosses. At last he anchored in the Port of <hi>Malaca,</hi> and terrified the Coast with the thundring of his Cannon, so that all the People running to the Ships and Vessels in the Harbour, shewed the apprehension they had of their new Guest. A Boat came to <hi>Lopez</hi> his Ship to enquire who they were; he answered, there was an Embassador from the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who came to propose such things as might be advantagious to that City. There came back a Message from the King in doubtful language, such as is usual when the designs are pernicious; for some forreign Merchants, Enemies to the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses, had persuaded him and his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <hi>Bandara,</hi> with the Powerful Argument of Rich Presents, to destroy <hi>Iames Lopez.</hi> The third day <hi>Lopez</hi> sent <hi>Hierom Teixeyra</hi> with a handsome Retinue as Embassador, who was well received on the Shoar, and placed upon an Elephant, so carried to the King, from whom he returned well pleased.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All this was but a Bait to ensnare our People, and therefore the King gave out he would do <hi>Lopez</hi> the Honour to dine with him in Publick. He sent to invite him, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54711:101"/>
the Invitation was accepted, till he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a Friend of <hi>Iao Utimutiraja,</hi> that the Invitation was to murder him. Then he gave credit to the advice sent him from a Persian Hostess by <hi>Duarte Fernandez</hi> after she had endeavoured to come aboard at Night, and was not admitted by <hi>Sequeyra,</hi> judging it some Love Intrigue, but it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one means to save those Ships. <hi>Lopez</hi> excused himself by counterfitting an indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. Another way was contrived to carry on the Treachery, which was by offering lading of Spice, saying it was requisite to send for it to three several places. This took so well, that 30 men were sent accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to agreement, whilst a Fleet of several Vessels was behind a Point of Land, ready to assault our Ships, at the same time the 30 were killed in the Town. Mean while a Son of <hi>Utimutiraja</hi> came to visit <hi>Lopez,</hi> and found him playing at Draughts. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded <hi>Lopez</hi> to continue his Game, that he might the less observe him, who offered a thousand times with a Dagger to kill him, and only waited the sign from the Town, when a Seaman, who was Centinel upon one of the tops seeing a throng, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noise, cried out, Sir, Sir, Treachery, Treachery, they kill our men. <hi>Lopez</hi> threw away the Draught-board with such fury, that <hi>Utimutiraja</hi>'s Son and those with him, in a consternation leaped into their Boats: All was done that could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a sudden, and having sunk ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Enemies Boats, and forced the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54711:102"/>
rest to retire, and left 60 of our men in sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and 8 killed, they sailed, and soon after took two Vessels bound for <hi>Malaca. Lopez</hi> arrived at Cape <hi>Comori,</hi> sent <hi>Teixeira</hi> and <hi>Sousa</hi> with their Ships to <hi>Cochin;</hi> resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, though ill provided, to return to <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> alone, being fearful of <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had sided with the Viceroy. With great hazard he arrived at the Island <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> had now fixed every thing for his design upon <hi>Ormuz,</hi> dispatched the Trading Ships, and other affairs with great expedition. About the end of <hi>Ianuary</hi> he sailed from <hi>Cochin</hi> with 1700 men in 21 Vessels of several sorts and sizes. <hi>Albuquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> at the River <hi>Onor,</hi> sent for the Pirat <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moja</hi> (before spoken of) who desirous of our Friendship, and being Powerful, came presently with much Provision. He being skilful in the affairs of <hi>Asia, Albuquerque</hi> communicated his design to him. But he dissuaded, shewing how much better it was to attempt <hi>Goa,</hi> that was unprovided, and would be more advantagious. This pleased <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> and hereupon calling his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to Council, it was proposed to them by the said <hi>Timoja,</hi> and the Design appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of and commended by all. <hi>Timoja</hi> furnished 12 Ships, giving out he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Portugueses to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> to the end that <hi>Goa</hi> might be less provided. <hi>Timoja</hi> had been dispossessed of his Fortune, and ill treated by his Kindred and Neighbours. The desire of revenge, and recovering what
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54711:102"/>
he had lost, caused his Love to our People, that it may always appear, that private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests are the ruin of the Country. On the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> they came to an anchor in the Port of <hi>Goa.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>TIcuari</hi> is an Island on the Coast of <hi>Canara,</hi> formed by two Mouths of the River <hi>Gacim,</hi> its length from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West</hi> 3 Leagues, the breadth one. There is in it Hill and Plain, has good Water, very Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Pleasant, Beautiful and Healthy. On the Northern part of it is seated the City <hi>Goa,</hi> which formerly was on the South. This now in being was built by <hi>Melique Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem,</hi> a Moor, 40 years before the arrival of the Portugueses. The Old is not known when founded; but some Authentick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings have been found, wherein is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that <hi>Mantrasat,</hi> King thereof, above 100 years before, confesses one only God, the Incarnation of his Son, and the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Unity; whence appears they had knowledge of the true Faith; to which may
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54711:103"/>
be added, that when the City was taken, there was found in a Wall a Copper Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix. These might be the fruits of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Preaching.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. About the year 1300 the Moors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conquer <hi>India.</hi> The first that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it with great Power was <hi>Xa Nosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin,</hi> King of <hi>Delhi;</hi> with a Powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my he came down from the <hi>North,</hi> conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the Gentiles as far as the Kingdom of <hi>Canara.</hi> Thence he returned to <hi>Delhi,</hi> leaving <hi>Habedxa</hi> to prosecute the Conquests, who by his Valour and Conduct became so great, that he coped with his Master, which beginning, his Nephew <hi>Madura</hi> prosecuting, possessed himself of the Kingdom of <hi>Canara,</hi> and casting off his Allegiance to the King, he called the Kingdom <hi>Decan,</hi> from the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Nations wherewith he Conquered it, this Word signifying so much in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Too great an Empire always threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens ruin. <hi>Mamudxa</hi> fearing this, used great industry to secure himself, which was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for some time; but at length seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Governours intrusted with Provinces of this Empire, erected them into Sovereignties. The greatest of these was he of <hi>Goa,</hi> about the time of our coming into <hi>India,</hi> called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayo,</hi> deceased about the time of <hi>Albuquerque</hi>'s design upon <hi>Goa;</hi> and <hi>Cufo,</hi> King of <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> had possessed himself of the City, and put it into the Hands of his Son <hi>Ismael.</hi> The other Princes were <hi>Nizamaluco, Mudremaluco Melic Verido, Coje Moçadan, Abexeiapado</hi> and <hi>Cotama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luco,</hi> all great, some very great. <hi>Sabayo</hi> was
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54711:103"/>
born at <hi>Saba,</hi> a City of <hi>Persia,</hi> of very mean extraction, but served the King of <hi>Decan</hi> so fortunately, that he gave him the City <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berga.</hi> Thence he extended his Conquests of the Pagans of <hi>Bisnagar,</hi> and after over the Island of <hi>Goa,</hi> lately possessed by the Moors come from <hi>Onor, Melique Hozem</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Lord of it, who defended it with 1200 men, and was killed in the defence. <hi>Goa</hi> had several dependencies, and with these and others he gained <hi>Sabayo,</hi> became the most Powerful of those Princes, and consequently hated of them all. He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained himself against all whilst he lived, sometimes by Policy, sometimes by Force; but his death produced great alteration.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We left the great <hi>Albuquerque</hi> at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor before the Bar of <hi>Goa,</hi> let us see what he acted. It was necessary to sail up the River, on whose Bank the City is seated; therefore he sent his Nephew <hi>Don Antonio de Noronha</hi> and <hi>Timoja</hi> to sound it. A light Vessel leading the way, spied a Brigantine of the Moors, and giving it chase, found they drew under a Fort well stored with Artillery and 400 men, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Yaçu Gorgi,</hi> a valiant Turk, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the entrance of the River. <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi> seeing the other in the chase, pressed after him; and though the attack of the Bulwark seemed difficult, they attacked, and after a stout resistance took it, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander having almost lost a Hand, and not able to stop the flight of his men, retired to the City. Mean while <hi>Timoja,</hi> not to be
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54711:104"/>
out-done, took another Bulwark on the Continent, defended by some Artillery and 30 men. Then they sounded the River. Next day as <hi>Albuquerque</hi> entred the River, he was met by <hi>Mirali,</hi> and other Chief Men of the City, who came to surrender it, upon condition their Lives, Liberties and Estates should be secured. The reason of this surrender was, that the Turk <hi>Yaçu</hi> had terrified them with the relation of what he had seen a few Portugueses do, and that a <hi>Iogue</hi> (these are Religious Men among those People, esteemed Saints and Prophets) not long before had declared, that place should soon be subject to Strangers. <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> accepted the offer, and anchoring before the City on the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> was received on the Shoar as if he had been their Natural Prince. He mounted on a Horse, they brought him, with Rich Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, at the Gate received the Keys, and went on to the Pallace, built by <hi>Sabayo.</hi> He found there much Cannon, Arms, Tackle, and many Horses. Next he gave such Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as were to the satisfaction of all the City, then dispatched several Embassies to divers Kings, which produced no effect, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed the greatness of his Thought.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Neighbouring Towns depending on <hi>Goa,</hi> came instantly to make their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and were kindly received. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Fort was given to <hi>Don Antonio de Noronna;</hi> the Government of the Infidels to <hi>Timoja,</hi> and so the other Posts to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral satisfaction. Understanding that Ships

of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>oast of <hi>Arabia</hi> were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at <hi>Baticala,</hi> four Vessels were sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which took and carried them to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi> sending plenty of Provision to <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque.</hi> Now our Fortune begins to frown. The Moors begin to exercise their Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Those whom <hi>Albuquerque</hi> most relied upon conspire, and after four Months revolt, notwithstanding the most faithful <hi>Timoja</hi> blamed his confidence. They had deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves up so easily to shun their own ruin, and gain time till <hi>Ismael Hidalcam</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to come to their relief. So it fell out, and he came on with great Power, sending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his great General <hi>Camalcam,</hi> with 1500 Horse and 8000 Foot. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> disposed his men with great diligence and order to receive him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The first step was to secure the Heads of the Conspiracy, and the chief being <hi>Mir Cazem,</hi> to whom he had given the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of 400 Moors, and his Nephew, they were hewed to pieces by his Guards, others were hanged in publick places, and others kept Prisoners, there being 100 convicted. This discovery, with the punishment, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the City. <hi>Camalcam</hi> attempted to pass over to the Island, having prepared Boats to that effect. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> opposed him, and took 12 Boats. Many of the Enemies were killed, many devoured by the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles, wherewith that River abounds. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless <hi>Camalcam</hi> landed in the Island, which was quitted by our men, and some Cannon had been lost, had not two Masons
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54711:105"/>
maintained it, though our Gentry fled, till they were killed, and it brought off. After some resistance, all retired into the City. <hi>Camalcam</hi> encamped about it, playing his Cannon effectually; <hi>Albuquerque</hi> did what the Place permitted, and now comes up <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalcam</hi> with 60000 Men, whereof 5000 were Horse. Part of this Army passed the River, and the rest was divided into two parts, one Commanded by a Famous Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, the other by his Mother and Women, who maintained their Souldiers by the gain of 4000 Common Women they had with them; so that the Women lived upon them, and they upon the Women. The siege was closed by the coming of the King, and no place left <hi>Albuquerque</hi> to act any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable. It is prudence sometimes to yield to necessity. It was resolved in a Council, before day to abandon the City. This was executed with great hazard, for the way to the Ships began to be stopped by <hi>Hidalcam,</hi> and <hi>Albuquerque</hi> had his Horse killed, yet got off without loss, after a siege of 20 days.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It was resolved to winter in that Sea, and to this effect drew into a Bay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though not commodious, the best thereabouts; and because the Fort of <hi>Pangi</hi> with much Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery incommoded them, there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy but gaining of it; 300 Portugueses were appointed for the attack. <hi>Don Antonio de Noronha,</hi> with a Party, was appointed as a reserve, to relieve where there was most need, and <hi>Albuquerque</hi> to guard the Shoar. At the same time they prepared by Night
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54711:105"/>
to appear with the day before the Fort; there marched 500 men, sent by <hi>Hidalcam</hi> to reinforce it. They Joy of these People was so great, that those without, as well as those within being all drunk, they mistook our Men, one side thinking it was the Relief sent them, and the other believing it was the Garrison came out to receive them. They were undeceived by the execution done upon them, 340 being slain, the rest rouced, with the loss of one man acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally drowned. The same hapned at the Bulwark <hi>Timoja</hi> had before gained at <hi>Bardes. Hidalcam</hi> hearing of this, was so terrified, that he went from the City, and his fear was the more, because some Conjurer had told him he should be killed by a great Shot near some River. He sent some ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Messages to <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> to discover what was doing aboard the Ships, and he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, still adding to his fear. By this means he exchanged those Moors he had kept Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, for the Portugueses that were left in the City at their abandoning of it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> had intelligence some Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels were preparing to burn his Ships, and he resolved to anticipate by firing them, and they being drove up the Harbour, <hi>Don Antonio de Noronha</hi> was killed in this action. This man used to moderate the Violent Passions of his Uncle <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after shewed the effect of his rigid Severity, by hanging a Souldier because he found him with one of the Slaves he called Daughters, that he used to give in Marriage.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54711:106"/>
And when some of the Officers asked him what Authority he had to put this in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, putting them under Deck, he lifted his Sword over them, saying, That was his Commission against all that were disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and then broke them all. They all suffered much hardship this <hi>Winter,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Hunger. Sailing hence they discovered four Sail, which were judged to be Turks; but coming nearer, appeared to be some of the Fleet come from <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. This year King <hi>Emanuel</hi> had dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Squadrons for <hi>India,</hi> one of seven the other of four Ships; after them went out two Ships more, and a third to settle a Trade at <hi>Madagascar.</hi> The four Ships under <hi>Iames Mendez</hi> were those <hi>Albuquerque</hi> met at his setting out from <hi>Goa,</hi> and gave him the News of the other Ships that were on their way, which was a great satisfaction to him, being the better enabled to prosecute his great designs. <hi>Gonçalo Siqueira</hi> with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Ships arrived at <hi>Cananor,</hi> soon after <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque,</hi> who communicated the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize upon <hi>Goa,</hi> but was over-ruled by <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queira</hi> and went to <hi>Cochin.</hi> By the way he obtained a Victory over the Malabares of <hi>Calicut,</hi> who opposed our lading Pepper; then he dispatched <hi>Siqueira</hi> with the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ships homeward-bound, and soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Duarte de Lemos</hi> with four more, and then turned his view again to the affair of <hi>Goa.

finding this, commanded him and his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, upon the severest penalties, not to stir without his Orders. It troubled them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they feared losing the opportunity of going to <hi>Malaca,</hi> whither the King sent them; but they obeyed. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> set out from <hi>Cananor</hi> with 23 Sail, and therein 1500 Fighting-men. He passed by <hi>Onor</hi> to joyn <hi>Timoja,</hi> whom he found busied in his Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, being to marry the Daughter of a Queen, and he desiring to be honoured with the Presence of <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> obliged him to land, which proved very dangerous, for a Storm rising kept them ashoar three days, and when he returned to his Ships, a Boat with 30 men was lost. <hi>Timoja</hi> sent with him three Ships, and promised to join him at <hi>Goa</hi> with 6000 men.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. On the <hi>22th</hi> of <hi>November Albuquerque</hi> anchored the second time before the Bar Calling to mind the dangers he had there escaped, and the discontent that was among some of his Officers, he thought fit to sooth the Principals with an obliging Harangue, and therewith won all their Inclinations. At break of day, on the Feast of St. <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> the City was assaulted with great slaughter of the Enemy that maintained the Shoar, but (though it seem strange) not one Portugues killed. The Enemy fled to recover one of the Gates of the City, and our men to enter with them. Here the Fight was renewed, till many Portugueses forced their way in, doing great execution in the Streets. They cleared all to the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54711:107"/>
Pallace with great danger, and loss of five Men of Note; and there was a most furious Contest begun with equal Valour on both sides. Now <hi>Albuquerque</hi> having done what became him, came up, and Fortune appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly on our side, the Moors fled, and abandoned the City, endeavouring to get over to the Continent, but through hast and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion perished in the River. After the Victory it was found, that of 9000 Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-men who defended the Town, 6000 had perished, and 50 Portugueses. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deorao,</hi> who commanded the three Ships sent by <hi>Timoja,</hi> behaved himself well. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moja</hi> with 3000 men came too late, he was only Witness to the Slaughter. The booty of Horses, Artillery, Arms, Provisions and Ships was excessive, and such as was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the great designs <hi>Albuquerque</hi> had conceived.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Our Dead were honourably buried, those of the Enemy in the Bellies of the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles of that River, into which they were cast. Not one Moor was left alive in the Island. The Gentiles, who were Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were restored to their Farms, and the Government of them given to <hi>Timoja,</hi> and after to <hi>Melrao,</hi> a Nephew of the King of <hi>Onor.</hi> Whilst <hi>Albuquerque</hi> setled these Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he received many Embassadors with Congratulations of his success from several Princes of <hi>Malabar.</hi> Many of <hi>Hidalean</hi>'s Officers, then, and afterwards made inroads as far as <hi>Goa,</hi> but always returned with loss. <hi>Iames Mendez</hi> and his two other Captains,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54711:107"/>
desirous to go to <hi>Malaca,</hi> stole away out of the Port by Night, contrary to <hi>Albuquerque</hi>'s Orders. He sent after them, and being brought back Prisoners, he Ordered they should be sent to answer it in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and two Pilots condemned to be hanged at the Yard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms. Some were suspicious that <hi>Albuquerque</hi> detained <hi>Iames Mendez,</hi> lest he should take <hi>Malaca,</hi> which Action he designed for himself; others said, he kept him from the danger <hi>Siqueira</hi> met with there, that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize requiring a greater Power.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> providing for the safety of <hi>Goa,</hi> laid the Foundation of a Fort, which he called <hi>Emanuel,</hi> being the King's Name. He caused the Names of the Captains who were at the taking of it, to be carved upon a Stone; but because every one would be named before the others, he turned down the Stone, hiding the Names, and on what was visible put this Inscription, <hi>Lapidem quem reprobraverunt aedificantes;</hi> and thus they were all pleased; for the Portugueses had rather their own Praise should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, than that another should partake. He coined Mony, that of Gold he called <hi>Emanuels,</hi> that of Silver, <hi>Esperas,</hi> and half <hi>Esperas</hi> that of Copper.

                        <p>A Continuation of the Conquests under King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> the Year 1511, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Alfonso de Albuquerque.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE City <hi>Malaca,</hi> whither <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> now directed his Course, is seated on that part of Land, being a Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sula, commonly called by the name of <hi>Aurea Chersonesus,</hi> and upon that Channel which parts the Island <hi>Sumatra</hi> from the Continent of <hi>Asia,</hi> about the middle of that Channel, in something more than two Degrees of <hi>North</hi> Latitude, stretched along the Shoar about a League, in the same manner as <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi> It is divided by a River, and the two parts joyned by a Bridge. The Buildings of Wood, except the Mosque and Pallace, which were of Stone. It afforded a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Prospect to the Sea, and was well secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Fortifications. The Port was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with abundance of Ships, as being the great Market of all those Parts. It was first built by the <hi>Celates,</hi> a People for the most part imployed in Fishing, who joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>Malayes,</hi> that before inhabited the Mountains. They were assisted by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risamora,</hi> submitting to him. This Man had been great in the Island of <hi>Iava,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by a Tyrant who usurped his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, fled to <hi>Cincapura,</hi> where being well
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54711:109"/>
entertained by that King, he rebelled against him, and was again cast out by the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> and so forced to wander about <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi> a just punishment for his ingratitude. He having increased the new Colony, gave it the name of his Fortune; for <hi>Malaca</hi> in that Language signifies a Banished Man. The first King of <hi>Malaca</hi> was <hi>Xaque Darxa,</hi> or as another Author says, <hi>Raal Sabu)</hi> Son of <hi>Paramisora,</hi> subject to him of <hi>Siam,</hi> from whom his Successors revolted. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Malaca</hi> is subject to Inundations, full of thick Woods, stored with hurtful and dangerous Creatures, chiefly Tigers, which obliges many people to pass the Nights on the tops of high Trees, because they fetch them off the low ones with a leap. The Men are couragious, the Women wanton. The Trade of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> make <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca</hi> most Rich and Populous. <hi>Mahomet</hi> reigned at this time, against whom the King of <hi>Siam</hi> had sent an Army of 40000 men, most whereof perished by sundry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and partly by the treachery of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> which he practised with <hi>Iames Lopez de Siqueira;</hi> but now came <hi>Albuquerque</hi> to revenge them all. <hi>Mohomet</hi> feared the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his baseness, and therefore brought to his aid the King of <hi>Pam</hi> with a great Force, and had now 30000 men and 8000 pieces of Cannon, and yet his fear was greater than his preparations.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> sailing from <hi>Cochin,</hi> by the way he took five Ships of the Moors bound for <hi>Malaca,</hi> off of <hi>Ceylon.</hi> The King
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54711:109"/>
of <hi>Pedir,</hi> in the Island <hi>Sumatra,</hi> sent some Moors to visit him, and with <hi>Iohn de Viegas,</hi> one of the Portugueses left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind by <hi>Siqueira,</hi> who, with others, flying from Slavery, arrived at <hi>Pedir.</hi> The same was done by the King of <hi>Paçem. Neboada Beeguea,</hi> of the Principals of the Treachery of <hi>Malaca,</hi> was fled from <hi>Pedir,</hi> and being beaten and taken at Sea by <hi>Ayres Pereyra,</hi> to the general astonishment of all that beheld him, he shed not one drop of Blood, though pierced with several mortal Wounds; but scarce had they taken off his Arm a Bracelet of Bone, when the Blood gushed out. The Indians discovered the Secret, saying it was the Bone of a Beast that breeds in <hi>Iava,</hi> which has that virtue; it was esteemed a great Prize, and brought to <hi>Albuquerque.</hi> Next they met a Vessel with 300 Moors, so resolute, <hi>Albuquerque</hi> was forced to come up himself to take it, not without some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. In this Vessel was <hi>Geniall,</hi> the rightful King of <hi>Paçem,</hi> banished by the tyranny of the present Possessor. Three other Vessels were taken soon after, whereof one gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the affairs of <hi>Malaca,</hi> in which Port our Fleet anchored on the <hi>1st</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> with much noise of Warlike Instruments and Cannon, terrifying all the People that covered the Shoar; for the guilt of what they had before acted, made then sensible what this Fleet was designed for; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no surer foreteller of their punishment to wicked men, than their own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:54711:110"/>
3. Next day came a Gallant Moor, with a deceitful Message, from the King to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque.</hi> He received him with great state, the greatest was that of his Person and Venerable Beard, which had never been cut since he was at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> he saying it should never be cut till he sat to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon the Back of <hi>Coje Atar;</hi> so it grew to such a length, that he knotted it to his Girdle. He treated the Moor courteously, whose Message contained, that if he came for Merchandize it was ready. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was, That the Merchandize he sought for, were some Portugueses that were in the City ever since <hi>Siqueira</hi> went away; that having got them, he would let the King know what more he demanded of the King and City. The Moor at his return spread the terror of this Answer, and it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agreed to buy off that danger by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing the Portugueses, and paying a sum of Mony. Prince <hi>Alodim</hi> and his Brother-in-law the King of <hi>Pam</hi> prevented the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this, and made ready to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> began some military ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, whereupon the King restored the Captives. Other Messages were sent by the King in order to appease <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> who answered, That he offered him Peace upon condition he permitted him instantly to raise a Fort there, and repayed the Charge of his and <hi>Siqueira</hi> coming to that Port, since his Falshood had been the cause of all the damage sustained; and that he must imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately return an answer, whether he chose
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54711:110"/>
Peace or War. The King desired an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, but his Son and the King of <hi>Pam</hi> opposed it. At last they all made the necessary preparations to repel the danger.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. On the Eve of St. <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle, the Signal was given for landing, with great Shouts and noise of Guns; immediately the Portugueses leap ashoar, and mix with the Enemy. The hottest of the dispute was about gaining and maintaing the Bridge, which <hi>Albuquerque</hi> had undertaken himself, and was vigorously defended till the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies pressed, leaped into the River, where many were killed, and many drowned. The Prince and King of <hi>Pam</hi> bravely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood another party of ours that would make their way to the Bridge. King <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> came out on a bulky Elephant, with two more carrying Castles on their Backs, whence flew a great number of Darts. Our men attacking the Beasts, so wounded them, that they fled, trampling their own men, and making way for ours to joyn those at the Bridge. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> then fortified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self there, and because much harm was done with poisoned Arrows from the tops of neighbouring Houses, he caused them to be burnt. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> bestowing great Praises on his Captains for their Valour, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they were scorched with the heat, and faint for want of Meat, retired with them to the Ships about Night, where ten died of poisoned Arrows. The Enemies loss was not known. The King of <hi>Pam</hi> went away, on pretence of bringing a recruit, but returned not.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:54711:111"/>
5. Whilst <hi>Albuquerque</hi> rested in his Ships re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing his men, the King harrased his, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the Streets to blow us up, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them with poisoned Thorns that might gore us at coming in; he planted more Artillery in many places, and secured the Bridge. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> sent <hi>Antony de Abreu</hi> in a Vessel well manned, to gain it; from the Bridge flew Showers of Bullets, and <hi>Deniz Fernandez de Melo</hi> seeing him near killed, endeavoured to carry him off to the Ships to be dressed, but he with wonderful constancy said, <hi>Though I have neither strength to Fight, nor voice to Command, I have still life to keep my Post.</hi> Floats of Wildfire were drove along the River to burn the Vessel, and no remedy to prevent it, till <hi>Albuquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> effected it by gaining the Bridge; then the Vessel had liberty to act. Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander enters the City through Showers of Bullets, Arrows and Darts. Understanding the danger of the Mines which were in a broad Street, he took another way and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Mosque; and at last with vast slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Enemy, took entire possession of the City, having with him in this Action only 800 Portugueses and 200 Malabares.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In nine days time all the Moors were killed, or driven out of that great Place. It was Peopled again by Strangers, and some Malayes, to whom leave was granted. Among them came that Powerful Native of <hi>Iava Utimutiraja,</hi> whose Son had like to kill <hi>Siqueira.</hi> The Souldiers had three days liberty to plunder. There were found 3000
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54711:111"/>
Pieces of great Cannon; of 8000 that King <hi>Mahomet</hi> relied upon, being with the rest retired to <hi>Bintam,</hi> where with Prince <hi>Alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim</hi> he fortified himself. This would be of dangerous consequence, therefore <hi>Albuquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> sent out 400 of his men, and with them went 400 of <hi>Utimutiraja,</hi> and 300 belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Merchants of <hi>Pegu,</hi> these put the Prince to flight, took seven Elephants with costly Trappings, and retired. The King now wandred the Woods, blaming the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy of his Son and the King of <hi>Pam;</hi> so the Father and Son fell out and parted, each shifting for himself. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly built the Fort, which he called <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosa</hi> for its beauty, and Church dedicated to the Visitation of our Lady. He Coined Mony (as had been done at <hi>Goa)</hi> of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Names and different Value, which was proclaimed about the Streets, and some scattered among the People. By these and other honourable Actions he gained the Hearts of the Strangers, and secured this most Important Place.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> though he saw into the Soul of <hi>Utimutiraja,</hi> knowing it sometimes convenient to trust an Enemy, gave him the Command of the Moors who remained in the City. But he kept private Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with Prince <hi>Alodim,</hi> on pretence to restore him, but in reality to the intent to set himself up. This was not so private but it was discovered, and he, his Son, and Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law were apprehended, and publickly (after Conviction) executed on the same
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54711:112"/>
Scaffold they had erected for <hi>Siqueira.</hi> This was the first piece of Publick Justice execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Portugueses in <hi>India.</hi> One Fire is followed by another. <hi>Pate Quitir,</hi> a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>Iava,</hi> to whom <hi>Alfonso</hi> gave that Government, took a sum of Mony of the Wife of <hi>Utimutiraja</hi> (whom he had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded) and a promise to give him her Daughter, upon condition he would revenge the death of her Husband on the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses, to whom she had offered 100000 Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats for his Life. <hi>Pate</hi> accepted the Offer, with the same intention of seizing the City. The King of <hi>Campar</hi> also having this design, sent to Congratulate with <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his Service, and asking the Command of <hi>Pate Quitir.</hi> But this had no effect now, in its time it shall be related. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> received here several Embassies, particularly from the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> who rejoyced to see his Quarrel revenged, though by another hand. He also sent Embassadors to <hi>Siam,</hi> to <hi>Pegu;</hi> and two to discover the Islands of <hi>Maluco</hi> and <hi>Banda.</hi> They had all Orders to publish every where what had hapned at <hi>Malaca,</hi> and offer the Trade of that Place on better terms than it was before. All things being ordered, the best the time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, he resolved to return to <hi>Cochin,</hi> leaving <hi>Ruy de Brito Patalim</hi> to Command in the Fort with above 300 men. The like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to guard the Sea, in ten Ships, under <hi>Fernando Perez de Andrade. Albuquerque</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with himself four Sail.</p>

8. Whilst this passed at <hi>Malaca,</hi> there broke out a Rebellion of many of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives at <hi>Goa,</hi> and <hi>Pulate Cam,</hi> an Officer of <hi>Hidalcam,</hi> appeared before it with a good Body of Men; he passed over into the Island and besieged the City. One of the Principal Exploits was a Sally made by our Commander <hi>Rodrigo Rebelo,</hi> in which was done much execution. But soon after he was killed, and with him <hi>Manuel de Cunna,</hi> so that things were in a bad posture. To remedy this, by Publick Consent <hi>Iames Mendez de Vasconcellos</hi> was chose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Pulate Cam</hi> gave some jealousie, that he designed to usurp this Territory, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which <hi>Hidalcam</hi> sent his Brother-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law <hi>Rotzmo Cam,</hi> who overcame him with the assistance of <hi>Iames Mendez,</hi> whom he drew to his Aid, and after would drive out of the City, finding himself with a power of 7000 men, there being then not above 1200 in the Town, whereof the third part only were Portugueses. He laid siege, and Hunger began to press within, and some of our men deserted, whereof part repenting, returned, which gave the first hopes to the Besieged</p>

in the Confusion; <hi>Peter de Alpoem</hi> coming up, though with much danger, saved him. The loss he most lamented was that Bone which hindred the wounded Moor from bleeding, and some Iron Lions of curious Work, which he had designed for Supporters to his Tomb. Some men were lost. <hi>Albuquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> went into <hi>Alpoem</hi>'s Ship, and prosecuting his Voyage, took two Ships of Moors, which, though Rich, made not amends for his great loss. Immediately upon his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at <hi>Cochin,</hi> being informed of the distress of <hi>Goa,</hi> he dispatched thither eight Vessels with Men and Provisions, and a Promise of his speedy coming in Person.

At the same time came an Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and one from him of <hi>Ormuz</hi> to go to <hi>Portugal.

He was received at <hi>Goa</hi> as a publick Father, and being informed of the past as well as present posture of Affairs; he visited the Fortifications, and studied how to drive <hi>Rotzomo Cam</hi> from his Works. The sixth day from his arrival, being on an eminence with some Gentlemen viewing 4000 Moors and 200 Horse, who diverted themselves in the Field, it being <hi>Friday,</hi> which is their Sabbath, he could not hinder our men from rushing upon them, and driving them up to their Fortifications, where was a hot Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, and our men victorious with some Booty, having killed above 100, and lost one Captain and another man, and some wounded.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> resolving to take that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress from the Enemy, gave the assault by Land and Sea, and thinking it was not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously carried on by Sea, he leaped into a Boat, and came so near that a Cannon Ball killed a <hi>Canara</hi> that steered the Vessels, dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his Brains and Blood on his Beard. This so inflamed him, that he promised a reward to any that should break that Cannon, and immediately one of our Gunners directed a Ball into the Mouth of it, wherewith it flew in pieces and killed the Canonier. This made way for our men to come up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and lay the siege closer, when <hi>Zufolari</hi> appearing on the Continent with 7000 men coming to the relief of it, but finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be done, he retired with some loss sustained by our Cannon. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> set down before the place with 4000 men, whereof 3000 were Portugueses, in two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, one Commanded by himself, the other by his Nephew <hi>Don Garcia de Noronha.</hi> At first we received some damage, but afterwards did so much, that <hi>Rotzomo Cam</hi> surrendred upon condition to leave the Fort with all the Cannon and Ammunition, and deliver all the Slaves and Renegadoes, which last <hi>Albuquerque</hi> punished by cutting off their Noses, Ears, Right Hands, and Thumbs of the Left, and sending them so maimed to <hi>Portugal.</hi> One of these was <hi>Ferdinando Lopez,</hi> who to do Pennance for his Sins, voluntarily staid with a Black in the Island St. <hi>Helena,</hi> where he was afterward serviceable to some Ships, and began to sow that Island.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Albuquerque</hi> endeavoured to bring <hi>Rotzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Cam</hi> over to the Portugues Service, but succeeded not. But this his Fortune terrified many Princes. The King of <hi>Calicut</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a Treaty with <hi>Don Garcia de Noronha,</hi> whom his Uncle had sent to <hi>Cochin</hi> to take
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54711:115"/>
charge of Affairs there. Those of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singa</hi> and <hi>Bisa, Hidalcam</hi> and others sent Embassadors, to all which he answered, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling the value of the Portugueses Amity, and the terror of their Arms; and being dispatched, sent after them Messengers of his own to inform those Princes, and gain intelligence of them. Now arrived at <hi>Goa, Mathew,</hi> Embassador from <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> in order to go to <hi>Portugal;</hi> he brought with him a piece of the Holy Cross, and Letters from Queen <hi>Helena,</hi> who Governed that Kingdom during the minority of her Son <hi>David.</hi> The design of this Embassie was to settle Amity with our King, and ask Aid against the Moors, who ever infested that Empire. The Embassador said, that at his Masters Court there were then three Portugueses, one call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iohn,</hi> who stiled himself Embassador of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and two who said they had been lately set ashoar at Cape <hi>Guardafu</hi> to discover the Country. These were <hi>Iohn Gomez</hi> and <hi>Iohn Sanchez,</hi> set ashoar there by Order of <hi>Albuquerque</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, with a Moor for that discovery.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Finding the Affairs of <hi>Goa</hi> in so good a posture, he resolved to put in execution an Enterprize he had been charged with by King <hi>Emanuel.</hi> This was the Conquest of the City <hi>Aden.</hi> He fitted 20 Ships, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acquainting any body with the design When ready to sail he acquainted the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains with his intentions. The number of the men was 1700 Portugueses, and 800 Canaras and Malabars. They set sail the

                        <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and arrived safe at <hi>Aden. Miramirzan,</hi> Governour of the Town, sent to complement <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> and a Present of Provision. Several Messages passing, and no hopes of a surrender appearing, it was resolved to give the assault.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The City <hi>Aden</hi> is seated on the Coast of <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> near the Mouth of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> called by <hi>Ptolomy, Modocan.</hi> Over it appears the Mountain <hi>Arzira,</hi> all a barren Rock, in many Cliffs. The Town from the Sea looks beautiful and strong. It is rich and famous for the great resort thither of many Nations. The Soil so scarce of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that it has only a few Wells and Cisterns. Even from the Clouds it is scarce watered above once in two or three years; whence it is void of all Trees, Plants and Orchards, the delight and pleasure of other Towns.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> found the Enterprize was more difficult than it had been represented. On <hi>Easter-Eve</hi> in the Morning our men landed with Scaling Ladders, this being thought the proper method for gaining the place. It was doubtful who first mounted the Wall, but several being already upon it, the Ladders, overburdened with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that pressed to get up, broke several times, so that there was no hope of relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving those who had gained the top, and stood in great danger, and <hi>Albuquerque</hi> was forced to order them down, making one out of the broken Ladders, some fighting while the others came off. After four hours engagement, they retired with great danger
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54711:116"/>
and loss, more sustained by the accident than the Enemy. <hi>George Silveyra</hi> and five men were killed, some died after of their wounds, and some with the fall from the Wall.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> complying with his ill fortune, and the persuasions of his Captains, and to save time, resolved to give over that attempt, and sail towards the Mouth of the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> But first they took a Bulwark that guarded the Port, where many Moors were killed, and 37 great pieces of Cannon found.</p>
                     <p>The Ships were all first plundered, and then burnt. The fourth day after their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival they sailed out of this Port, and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Mouth of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> next the Coast of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which was much celebrated with great signs of Joy by <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> as being the first of our Nation that had entred those Seas.</p>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54711:118"/>
improved his absence to carry on his Treason. One Night he killed a Captain of ours, and took some Cannon, and fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself therewith and with what he had before, and 6000 Men and two Elephants. <hi>Ferdinando Perez</hi> and <hi>Alfonso Pessoa</hi> with 320 Men attacked him, one by Land, the other by Water; after a vigorous defence, many of his men being slain, he fled to the Woods.

Being put to the Rack, they confessed there was a Son of <hi>Pate Quitir</hi> among them, and that they were followed by three Vessels with the like lading, which were also taken, and all carried to the City. At the same time arrived <hi>Gomez de Cunna</hi> with his Ship laden with Provision; he came from <hi>Pegu,</hi> where he had been settling Peace with that King. The Famine being appeased, and Men recovered, <hi>Ferdinando Perez</hi> with his Fleet attacked <hi>Pate Quitir,</hi> and fortunately burnt his Fort, obliging him to fly to <hi>Iava.

He was very rich, and ordered in a Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place a Scaffold to be erected, adorned with Rich Silks and Cloath of Gold; in the middle he placed a great heap of sweet Aromatick Wood, and strewed the Street from his House thither with sweet Herbs and Flowers, and hung it answerable to the scaffold. He invited his Friends, and clad himself and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily richly.

The Governour <hi>Raez Nordim</hi> came with his Nephew to ratifie all, to whom <hi>Albuquerque</hi> gave rich Presents, and by them sent the King a rich Coller of Gold, no less valuable for the Workmanship than the Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and a Standard with the Portugues Arms, to declare the Union between both Nations. Publick demonstrations of Joy were made on both sides for this agreement, with sound of Warlike Instruments and noise of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. On <hi>Palm Sunday Albuquerque</hi> took pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Fort before begun, which in few days did rise to a great height, and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque</hi> with some of his Captains went into the Houses neighbouring to it.</p>

The King of <hi>Ormuz</hi> was at a Window to see this Reception. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent consisted of Ounces, Brocards, Precious Stones, and Jewels of Gold, and many Silks.

The Embassador was honourably received, and the Treaty concluded with mutual satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Raez Hamet</hi> was come from <hi>Persia</hi> with a design to secure <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and deliver it up to his King <hi>Ismael.</hi> He so far gained upon the King, that he absolutely governed him, and nothing was done but by his direction. The better to carry on the Enterpize, he underhand brought People into <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and was actually in readiness to kill the King, but deferred it till a more favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> was informed of all these practices, and how much the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be delivered from that oppression; he studied, and Fortune offered him the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of executing it. An interview was appointed between the King and <hi>Albuquerque.</hi> His Evil Conscience warned <hi>Raez Hamet</hi> to shun that danger. He proposed <hi>Albuquerque</hi> should come to the King, lest the King go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should carry him. The other insisted that the King should come to him, and carried it, upon condition that neither Party should be Armed. Some of <hi>Raez Hamet</hi>'s Men broke the Condition, carrying hidden Arms. He was armed himself, and entring the first with much rudeness, <hi>Albuquerque</hi> cried to his Captains, kill him, which was instantly obeyed. The King came, and the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence began; but was interrupted by the noise of the People, supposing the King was killed. <hi>Raez Hamet</hi>'s Men knowing it was he who was slain, ran and possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of, and fortified the King's House.

                        <hi>Albuquerque</hi> would presently have scaled it, but was hindred by the King, who with the assistance of his Governours, found other means to expel those Enemies the City. They were to the number of 700, who all went away to <hi>Persia.</hi> This disorder was succeeded by the Pomp wherewith <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> and all his Captains accompanied the King to his Pallace, to the great Joy of the whole City, seeing their Prince deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that Tyrany, and restored to the Majesty of a King. Then <hi>Albuquerque</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s Embassador, sending along with him <hi>Ferdinando Gomez,</hi> with a Present of double the value of that he had received. He was to give an account of what had been done at <hi>Ormuz.</hi> He was well received, and brought a favourable Answer.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It requires a larger History to give an account of the Affairs and Kings of <hi>Persia.</hi> Let it suffice to say, that the Valiant Prince Reigning at this time, was embroiled in War with the Turk, which was one cause of sending this Embassie, hoping to make an advantage of our Arms against his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Whilst the Fort was building, or rather finishing, <hi>Albuquerque</hi> persuaded the King it was for the safety of the City to put all their Cannon into the Fort, pretending thereby to secure them against their Enemies, but in reality to disable them from offending him. Security is a Powerful Argument where there is Fear. The King and his Governours,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54711:124"/>
though with some reluctancy, consented to all was demanded. The Command of the Fort was given to <hi>Peter de Albuquerque.</hi> So was that Rich and Powerful Kingdom brought under the Portugues subjection, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the advantage than detriment of its Natural Kings; more oppressed before by the tyranny of their Ministers, than by the Tribute they afterwards paid. Besides the security it enjoyed, being protected by our Arms; but that Liberty is sweeter than all other Conveniencies.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. These Affairs settled, <hi>Albuquerque</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himself to dispatch the Trading Ships homeward-bound. He sent to this purpose his Nephew <hi>Don Garcia de Noronha</hi> with most of the Fleet to <hi>Cochin,</hi> staying behind himself to conclude such affairs as required his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. Soon after he fell sick, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease increasing, was persuaded for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his health, to go to <hi>India,</hi> which he consented to, to the great grief of the King, who looked upon him as a Father. By the way he met the News, that there were arrived in <hi>India</hi> 12 Ships from <hi>Portugal,</hi> who brought Orders for him to return home. <hi>Lope Soarez,</hi> who Commanded them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed his Successor; hearing this, he cried out, <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> Governour of <hi>India;</hi> this is he, it could be no other. <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Fleet consisted of seven Gallies, two Galleons, and five small Vessels, and carried about 3000 fighting Men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Viceroy anchor'd in the Bay of that City called <hi>Mangalor</hi> and <hi>Olala,</hi> seated on the Banks of a River that washes both sides of it not far distant from the Sea, whence was to be seen a Wall wherewith the Queen had fortified her self, within which and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Works were Thirteen thousand Men
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54711:132"/>
with sufficient Cannon. The Viceroy divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Men into six Battalions, and landed on the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> At night the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> sitting to supper, and to play with many lights, and the same security as if they had been at <hi>Goa,</hi> the Enemy laying hold of the Opportunity sallied in a body of Five hundred, followed by Fifteen hundred, fell upon and put them into such a disorder, they scarce had time to take their Arms. D. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Mascarennas</hi> who had the advanced Post, fared worst; and though he fought well, lost several Men, most perhaps killed by our own Fire, for through the darkness and confusion no body knew what they aimed at.

                     <p n="4">4. On the Eve of the <hi>Epiphany</hi> they gave the Assault, and being as desirous of Revenge as entring the City, soon forc'd their way and fired the Town, at the same time cutting down the Palm-trees. The Queen fled to a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Of the Enemy Five hundred were slain, about Forty of the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> The Viceroy immediately laid the Foundations of the Fort, giving it the name of St. <hi>Sebastian,</hi> because the first stone was laid upon his day, and that day chose in Honour of our King then Reigning. By the middle of <hi>March</hi> the Work was finished with a Church and other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies.

On a sudden he appear'd before it with 450 Sail, 200 Brass Cannons, and 20000 Men. D. <hi>Leonis Pereyra</hi> was at that time on the Shore celebrating the Birth-day of King <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian,</hi> with a certain Exercise used among <hi>Portugueses</hi> on Horseback, and perceiving some of the Company were surprized at the sight of the Fleet, he ordered the Sport to continue, drawing down nearer to the Shore, that the Enemy might not imagin they could disturb his Pastime.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

Cannon, above two hundred scaling Ladders were laid to the Wall with great Shouts on both sides. D. <hi>Leonis</hi> had also distributed his Men in their several Posts. The Priests had undertaken to defend one, but no sooner did the Enemy attack, than they fled to the Church.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In the heat of the Action a Party of ours sallies out upon the Enemies Works, making a great slaughter; among the rest was killed the King of <hi>Aru.</hi> Our Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with one Cannon, and loaded with Musquets, Cimiters, and Heads of all sorts of People that compos'd that Army, having lost but one <hi>Portugues</hi> and six <hi>Malayes.</hi> The Enemy encourag'd by the King who looked on, mounted our Works, and were as soon thrown down by the Defendants. The King in a rage stamp'd and blasphem'd, and seeing three days furious Assault had not gained a foot of Ground, he utterly despair'd of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; therefore with great Secrecy Shipping off all his Army and Train, except Four thousand Men that were killed, he set sail, firing the Ships that were to spare by the loss of those Men. This great Success cost us but three <hi>Portugueses.</hi>

King of <hi>Ujantana</hi> our Neighbour with sixty Sail, who visited our Captain in the Fort, and was received with Royal Magnificence, rejoycing at our Success not without trouble that he had no share in it.</p>
                     <p n="9">9.

                     <p n="10">10. In this Island is a high Mountain, wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about which are 3000 Cells with each of them a Cistern all cut out of the solid Rock.

It is inhabited by two sorts of people, the <hi>Ulimas,</hi> who are native <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and have three Towns; the <hi>Ulensivas</hi> are Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and have four. Our Captain found the Natives assisted by Six hundred of the Islanders of <hi>Iava,</hi> and well fortified under the Command of <hi>Gemiro</hi> Governour of those Islands.

The Enemy retired to a Mountain, and there compounded only for Life, laying down their Arms. But the People of <hi>Amboina</hi> having been the first among those Islands who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the <hi>Portugueses</hi> offering Subjection to our Crown, Lands, and leave to erect a Pillar in their Metropolis with the Royal Arms of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and finally embracing our Religion, and contracting Marriages with us, it will be convenient to look a little back in order to proceed in the relation of these Affairs, and particularly of one wonderful Passage, that may serve as an Example to such as pretend to Plant Colonies.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. The People of <hi>Amboina,</hi> to shew their Gratitude to those who had defended them, invited them to a splendid Entertainment. The Wives of those who made the Feast came abroad to see the <hi>Portugueses</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. One of these (doubtless he was drunk) was so charmed with the Beauty of one of those Women, or so blinded with Lust, that leaping suddenly from his Seat he catched her in his Arms with such insolence, after being three times admonished without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, that if <hi>Genulius,</hi> a Man of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, had not interposed, the <hi>Portugueses</hi> had there been all cut to pieces.

as any, looking upon himself equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that Injury: and knowing it was a new offence every time the injured saw him that gave the wrong; he therefore reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the hainousness of the Crime, and shewing how greatly they were favour'd in having their Lives spared, ordered them instantly to depart the Island, and never more presume to set their feet upon it.</p>

The People overturning the Tables with furious Countenances, gave them to understand they would by force execute what <hi>Genulius</hi> had directed, if the <hi>Portugueses</hi> doubted doing of it by fair means. There was nothing to do but submit, so they went away to their Ships full of shame; their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Confusion paying for the Impudence of one in which all had a share, because none reproved it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Scarce had the <hi>Portugueses</hi> left the Shore, when those of <hi>Amboina</hi> prescribed the same Laws to the People of <hi>Atire</hi> and <hi>Tavire,</hi> that the <hi>Curons,</hi> or <hi>Cerams,</hi> had done to them before. That was, they threatned them with War if they received the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> into their Ports: But those People answer'd, That they were Christians, and as such would admit to their Ports and Houses the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> though it were with hazard of their Lives.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They of <hi>Amboina</hi> were so irritated with this Answer, that falling suddenly upon them, they routed and put to the Sword most of the Inhabitants of those two Places, bringing under their Subjection those Towns
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54711:136"/>
that had submitted to the Crown of <hi>Portugal;</hi> such as refused were reduced by Fire, and Sword, and Slavery. They were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to put to Death those who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in the Faith, unless they did it with barbarous and cruel Tortures. One may serve as an Example of all their other Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A little King of <hi>Elate</hi> was taken, who because he would not renounce the Christian Faith, was tied to a Stake, and Pans of Fire being set before him, they cut off pieces of his Flesh, broi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He with much patience answer'd he did, and was pleased to do that for Christ, who had suffer'd for him: That if after he was dead, they would put a piece of his Flesh into a new Pot, within twenty four hours they would find it converted into Oil, in testimony of the Truth of the Christian Doctrine, and, in fine, that the <hi>Portugueses</hi> would revenge his Death.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. They continued the Torments till he died, and then to try what he had said, put a piece of his Flesh into a new Pot covering it, and the Twenty four hours being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired found it full of most sweet Oil. They were astonished, but did not repent; and soon after the Prophecy was fulfilled by their Ruine.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Gonçalo Pereyra</hi> (as was before said) coming thither defeated them and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors they had from <hi>Iava</hi> and other Places,

He began to revenge it, killing three of them, because they refused to do him Justice. This difference was composed by some well meaning Persons, and the King and <hi>Mesquita</hi> solemnly swore to the Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But it being all deceit in the latter, before six days were expired he murder'd the King as he visited him. This was done at parting, he waited on him to the Door, and his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Martin Alfonso Pimentel</hi> stabbed him by the Unkle's Order.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. When this King the last time Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced that false Friendship, he took to witness of his sincerity the Scutcheon of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> Arms, which represent the Wounds of our Saviour. As he was stabb'd, he laid hold of a Cannon about the place where those same Arms were, saying, <hi>Ah Gentlemen, why do you thus kill the best Subject your King my Master has?</hi> Neither these words, nor the sacredness of the Place, it being hallowed Ground, asswaged their fury. There they strip'd and cut him in pieces,

which being salted and put into a Chest were cast into the Sea in sight of his Queen and Daughters, who begged only for leave to bury him. Such was then the <hi>Portugues</hi> Government, that these and other the like Cruelties and Villainies passed unpunished by them. But God did not so, who first with shame deprived them of those Dominions, and afterwards of a Prince of their own. <hi>Gui Chil Babu,</hi> Son to the deceased, succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the Crown, and just desire of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for such inhuman Oppression.

But this happened later, we shall see it in its proper place.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Viceroy order'd D. <hi>Luis de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meyda</hi> in the Spring to Cruize in the Sea of <hi>Suratte,</hi> to examin what Ships sailed there without our Passes. He had six Ships with him, and was joined by fourteen more, they took three great Ships richly laden, and brought two of them to <hi>Damam,</hi> one having foundred at Sea. This was the last publick Action of the Viceroy. He embarqued to return home and died in the Voyage. It was ordered in his Will, that his right Arm should be cut off, and preserved, to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with his Unkle D. <hi>Nunno Alvarez</hi> at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> and that the Body should be cast into the Sea. It was accordingly performed, and some observed that the cutting off this Arm
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54711:138"/>
was the Execution of the Sentence he had given against himself, when a Relation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing upon him to sign an unjust Paper, he said, <hi>The hand that signs such a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be cut off.</hi> Such is the force of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it makes a Man do the very thing he abhors.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. D. <hi>Anton. de Noronna</hi> was a Man of a good Disposition, Judgment and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was Viceroy the term of four Years the 11th of that number, and twenty-third of the Governours, the first of that Name, and third of the Sirname.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. During the Government of D. <hi>Anton.</hi> the Ships that came from <hi>Lisbon</hi> to <hi>India</hi> were, in the Year 1565 four, in 1566 four more, and four in 1567.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. This Year our great Poet <hi>Luis de Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi> was at <hi>Zofala.</hi> Being very poor in <hi>India,</hi> where he served sixteen Years, <hi>Peter Barreto</hi> who was going to Command at <hi>Zofala</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him great things, and <hi>Camoens</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing came of them, after waiting long he resolved to come for <hi>Portugal</hi> in a Ship that had touched there, in which was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor de Silveyra</hi> and other Gentlemen.

                     <p n="2">2. With him went five Ships with a great number of Men, and great part of them of Note.

D. <hi>George de Meneses</hi> set out with two Gallies and five small Vessels to seek the Pyrate <hi>Canatale,</hi> whom he found not; but discovering many Vessels in the River <hi>Carapatan</hi> he made to them, and came up himself with a Gally in which 180 <hi>Mores</hi> fought so desperately, that none being left alive but a Father and Son, the former killed the latter, and stabbing himself leap'd over-board.</p>

about them. D. <hi>Paul</hi> in his return took two Ships of the Enemy, though forsaken by some of his own Vessels, and those that left him had afterwards the Impudence to boast of the Victory. The Viceroy receiv'd D. <hi>Paul</hi> with much Honour; and one of those that had forsaken him coming to kiss (as was the Custom) the Viceroy's Cloak, he said to him, <hi>Keep off, go kiss your Mother's hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In <hi>November</hi> the Viceroy set out of <hi>Goa</hi> with above One hundred and thirty Sail, some of them were Tenders, and some Merchants: In the fighting Ships were Three thousand <hi>Portugueses</hi> besides <hi>Indians.</hi> He entred the River of <hi>Onor,</hi> and landed Two thousand three hundred Men, not without opposition. The place seem'd impregnable both by Art and Nature, yet our Men with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty beginning to ascend the Hill, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Bullets that fell from above, soon discovered the People flying out of the City, and the Queen of <hi>Guarcopa</hi> retiring to the Inland, as despairing the Fort could hold out, though Garrison'd with Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred resolute Men, and well stored with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery and Ammunition.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The City which was rich and beautiful was first Plundered, and then reduced to Ashes. Our Forces sat down before the Fort, and batter'd it without intermission four days, without the least molestation from a Body of the Natives who came to hinder their Progress: Which the Besieged perceiving, surrendred upon condition to march away

without Arms. The Booty was small, the most considerable part of it Cannon and Ammunition. The next day being St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharines,</hi> a place was cleansed to say Mass in. The Command of it was given to <hi>George de Moura</hi> with Four hundred Men, half of them <hi>Portugueses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Here the Ingenier <hi>Simon de Ruan</hi> fought alone with thirty of the Enemy till he fell as was thought dead, but as they put him into a Shroud a small motion was perceived, and soon after, to the admiration of all Men, he recovered. In this Action we lost twenty Men. Next the Viceroy passed to <hi>Bracalor,</hi> which is much like the other in strength and situation. The Landing was somewhat more difficult, being obstructed by 11000 Men, but at length Two hundred of them being killed (with the loss of nine on our side) our Men possessed themselves of a Work which much dismay'd the Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Those in the Fort, before the Viceroy could besiege, abandon'd it. Soon after the Kings of <hi>Tolar</hi> and <hi>Cambolim</hi> attack the Fort on a very dark Night, but found <hi>Peter Lopez Rabelo</hi> who commanded it with Two hundred Men so ready to receive them, that they lost Three hundred, killing only five of his, and despairing of any Success, concluded a Peace with the imposition of a greater Tribute than they paid before. The Viceroy had an interview with those two Princes and the Queen of <hi>Cambolim,</hi> and they parted very good Friends. Above a Month was spent in building a new Fort in a convenient place,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54711:146"/>
which was the mid-way between the City and the Mouth of the River. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it was given to <hi>Antony Botello,</hi> who spilt the first Blood in this Action.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Viceroy was in great care, that he received no answer from <hi>Miran.</hi> But there is no security in humane Policies. <hi>Miran</hi> thought to tie the <hi>Mogol</hi> to his Interest, by marrying his Brother to the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Sister. But scarce did the Brother, assisted by his Father-in-law the <hi>Mogol,</hi> see <hi>Miran</hi> march towards <hi>Cambaya,</hi> when he enters his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with a great Power; and <hi>Miran</hi> having notice hereof, was forced to stay to secure a certainty of his own, rather than to go to a doubtful Purchase. The Viceroy was much concern'd at this News, and having no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Imployment for so great a Fleet, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it into several Squadrons, and sent them upon different Expeditions. D. <hi>Peter de Casto</hi> had one to secure the Ships trading to <hi>Goa; Ferdinand Tellez,</hi> who not not long before had taken some Ships of the Enemy, went with another to the North. Of his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron were <hi>Ruy Diaz Cabral,</hi> and D. <hi>Henry de Meneses,</hi> who being separated from him, met fifty Sail of <hi>Malabars,</hi> and rashly fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. <hi>Ruy Deaz</hi> and seventy Men they both commanded were all killed; D. <hi>Henry</hi> from among the dead was carried into slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and after ransom'd. D. <hi>Emanuel Pereyra</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Silva Barreto</hi> came too late to prevent this Misfortune, but not to put the Enemy to flight after receiving and doing much harm.</p>

7. The Viceroy resented this loss not so much for its greatness, as because it was the first time Fortune had frowned on him. He went to <hi>Mangalor,</hi> twelve Leagues to the Southward, to appease some Disturbance that lessened the King's Revenue, and was prejudicial to Trade. This proceeded from the Enmity between the King of <hi>Bangu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Viceroy being better received at <hi>Mangalor</hi> than he expected, had a meeting with those two Princes, and agreed their Differences. In his return to <hi>Goa,</hi> he left with <hi>Antony Botello</hi> Commander of <hi>Braçalor</hi> for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Place, six hundred fresh Men; and <hi>Antony Cabrall</hi> at Sea with three Vessels well provided. At <hi>Onor</hi> he added to <hi>George de Moura</hi> Five hundred Men, and left on that Sea <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Rocque de Miranda,</hi> Brothers, with six Ships, who with Fire and Sword destroyed some Towns and Ships, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they rebelled as soon as the Viceroy had turned his back.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. At the end of this Year arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> five Ships from <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Queen of <hi>Guarcopa</hi> who was fled to the Mountain, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for fear than good Will, came now to an Accommodation.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. In those Seas were left D. <hi>Iames de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> with Forty two Sail; <hi>Luis de Melo de Silva</hi> with fifteen; <hi>Vincent de Salda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Zamori</hi> thought to put a stop to the Ruine of his Country by offering Proposals of Peace, but no Ear was given to them.

The King of <hi>Tidore</hi> received those that would stay with him, the rest dispersed into several Countries.

The chief Commanders of this multitude were, <hi>Norican</hi> called <hi>Hener Maluco,</hi> of such quality, that he never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with his Prince but in the Field; <hi>Rumercan</hi> and <hi>Cogercan,</hi> who for their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54711:150"/>
had distant Quarters on the edge of the Water. The Army encamped in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it looked rather like a regular City than a Camp. Their order of Battle was thus: <hi>Hidalcan</hi> at <hi>Ponda</hi> with 4000 Horse, 6000 Musqueteers, 300 Elephants, 220 Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; <hi>Cogercan, Rumercan,</hi> and <hi>Mortazacan</hi> near the Mouth of the Channel <hi>Ganja</hi> with 3000 Horse, 130 Elephants; and nine Cannons. <hi>Norican</hi> opposite to the Island of <hi>Iohn Lopez</hi> with 7000 Horse, 180 Elephants, and eight great Cannons. <hi>Camilcan</hi> and <hi>Delirracan</hi> facing the Pass of <hi>Benastarim</hi> with 9000 Horse, 200 Elephants, and 32 batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pieces. <hi>Solyman Aga</hi> on a height above <hi>Benastarim</hi> with 1500 Horse, and two Field Pieces. <hi>Anjozcan</hi> opposite to the Island of <hi>Iohn Bang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The rest of the Army covered the Mountains capable to strike a Terror into the boldest Spirits.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Viceroy viewed all the Posts, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his Person to the greatest danger. The ranging of the Enemies Army caused him to alter his first method, being now reinforced with some men come from several Parts, he posted his men thus: The dry Pass which he had designed for himself, he committed to D. <hi>Peter de Almeyda,</hi> and D. <hi>George Deça</hi> with 120 men, and went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54711:150"/>
to that of <hi>Benastarim,</hi> where <hi>Ferdinand de Sousa de Castellobranco</hi> was with the like number, taking to himself the Command of one of the lesser Posts there, rather than remove that Officer. D. <hi>Michael de Castro</hi> not far from <hi>Madre de Dios</hi> with 150; <hi>Iames Barradas</hi> on the point of the dry Pass with 60; D. <hi>Peter de Castro</hi> towards <hi>Benastarim</hi> with 120 maintained at his own Charge; <hi>Iames de Azambuja</hi> hard-by with 50; <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Pereyra</hi> a little farther with 20; <hi>Vincent Diaz Villalobos</hi> at <hi>Sapal</hi> with 60; next <hi>Gaspar Fernandez</hi> with 50; then D. <hi>Luis de Almey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> D. <hi>Ferdinand Monroy,</hi> and D. <hi>Martin de Castellobranco</hi> with each 60; <hi>Francis Marquez Botello</hi> with 50; <hi>Alvaro Mendoça</hi> between the Viceroy and Pass of <hi>Mercantor</hi> with 10; a little farther <hi>Simon de Mendoça</hi> with 120; <hi>Emanuel Rolim</hi> at St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Pass with 100; In the Pass of <hi>Marque</hi> the City placed 80; <hi>Iohn de Sousa</hi> with his 50 Horse went from <hi>Agacaim</hi> to the Bar, to receive and execute his Orders; <hi>Baltasar Lobo de Sousa</hi> at <hi>Pard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="8">8. Several Vessels with small Guns were to run along the River to relieve all these Posts. Thus the number of the Viceroy's Men was not above 1600, and he had but 30 Cannons in all those Posts. This was the force we had to oppose that great Power, the like was at <hi>Chaul.</hi>

9. For <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> set down before it at the same time, as <hi>Hidalcan</hi> did before <hi>Goa.</hi> They two being suspitious of each other, kept time in their Preparations, Setting out and Marches. But that we may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Actions by mixing them, we will first relate those at <hi>Goa,</hi> and then proceed to <hi>Chaul.</hi> The Cannon began to play, the flashes whereof enlightned the Night and the smoak darkned the day. The Enemy spent their first Fury on the Fort and Works of <hi>Benastarim,</hi> and did great harm, but could not perceive it; for whatever they ruined by day was repaired by night. They pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in showers of Bullets, for only in <hi>Alvaro de Mendoça</hi> his Post 600 were found, some of them of two Spans diameter; we could not answer with the like number, but could see we did great execution. And our Vessels sailing nimbly about, plied their small Guns with good effect. <hi>Ferdinand de Sousa de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellobranco</hi> one night by the help of a great number of Torches that went before spied an Officer of the Enemies crosing, a height opposite to him with young Women a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before, <hi>Sousa</hi> desirous to untune their harmony, caused a Cannon to be so luckily levelled at them, that the Officer, some of those that lighted, and two couple of the young Women were seen to fly into the Air.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. This was the time for the return-Ships to sail for <hi>Portugal,</hi> and every Body advised the Viceroy to stop them, because they would carry 400 Men that might be a great help in the present distress. But the Viceroy am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54711:151"/>
of making his Glory the greater, by conquering the greater difficulties, answer'd, <hi>There was want of them in</hi> Portugal, <hi>and he trusted those that remained were sufficient for the work he had in hand.</hi> So the Ships set sail.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Hitherto the <hi>Portugueses</hi> did much more harm than they received, having killed many of the Enemy, and among them some of Note, and lost no number nor any person considerable, only some were dangerously wounded. D. <hi>Francis de Sylva</hi> being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Cannon Ball so that his Guts hung out, continued encouraging his Men holding them up with his hand. <hi>Peter Homem de Silva</hi> losing much Blood at three Musket Shots he had received, and being perswaded to go off, said, It could be no matter of moment since he felt it not. Our Vessels did good Service; and the Enemies were not idle, carrying their men from one place to another. Our men had the boldness often to land and attack the Enemy in their Posts, and still brought away Prisoners, the heads of those they killed, Colours and Arms. D. <hi>George de Meneses Barroche</hi> in his Vessels, and D. <hi>Peter de Castro</hi> by Land with 200 <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> made such a slaughter, that the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy to animate the City, and show them what was done abroad, sent them two Carts loaded with Heads. <hi>Gaspar Diaz</hi> and his Brother <hi>Lancelot</hi> running up the Country one night a League and half with 80 men, burnt two Villages and many Farm Houses, and brought away many Prisoners, heads of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

12 Another time these two Brothers with 130 men, attack the Quarters of <hi>Cogergan</hi> and <hi>Rumergan,</hi> and making a great havock, destroyed all they had provided in order to pass over into the Island of <hi>Iohn Lopez.</hi> In this Action <hi>Francis de Cunna Coutino,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Viceroy, going alone before the rest, came so close up to 500 <hi>Mores,</hi> that he threw two Granadoes among them, which did some execution, and retired without hurt. The Enemy admired the smallness of our number, and greatness of our Actions; but was more surprized when he heard, that in the heat of all this fury, the Viceroy had order'd D. <hi>Iames de Meneses</hi> who came from the Coast of <hi>Malabar</hi> with his Squadron, to return thither; and D. <hi>Ferdinand de Vascon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celos</hi> to go with four Gallies and two small Vessels to destroy the City <hi>Dabul,</hi> to show <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> whose it was, how little account he made of all his Power. D. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> burnt there two great Ships of <hi>Meca,</hi> and many small Vessels; then landing fired some Villages, and had done the same to the City, had not his own Captains opposed it.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. He returned to <hi>Goa,</hi> and attacking the Quarters of <hi>Angoscan,</hi> a principal Man among the Enemy, three Miles distant from the Viceroy, entred them with great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But his Men with the success falling into Disorder, the Enemy rallied and fell upon them, killing some, the rest fled leaving their Captain, who, weakned with loss of Blood, and tired with the weight of his Arms, could not get into a Boat, but fought

in the Water till he fell down dead. His Ensign <hi>Augustin Fernandez</hi> died honourably with his Colours in the left hand, which he bravely defended with the right. Forty were killed, their Heads with the Colours were carried to <hi>Hidalcan.</hi> The Viceroy immediately sent <hi>Barroche</hi> with 100 Men more to burn D. <hi>Ferdinand's</hi> Vessel taken by the Enemy, which he performed, bringing away the Cannon that was left in it by the Enemy, believing no Body durst come where it lay.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. AT this time <hi>Zamori</hi> made Proposals of Peace to the Viceroy, either to amuse him while he went upon other designs pursuant to the Articles of the League, or else hoping to gain some advantage in that pressing Conjuncture. The Viceroy gave him to understand he would not yield the least point for fear, and continued firm in this resolution, notwithstanding <hi>Hidalcan</hi> had prevailed with the Queen of <hi>Guarcopa</hi> to declare War at <hi>Onor:</hi> That Prince was astonished to see him send relief thither, when he thought there was not force to supply <hi>Goa.</hi> The Viceroy at this time also
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:54711:153"/>
relieved <hi>Marramaque</hi> at the <hi>Malucos,</hi> and <hi>Francis Barreto</hi> at <hi>Mocambique.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The grand design of <hi>Hidalcan</hi> was to get over into the Island, in order to it his General <hi>Norican</hi> began to lay a Bridge over the River with a vast number of Workmen. The Viceroy falling upon them made a great havock. There was a Report that <hi>Hidalcan</hi> designed to pass over to the Island in Person, and carnestly desired a fine Horse the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy had, for which he had before offered a great Sum of Mony. The Viceroy sent it him for a present, assuring nothing should be more pleasing than to see him come over to <hi>Goa. Hidalcan</hi> accepted of the Horse, and caused him to lie upon silk Quilts under Canopies of Cloath of Gold, to be covered with embroidered Dammask, and his Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings to be adorned with massy Gold, and his Provender was mixed with Preserves and other Dainties. The Horse enjoyed it not long, being killed by a Cannon-Ball. At this time such a violent Storm of Rain fell, that most Posts were abandoned; the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy desired to take a Standard that was left in one; a French Gunner with only one Man went over in a Boat to fetch it, and were both killed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It was now the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and the Siege had lasted two Months, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abating any thing of the Fury. Many of our Buildings were ruined by the Enemies Cannon, many of them killed by ours. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony Cabral</hi> run up the River <hi>Chapora</hi> with four Vessels, and landing fifty Men, burnt four
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54711:153"/>
Villages, and above fifty Sail, bringing away some Booty. D. <hi>Paul de Lima</hi> with forty Men did as much at <hi>Rachol.</hi> The Viceroy laying hold of a Rope at the Pass of <hi>Bena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starim</hi> to draw a Cannon, others refusing for fear of the many Bullets that flew, one hit him upon the Arm, and only pierced the sleeve without doing him any harm. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being in the Church of <hi>Santiago,</hi> the Roof of it was beat down and hung over his head, <hi>Emanuel de Sousa Coutinno</hi> stepped up to save him, by receiving the Blow, but he acknowledging the Kindness reproved the Action.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Viceroy used all possible means to have Intelligence from the Enemies Camp. He bribed some Renagado <hi>Portugueses</hi> that served there, but what is more, he corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hidalcan</hi>'s most beloved Wife, and by her means knew the King's secret Thoughts, which he could not conceal from her.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> now began to consider the damage done by so few Men to so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an Army, that now the <hi>Portugueses</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in strength by the arrival of several Squadrons that had been abroad, among which <hi>Iames de Meneses</hi> returned victorious from <hi>Achem,</hi> and <hi>Luis de Melo de Silva</hi> from <hi>Malabar.</hi> He desired Peace, but was loath to propose it. The Viceroy who knew his Thoughts ordered it so, that a Treaty was in a manner set on foot, so that no body could discern who was the Author of it. Yet at length <hi>Hidalcan</hi> stooped to make the first Proposals. But still the Siege was carried
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54711:154"/>
on, and <hi>April</hi> was began. Seven hundred <hi>Mores</hi> attack a Pass, Two hundred <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> at first opposed them, but seeing they were relieved, fled in such Disorder, that neither their Officers nor the Viceroy could rally them. Their two Captains were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Action of D. <hi>Iames de Meneses</hi> relating to <hi>Zamori,</hi> shall be referred to the Chapter of <hi>Chaul;</hi> that of <hi>Luis de Melo</hi> is fit for this place. He set out with Fourteen Sail in search of the Fleet of <hi>Achem,</hi> and met it near that Port; it consisted of Sixty Sail well Manned and provided with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, commanded by the King's Son and Heir. <hi>Melo</hi> and he met first, and our first Shot killed him and several of his Men. The Fleets met and fought resolutely on both sides; but the Enemy was utterly destroyed, three Galleys and six small Vessels taken, all the rest sunk but one. We lost not one Man; of the Enemy Twelve hundred were killed, and Three hundred made Prisoners. <hi>Melo</hi> returned to <hi>Malaca</hi> with the Vessels and Cannon he had taken, and thence sent some Men to the <hi>Malucos,</hi> and came to <hi>Goa</hi> with Fifteen hundred, and <hi>Vasco Lorenço de Barbuda</hi> whom he found at <hi>Cochim</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bring some Relief.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. These Commanders being come to <hi>Goa,</hi> took their Posts. <hi>Meneses</hi> executing his Office of Admiral was carried off wounded, at such time as Three thousand of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my began to enter the Island of <hi>Iohn Lopez. Antony Fernandez de Cale</hi> with One hundred
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:54711:154"/>
and twenty Men met and put them to flight, killing a great number.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. During this time, before Winter came on, several Attempts were made upon the Enemies Quarters and Inroads into the Country always with success. One Night One hundred and fifty Men beat the Enemy out of a Post at <hi>Benastarim</hi> and after another at <hi>Angoscan,</hi> ruining all the Works they had raised. They did the same at <hi>Xatiar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ao, Chatigan</hi> and <hi>Rachol,</hi> burning Villages demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the Works, and killing very many.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> though almost in despair, began to plant Gardens, and other Works, as if he designed either to take <hi>Goa,</hi> or live in that Field: He resolved to enter the Island with Nine thousand Men at the Pass of <hi>Mercantor,</hi> which was not guarded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the River is wide there. Our Men hearing a Drum, which never beats but when that Prince marches in Person, run thither, and saw him on the other side en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging his. Advice being brought to the Viceroy, he sent several Parties and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself. In spight of all opposition Five thousand Men got over under the Command of the Turk <hi>Soliman Aga,</hi> Captain of the Guard. Fresh Men still flocked to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, till he was Two thousand strong. All the Posts which extended two Leagues were in Action.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. All the Thirteenth of <hi>April,</hi> from Morning till Night the attack lasted, and from the next Morning till the Day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> all the while looking on,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54711:155"/>
cursing his Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and throwing his Turbant on the Ground. Of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> scarce Twenty were killed, of the Enemy almost Four thousand, and among them <hi>Soliman Aga; Hidalcan</hi>'s Brother-in-Law, and other Persons of Note, some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and Plunder were taken.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>F. George de St. Lucia</hi> a Dominican and Bishop of <hi>Malaca,</hi> foretold this Success to the Viceroy. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> raged, and in publick vowed not to stir thence, but in private wished a conclusion, but used not the means. He proposed a Pence, and despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of concluding it upon the Terms he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; one of them was the Surrender of <hi>Goa,</hi> as if the <hi>Portugueses</hi> had all this while tought for any thing but to keep it. Our Viceroy treated with <hi>Norican</hi> about killing the King, offering him either the Crown of great Power in the Government. <hi>Norican</hi> admits the Proposals, and as the blow was ready to be given, the Treachery was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, he secured, and so the other Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators desisted. This was about the end of <hi>April.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. The treaty of Peace failing, the Siege went on, but not with the vigour as before. The Enemies Cannon ruined our Buildings, ours their Men, and Parties of ours burnt all the Country. <hi>Sebastian de Resende</hi> with only four Men attempts a Post of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and killing some, would have brought away one alive, but he making much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, <hi>Resende</hi> was forc'd to kill him. <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celot Picardo</hi> and others with forty Men did
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54711:155"/>
great execution. <hi>Antony Fernandez</hi> with thirty falling upon <hi>Rumercan</hi>'s Quarters where there was eighty, killed eighteen, and retired without any damage received. The Viceroy leaning one day on a Page, a Ball took away his Prop. Being at rest one night he heared a great Noise, and instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came abroad, and a Bullet hitting him on the Breast, fell at his feet without doing the least hurt.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> to divide and weaken the Viceroy, again perswades the Queen of <hi>Guarcopa</hi> to attack <hi>Onor.</hi> She consents, and joining Three thousand Men of her own to Two thousand sent by him, besieges the Fort. It was the middle of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the dead of Winter there, when the Viceroy received Advice thereof. He sent instantly <hi>Antony Fernandez de Chale</hi> with two Galleys and eight Vessels, and what Men they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: <hi>Antony</hi> in five days enters that Port, and joining with <hi>George de Moura</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, falls upon the Enemy and puts them to flight, killing many, and bringing all the Cannon into the Fort. About this time <hi>Zamori</hi> broke out in another place, but that requires a particular Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Viceroy underhand endeavoured to stir up other Princes to invade <hi>Hidalcan</hi>'s Dominions, by that means to draw him from the Siege. Both endeavoured to hide their desire of Peace. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> made appear as if he resolved not to stir, and the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy as if he valued not his lying there. In fine, the whole Winter was spent, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

the end of <hi>August,</hi> when Summer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and the Enemy might better keep the Field, the number of Tents was seen to decrease, then the Men, and lastly the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non vanished, without coming to any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, after a Siege of ten Months, wherein the Enemy lost Twelve thousand Men, Three hundred Elephants, Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horses, and Six thousand Oxen, part by the Sword, and part by the Weather. Thus <hi>Goa</hi> was suddenly delivered. Let us now see what was done at <hi>Chaul</hi> by <hi>Nizama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luco,</hi> the second Chief of this League.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>NIzamaluco</hi> keeping time with <hi>Hidal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> set down before <hi>Chaul</hi> at the same time the other did before <hi>Goa.</hi> His General <hi>Faretecan</hi> invested the place with Eight thousand Horse and Twenty thousand Foot; and on the last day of <hi>November</hi> the Enemy broke ground with a horrid noise of warlike Instruments.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Luis Ferreyra de Andrade,</hi> a Man well deserving such a Post, commanded at <hi>Chaul,</hi> and laboured long under great Wants of all Necessaries, supplying those Defects with his and his Men's Valour, till D. <hi>Francis Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carennas</hi> came to his assistance with Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54711:159"/>
Men in four Gallies and five small Vessels, and some Barques loaded with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Provision.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Fort of <hi>Chaul</hi> is seated in about 18 <hi>deg.</hi> of <hi>N. Lat.</hi> on the Bank of a River, not twelve Miles from the Mouth of it. There were in it but fifty Horse, and a small number of Foot. The first bold Action done here was by <hi>Sebastian Gonzales de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velos,</hi> who passing over a small Creek alone, challenged any of that number of Enemies, and none durst answer him. Then <hi>Alexander de Sousa</hi> went over with fifteen Horse to discover the Enemy, and stayed so long till 5000 came upon them, among which they killed a considerable Officer. At this time <hi>Faretecan</hi> was marching down the Mountain Gate with 8000 Horse, a great number of Foot, and twenty Elephants; he sat down before <hi>Chaul,</hi> and began to plant Cannon.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Faretecan</hi> desiring to do somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Prince came, set the Castles upon the Elephants and tied Syths to their Trunks to give an Assault. All turned to his Loss, for he was repulsed by Sea and Land, and forced to retire as far as the Church <hi>de la Madre de Dios,</hi> or Mother of God, where his men rallied.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Here it is said some Miracles were seen, as that a Bullet hitting a Souldier on the hand, rebounded from it as a Ball struck with a Racket. The fight lasted three hours with great slaughter of <hi>Mores,</hi> and loss of three <hi>Portugueses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">

6. The Enemy having lodged themselves about the Town, it was thought convenient to demolish all the Buildings that were any thing distant. Nothing remarkable happened till after <hi>December.</hi> Some <hi>Mores</hi> being then gathering Fruit in an Orchard, <hi>Nunno Vello</hi> went out with five Soldiers, and killing one of them, others came on still till they made up Six thousand, and ours encreased to two hundred; who behaved themselves with such bravery, they drove that multitude, killing One hundred and eighty, with the loss of two.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> came before <hi>Chaul</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> with the rest of his Army, which now together consisted of 34000 Horse, 100000 Foot, 16000 Pioniers, 4000 Smiths, Masons and other Trades of sundry Nations, as <hi>Turks, Coraçons, Persians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> 360 Elephants, an infinite number of Bufalos and Oxen, and forty pieces of Cannon most of a prodigious bigness, some carrying Balls of 100, some 200, and even 300 weight, and had Names answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as <hi>Cruel Butcher, Devourer, Orlando Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioso,</hi> and the like. Thus 150000 Men so well provided, planted themselves before a Town that had only a single Wall, a Fort like a House, and a handful of Men. <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecan</hi> lodged himself in the Vicar's House near the Chapel of the Mother of God with 7000 Horse and twenty Elephants. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galascan</hi> in the House of <hi>Iames Lopez</hi> with 6000 Horse; <hi>Ximirican</hi> between that and upper <hi>Chaul</hi> with 2000, so the City was
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54711:160"/>
beset from Sea to Sea. At the same time 4000 Horse ravaged the Lands of <hi>Baçaim.</hi> The King took his Quarters at the farther end of the Town; thus the space of two Leagues was covered with Tents.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The <hi>Portugues<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>

Soon after the News of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Chaul</hi> being spread abroad, many Gentlemen flocked thither with supplies of Men, so that in a little time there were 2000 Men in the Town. It was resolved to maintain the Monastery of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and it was committed to <hi>Alexander de Sousa.</hi> Some Houses were also judged fit to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. <hi>Nuno Alvarez Pereyra</hi> with forty Men had those on the Shore, those between the <hi>Misericordia</hi> and St. <hi>Dominick D. Gonçalo de Meneses,</hi> others near <hi>Nunno Vello Pereyra,</hi> and so in other Places.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Mean while it was generally voted at <hi>Goa,</hi> that <hi>Chaul</hi> ought to be abandoned, but the Viceroy resolutely opposed, and was seconded by <hi>Ferdinand de Sousa de Castello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branco.</hi> He immediately sent thither D. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arte de Lima</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand Tellez de Meneses</hi> with their two Gallies, and some Men in four other Vessels. Let us see what was done at <hi>Chaul</hi> whilst they are under Sail.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Nimirican</hi> had promised <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> he would be the first man should enter the Town, in order thereto he vigorously at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks the Posts of <hi>Henry de Betancor</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand Pereyra de Miranda.</hi> They bravely
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54711:161"/>
made good their Ground, and being reliev'd repulsed him, killing Three hundred of his Men, seven of ours were lost. The Enemy turn their Cannon upon the Monastery of St. <hi>Francis</hi> where we had some Pieces, and both sides striving to burst or dismount the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Guns; the Gunners were so dextrous, that Bullets were seen to meet by the way. On the Eve of St. <hi>Sebastian</hi> a Party of ours sallied upon some Houses where the <hi>Mores</hi> had fortified themselves, and killed a great number without losing one Man.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> enraged at the last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse desired Revenge, and that same night attacks the Fort of St. <hi>Francis</hi> with Five thousand Men. The <hi>Mores</hi> thought to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize ours, but were soon undeceived by the Execution done among them. The attack lasted very furious the space of five hours. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> suspected the Enemy work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Wall, and could not see by reason of the darkness, but <hi>Christopher Curvo</hi> three several times put half his Body out of a Window, with a lighted Torch in one hand, and a Buckler in the other, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what was doing. The noise was very great, and those in the City fearing for those that were assaulted, sent them Relief though with great hazard. The Morning discovered the Fort stuck with Arrows, and under it above Three hundred <hi>Mores</hi> slain, without the loss of one <hi>Portugues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. Next day the Enemy repeated the Assault, and continued it five days with great resolution, with as great bravery were
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54711:161"/>
they received by the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who often fallying covered the Field with dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and took several Colours. However it was at last judged expedient to quit that Fort, and withdraw the Men into the City, lest the losing of it should prove more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial than the defending it could avail. Seventeen Men were killed in it. One of these being on a high place to give notice when the Enemy fired their Cannon, said to those that were below: <hi>If they should now fire</hi> Raspadillo (that was a Cannon eighteen Foot long so called) <hi>without doubt they would send me all in pieces to sup with Iesus Christ, to whom l commend my self, for the Gun points at me.</hi> Scarce had he spoke the words when he was torn in pieces by a Ball from that Cannon.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The <hi>Mores</hi> being possessed of the Fort and Monastery of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> fired a whole Street, but attempting to gain some Houses lost Four hundred Men. Three of them challenged a like number of ours, who thinking it a disparagement to answer them upon equal terms, only two went out, which were <hi>Gomez Freyre</hi> and <hi>Luis del Valle,</hi> who carried a great Hanger. The <hi>Mores</hi> refused the odds, and one of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew. <hi>Valle</hi> with the advantage of the Hanger overcame his Adversary, and then assisted <hi>Freyre</hi> to kill the other. So both sides might be said to be conquer'd, the <hi>Mores</hi> losing their Lives, and ours their Honour by taking the Advantage.</p>

14. <hi>Chaul</hi> being now streightned, <hi>Ruy Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çalez de Camara</hi> was sent to <hi>Goa</hi> for Relief; which he brought in two Galleys. At this time appeared here, and before <hi>Mangalor,</hi> the <hi>Malabar-</hi>Ships, sent by <hi>Zamori,</hi> pursuant to the Articles of the Consederacy. But our Method being to relate what each of the Confederates did separately, this shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to another Chapter. Let us see one of the bravest Actions that has been heard of, performed by <hi>Stephen Perestrelo,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the weak Fort of <hi>Caranja.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. It was said, above 5000 of <hi>Nizama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luco</hi>'s Horse marched into the Lands of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çaim.</hi> They resolved to attempt some of our Garrisons; and being beaten off at <hi>Aça<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> and <hi>Damam,</hi> went and sate down before <hi>Caranja,</hi> where <hi>Stephen Perestrelo</hi> was, with only Forty Men, <hi>Caranja</hi> is a small, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Work, between <hi>Chaul</hi> and <hi>Damam,</hi> on the Edge of the Water, and is, in some measure, an Island, being encompassed by small Brooks. As the Enemy sate down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, <hi>Emanuel de Melo</hi> came with Thirty Men. Being now Seventy strong, <hi>Perestrelo</hi> falls upon that great Number, with such Success, that after covering the little Island with dead Bodies, the rest fled, leaving their Cannon, and a considerable Quantity of Arms and Ammunition.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. But to return to <hi>Chaul:</hi> The <hi>Moors</hi> furiously batter'd it with Seventy Pieces of large Cannon, for the space of a Month; the least that was spent every Day being 160 Balls. They made great havock among

The Besieged worked incessantly to cover themselves; but the Enemy's Gunners were so expert, they mounted their Balls so, that they fell among those that thought they were within Shelter. <hi>Augustine Nunez</hi> found an Expedient to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this Danger, which, though thought difficult at first, was afterwards their only Security.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Our Commander seeing the Battery on the other side of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, thought fit to attack the Enemy's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters opposite to it. <hi>Alexander de Sousa</hi> and <hi>Augustine Nunez</hi> undertook it with One Hundred and Twenty Men, and, though vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously opposed, drove the Enemy thence; killing many, and firing the Works.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Iohn Alvarez Suarez,</hi> an Officer of the Revenue, hearing the Danger of <hi>Chaul,</hi> fitted out a Vessel at his own Charge, and came thither with some Soldiers; where he behaved himself beyond what was expected of one, whose Business seemed to be only the Pen, though now he converted it to the Sword.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Coming now at the time of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack of those Works, he was one of the first that mounted. <hi>Ferdinand Casqueiro</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Lance in his Hand; then changing it to a Whip, in a Rage threatned his Men, and upbraided them as Cowards.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Our Men were now so accustomed to Danger, nothing could terrifie them; and they seemed to court Death, as if she had not been busie enough about them. Some of our Soldiers being employed, levelling the Enemy's Works we had driven them from about St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and being more han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at the Sword than Spade, drew upon themselves a great Number of Enemies, whereof they killed above Two Hundred, not without Loss on our Side.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. D. <hi>Iohn de Lima, Francis de Sá,</hi> and D. <hi>Nunno Alvarez</hi> went out to discover some Mines it was thought the Enemy was carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on. They executed their Command, entring those Quarters, where they put all that were in them to the Sword. In these two Actions we lost Six Private Soldiers, and D. <hi>Luis de Gastellobranco,</hi> who having lost one Leg, offered the other; D. <hi>Iohn de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> who seeing a <hi>Moor</hi> miss several Shots he made at him, stood still till he was killed; performing his Promise made on his Brother D. <hi>Duarte</hi>'s Grave, that he would soon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; <hi>Anthony de Fonseca,</hi> he who hung by his Lance at <hi>Parnel,</hi> and laughed at the Enemy; <hi>Francis Barradas,</hi> and <hi>Ruy Pereyra de Sa,</hi> and Five other Gentlemen of note.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. After the King had made it appear he designed to continue the Siege all the Winter, and all Things were on both Sides disposed in order thereto, <hi>Faretecan</hi> made
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54711:165"/>
some Overtures of Peace, but without any visible Commission from his Prince, who caused him to be apprehended, not for act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein without Orders, for, doubtless, he had private Instructions; but upon suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he was corrupted. It was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> desired a Peace, after ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before a Town Seven Months, without any Success, but losing as many Thousand Men. Nor was it strange the <hi>Portugueses</hi> should wish it, having already lost above Four Hundred of their own, besides <hi>Indians.</hi> But the Hopes of Peace being extinguished by the Imprisonment of <hi>Faretecan, George Pereyra Coutinno</hi> went out with his Ships, and, without any considerable Loss, burnt Three that belonged to <hi>Nizamaluco.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. It was now the Beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> and the Attacks and Batteries were carried on with such Vigour, as if they then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. The first Attempt was upon D. <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Alvarez</hi> his House, which was lost through Carelesness. Yet after it was taken, some Gentlemen attempting to recover it, lost at least Twenty <hi>Portugueses,</hi> without doing any considerable Execution. Next, the Enemy possessed themselves of the Monastery of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> where great Slaughter was made. At D. <hi>Gonçalo de Meneses</hi> his House it was well fought, but to our great Loss. In all the other Quarters, the Cannon-Balls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="13">13. The Batteries never ceased from the End of <hi>May,</hi> till the End of <hi>Iune; Niza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maluco</hi>

resolving to make a Breach fit for his whole Army to try its Fortune. On the 28th the Elephants appeared loaded with Castles, and the Castles full of Men. A va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Moor,</hi> well mounted, walked leisurely before all our Works, within Musquet-shot, and never altered his Pace; notwithstanding above Five Hundred Shot was made at him, and his Horse wounded, he went off un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt. The whole Army expected the Sign to move, but it was not given because our Cannon killed an Officer of Note, which the King took as an ill Omen, and put off the Assault till next Day. Six of our Men ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing out of the Works, drew a great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Enemy within reach of our Shot which was so well bestowed, that One Hundred and Eighteen fell down dead, and above Five Hundred were wounded, with out doing us the least hurt.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The next Day about Noon the King gave the Signal to fall on; and the whole Body of Men and Elephants advanced with horrible Cries, and Noise of Warlike Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Agalascan</hi> attacked <hi>Iames Suarez de Albergaria, Iohn de Silva Barreto, Roderick Homen de Silva,</hi> and <hi>Laurence de Brito,</hi> in their Posts. <hi>Faretecan</hi> and <hi>Sujatecan</hi> fell on the Quarter of the <hi>Misericordia.

15. The Day was darken'd with Smoak, at Times lighted with Flames; the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Confusion was great on all Sides. Some of the Enemy's Colours were planted on our Works, but soon taken, or cast down, with those who had boldly set them up. The Elephants, made drunk by the <hi>Nayres,</hi> that they might be the more fierce, being burnt and wounded, ran madly about the Field. One much valued by the King, being fired in the Flames, ran into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and swam over the Bar, where one of our Vessels killed him with a Cannon-Shot. In fine, The Assault ended with the Day, the <hi>Portugueses</hi> remaining Masters of all their Works, after killing above Three Thousand of the Enemies; among which, one was the Son of <hi>Agalascan,</hi> and many more of Note.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. This Action cost us but a few private Soldiers, and Eight Gentlemen. D. <hi>Henry de Meneses</hi> being lame, having his Legs burnt, caused himself to be carried in a Chair. <hi>Laurence de Brito</hi> took a Colours. <hi>Gonçalo Rodriguez Caldera</hi> and <hi>Hierome Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="17">17. The <hi>Moors</hi> asked Leave to bury their Dead; which being granted, as they drew them off, they asked the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> What Woman it was that went before them in the Fight, and whether she was alive? One an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:54711:167"/>
                        <hi>Yes; for, doubtless, she was immortal.</hi> And they replied, <hi>Then certainly, it was the Lady</hi> Marian. So they call the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Many said they saw her at <hi>Lawrence de Brito</hi>'s Quarter, so bright, that she blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. And some who went to see her Image in the Churches, were converted, and staid in Town.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> was desirous to treat of Peace, but was not willing to shew it: Our Commander wished as much as he, and was as backward in making it appear. At length both Sides abated, and a Treaty was set on foot: <hi>Faretecan</hi> and <hi>Azafacan</hi> were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for <hi>Nizamaluco: Peter de Silva,</hi> and <hi>Meneses,</hi> and <hi>Anthony de Teyve,</hi> for our Commander in Chief; and D. <hi>Francis Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scarennas Baroche,</hi> for the Captain of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Substance of the Accommodation was a League Offensive and Defensive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> and King <hi>Sebastian.</hi> This Agreement was celebrated with great Joy, and sending of rich Presents on both Sides. All this might have been done, without so much Effusion of Blood. <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> raised his Camp, and returned home.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>ZAmori</hi> the third Chief of this League, who was to act by Sea as Sovereign thereof among those of <hi>India,</hi> performed his Part very coldly. After <hi>Goa</hi> and <hi>Chaul</hi> had been Besieged a Month, he instead of putting his Fleet to Sea, sent to treat of Peace with the Viceroy, either by this means to amuze him, or else to gain some Advantage upon his pressing Necessities. For few Princes follow the Dictates of Honour, when opposite to their Interest. This Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair being proposed in Council at <hi>Goa,</hi> it was unanimously agreed to accept of a Peace though upon hard terms. But the Viceroy who had resolved to loose all or nothing, said, <hi>He would make no Peace unless upon such Terms, as he might expect in the most flourishing Condition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Zamori</hi> seeing this Design fail, set out a Fleet about the end of <hi>February</hi> under the Command of <hi>Catiproca Marca.</hi> He soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before <hi>Chaul</hi> with twenty-one Sail, and a great number of Men, whereof above One thousand were Musqueteers, and passed by Night through all our Gallies and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons that filled the Port without opposition. The Entrance was defended against only
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54711:168"/>
two Paraos, whereof one got in, the other not. The <hi>Malabars</hi> with reason boasted of this Action, and <hi>Nizamaluco</hi>'s Men rejoyced at the Success.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> was much pleased at the arrival of the <hi>Malabars,</hi> posted the 1000 Musqueteers, and then perswaded the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to attack our Ships, which were under the Command of <hi>Leonel de Sousa.</hi> A great number of Calemutes, which are small Vessels that King made use of, were crammed full of Men to accompany the twenty-one <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labars,</hi> every one going as to a sure Victory. They set out with great eagerness, bearing down upon <hi>Lionel de Sousa,</hi> and fled with the same precipitation seeing him make at them. Yet for all their haste our Gallies did considerable execution among them. <hi>Nizamaluco,</hi> who from a height had been looking on, did all he could to perswade them to try their Fortune again, but to no purpose; for after twenty days they stole away by night out of that Harbour with the same good Fortune they came in.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Queen of <hi>Mangalor</hi> thinking to make some Advantage of these Confusions, and hearing: that <hi>Catiproca</hi> was near with his Fleet, represented to him how easily our Fort might be surprized, and offered to defray the Charge. He accepted the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, thinking to regain the Credit lost at <hi>Chaul.</hi> Unexpectedly he applies scaling Ladders, and some of his Men mounted Some Servants of D. <hi>Antony Pereyra,</hi> who Commanded there, awaking, and seeing the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:54711:168"/>
Enemy, threw out of a Window the first thing came to hand, which was a Chest of their Master's full of Silver, and with it beat down those that were upon the Ladder. <hi>Pereyra</hi> waking with the noise, threw down those that had mounted, the other fled carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Chest aboard the Ships. As they passed before <hi>Cananor,</hi> D. <hi>Iames</hi> with his Squadron fell upon and totally routed them. D. <hi>Iames</hi> follows them up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Tiracole,</hi> and not one Ship of them escaped, <hi>Cutiproca</hi> was killed, and his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Cutiale</hi> taken, as also D. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Chest recovered.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Zamori</hi> did not fulfil the Articles of the League by sending this Fleet, for every one had promised to undertake something in Person; till now D. <hi>Iames de Meneses</hi> had obstructed him, scouring that Sea, burning many Towns and Ships, and taking many which he carried to <hi>Goa.</hi> Towards the end of <hi>Iune,</hi> when D. <hi>Iames</hi> was gone, and <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalcau</hi> and <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> were about drawing off, <hi>Zamori</hi> fate down before the Fort of <hi>Cbale</hi> with 100000 Men, most of them Musqueteers. This place is but two Leagues from <hi>Calicut,</hi> that Prince's Court, and was then held by D. <hi>George de Castro.</hi> The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy planted forty Pieces of Brass Cannon, and girting the place round thought they had shut out all hopes of Relief. Some was sent from <hi>Cochim</hi> under the Conduct of D. <hi>Antony de Noronna,</hi> who could not put it into the Place, for the furious Batteries of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Cannon. <hi>Francis Pereyra de Sousa</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:54711:169"/>
from <hi>Cananor</hi> with extravagant Bravery, conquered the difficulty, but the Relief was small because the Vessels were so. As soon as the Viceroy had advice, he sent D. <hi>Iames de Meneses</hi> with eighteen Sail to carry Supplies to the Fort. He with great difficulty got to <hi>Chale</hi> about the end of <hi>September,</hi> when the Besieged were reduced to the last Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, there being at least Six hundred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the place, whereof not above Seventy that could bear Arms.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It seemed impracticable to attempt the putting in any Relief, for the mouth of the Harbour was very narrow, and all the Hills about it were planted with Cannon. But our Commander resolved to surmount all Difficulties: A great Vessel was filled with Provisions for two months, and fifty Soldiers put into it. <hi>Iames de Azambuja</hi> went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his Gally, and <hi>Antony Fernandez</hi> and D. <hi>Luis de Meneses</hi> cover'd it with their Vessels. They pierced with incredible Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage through Showrs of Bullets, and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand de Mendoca,</hi> Nephew to D. <hi>Iames,</hi> run in all the Supplies, whilst <hi>Francis de Sousa</hi> with his Men killed above Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Enemy, who endeavour'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct it. This done, they retired through the same Dangers with loss of forty Men. As they were cutting off a Soldier's Leg he asked whether the Succour was got in, and hearing it was, <hi>Then,</hi> said he, <hi>let me die in God's Name, for I cannot die more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</hi>

                     <p n="8">8.

These were comforts to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged, but no perfect Cure. The King of <hi>Ujantana,</hi> our Friend, supplied the Enemy with Arms. <hi>Sancho de Vasconcelos</hi> coming from <hi>Amboina</hi> to succor the Besieged to small effect, found a Galleon of his loaded with them in the Port; and a <hi>Portugues</hi> Ship at <hi>Banda</hi> in danger of falling into the hands of those People: For, seeing the decay of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The great Ship of <hi>Lionel de Brito</hi> came when there was no Fort there<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and was lost afterwards. Other Supplies, a great deal of Cannon, much Merchandise and Ammunition, and above 2000 Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd thither, perish'd all by lamentable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters. The Murderer of that innocent King was stabbed by the People of <hi>Iava,</hi> rather as Executioners of God's Justice, than Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Portugueses. Gonçalo Pereyra Marramaque,</hi> who consented to the Murder, died for meer Grief of so many Misfortunes, as he sailed for <hi>Amboina,</hi> and was cast into the Sea.</p>

The arrival of that Ship, with sufficient Supplies was a testimony of the Guilt. But both places being lost for want of Relief, they ought rather to have been Executed who did not relieve, than they that surrendred them.

                        <p>The Government of <hi>Francis Barreto</hi> in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomotapa,</hi> beginning in the Year 1569, in the Reign of King <hi>Sebastian.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. SInce, by reason of the Disagreement between <hi>Antony Moniz Barreto,</hi> and the Viceroy <hi>D. Antony de Norronna,</hi> and <hi>D. Leonis Pereyra,</hi> the Government of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca,</hi> one of the three into which that Dominion was divided, took no effect, let us go over to the other of <hi>Monomotapa,</hi> which was erected, though it lasted not long. When <hi>Francis Barreto</hi> returned to <hi>Portugal,</hi> after having been Governor of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> he was appointed Admiral of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: He exercised this Command at the time of that memorable Action of <hi>Pennon,</hi> by which he gain'd great Reputation. Being come back to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and the King resolv'd to make that Division of Governments, he named him for <hi>Monomotapa,</hi> with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Title of Conqueror of the Mines there. The great inducement to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, was the Information and Experience of the vast quantity of Gold found, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:54711:181"/>
at <hi>Manica</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Bocaranga.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Doubt was, whether it were proper for a Man who had been Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of all our Dominions in <hi>Asia,</hi> and this Southern Part of <hi>Africk</hi> to accept of this, which was the least considerable part into which it was divided, but the danger and difficulty of it made amends for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Three things prevailed with him to accept of it; the first, that he was poor; the second, that he thought it no lessening to take a less Command in Obedience to his Prince; and the third, that it was allowed him, in case the Viceroy and he met at Sea, their Power should be equal in all respects.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In fine, <hi>Francis Barreto</hi> submitted to his King's Command, and the Desires of his Country, and sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> 1569, as Captain, General, and Governor of that Conquest, with three Ships. He carried One thousand Landmen, and might have had more, if the Vessels could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them; for the noise of Gold drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the thoughts of danger, and nothing raises Men like the thoughts of gain. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these were many Gentlemen and old <hi>African</hi> Soldiers. Being come to <hi>Moçambique,</hi> he went to subdue the King of <hi>Pate,</hi> who was revolted from us.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Barreto</hi> had Orders not to undertake any thing without the Advice of <hi>Francis de Monclaros,</hi> a Jesuit, who was the cause of the ill Success of this Enterprize. So great an Error it is to subject a Soldier to a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Man: So indiscreet a Presumption
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:54711:182"/>
for a religious Man to undertake what does not belong to his profession: There were two ways to the Mines, the one through <hi>Monomotapa,</hi> the other by <hi>Zofala, Barreto</hi> was for this, <hi>Monclaros</hi> for the other, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed it, notwithstanding, all the Votes to the contrary, and so the first step they gave was to their ruin.</p>

They speak of things past by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, having no knowledge of Letters. They give Ear to the Doctrine of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; the lame and blind they call the King's Poor, because maintained by him with great Charity; and if they travel, the Towns they go through are obliged to maintain and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them guides from one place to another.

On the last Day he orders the Nobleman he has the least affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for to be killed; this is in the nature of a Sacrifice he offers to his <hi>Muzimos,</hi> or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors; this done, the Drums cease, and every Man goes home.

                     <p n="1">1. SUch was the Country whether the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour <hi>Francis Barreto</hi> was now going, he set out from <hi>Mozambique</hi> with more Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels than he brought and more Men, Tools, Camels, Horses, and other necessaries for War, and for the work of the Mines; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sailed Ninety Leagues, he went up the River <hi>Cuama,</hi> called by our first discoverer <hi>De las buenas sennales,</hi> he came to <hi>Sena,</hi> or Fort St. <hi>Marcalis,</hi> as <hi>F. Monclaros</hi> desired, and repaired the Town <hi>Inaparapala,</hi> which is near to another of the <hi>Moors,</hi> they being always professed Enemies to the Christians, began to undermine our designs, as they had formerly done in <hi>India;</hi> they attempted to poyson our Army, and some Men and Horses began to Die, and the cause being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by one of them, they were all put to the Sword, and the Chief of them torn to pieces at the mouths of Guns, except one (called <hi>Mahomet Iame)</hi> who affirming the Blessed Virgin had appeared to him, and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54711:186"/>
commanded him to become a Christian, by the name of <hi>Lawrence;</hi> he had the favour to be strangled. The discoverer was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Barreto</hi> sent an Embassador to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who for the more honour admitted him to his Presence, not as other Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors were treated at this Court, which is to go without Arms, bare-footed, on their Knees, and when they come near, prostrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the ground. The effect of the Embassy was to desire leave to punish the King of <hi>Mongas</hi> who was in Rebellion, and go on to the Mines of <hi>Butua</hi> and <hi>Manchica:</hi> The first part was a piece of flattery, to obtain the second, because the Lands of <hi>Mongas</hi> lie between <hi>Sena</hi> and the Mines, and it was necessary to make way with the Sword. He consented to all, and offered One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Men; <hi>Bareto</hi> accepted not of them, because he would give him no share in the Honour gained in that War, and thinking thereby to oblige him the more.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He marched ten Days with Twenty three Horse, and Five hundred and sixty Musquetiers, (enduring much by Hunger and Thirst) for the most part along the River <hi>Zambeze,</hi> over whose most rapid stream hang pieces of the high Mountain <hi>Lupata,</hi> ninety Leagues distant from the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Sea. At the end of this tedious march, they began to discover part of the Enemy, and soon after saw the-Mountains and Valleys covered with Arm'd Men, the Governor was not daunted, seeing it was
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54711:186"/>
hard to discover the end of that multitude, he drew up, and gave the Van to <hi>Vasco Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Homem,</hi> he had the Rear, and between the bodies was the baggage, and some Field pieces; when they came to charge, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Canon to the Front and Flanks, the two unequal bodies advanced, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the sorm of a half-Moon; before they engaged, an old Woman advanced and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered some Powder towards our Men, having perswaded the Enemy (she was a notorious Witch) that that Powder alone would gain the Victory.</p>

as both the former; the <hi>Cafres</hi> were again routed, and beg'd peace in the King's name. The Governor received the Messenger with such Majesty, that he was astonished, and could not speak; being come to himself, and having delivered his Message, <hi>Barreto</hi> promised he would see the King, and mat ters should be adjusted.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The next Day our Men marched and incamped in a convenient place where Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors came from the King to treat of Peace.

He making his advantage of their ignorance, told them, he had many of those Beasts that only fed upon Man's flesh, and having devoured all that were killed, that Beast came from the rest to desire he would not make Peace, because they would come to want Food; they astonished hereat, earnestly intreated him, he would desire the Camels to be satisfied with good Beef, and they would instantly bring them a great number. He granted their request, and marched on. He was in great distress for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision when news came his presence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at <hi>Mocambique.</hi> He gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Forces to <hi>Vasco,</hi> and departed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="7">7. Our Governor being come to the Fort of <hi>Sena, F.

                     <p n="1">1. THE Governor <hi>Francis Barreto</hi> being dead, an order of the King's found among his Papers was opened, by which <hi>Vasco Fernândez Homem</hi> his Major, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to succeed him. The Perswasions of <hi>F. Monclaros,</hi> who now disliked the Conquest, so far prevailed with him, that forgetting his Duty he returned to <hi>Moçambique.</hi> There some understanding Persons, and chiefly <hi>Francis Pinto Pimentel</hi> his Kinsman, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented this Affair in such manner to him, that he returned to <hi>Monomotapa.</hi> Being now delivered of that religious Man, who went away to <hi>Portugal,</hi> he set out by the way of <hi>Zofala,</hi> as <hi>Francis Barreto</hi> would have done, that being the properest Road for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in hand: He marched directly towards
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:54711:188"/>
the Mines of <hi>Manchica</hi> of the Kingdom <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canga,</hi> bordering by the Inland with that of <hi>Quiteyve,</hi> the next in Power to <hi>Monomotapa.</hi> With him was the same number of Men, and sorts of Instruments his Predecessor had. To oblige the King of <hi>Quiteyve,</hi> he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented and sent him Presents, and tho' these are the most efficacious means to make all things easie, that Prince grew so jealous of these Solicitations, that he received all very coldly.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Governor not making much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Answer, marched into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Several Bodies of <hi>Cafres</hi> attempted to stop his Passage, but were routed with great slaughter. The King seeing he did not prevail by force of Arms, had recourse to Policy. He caused all the People and Provisions to be withdrawn from the Towns and Country, so that our Men suffered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream want till they came to <hi>Zimbaoe</hi> his Court, whence he was fled, and had forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himself in inaccessible Mountains. <hi>Vasco</hi> burnt the City, and marched on to <hi>Chicanga,</hi> the King whereof rather through fear than love, received him with exterior signs of Affection, and gave him free passage to the Mines. Our Men marched to them, many believing they should gather Gold by hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls; but seeing the Natives with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty gather'd but little in a long time, and not being expert at that work, and that to make any thing of it, more Men and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials were requisite, they return'd the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54711:189"/>
way they came, and parted Friends with that King.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Though they obtained not what was sought this way, yet the ease wherewith they came to the place designed, evinced how great an Error it was to impose <hi>F. Monclaros</hi> as Director to the late Governor, who, only to follow his own extravagant Humour, lead him a way so dangerous and tedious. <hi>Vasco</hi> returned to <hi>Quiteyve,</hi> and that King did now for fear what he refused before, permitting the <hi>Portugueses</hi> to march to the Mines of <hi>Maninnas,</hi> only upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they should pay him Twenty Crowns yearly. <hi>Vasco</hi> passed thence to the Kingdom of <hi>Chicova,</hi> bordering upon <hi>Monomotapa</hi> to the Norward along the Inland. The cause of undertaking this March was, the Account he had of rich Silver Mines. Having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, he ask the <hi>Cafres</hi> for the Mines and they seeing it was in vain to resist, and fearing the discovery of the Mines would be their Ruine, scattering some Ore far enough from the Mines, shewed it, telling them, there they were.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. By this means the <hi>Cafres</hi> got time to escape; for our Men giving credit to them let them go, perhaps not desiring they should see what Treasure they got. The Governor caused all round about to be dug, and after much labour it was no wonder he did not find what was not there. Provision growing scarce, and finding no Fruit of his Labour, he marched away, leaving Captain <hi>Antony Cardoso de Almeyda</hi> with Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54711:189"/>
Men, and Necessaries to continue there some Days, to examine into the Truth of that so much coveted Corner of the Earth.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Vasco</hi> being gone, <hi>Cardoso</hi> suffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be again deceived by the <hi>Cafres,</hi> who had before imposed upon him. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, since he could not find a Vein there, they would show him a place where he might; and leading him the way of Death rather than that of the Mines, killed him and all his Men, after they had defended themselves with incredible Bravery. This may convince those who affirm, numbers of <hi>Cafres</hi> would fly from a Gun, as not having before seen them, since here Two hundred Men fighting with them for their lives, were all slain by their Darts and Arrows.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This was the end of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, scarce begun sooner than ended, and possest by two Governors, who no sooner saw, but they lost it. The first killed by rash words, the second expelled by a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, not barbarous, Stratagem. However the Peace and Trade with the Emperor of <hi>Monomatapa</hi> continued. These Actions of <hi>Francis Barreto</hi> and <hi>Vasco Fernandez Homem,</hi> were in the time of the Government of <hi>D. Luis de Ataide, D.

                     <p n="1">1. IN the beginning of this Year sailed <note place="margin">1575.</note> from <hi>Lisbon Ruy Lorenço de Tavora,</hi> to succeed <hi>Antony Moniz Barreto,</hi> with the Title of Viceroy of <hi>India,</hi> and four Ships: He died at <hi>Moçambique,</hi> and was the first that came short, being appointed for that Government. The Ships arriving at <hi>Goa,</hi> the Royal Patents of Succession were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and D. <hi>Iames de Meneses</hi> there present was the Person named in the first. So he was rather Successor to <hi>Antony Moniz,</hi> than <hi>Ruy Lorenço.</hi> However, since he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for it, we will reckon <hi>Tavora</hi> the Twelfth of the Viceroy's, and Twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seventh of Governors, and First of the Name and Sirname.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. D. <hi>Iames de Meneses</hi> having held this Command near two Years, there is no doubt but there happened more remarkable Passages than I heer relate, but I could find no more, having used all possible endeavours to get some farther Memoirs of his Time.

Treasure. The little I could gather is thus:</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As soon as D. <hi>Iames</hi> took upon him the Government, he fitted out several Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons for the usual purposes. At that time some Captains were upon the Northern Coast upon their own account, as D. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome Mascarennas,</hi> D. <hi>Iames</hi> and D. <hi>Antony de Silveyra</hi> Brothers, and <hi>Francis Pessoa.</hi> They anker'd in the River of <hi>Dabul,</hi> that City being then at Peace with us, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the <hi>Tanadar Melique Tocan</hi> with feigned kindness. He proferred to furnish them with what they wanted, and invited them home to dine with him, having Men ready to murder them in the height of their Merriment. All things succeeded as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, for they put themselves into his Power unarmed, except <hi>Mascarennas,</hi> who forbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding some Treachery stayed in the River. Those that accepted the invitation were killed, except a few who fled to the Shore, and the Murderers after them had like to have entred <hi>Mascarennas</hi> his Vessel, but that he and those few that were with him laying hold of Arms repulsed the bloody Assassins. <hi>Mascarennas</hi> carried the news of this Disaster to <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Towards the end of this Year arrived <note place="margin">1577.</note> the Ships that sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it; they were six in number, two set out first under <hi>Mathias de Albuquerque,</hi> appointed to Command at <hi>Malaca,</hi> and four after.</p>

5. As soon as the Governor was informed by D. <hi>Hierome de Mascarennas</hi> of the Villainy committed by the <hi>Tanadar</hi> of <hi>Dabul,</hi> he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched D. <hi>Peter de Meneses</hi> with a small Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron to Revenge that wrong, ordering him to lay wait for the Ships of <hi>Meca,</hi> and do all the Mischief he could on the Coast subject to <hi>Hidalcan.

                        <p>The Count D. <hi>Luis de Ataide</hi> is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time Viceroy of <hi>India;</hi> he set out in the Year 1577, and Governs till 1581, and is the last sent out by King <hi>Sebastian.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. WHEN King <hi>Sebastian</hi> had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (though he designed better) to bury the Glory of his Kingdom in the Sands of <hi>Africk,</hi> he appointed <hi>D. Luis de Ataide</hi> Count <hi>de Atouguia,</hi> General of his Forces: But soon after, not able to conform his Youthful Heat to the prudent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of the Count, that he might have a plausible Colour for removing him, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain constituted him Viceroy of <hi>India,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending there was need of such a Man there; as if he had not much more need of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct himself.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Count well understood the drift of this Change, but not willing to disgust the King, took no notice of it. He desired to have along with him <hi>Nunno Vello Pereyra,</hi> a Man more Expert than Fortunate in Military and Sea Affairs, as will appear hereafter, and <hi>Iohn Alvarez Suarez,</hi> a Man versed in the Revenue, and who had given good Proof of his Courage, as was related in the Siege of <hi>Chaul.</hi> D. <hi>Luis</hi> had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous Voyage, and was received at <hi>Goa</hi> with great Joy.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="362" facs="tcp:54711:192"/>
3. His arrival at <hi>Goa</hi> was about the end of <hi>August:</hi> The first thing he did after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sword, was the spreading the News that King <hi>Sabastian</hi> would infallibly that Year go over into <hi>Africk,</hi> where he was already killed when this was given out. The Viceroy foreseeing that disaster, and the ill Consequences might arise from it, fitted out such a mighty Fleet, as struck a Terror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the neighbouring Princes, who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure their own safety by our Power. The design of this Fleet he never revealed to any Man.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Amidst these greater Cares he forgot not the less, but sent Supplies to D. <hi>Peter de Meneses</hi> to enable him to act the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously against <hi>Melique</hi> the Tanadar of <hi>Dabul.</hi> The Viceroy in Person carried on the War against <hi>Hidalcan</hi> along the River of <hi>Goa,</hi> whether his Dominions extended; and he no longer able to endure it, proposed a Peace, promising the Traytor <hi>Melique</hi> should be for ever banished <hi>Dabul,</hi> and all his Dominions. The Peace was concluded, and our Forces withdrew. At that time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Goa</hi> three Ships from <hi>Portugal,</hi> and were the last sent sent by King <hi>Sebastian.</hi> When these came to <hi>India,</hi> two Caravels set out from <hi>Lisbon</hi> with the News of the King's Death, one bound for <hi>Goa,</hi> the other for <hi>Malaca.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardinal succeeded in the Throne, and from amidst those Ruines di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched five Ships for <hi>India,</hi> fearing lest the loss of King <hi>Sebastian</hi> being known, new
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54711:192"/>
Troubles might arise, if those Dominions were not timely supplied.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Viceroy understanding that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Tocan,</hi> contrary to the Articles of the Peace concluded the Year before, continued at <hi>Dabul</hi> publickly exercising his Office, and was ready to Launch a great Ship to Trade to <hi>Meca,</hi> he resolved to show how much he resented that wrong, and to that purpose sent thither D. <hi>Paul de Lima Pereyra</hi> with ten Sail.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>D. Paul</hi> coming to the Mouth of the River found all the Shore fortified, and a great number of Cannon planted in all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Places: He forces his way in through all the Batteries, and sees Six thousand Horse, and great number of Foot covering the Shore, and pouring showers of Bullets and Arrows upon him; nevertheless he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to burn two Ships belonging to <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalcan,</hi> but finding it impossible to come at them for the number of the Enemy's Cannon, he runs up the River, and spent some days in burning all the Towns along the Coast.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Enemy calls in to their Aid <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale</hi> and <hi>Mandaviray,</hi> two <hi>Malabar</hi> Pyrats who were in the Sea of <hi>Chaul</hi> with five Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liots: To these <hi>Melique</hi> joins other five Sail he had ready with Five hundred <hi>Turks, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> and other resolute Men. The Shore was cover'd with People that came to see this Action. D. <hi>Paul</hi> prepared to receive them, and after the Discharge of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non they came up board and board, and hand to hand.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:54711:193"/>
9. D. <hi>Paul</hi> boarded the first Galliot, they were ten to ten, though the Enemy had the advantage of the bigness of the Vessels and number of Men; but our Captains following the Example of their Admiral, behaved themselves so bravely, that only one of the Enemy's Galliots escaped, the rest were all taken. We lost but two or three Men in this Action, which was as fortunate as any we perform'd in <hi>Asia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. Having taken this Revenge of <hi>Melique</hi> for his Crime, and of <hi>Hidalcan</hi> for winking at it, D. <hi>Paul</hi> sailed out of the River through the same Dangers he came in, losing one Man. Being come to <hi>Goa</hi> with Nineteen Sail, whereas he went thence with only Ten; the Viceroy came out to receive him, and in the hearing of all that were present, said, <hi>What is it you mean, D.</hi> Paul, <hi>will you with such Acts of Bravery provoke my Envy to poison you?</hi> Thus Heroes praise great Men, and at the same time upbraid those who enviously Rail at noble Actions.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Emperor of <hi>Ceylon</hi> had some time since by his Ambassadors desired King <hi>Iohn</hi> III. to send him some Religious Men of the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> to instruct him in the Christian Religion: They being come to him he recanted. F. <hi>Iohn de Villa de Conde</hi> was this Year at his Court, and had several times confuted the <hi>Bramenes</hi> disputing of Religion. Yet they refusing to yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves overcome, he offer'd with a lively Faith, that he and one of them should be cast into a River full of great Crocodiles, or
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:54711:193"/>
into a great Fire, and that his Religion, who came out unhurt, should be allowed to be the true. They refused, and the <hi>Franciscan</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reaped the Fruit of this Victory, baptising <hi>D. Iohn Parea Pandar</hi> King of <hi>Cota,</hi> in the same Island.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Kingdom of <hi>Angola</hi> is near <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomotapa,</hi> whereof we lately spoke, and therefore will relate what happened there this Year, because it is a remarkable Passage. <hi>Paul Diaz</hi> undertook to War with that King, who had treacherously kill'd a number of our Men: This Captain with only two Galleys did Wonders on the Banks of the River <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anza,</hi> till he fortified himself in an Island formed by this and the River <hi>Lucula.</hi> Then joining the King of <hi>Congo</hi> and other Princes with only 150 <hi>Portugueses</hi> he several times defeated the Enemy. But the most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is the Battle wherein that King had a Million of Men, which were put to flight in such Confusion they kill'd one another.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. At the beginning of this Year, when the Ships sailed for <hi>India,</hi> our Kingdom, by the Death of the old Cardinal, King <hi>Henry,</hi> was under the Direction of five Governors, who dispatched them. They were four, whereof one was forc'd back to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the last sent under a <hi>Portugues</hi> Government, and the last our Viceroy saw: For he having done no more than what is related, or if he did, having left no memory of it, died the beginning of the Year, having in some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner foretold it For some time before leave being asked of him to bury his Cousin <hi>Antony
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:54711:194"/>
Rotello</hi> by his Brother D. <hi>Iohn de Ataide,</hi> he refused it, saying, <hi>He had long since designed that place for himself.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. At the end of his first Government something was said of his Qualities and Merit, and I have referred it to this place to speak of his undaunted Courage, as a virtue most peculiar to him. Some Proof of it has been given in the former Part of his Life, I will now give another Instance. At the attack (as I think) of <hi>Onor</hi> he sailed in a <hi>Brigantine,</hi> sitting on a Chair, and a famous Musician by him playing upon a Harp. The Enemy's Cannon from the Fort reached the Vessels, and grated the Musicians Ear; D. <hi>Luis,</hi> who was pleased to hear the Musick, seeing him give over, as if he had not seen the Cause, asked him, why he left off; the Musician told him; and he stretching out his hand, said, <hi>I pray let nothing disturb thee, go on with that Tune, for it is a very good one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. One of the Gentlemen that were standing behind him, seeing this was too great a Contempt of Danger, said, <hi>Tell that Man, if he happens to be killed, all will be lost:</hi> And another answer'd, <hi>Do not tell him so; for if he be killed, here are Men enough fit to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. D. <hi>Luis</hi> this second time govern'd the Term of two Years and seven Months, and may be reckoned in the number of Viceroys the Thirteenth, in that of Governors the Twenty-ninth; the First of the Name and Sirname.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Government of <hi>Ferdinand Tellez de Meneses,</hi> who was named by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of <hi>Portugal,</hi> upon the Decease of the Cardinal King <hi>Henry,</hi> in the Year 1581.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Ships dispatched by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of <hi>Portugal</hi> the last Year, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried new Patents of Succession. In the first was named <hi>Ferdinand Tellez de Meneses.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Malaca, D. Iohn Ribeyro Gayo,</hi> was President at this Ceremony, which was celebrated with such Demonstrations of Joy, as if there had been no Memory of their fresh Subjects of Tears.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whilst the Affairs of <hi>Portugal</hi> were in this miserable Condition, those in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Visapor</hi> were no better, the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion being uncertain upon the decease of <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> who died without Heirs in the 23d Year of his Reign, and 50th of his Age. He studied less to have Wives to get Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than young Men instead of Wives. A Youth of 18 Years of Age, who had more Honour than to consent to such Baseness, killed him as he was endeavouring to allure him to his brutal Appetite. <hi>Abraham,</hi> Son of <hi>Xatamas,</hi> one of two Brothers not long before slain by him, succeeded in the Throne. <hi>Qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:54711:195"/>
with others, enters <hi>Visapor</hi> with Forces, and seizes that Prince. Not long after the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi> (who are the Guard of those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) did the same under three Heads, chose by themselves to this purpose, who were <hi>Acalachan, Armichan,</hi> and <hi>Delarnachan.</hi> This last secures the other two, and takes all the Power into his own hands. Our Governor kept a watchful Eye over all these Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, knowing the Happiness of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, depended much upon the Event of those.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. At this time were brought to <hi>India</hi> new Instructions from the Governors of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the Second then sworn King, and First of the Name there. The Governor was order'd to tender the Oath there. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand Tellez</hi> performed the Ceremony with great Solemnity in the Church of <hi>Goa</hi> on the third of <hi>September.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Captains then commanding our Forts there were at <hi>Goa,</hi> D. <hi>Tristan de Meneses;</hi> at <hi>Zofala</hi> and <hi>Moçambique,</hi> D. <hi>Peter de Castro;</hi> at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> D. <hi>Gonzalo de Meneses;</hi> at <hi>Damam, Martin Alfonso de Melo;</hi> at <hi>Baçaim,</hi> D. <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel de Almada;</hi> at <hi>Chaul,</hi> D. <hi>Ferdinand de Castro;</hi> at <hi>Cananor, George Toscano;</hi> at <hi>Cochim,</hi> D. <hi>George de Meneses Baroche;</hi> at <hi>Columbo, Emanuel de Sousa Coutinno;</hi> at <hi>Tidore, Iames de Azambuja;</hi> and at <hi>Malaca</hi> D. <hi>Iohn de Gama.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Governor understanding that four Galliots of <hi>Malabar</hi> Pyrats were harboured in some of the Rivers about <hi>Goa,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:54711:195"/>
sent <hi>Mathias de Albuquerque</hi> with ten small Merchant Ships that were the readiest at hand, after them. He found them in the River <hi>Carapatan;</hi> three of our Vessels that were foremost falling violently upon them, forced the <hi>Malabars</hi> to leap into the Water, and by that time <hi>Albuquerque</hi> came up, each of them had taken one.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. There were at <hi>Mazulopatan</hi> two Ships of the bigness of ours that Trade to <hi>India;</hi> one belonging to the King of <hi>Achem,</hi> loaded with Ammunition, design'd, as was believed, against <hi>Malaca;</hi> the other to the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> richly loaden. The Governor sent <hi>Gonçalo Vaz de Camoens</hi> with four Ships to seize upon them: The first of the two had notice of it, and went off, and <hi>Gonçalo Vaz</hi> being informed of the great Force of the other, by the consent of his Men left that Design, and went over to the Coast of <hi>Pegu,</hi> where the <hi>Malabar</hi> Pyrats took one of his Ships Commanded by <hi>Francis Serram,</hi> and a Galliot of <hi>Ferdinand de Lima.</hi> They came to the Mouth of the River <hi>Negraes,</hi> just at such time as the Ship they feared to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter at <hi>Mazulapatan</hi> was entring. They could not in Honour avoid engaging her, though they were but two Galliots: After a desperate Fight, which lasted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most two days, the Ship was sunk, our Men having first rifled her with such covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that our Vessels had sunk, had not the Captain thrown many of the Goods over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="370" facs="tcp:54711:196"/>
7. The Galliots setting out again, were for some time carried about by the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being the beginning of Winter, till about the place where they sunk the Ship, they discover'd the Prince of <hi>Fegu</hi> with a Fleet of 1300 Sail, design'd for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the Kingdom of <hi>Arracam.</hi> The Prince desired to meet with these Galliots, having advice they were thereabouts, and that his Father would be as much pleased with taking of them, as the Conquest of that Kingdom. Sixteen of the best Sailers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, began to play their Cannon, and were as well answer'd, till they came to Board. After a sharp Engagement, three of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Ships were disabled, some entred, many Prisoners and 18 Pieces of Cannon taken; then our Men seeing all that Multitude was coming upon them, making all the Sail they could and plying their Oars, got into the Port of <hi>Arracam.</hi> The King rejoycing for the share he had in this Success, and well pleased that <hi>Gonçalo Vaz</hi> made him a present of some of his Subjects taken in the great Ships, gave liberty to some <hi>Portugueses</hi> he had long kept in Prison.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. About this time three Turkish Gallies set out of the Port at <hi>Moca,</hi> sent by the Bassa <hi>Mirazenam</hi> to plunder <hi>Moscate,</hi> having Intelligence from <hi>Moors</hi> living there; that the Town was Rich, and unprovided of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. <hi>Alibec,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> used to Robbing undertook this Design. <hi>Mirazenam</hi> was born at <hi>Otranto</hi> of Christian Parents, and was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:54711:196"/>
of all that Part of <hi>Arabia Felix</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trea,</hi> which the Natives call <hi>Ayaman,</hi> he resided in the City <hi>Cana,</hi> the Center of <hi>Arabia Felix.</hi> 60 Leagues North of <hi>Moca,</hi> and as many from <hi>Xael. Cana</hi> is built upon a Hill, encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a good Wall, and thought to be the Foundation of <hi>Cham</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> and to have been the Court of the famous Queen of <hi>Saba.</hi> The Province is most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, called by the Ancients, <hi>Siria Mumifera,</hi> because it produces Frankincense, Myrrh, and Storax.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Alibec</hi> being before <hi>Mascate,</hi> landed his Men, ordering those that remained in the Galleys to enter the Port, and as soon as they were in to play their Cannon furiously, that so the Inhabitants being imployed on that side, he might come in upon their Backs. It succeeded as he desired; for most Men saved themselves by flight, but few their Goods, and he in an instant entred and plundred the Town. <hi>Iames Machado</hi> going out to bury some Treasure, was killed, and himself and Money deprived of Burial.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Let us in some manner describe the situation of this Town: Extend the right Hand with the Palm of it down, stretch out the Thumb from the fore-finger, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that from the middle Finger, keep that close to the other two. The space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the middle and fore-fingers, is a Bay called <hi>Seabo,</hi> running up as the hand repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents. The distance between the Thumb and Fore-finger is another Bay, not so deep, along the Shore whereof the Town is bailt,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:54711:197"/>
shut in by two Mountains; one rises at the point of <hi>Seabo</hi> next that part where the three Fingers are together, it has only one Path that leads to <hi>Mascate</hi> so narrow, that two Men cannot pass it a-breast. This way <hi>Alibec</hi> come into the Town, no Body imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he would attempt it, for four Men with one Cannon might maintain it against the Universe.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Let us not deny any Man the Honour that is due to him: They that fled from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scate</hi> to <hi>Mataro,</hi> a Town a League distant, not thinking themselves safe there went to <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xel,</hi> a Fort four Leagues up the Inland, belonging to <hi>Catani,</hi> Head of a Hord of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabs.</hi> This place at that time was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by an Officer of his, a Man so Just and Honourable, that hearing the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of those People who came to him for Refuge, (for in great Dangers the lesser is a Refuge) he went out to receive, comfort, and entertain them. This was much, but what follows is more; His Men seeing the <hi>Portugueses</hi> come loaded with Riches, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to make use of that Opportunity, and not show too much Weakness or Pity. And he fearing, lest Covetousness should make them Disobedient, laboured with soft Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and sweet Words, to disswade them from their wicked Design.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. They all submitted themselves to their Officer's Reasons, and, with kind Usage, much comforted the Disconsolate <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> who continued there till <hi>Alibec</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone, they returned to <hi>Mascate,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:54711:197"/>
relating and admiring how honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably that Moor treated them, without suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the least wrong to be offered to their Persons or Goods.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The News of the Ruine of <hi>Mascate</hi> being brought to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> The Commander, D. <hi>Gonçalo de Meneses</hi> caused the Gallies to be closely watched, and Ships to be fitted out immediately to follow them. He made <hi>Luis de Almeyda</hi> Commander in chief, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him a Galleon, a Galley, and six other vessels, with Four hundred good Men. But he not observing the Orders of <hi>Meneses</hi> that were to follow the Galleys, fell into the Coast of the <hi>Naytaques,</hi> where they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Surprize the beautiful and rich City <hi>Pesani.</hi> But <hi>Francis Machado</hi> having given the Alarm, by falling upon some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were passing in two Boats, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants all fled.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. They plundered the City without Honour or Danger, and after burnt it and near Fifty Sail that were in the Bay. The very same Fate attended the City <hi>Guadel,</hi> not inferior to <hi>Pesani,</hi> and that of <hi>Teis</hi> of the <hi>Abindos,</hi> a barbarous and fierce Nation, the last of <hi>Gedrosia,</hi> on the Banks of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Calamen,</hi> the People of it join with the <hi>Naytaques</hi> in their Piracies.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. All these Things were begun, though not absolutely transacted, when D. <hi>Francis de Mascarennas</hi> arrived in <hi>India</hi> with the Title of Viceroy, being the first sent by our first King <hi>Philip,</hi> who was second of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:54711:198"/>
                        <hi>Spain. Ferdinand Tellez</hi> left the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a peaceable Condition, and the Sea of <hi>Goa</hi> well furnished with good Ships.

                        <p>Of the Gods, Surpestitions and Opinions of the <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> particularly the <hi>Indians,</hi> and among them the <hi>Malabars.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. I Have purposely omitted giving so particular an Account and Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People and Countries mentioned in this History, as will be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me, to avoid interrupting the series of Affairs, and connexion of Matter, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it still for a more proper place. The grand Revolution of the Kingdom of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> now brought under a foreign Prince, puts a Period to the Proceedings of our own, that we may begin again with what
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:54711:199"/>
was transacted under our new Sovereigns. Here then it will not be amiss to give the Curious the Satisfaction of some further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation touching the <hi>Indians, Ethiopians, Chineses</hi> and <hi>Iapans,</hi> but still with my usual brevity, dividing among them this Fourth Part of this Second Volume. As <hi>Asia</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into several Empires, so it is inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many very different sorts of People, and each People distinguished by very oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Customs. Yet those that are of one Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, agree in the essential Part, though they differ in Form. It is so in <hi>India,</hi> as well as any other considerable Portion of the World, and therefore the <hi>Malabars,</hi> one of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, may inform us of the Religion and Government of all the rest.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to the Frame of the World, they believe it had a beginning, and will have an end; but then begin again, and in that manner will be everlasting; that all things after having encreased, diminish; that in the beginning as One thousand and Animals were produced One thousand died, but now for One thousand produced One thousand and one die; that the reason why more die is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the heat of the Sun increases; that in the end, a violent Wind shall dissolve all things; that nothing shall then remain but the Deity <hi>Ixoreta,</hi> as in the first <hi>Chaos;</hi> that he shall be reduced to the bigness of an Egg, and this to the quantity of a Dew drop, scarce discernable; that after it has sounded like a Cricket, it shall increase by the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it diminished, and shall produce within
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:54711:199"/>
it self the five Elements, (for they reckon the Heaven the fifth) that their increasing shall burst the Egg in the middle; that there shall appear in it seven shels put together like an Onion; that the Egg being divided into two unequal parts, the biggest will be the Heavens, and the lesser the Earth; that the Gods were and shall be so formed again.</p>
                     <p>The Egg being open, the Deity will be placed in the upper part, on the Earth will appear a Mountain of Silver, on the top whereof will be seen the instruments of Generation (which they call the true <hi>Ixoreta</hi> or Deity, the true God and <hi>Causa Causarum)</hi> because all things in the World proceed from the Union of the instruments of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; therefore they particularly adore the noblest, that it is the Male, and place its Image in their Pagods, and on their ways. This they reign to have three Rines, from which proceed the three Gods, <hi>Bramá, Vist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Of the superior and inferior producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this is their Opinion. <hi>Ixora</hi> with this instrument of Generation, which was of a prodigious bigness, plowed up the Earth for the space of Seven hundred thousand loxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, each of these when greatest, is four Leagues, and when least a League and a halfe; from the Furrows sprung seven Seas and seven Lands, the ridges were the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the furrows, the Vales and Waters. Then from <hi>Ixoras</hi> back came the Woman called <hi>Cbati,</hi> (this has some resemblance with <hi>Eve's</hi> being made of <hi>Adams</hi> Rib,) and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:54711:200"/>
was separated from it by virtue of some words, and they resolved to have copulation. The length of the Generating Instrument (called <hi>Linga)</hi> wherewith <hi>Ixora</hi> had plowed the Ground hindred; he cut it into eighteen pieces, whereof were made the Weapons they use, as the Spear, Sword, Bow, and Buckler. Then <hi>Ixora</hi> with his Finger opened the way of Generation in <hi>Chati,</hi> which shed much Blood; he received it in his Hands, and throwing it up into the Air, suddenly of it were produced, the Sun, Moon, Stars, Roses, Flowers, Sweet-herbs, and Snakes, which they use in their Ceremonies, both being then fit for Copulation, by them the World was Peopled, the Beasts and Devils produced, and Heaven filled with Spirits, which they say are Thirty three Millions.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Heaven is fixt upon the Earth, not the Earth, the Center of it. The Sun and Moon move like the Fish in the Water, by Day from East to West, by Night they run about the Northward, not under the Earth, but along the edge of the Horrizon; they doubt whether the Earth be supported upon a Bulls-horns, or upon the Snake called <hi>Ananta;</hi> their Paradize is in some Mountain. The Snake <hi>Bassagui</hi> fighting with the Wind, would not let it pass, but <hi>Ixora</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to give it way, the Wind flying the more impetuous for having been detained, tore up a Mountain, which falling into the Sea, formed the Island <hi>Ceylon.</hi> Other Islands are encompassed with Seas they call of Sugar, Milk, Butter, and Sweet-Water. Happy the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:54711:200"/>
Sailers that could find such pleasant Seas.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Bases or Grounds of the Elements are of several matters, that of the Earth of Copper; that of the Water of Silver; that of the Fire of Gold; that of the Air of a Pretious Stone; that of Heaven of another Stone of more value: They are Gods and move, on the first waits the Bird <hi>Anam;</hi> on the second <hi>Guereram,</hi> on the third a Cart; on the fourth an Ox; on the fifth a Horse.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. There are seven large Subterranean dwellings, called <hi>Padalas,</hi> where live People who have no other light but that of certain bright Stones, which Snakes have in their Foreheads. One Day of ours is a Year in Heaven, and one of our Years, Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and sixty five there. The Days of the Week (as among us) take their names from the Planets, and one of them is a Festival. They believe the transmigration of Souls.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The God <hi>Givem,</hi> or <hi>Ixora,</hi> is of the colour of Milk; besides the usual two, he has one Eye in the Forehead, which being of Fire, consumes all things; his Body of such a length, that <hi>Brama,</hi> though he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, could never find the beginning or end of it. The other Brother <hi>Vistnu,</hi> who is God of the Transmutations, converted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a Hog, and turned up the Earth with his snout, but could never find his Feet. He is so thick that the Snake that girts the World, cannot encompass one of his Arms, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Having shared his Body with his Wife, and she hers with him, he is halfe Man halfe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; his care is to finish all things, <hi>Bram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="9">9. The God <hi>Ixora</hi> lives in <hi>Calaya,</hi> a most delicious Mountain for Woods, Gardens, Fountains, Birds and Nymphs, among them there is nothing but Harmony. The desert parts of it are inhabited by <hi>Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Brama</hi> and <hi>Vistnu</hi> envying <hi>Ixoras</hi>'s great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, set themselves against him; he said if they could find his beginning or end, they should be his Superiors. <hi>Vistnu</hi> looked for his Feet and <hi>Brama</hi> and for his Head; the first was deterred by a Snake, the second dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by Roses; he brib'd them to testifie he had seen his Head, which they did. <hi>Vist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu</hi> sensible of the fraud, turn'd them into Beasts, and cut off one of his Heads, of his Blood sprang a Man with Five hundred Heads, and One thousand Hands. <hi>Ixora</hi> did penance for this crime, and travelling, came
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:54711:201"/>
to a place where they threw several Beasts at him, he catched, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ead them, and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself with their Skins; being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered, <hi>Vistnu</hi> came to his Aid in the shape of a beautiful Maid, and his Enemies were astonished at her form: <hi>Ixora</hi> having to do with her, a Son was born, <hi>Ixora</hi> and <hi>Vistnu</hi> differed about whom it should belong too, and a Heavenly Spirit reconciled them, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to himself. He bred him an expert Archer, and kept him as his guard against <hi>Sagatracavaxem,</hi> the Giant of Five hundred Heads, and One thousand Hands, sprung from <hi>Bramas</hi> Head, cut off by <hi>Ixora.</hi> This pilgrimage of <hi>Ixora</hi> gave the Original to the Pilgrims, called <hi>Iogues,</hi> who wander about living upon Charity, wearing Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wigs, and strewed with Ashes.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Ixora</hi> has four Children, the first has the Face of an Elephant; the second of a Monkey; the third is <hi>Superbenia,</hi> with six Faces and twelve Arms; the fourth a young Woman called <hi>Patracali.</hi> The Father and his Wife <hi>Chati</hi> converted into Elephants, begot a Son with an Elephant's Head and four Arms, he is wonderful big, and rides on a Mouse. The first fruits of all that is sowed are offered to him.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The <hi>Bramones</hi> who are the Masters of their Ceremonies, abstain from Fish, Flesh, Eggs, and Wine, of other things they Eat and Drink without measure, they celebrate the Aniversaries of their Dead with great Banquets; they are so much afraid of the Moon on the fourth Day after the full, that
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:54711:202"/>
they shun seeing even the reflection of her in the Water.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Chati</hi> washing her self in the time of her courses, produced a Man. Her Husband cut of his Head, which rowling to the foot of his Mountain <hi>Calaya,</hi> brought forth the Tree on which grow the Coco's, which therefore have the resemblance of Eyes, Nose and Mouth. But the Wife complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ixora</hi> cut of an Elephants Head and put it to the Body, which remained Man and Elephant. Then both converting themselves into Monkeys, begot one, but she ashamed to bring it forth, desired the Wind to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate it to another Womb, and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to that of the Wife of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirits. She was delivered of, and <hi>Ixora</hi> gave him great power, calling him <hi>Anuman.</hi> This is the Reason the <hi>Indians</hi> adore Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Patracali Ixoras</hi>'s Daughter is black, she has eight Faces, and sixteen Arms, great round Eyes, Hogs Teeth, two Elephants for pendants, she is cloathed with Snakes, her Hair like the Peacocks Tails, has seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things in her hands, particularly Arms, the Devil <hi>Medala</hi> waits on her; she seeing her Father could not overcome the Giant <hi>Daridabaxada,</hi> Conquered him by Policy. <hi>Ixora</hi> to deliver her from Enemies, sent her to live invisible among Men. At Sea she overcame some Fishermen, and landed at <hi>Coulam,</hi> and marryed the Prince of <hi>Coulett,</hi> who being falsly accused of stealing the Queen of <hi>Pande</hi>'s Bracelets, was impaled.

                        <hi>Patracali</hi> brought him to Life, caused Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to he offered to him, and thus freed from the bands of wedlock, remained a Virgin.</p>

In the first shape he overcame <hi>Breniacxem</hi> in the bottom of the Sea, taking from him the Law he had stole from the heavenly Spirits.

At the hour of his Birth the Palace was filled with Brightness, though it was Mid-night; the Doors flew open, and the Fetters fell off that held <hi>Bassudever.</hi> He arose and took the Child to carry it to <hi>Amparhi,</hi> and by the way the Waters of two Rivers divided themselves, that he might pass dry. <hi>Camusem</hi> consulting Diviners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

the Birth of this Child, which was the first Quarter of the Moon, on a Thursday in <hi>August,</hi> the Sun being in <hi>Leo,</hi> and the Moon in <hi>Taurus,</hi> in the time of <hi>Minabixam,</hi> they answer'd, <hi>Siri Christna</hi> would govern the whole World, and would kill him in the Sixteenth Year of his Age. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him to send a Woman that had veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Milk, that sucking her might be his Death; but the Child, instead of her Milk, sucked out her Soul, and she died to the astonishment of his Mother <hi>Axoda,</hi> who was present. Thus he escaped other Dangers from his Enemies, and at Seven Years of Age, was skilled in all Sciences, and among other Extravagancies defloured the Maids he played with.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His Mother whipped, and causing him to open his Mouth to discover whether he smelt of some Butter 'twas said he had eaten, she saw within Heaven and Earth and her self. She frighted, bid him shut his Mouth, but he would not till she promised him Figs or Sugar, and other things, and that she would carry him to the River to make Pipes to play upon. He, to be revenged on the Women, watched a Bath where they came, and enjoyed them all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He went afterwards to fight the Snake <hi>Caliga</hi> that was Nine Leagues long, had Eyes like two Suns, and lived in a Lake made of the Venom she cast out of her mouth. The Snake finding she could not overcome him, perceived he was the God <hi>Vistnu,</hi> and begged his pardon. <hi>Camused</hi>
                        <pb n="389" facs="tcp:54711:205"/>
caused a Woman turned into a Snake to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and he swelled till he burst her. In fine, <hi>Camused</hi> was killed, and <hi>Siri Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stna</hi>'s Parents placed on the Throne of the Kingdom of <hi>Madure.</hi> This done, <hi>Vistnu</hi> turned into <hi>Siri Christna,</hi> married 16108 Women, and lying with them all in one day got as many Sons. This is counted the greatest Action of this God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Betele</hi> is a Plant, the Leaves whereof pouder'd with Lime and Areca the <hi>Indians</hi> chew and suck to preserve the Teeth, streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Stomack, and provoke Lust. It is so like our Ivy, that an Ambassador of <hi>Hidalcan</hi> in <hi>Lisbon</hi> made use of it instead of Betele, mixing it instead of Areca with Cipress Apples, and said the Virtue was the same. <hi>Argionem</hi> being upon a Tree <hi>Degastri,</hi> one of the Wives of the Celestial Spirits came and carried him up in her Chariot, where he found this Plant, and stole a Stock of it which he planted on Earth. This is the reason the <hi>Indians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Plant came from Heaven, and that it cannot thrive unless he that Plants steal it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The time of <hi>Siri Christna</hi>'s Death draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, he gave signs to know it by, which was, that when he expired the World should be inverted from what it ought to be, and is the time of <hi>Culi,</hi> which now is. Their Writings say, all will come to Confusion. But <hi>Vistnu</hi> coming to the World again, shall kill all for their Wickedness, except two Kings, who till then shall be doing Penance
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:54711:206"/>
for the love of <hi>Vistnu.</hi> These are <hi>Mara</hi> of the Sun's Charge, and <hi>Divappi</hi> of the Moon's.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Darmaputrem,</hi> one of the hundred Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, descended into Hell, where he saw one encompassed with great Treasures, and perishing with hunger: He asked the reason, and the other answer'd, That it was because he had not given Alms while he lived in the World; but that once he shewed a poor Man the House where the Rice was kept that was given for Charity, pointing at it with his Finger. Then <hi>Darmaputrem</hi> bid him put that Finger with which he had pointed into his Mouth, which he doing thought he tasted all the Dainties in the World. <hi>Darmaputrem</hi> and others returning into the World gave great Alms, whereby after Death they purchased Paradice. This proves the <hi>Malabars</hi> believed Heaven and Hell, and a Reward and Punishment for good and bad Works.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Brama</hi> is the antientest God of the three, he resides in the Rose that springs from <hi>Vistnu</hi>'s Navel, though he lies in the milky Sea. He descends through the hollow stalk of the Rose to <hi>Vistnu</hi>'s Belly, where are the Ideas of all things, and where he produces these by looking on those. He has four Heads, which are the Original of four Laws; and because <hi>Ixora</hi> cut off the fifth Head for the Lye he told, he lost the fifth Law, which is that of God, and therefore the <hi>Bramenes</hi> want it. He dies and comes to Life very often; an artificial Day of his contains 120000 Years of the Celestial Spirits. He
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54711:206"/>
has two Wives, but never had Children by them.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Among the <hi>Malabars</hi> are four sorts of Nobility, <hi>Bramene, Exastri, Baestri, Chadra.</hi> The first they say proceed from <hi>Brama</hi>'s Face; the second (being Kings called <hi>Coilas)</hi> from his Arms; the third from his Thighs, which Race they say is extinct; the fourth from the Feet, called <hi>Nayres.</hi> The <hi>Bramenes</hi> have the name, because descended from the Face, and are much honoured by the Kings who are not <hi>Bramenes,</hi> and may sit down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Though they attribute the Production of all things to <hi>Brama,</hi> he acts only in the most perfect, giving others the lesser power. Sometimes he grants so great Power to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he is in great danger of them, and forced to fly. <hi>Vistnu</hi> converted into a Nymph, delivered <hi>Brama</hi> from one of those Dangers. <hi>Ixora</hi> seeing that beautiful Form of his got him with Child. He was delivered of two Children, the one at the Mouth, the other at the Thigh. One was called <hi>Chartava;</hi> the other <hi>Ayapem,</hi> who lost his Birthright by drinking too much Wine, and it being put to his choice, whether he would be the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est among Angels, or Chief among Devils, he chose the latter, and was constituted such. <hi>Ixora</hi> gave him Privilege to converse with Men and be serviceable to them, and he came in the Shape of a <hi>Nayre</hi> to the Court of the King of <hi>Pande.</hi> He lived in <hi>Malabar</hi> and turning Physitian, in which he was suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful, had Temples dedicated to him
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:54711:207"/>
His chief offering is Whelps, because he is a Hunter. So ancient a Custom it is for Doctors and Whelps to go together. They say in this Age of <hi>Brama</hi> all Men have Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key Faces, and in the next they will be Horse Faces. The contrary is seen among us; for outwardly we appear Men, and inwardly are Brutes.</p>

                        <p>A Continuation of the same Matter.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. BEfore they build a Pagod they sow the Ground with Kidney-beans, when they are green they turn in a greyish Cow to seed on them, and where she Dungs, they believe is the place for the Pagod, placing on the very spot a Pillar, and on the top of it the Idol, to whom it is dedicated: Then they build the Walls, which are never of great extent, but rich, as being black Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble well carved, covered with Copper-plates, with Globes of Gold, or gilt. The inside is set thick with monstrous Images with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heads and Arms, and girt with Serpents. Then they build a square Wall about it, on each side of it is an entrance with a sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Portal, with Histories of their Gods carved about them. They are covered in the same nature as the Temples. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath are Heads of Elephants, Bears, Lions,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:54711:207"/>
Tigers, and other wild Beasts with terrible Eyes and Teeth. It is thought these things are to terrifie those that resort thither, and move them to give Alms; though their Poet <hi>Palcanar</hi> laughs at it. Those who go to visit the Idol enter the inclosure, but not the Temple. The Inhabitants of <hi>Pande,</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Bisnagar,</hi> are singular in these Works.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The most famous Pagods are, that of <hi>Rettora</hi> built by <hi>Cheram Perimal</hi> living at <hi>Cranganor,</hi> who placed in it the Statue of a Man ten Cubits in length, lying on a Snake with five Heads in the Sea of Milk. The Temple was covered with Plates of massy Gold, but because they were subject to be stole he put them into the Treasure of the Pagod, and instead of them placed others of Copper. The Idol is still covered with pure bright Gold that shines like Fire; his Crown is of an inestimable value, and has many precious Stones, in the Forehead three Rubies that exceed all price, on his Feet Buskins valued 200000 Ducats.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the Treasure, besides the covering Plates there laid up, there are nine Boats of Gold set with rich Stones, each big enough to contain three Men; the same number of Kettles of the same Matter, each deep enough to hide the <hi>Bramene</hi> with the Idol upon his Head, many Pots, Peacocks and Cocks of Gold and Silver, and an infinite quantity of Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>. These are useless Vessels, those that are of use and the same Metal are kept more at hand. At the entrance of the Pagod hangs a Gold Candlestick so big, no Man can
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:54711:208"/>
lift it from the ground, and with the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual smoak looks like Ebony. Several Idols and Candlesticks that stand before the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Idol are of the same Metal. In fine, the Treasure is unmeasurable, if we may believe a Bramene who turned Christian, and had many good Qualities that show he merited Credit.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Revenues of this Pagod are incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and very many live on them. The enclosure is of Marble six Yards high, and above one in thickness; it is about half a League from the Shore, a beautiful Way leading to it. At each of the wonderful Gates can enter at once four Elephants with all their Furniture. It is guarded by 1000 armed Men: The Coast is dangerous, which secures many great Men who keep their Treasures there.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Pagod called <hi>Comori,</hi> from which that famous Point of Land takes name, is also remarkable. <hi>Comori</hi> Pagod, signifies, The Church of the Virgin. It is like the other in Structure, but not in Riches, because they trust them not there, since our Fleets Sail upon those Coasts. The Pagod is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to a Virgin Daughter to a Shepherdess, that was changed for a Son of <hi>Davagni</hi> Sister to the Giant <hi>Maveli,</hi> who killed all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, because he was told one of them would be his Death. He thought to kill this Virgin, and she giving him a kick flew through the Air into the Desert to the place where the Pagod now stands on the Shore, having been formerly 60 Leagues from the Sea. She after
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:54711:208"/>
flew a great Giant by the help of the God <hi>Vistnu,</hi> and set his Head on a Rock that now appears in the Sea, and is above 400 Fathom round. In the very place where the Virgin sate after this Victory, was erected the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Pagod of <hi>Trivate</hi> is more ancient than that of <hi>Rettora,</hi> but poor, having been plundred by the Nayque of <hi>Madure.</hi> It is not much frequented. This Temple was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in memory of the Giant <hi>Naragecoguer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli,</hi> who by destroying the World provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the God <hi>Vistnu;</hi> and still came to Life again, though overcome and killed by him. <hi>Vistnu,</hi> to end the dispute, laid him on the ground and sate down upon him. This is what is represented in the Pagod.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That of upper <hi>Cranganor</hi> has an Idol on whose Head one of the Bramenes gives se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral strokes of a hammer every day. For they think if this were not done, he would by this time touch the Stars with his head. In the Frontispiece are several Images in the <hi>Portugues</hi> Habit, whence is concluded either that Work was finished after their arrival, or such a Habit was formerly used there.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That of <hi>Canari</hi> in the Island <hi>Salsete,</hi> is bigger than all the others, and exceeds them in sumptuousness of building. It seems to have taken the name from some Builder of that Country, or from <hi>Canara</hi> King of <hi>Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagar,</hi> the grandure of the Work requiring so great a Founder. It is dug out of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that looks like one solid Stone, and is black Marble. The Body is very high, the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:54711:209"/>
Isles low, but altogether of a vast bigness, somewhat dark, as dug out of the middle of a Mountain. Among at least 3000 Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are cut out about it with each a Cistern by the Door, there are some large Rooms, and one of an extraordinary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in which 'tis said are read Lectures of all Sciences. We have already spoke in the Second Chapter of the Second Part of this Tome, of the Way cut under this Mountain said to run as far as <hi>Cambaya,</hi> of the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscan</hi> that attempted to discover that Secret, and the Princes that are believed to have made it.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Pagod of <hi>Maliassa</hi> is in the same Island. At the foot of a Mountain is a Portal of a moderate bigness: The two Pillars that support it are in the Shape of Giants well carved. There are other Figures like those of Angels among Christians. This leads into a large Porch, and on the left hand is the Gate of the Pagod through which the Water runs: Then follows a great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, after that other little ones, and then a strait way, all dug out of the solid Mountain.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Pagod called of the Elephant, because the Figure of one stands upon a Rock at the entrance of it, is in one of the many Islands of the River <hi>Bombaim</hi> between <hi>Bacaim</hi> and <hi>Chaul.</hi> It is like the others, in that it is cut out of a Mountain, but exceeds them much in curious work. The first entrance is into a spacious Room supported by vast Pillars in the form of Giants curiously carved.
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:54711:209"/>
It has three Isles: The Pillars are all compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of Figures of the same height as the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: On one of them is the Giant <hi>Briareus</hi> with his hundred Hands; on another the God they call <hi>Mahamurte,</hi> who has three Faces to one Body, on his Head a Pontifical M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Some Soldiers attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to enter an Apartment that is very dark, and being fearful took Lights, but were drove out by a multitude of Bats that were frighted at the Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There are Galleries with rich carved Work of Men and Women, most of them in very immodest Actions and Postures. This (they say) was the Choire of their Ceremonies.

                     <p n="11">11. To conclude, the Pagod dedicated to the Monkey is so great, that only the Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in which they shut up the Cattle designed for Sacrifices, has 700 Columes of Marble nothing inferior to those of the Roman <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. EVery <hi>Pagod</hi> has a Cook who dresses the Rice that is offer'd for himself, for the Idol, and for those who offer. The last divide their share with their Neighbors, who esteem it as a Holy thing. A great Poet of theirs laughs at them for offering more Food to the statue, seeing it has not Eaten the last, and they answer, though he does not Eat, he smels it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Kings and Nobles every Day use a ceremony (called <hi>Tevaram,</hi> that is Divine Ceremony,) which is with many Prayers to offer Rice, Coco, and Butter, all burnt in honour of their golden Idols, of which they have a number answerable to their Estate; so that some have above 1000; this sacrifice is to obtain Riches for themselves, revenge and destruction of their Enemies: Many have in their Houses familiar Devils, which they call <hi>Cutichates,</hi> every Day they offer some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them, they get by them; and some have 300 of them. They make them enter into the bodies of those they would be revenged of, whereof they make great advantage, for many pay to be delivered from them. By the help of them converted into the shapes of Beasts, they hurt People and infest whole Towns: There are those living, who have seen the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:54711:210"/>
Town of <hi>Cranganor</hi> burnt by this means. At <hi>Pudiangale</hi> near <hi>Calicut,</hi> a Woman had one of these, and saw it in the shape of a Cock, a Monkey, and a little black Boy with a Truncheon in his Hand: these are not punished in <hi>Malabar,</hi> but their Kings make use of them in danger: The very Heathens observe that all those who follow that course live and die miserably.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In sickness they consult Wizards, not Doctors; they say a Devil causes the Disease, and bringing him into the Sick Man, make him tell the Reason of molesting him; then they promise him something to go out again, and he does it. They think the Small-pox is Cured with an offering to <hi>Patracale,</hi> who they affirm causes them. The Gout they believe is caused by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="4">4. They adore and offer Sacrifice to vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Snakes, that they may not hurt with their Poyson. The Lawyers on the first Day of <hi>September</hi> do the same to their Books.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Their Baths are used rather to cleanse the Soul than the Body; they know the ten Commandments, but think not themselves bound by them. It is a great Sin if a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman is touched by one that is not such, though he be never so great by learning, by the Sword, or by Virtue: And even Riches there cannot prevail to gain this point.

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:54711:214"/>
on pain of losing their quality. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult Foretune-tellers about a happy time to Marry; they choose a Husband of their own race born under the same Planet, and the same Day of the Moon, as themselves, to which purpose the times of Nativities are punctually observed. The <hi>Bramen</hi> that does the duty of Priest, is called <hi>Odicon,</hi> or <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical;</hi> he for four Days sacrifices in a Den Rice, Butter, Cows, and such like things; he lights a lamp, and sets aside a portion of Rice for <hi>Garapatii,</hi> and for the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Elephant, that he may not disturb the Feast. The Bridegroom ties about the Brides neck, a thread on which hang three little pieces of Gold, in honour of the three Gods; this is called <hi>Tale,</hi> and is the mark of a Marryed Woman. Hence among the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labars</hi> Matrimony is called <hi>Quo Fa,</hi> which signifies binding; if the Husband dies first, the Woman throws away the thread, or <hi>Tale,</hi> in token of liberty.</p>

The Priest takes the couple by the Hands and says some Prayers, then they go to feast; they do not lie together till some happy Planetary Conjunction, when that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, they go to the door of the Room which is half put too, and therewith the Priest say some Prayers, and withdraw; the next Day they go to a Cauldron of Water, in which are live Fish, and each holding the end of a cloth, draw it through like a Net, the Fish taken they lay respectfully on their Heads, with the right Hand; if many be taken, they believe they shall have many Children, and the contrary.</p>

3. If any dies a Maid, they cause some poor Man of the family, (an unheard of beastliness) to deflour her though very young; him they pay well for so doing, and as soon as done, throw stones at him till he runs out of reach. Those of the family <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astri,</hi> and the Kings that are not <hi>Bramenes,</hi> make no Royal Marriages, so their Wifes are not Queens, but Concubines, called <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaras,</hi> and all of them may have Gallants. Therefore the Sons do not inherit, but the Nephews born of Sisters. Of their manner of Marrying we have spoke before.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Tale</hi> among the meaner sort of Women, serves to tie them to one Husband, and among Ladies, to turn them loose to all lasciviousness. Only the <hi>Bramenes</hi> have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to lie with all sorts of Women, from the meanest to the Queen. The others if they have to do with inferiors are killed, if Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, sould. The <hi>Nayres</hi> differ not from the others, in the manner of their Weddings. Among the meaner sort as Tradesmen, one of them puts the <hi>Tale</hi> upon the Young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who is thereby capacitated to follow whom she pleases, or be taken up by who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever likes her. Among Silver-smiths, Black-smiths and Founders, four Brothers, or as many as there are, keep one Wife between them, and have particular Days assigned for each, that the inheritance may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. Till a Maid is licensed by the <hi>Tale,</hi> she may be abroad among Men, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

5. The <hi>Bramenss</hi> of the North do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrate their own Weddings, but those of Beasts and the Elements. In our Age there was a great Man of that Family, who spent above 15000 Ducats at the Wedding of a Bull and a Heifer. There was also a Baneane who making a Well in the Village <hi>Calegam</hi> for the use of Passengers, and resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Marry this Water with some other, despised all that was near, and Marryed it to the River of <hi>Suratt,</hi> above 30 Leagues distant, and spent above 5000 Crowns in the Wedding.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>Chatines</hi> Marry as the <hi>Bramenes,</hi> but their Widdows cannot throw off the <hi>Tale,</hi> because they must not Marry again, nor keep a Gallant: When they want Heirs, they adopt one, by drinking to the adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who pledges in Coco-milk dyed with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fran.</hi> If he is a Man they give him one of the names of the Sun, if a Woman, of the names of Gods Wife.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The cause the families do not mix, is because the <hi>Bramenes</hi> descended from the God <hi>Bramasface,</hi> those of <hi>Chatrier</hi> (that is Kings) from the right Hand, those of <hi>Vaix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> from the Belly; those of <hi>Chadrer,</hi> (they are the <hi>Nayres)</hi> from the Foot. At first they used to mix, but afterwards the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> obtained a priviledge of King <hi>Chera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Perimal</hi> to the conrrary; hence they are so much superior to others, that they are polluted by coming near as well as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; they must not Eat with those of a lower race, nor any thing drest by them,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:54711:215"/>
nor out of any Vessel of theirs; if any of them Marries, or has to do with inferiors, they burn on his Forehead a mark like a daws soot, and his kindred making a statue like him of straw, and the Herb <hi>Dorpe,</hi> burn it with ceremonies, as if it were a dead Man. The <hi>Bramenos</hi> loose their birthright of their Family, by Eating Fish, Flesh, or Eggs; and by Drinking <hi>Sura</hi> or <hi>Orraca,</hi> by stealing or killing another <hi>Bramen,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it is not in War<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Saniade</hi> or <hi>Saniassi</hi> is a dignity greater then a King, of which only the <hi>Bramenes</hi> are capable, the elect is installed by another <hi>Saniassi</hi> in this manner. The Image of the elect is made in Straw and burnt, to show he is dead to the World; then the Master leads him to a Bath, cuts of his <hi>Corombi,</hi> and dips him 72 times, then takes off his piece of Net, the mark of a <hi>Bramene,</hi> cloaths him in red, and he can never after wear white, only on his back a <hi>Fota.</hi> He delivers him a rod with a piece of the same cloath, and a straw Hat; for three or four Days he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Masters tuition, must not Eat Fish, Flesh, chew Betle, nor so much as look upon a Woman, and if accidently he meets one, he puts his Hat over his Eyes, and goes on till she is out of sight. He is to take what is given him without complaining, lives in or near the <hi>Pagod,</hi> succeeds and is Heir to his Master. He bows only to the Idol, and even the King and <hi>Bramenes</hi> do to him, all his

defence is in curses, so much dreaded, that every one endeavours to appease him; he is not to handle Money; none can carry his Hat when he goes a foot: If he does any thing contrary to his institution, the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> accuse him before the King; if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, they stain him with <hi>Safran</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him, but he buys it off with bribes.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. They use no ceremony with those that die under the Age of 7 Years; those that are above this Age, are burnt towards the South from their Houses, where lives <hi>Iemen</hi> King of the Devils, that he may the sooner carry away the Soul. For mourning they shave their Heads and Beards, which they do not cut for a whole Year after, nor have to do with Women: Lye 15 Days on a mat, and enter not into the <hi>Pagods;</hi> the 15 Days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, they cast the Ashes into the Sea, if near, if not into some bye place, and plant a Fig-tree where the funeral pile was; then they wash and put on clean cloaths, cast out all Earthen Vessels, and one comes to purify the House, sprinkling it with Cows piss and Milk.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Every Day of the Fast, he that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the House puts a little Rice upon a Fig leafe, which the Rooks Eat, or if they fail, which is looked upon as a great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, 'tis cast into the Water for the Fish. The Anniversary is a Feast at which there must be no Poor.

                     <p n="11">11. The Original of this Custom was from King <hi>Pandues</hi> Wife, who voluntarily burnt her self with him, and it is upheld to secure the lives of the Husbands; it having been observed, that more died by means of the Wifes, then by Sickness. The <hi>Saniade</hi> or <hi>Saniassi</hi> is not burnt, but buryed whole in the <hi>Pagod</hi> where he serves; they make a hole and seat him in it upon the bench he used before he is quite Dead, with a little Rice, and some without for the Idol, then cover him with Clay without any farther ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, believing he is suddenly gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

The poorer sort cloath much in the same Nature, but with Apparel of less value. For the most part they go barefooted; or if they wear any thing, it is only a sort of Buskins so streight the Foot never goes to the bottom, and so they drag them. The meanest sort of all wear Cow. Hides either with or without the

                     <p n="6">6. The Women of great Quality, as the <hi>Oisoros,</hi> that are of the Blood-Royal, and others wear Shifts of Silk, or rich Indian Linnen, they cover the whole Body, very close at the Wrist, but the rest of the sleeve so wide it hangs down to the ground. They use Bracelets of Gold and Silver, Necklaces of Glass of several Colours, from the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders downwards they are covered with silk Veils of several Colours, or white as the Men, and they let them fall like them when they make Reverence; they put nothing on their Heads, their Hair hanging in many breadths, or loose and divided, fastned to the Skin ointed with Butter, the ends are knotted. Men and Women to avoid discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing this so tedious dress, when they sleep rest their Neck upon sticks so framed, that the Head lies hollow: They always carry Bodkins of Ivory, Ebony, or other things well wrought to scratch themselves with, and are always stuck in the Hair.</p>

They love Feasting, and make more account of the Wine than the Meat; the Tables round; for Table-cloaths Cakes of Bread of several sorts of Grain, generally three cover the Table, and sometimes one. Their Food much the same as ours. When they wash their hands, every one wipes on the Cloath he wears, and when they eat on a piece of Bread. The greatest Dainty, without which the Feast is not compleat, is Beef just killed and eaten raw, and for the more delicacy, instead of Mustard, dipped in the Excrement of a certain Gut of the same Beast. The Desert is parched Pease and other Grain. Whilst they eat they drink little or nothing, but as soon as dinner is done they go to another place to drink, in which they spend more time than in the former. The drink is <hi>Sava,</hi> or Beer, and that Liquor of Honey before-mentioned: They drink and talk, till being hot-headed they go out brandishing their Swords, and promising to kill all the Master of the Feast's Enemies. The Feast is esteemed most splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, whence most come out drunk. The Women go to Feasts with their Husbands, and the <hi>Oisoros</hi> without them if they please.</p>

The Sons of Women of the Blood-Royal, that is those <hi>Oisoros,</hi> can never inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Crown, nor they marry with Men of the Family, though removed a hundred De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.

Easter</hi> they keep fifteen days; all the Festivals of the Year they observe according to the old Stile, on the Feast of the Epiphany they also cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Baptism of Christ, and Men and Women repeat their Baptism in some River or Pool.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. They add more Days to the Lent than we do to make up the forty, because the <hi>Saturdays</hi> as well as <hi>Sundays</hi> are kept holy.

                     <p n="13">13. The Weddings are celebrated with Trumpets, Tabors and Dancing. Some live together upon promise of Marriage, if they have any Children. The Women are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Husband's Brothers and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the nearer of kin the more free to this beastliness. If the Wife knows the Husband has to do with another Woman, she recovers of her forty of every Creature she has upon the ground, as Forty Cows, Sheep, Goats, or any other thing; and if she will, the Husband is fined for her use many Cloaths which are delivered to her, for the Wives have their Goods apart. Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is not punished with death.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. In their Funerals they use the same Musick and Dancing as in the Weddings, to signifie it is the same thing to die as to be born. All the difference is the People that follow the Corps wear white Ribbands tied about their Foreheads, and go without Priest or Cross. Instead thereof they carry the dead Man's richest Goods before him. It is a great token of Grief to shave their Heads (at the Death of their Kings all men are obliged to it) but yet a greater to accompany the Corps naked from the Wast upwards.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Their Mourning is a black Cloath died in a certain sort of mud, for they have no other dying. If a Man be found dead and the Murderer not known, the Country
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:54711:224"/>
is fined to make satisfaction to the Relations. The same if any Cattle be lost; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People are obliged to maintain the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys and other People when they travel. When two meet after a long absence, their salutation is kissing commonly the Mouth, sometimes the Cheek, or Shoulder. The Women neither spin nor soe, the Husbands mend the Cloaths; the Poorest Woman would be ashamed to wash her own Cloaths, the Men do it, and the Women bring the Water.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. They have many Churches, I will say somewhat of the chiefest, that of <hi>Acçum</hi> is the principal of all <hi>Ethiopia</hi> for its antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and because the Emperors must be Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it and no other. It stands in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of one of their greatest Towns. Near <hi>Acçum</hi> are the Caves where the Holy King <hi>Cabeb</hi> and his Son did pennance. They are buried in the Church of St. <hi>Pantalion,</hi> which stands on the top of a high Mountain; <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion</hi> was one of the 9 Saints, they say went from <hi>Rome</hi> to Preach the Gospel in that Country.</p>

The famous Monasteries of <hi>Abbaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rima</hi> and <hi>Aleluya</hi> and the Church of <hi>Acçum</hi> stand in the form of a Triangle, a Days journey distant from each other. In the Center is <hi>Tremona; Abbagarima</hi> took name from its founder, who was one of the 9 Saints, and Son of a King of <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Isaac,</hi> as the Son also was; but the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> called him <hi>Abbagarima,</hi> which signifies, a Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious for Miracles; they feign that there was a way under ground from this Saints

The religious of these Monasteries are of two sorts, those of <hi>Abba Tula Aymanot</hi> and those of <hi>Abba Stateus</hi> the founders. They live not in community, but every one where he pleases with Servants; they observe no noviceship, nor make any vow, such as will Marry and have 2 or three Wives; most of them have Mistresses, and think it no sin. Such as do profess Chastityare much esteem'd, all their business is to gather Riches, and get Governments. Their Habit is white Shirts, or striped with several colours, over them, a black Scapulary before, a narrow round hood of the same colour; they never take it of, not even when they consecrate, Cloaks or Mantles as every one can afford, the Poorest or most observant wear Cow hides, like the meanest of the People. All carry crosses in their Hands; the Masters who are not Marryed bigger then the others; but they want not for Women even of those they call Nuns.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. The Nuns make no Vow, live where they will, and wear hoods like the Fryars<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

twice, if they do, they are excluded the Church. The <hi>Abugnas</hi> who give the Holy Orders scarce do it <hi>gratis.</hi> They use no ceremonies, nor examine those who are to be ordained; they pay more respect to the Altar stone on which they lay the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, then to the the Sacrament it self; their Chalices are made of Tin, or Copper, very large, that they may hold much Wine for the People to whom it is given in little spoons. The Priest to say Mass puts nothing over his cloaths, but as it were a piece of a <hi>Casula</hi> which hangs behind and covers his back. The <hi>Thuribels</hi> have bells to make a noise, they use no Mass book, but say the Mass by Heart; they assist at it with a confused noise their Chalice cloaths are black and dirty, so rags for other uses, their bells of stone.</p>

In the Country of <hi>Barnagassa</hi> towards <hi>Arquico</hi> is the famous Monastery of <hi>Birau,</hi> corruptly called <hi>Vizan</hi> or <hi>Vision.</hi> It is of 200 Years standing, had once 500 Fryers, now not above 40. There is a great Church with 3 Isles. sustained upon 12 Pillars, built and dedicated, as they say to the Blessed Virgin before her birth; about half a League from it, is the Church of St. <hi>George,</hi> possess'd by the last Patriarch; near this Church is a large Cave cut out of the Rock, where are kept with great veneration, and even Heathen Sacrifices, some dead bodies they call Saints, and not dead Men, for they say, they rest there, and if any offer to lift the cloaths that cover them, to see what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Their errors in Faith are many, the chief, that they baptize without saying any thing, or if they do, use not the words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by the Church: In confession they use no form of absolution, others absolve without hearing the sins, giving unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pennances. They say God is like a Man, that the Divinity was born of the Blesied Virgin, that there is but one nature in Christ, that the Holy Ghost proceeds not from the Son, that there is no Purgatory, that the Souls are given by the Parents, not by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that till the Day of Judgment none goes to Heaven or Hell, even the Blessed Virgin. They Eat not Swines Flesh, Hare, Rabbet, or Eel; <hi>Saturday</hi> they keep better then <hi>Sunday,</hi> no Woman in the time of her courses enters the Church; nor 40 Days after she is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a Son, and 80 of a Daughter, nor those who have had carnal Copulation the Day they had it. If any one enters the Church when they are communicating, he must receive without confessing, though he be loaded with sin, they had no knowledge of the Sacrament of confirmation, nor extream unction. There is no punishment for errors in matters of Religion.</p>

                        <p>Of the Nature of the Country of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> of its Towns and the Kings it has had, and of the entrance and expulsion of our Doctrine.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. ALL this Country is divided by vast Mountains, so high, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as if they had been heaped one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of strange figures on which they build impregnable Castles; some are difficult of ascent, some almost, and others quite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be ascended; they are beautified with variety of Trees, and inhabited by a rebellious People, that have much of the nature of their habitation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their Cities and Towns are small, but the ruins of great ones are to be seen. In <hi>Accum</hi> they appear to have been very sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, for there are Obeliscks of black stone, some ruined, some standing, two whereof are above 40 Yards high. It is believed the Court of their Kings was there kept for some Ages after the famous Queen <hi>Saba.</hi> I will here give a particular account of the City <hi>Adem,</hi> though on the Coast of <hi>Arabia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was in a manner, and is the inlet into <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. About 30 Leagues from the mouth of the red Sea, a point of the Continent runs into the Sea, making a small <hi>Peninsula</hi> cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:54711:227"/>
with vast Hills and Rocks that do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the least Plant; on the top of one is a square Fort with Towers; thence runs down towards the Bar a wall with Bastions, the last of them at the foot of the Mountain. Hence the wall turns along the foot of the Hill, till it joins the lower Fort, making a sort of Circle. This work though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears formidable at Sea, can do no great harm to the Ships, byreason of its great height, to remedy which fault, there is a Plat-form raised near the Water. In all the works there are about 12 large, and 20 lesser pieces of Canon, and 600 Soldiers armed with good Firelocks, Swords without shells, Cimitars, and Tucks.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In a bottom at the foot of the wall and Mountain, lies the City, not the third part of what it has been, girt with a wall and Towers at convenient distances; it is divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather into lanes than streets, there are wells the Water whereof is brackish, but us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when Rain Water fails, the inhabitants are <hi>Arabs</hi> and strangers, Moors descended from those who were once masters of it, and Jews who are in all parts of the World and here live meanly.</p>

Provisions are brought from the inland on Camels; their Money pieces of Eight, and another of the same value called <hi>Cabres</hi> or <hi>Xamies.</hi> There are no Thieves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Locks to the Doors; their weapons Swords, Semiters, Poniards and Bucklers hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by straps about their Necks.

like a shirt down to the Ancles; the Poor a clout tyed about the waste, reaching half way down the thigh; the Gallants add a <hi>Fota</hi> or loose cloak hanging down, or under the Arm, only the <hi>Xarises</hi> wear Veils on their Heads. The Women use the same sort of shirt or cassack as the Men, except that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it reaches only to their Knees, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind sweeps the Streets with a train a Yard long.

                     <p>The <hi>Arabs</hi> easily took this Town from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and it might as easily be taken from them, if any would attempt it by way of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.

in receiving the true Catholick Doctrine; the chief cause hereof, is their great incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Judaism, as descended from <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Son. Therefore they so rigarously ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to Circumcision, that not only the Men but Women are Circumcised; they observe strictly the <hi>Saturday;</hi> they take the liberty of being divorced only for their pleasure, and have several Wives, without regarding whether they have been their own Father's Brother's, or other Mens. This obstinacy is not a little helped by the Pontifical Power usurped by their Emperor; and by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy they have, that the <hi>Franguis</hi> or <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans</hi> shall become Masters of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and they fear the Preaching the Faith may be an Introduction to it. They have also another Prophecy, that they, assisted by the <hi>Franguis,</hi> shall destroy the House of <hi>Meca,</hi> which they desire as much as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christians. But let this suffice for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. WE have already in the Eleventh Chapter of the First Part of this Tome spoke of the Situation, Extent, Names, and some other particulars of these Islands, which will be needless to repeat, and shall therefore proceed to what has not yet been related.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Country, though not void of large
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:54711:229"/>
Plains, is very mountainous, some so high they are much above the Clouds. Two are most remarkable; that of <hi>Fiyenoyama</hi> four Leagues from <hi>Miaco,</hi> and that of <hi>Letchu</hi> which continually casts out terrible Flames, and among them sometimes the Devil comes out to perswade the People to cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in there, affirming, it is the shortest cut to Heaven. About this Mountain are many Silver Mines: The Fields are water'd with many Rivers, which together with the Summer Rains and Winter Snow make them Fruitful, if the continual Wars did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Tillage, which is the Reason that Land is undeservedly accounted barren. It bears Rice and Wheat, of which they do not make Bread, but use it after their own manner, all sorts of Fruit usual among us, and many others, abundance of Wood both on the Hills and Plains. It is plentiful of all sorts of Cattle, and abundantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Fish. Their Water is thin, the Air wholesom; the Natives are generally long-liv'd, and vigorous to the last; they apply themselves to the use of Arms at 15 Years of Age, and give it not over till sixty.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Their Countenance is agreeable, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaped, generally large, and they value the greatest Bodies, very strong, and inured to Labour and Hardship: As soon as born they dip the Children in the Water to make them hardy, and as soon as grown to any strength the Boys hunt wild Beasts in the Woods. They are more ready at Handy-crafts than the <hi>Europeans,</hi> and their Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

more polished; this makes them the more tenacious of the Christian Faith, because they admit it not till sufficiently convinced.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Honour is no less Worshipped among them than their Idols, and they will endure any thing rather than abate in any point of it; this makes them very courteous, they show the same civility to Friends and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they never swear, Princes punish Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Masters Servants in such manner, as neither has cause to complain, all Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, though between near Relations, are composed by a third hand to avoid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimosities. To speak ill of the absent, is a Crime to them unknown; so is Play and Theft, and no less begging or borrowing. Poverty, nor any other Misfortune that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not of the Will, is not looked upon as disgraceful, for they will no way allow Honour to depend upon Fortune.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Withal there is no Faith among them, even between Father and Son, but it is a Disgrace for a Man to be open-hearted. Hence it proceeds they commonly Murder one another in their Embraces, Subjects do the same to their Princes, and Servants to Masters. Thus Rebels are caressed by their Sovereigns, for all their study is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency; Mothers instead of suckling stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle their Children; some kill themselves to save receiving an Affront; and the Sick have no Relief, for all fly from them, and when dead throw them like Beasts on a Dunghill. They are not only given to Women, but much more to Sodomy.</p>

6. If two happen to lie together, each lays his Head at the other's Feet. Neither Men nor Women wear any thing on their Heads, only the great Men when they travel go under an Umbrello; they mount on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back on our off-side. Instead of bowing when they meet, they draw back their Foot out of the slipper more or less; when the Inferior sees a Superior he sits down. They, value pretious Stones no more than Straws; any piece of Antiquity they esteem at extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Rates of what sort soever. The King of <hi>Bango</hi> gave 13000 Crowns for a Vessel among us not worth a Groat. They have the same value for any draught of a famous Master, or for a Blade of a Sword or Hanger.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Their Mourning is white, and their festival Apparel black, the same is used by the <hi>Chineses.</hi> The Men varnish their teeth, the Women their hair. Our Musick to them is ungrateful; they delight in those Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that make most noise: Their Fish they eat raw, and hate Milk or any thing made of it, calling it unconcocted Blood. Beef or Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton is never eaten but in the utmost Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as loathsom Vermin among us; the Wheat they make like the <hi>Italians</hi> into <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micheli,</hi> or <hi>Macaroli,</hi> and drink Water boil'd with the Herb <hi>Cha</hi> hot, sipping it; this I believe is our Tea. The Service of their Tables differs from ours; the Vessels are all of Gold or Porcelane, for the Silver is all coined into Money. Our sweetest Perfumes are loathsom to them. What would make
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:54711:230"/>
us sick is the Diet of their Sick, as Fish salt and raw, Limons and other acids. Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not used, for they say 'tis a madness to lavish the Treasure of Life, so they call the Blood. Their Purges are sweet and pleasant, the others, they say, and with reason, do but heap misery on the Patient.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Though there are many Kingdoms, the Language is the same; but so various, it sounds like many; for they have great variety of Words upon all Occasions: those that are used in serious Discourse serve not to jest, those that are for great Men are not for the meaner, those for the old are not for the young, the same are not for Men as for Women. In Writing they have fourteen different sorts of Characters, all varying not only in form but signification. The Gentry learn to read and write till twelve Years of Age in the Monasteries of the <hi>Bonços.</hi> There is one sort of Character to write to Princes, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Nobles, another to the meaner sort, and another for Books, of which they have great plenty in Prose and Rhime very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and ingenious: Every Character is a Word. Some of our People that understand the Language of <hi>Iapan</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> avouch the former to be much more copious, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, soft, and compleat in all particulars.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. All their Buildings, because of the Earthquakes the Island is subject to, are of Wood, but of such Structure, they are no way inferior to the finest in the World. They are whitened with a Plaster made of shells of Fish, which preserves the Wood

from the Weather, and makes the Cities appear most beautiful at a distance. The Tiling is black and of such a nature it will last Five hundred Years. The Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity within it not to be parallelled. Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not used, but all the Walls curiously painted with Landskips or Histories of their Ancestors. The floors are covered with fine Mats, and such as go on them wash their Feet first. There are no Chairs nor Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steads. On the Beds there are few Cloaths but what they wear by day, but some have coverings of the same Straw as the Mats wrought with Gold.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Poor eat as they can, but always with decency; the Rich with such state of Servants, Musick, Plays, and variety of Dishes, that a whole night is spent in a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. They use as many Tables as Dishes, about a span and half high, because they sit on the ground, each Table about half a yard square curiously wrought of Cedar inlaid with Gold and several Colours. There are no Napkins nor Table-cloaths, because they never touch any thing, but feed themselves with little Cipress sticks so artificially that never any thing drops. The Meat is heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Dishes like Pyramids strewed with Gold, the Fowl whole, the Beaks and Talo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They take many Wives, and are easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced, yet Adultery is a capital Crime, and the Woman's Relations resent it as hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously as the Husband. The Children are bred as has been said, and at Fifteen have their Sword put on by the <hi>Bonzos</hi> with much Ceremony. Every Man is so absolute over his Children and Servants, he may punish and kill them without being liable to any penalty for it.</p>

Their Lances are longer and lighter, their Musquets and other Arms perfectly good, as is their Powder, their Horse Furniture curious beyond expression.

When they are grown in Years, and have Sons of the Age of Eighteen, they give their Estates to them, reserving only some small thing to live upon, and this they do not for love, but to prevent being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out and dispossessed by them.

There are also Monasteries of Women, whom they call <hi>Biconies,</hi> who also profess Chastity, and observe it as ill as the Men. It is wonderful that though both of them be extravagantly Debauched, Proud, Covetous and Cruel, yet on account of their Profession they are held in great Veneration. They had once an infinite number of stately Temples, and even at the time St. <hi>Francis Xaverius</hi> went thither, he found Five hundred that had escaped the Fury of their Wars. In one of these is that prodigious Altar on which stand Fifteen hundred Idols of the common Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Man, all gilt and orderly placed in nine rows round a principal one, to whom they seem to make their Court. Every one of these has three Heads and above forty Arms, which the <hi>Bonços</hi> say represent the Power of their Deities.

                     <p n="1">1. THis vast Empire is divided into two parts, the Northern, and the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, and they into 15 Provinces. To the Southern part belong 9, which are <hi>Quantung, Quansi, Yunnan, Fokien, Kiangsi, Suchuen, Huquang, Chekiang,</hi> and <hi>Nanking. Quantung</hi> is the most Southerly, and lies between 20 and 25 deg. of lat. it is large and Rich, and abounds in Wheat and Rice, of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though differing in kind, the Earth gives two crops a Year.

                        </gap>, all which are wrought with great perfection, as also the works of <hi>Charam</hi> and gildings brought to us. The People are very ingenious at handicrafts, easily imitate what they see, but are not good at invention. Our Merchants repair twice a Year to the Capital City <hi>Quangcheu,</hi>
                        <pb n="454" facs="tcp:54711:238"/>
75 Leagues distant from <hi>Macao,</hi> and <hi>Macao</hi> is 18 from the Islands, and is about 5 Leagues in circumference. This is the most frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Port of the whole Kingdom. The <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugues</hi> alone export hence Yearly, 53000 Chests of Silks, 22000 bars of Gold, each weighing 12 Ounces, 7 Picos of Musk, which is 8 Hundred and three quarters. Pearl, Sugar, Porcelane, <hi>China</hi> wood, Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb. and other lesser commodities in vast quantity. The Island <hi>Haynan</hi> belongs to this Province, about it is a great Fishery of Pearl, it is well Peopled on the Northern Coast, on the Southern is a Town that owns no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to any body. It produces several sorts of precious Wood.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. On the N. E. side of <hi>Quantung</hi> lies the Province of <hi>Quang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That of <hi>Yunnan</hi> to the Eastward in the same lat. is the farthest from the Center of <hi>China,</hi> 'tis large but not rich, its principal Commodity being Amber for Beads, and such uses. Here contrary to the custom of all the rest of the Kingdom, the Women go abroad to buy and sell. On the other side of <hi>Quantung</hi> to the E. N. E. is the Province of <hi>Fokien</hi> between 24 and 28 deg. of lat, it is for the most part Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; the Natives contrary to the general Law, travel and trade abroad: It yields Gold, Sugar, Hemp, and Paper of several so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

hereafter, it is not done with loose letters as among us, but cut in Wood, so that the Original remains; there are an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Printing Houses, every one may Print what he pleases without a Licence, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this liberty, they never publish any scandalous or immodest Book. This Province lies on the Sea, and thence are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported infinite quantities of Merchandize for <hi>Manila, Iapan,</hi> and the Island <hi>Formosa,</hi> which is in sight; the Dutch trade here.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Province of <hi>Kiangsi</hi> lies North of <hi>Quantung,</hi> between 25 and 30 deg. of lat. It is hemm'd in with great Mountains, from which fall two Rivers, one running to the Southward, all the way Navigable; another to the Northward, which after running through great part of this Province, receives another great one coming from the Province of <hi>Huquang,</hi> and is the famous <hi>Kiang.</hi> The feet of these Mountains are adorn'd with good Cities at convenient distances for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and carrying of goods, which are generally on Men's backs, and the concourse is incredible; the Innkeepers give an account of all that comes in to their Houses, and are obliged to give two Meals to all such Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, having other ways to be payed; every Man carries his own Bed, for the lodgings find nothing but bedsteads. In the Custom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, which is here very great, they do not visit the goods, but take everyMans word, and the Duties are very easy; a traveller that is no Merchant, is Custom-free; the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that come to <hi>Macao,</hi> pay according to
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:54711:239"/>
the Tunnage of their Vessels without search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This Province is so populous they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal it <hi>Laocha,</hi> that is little Mice, because they spread all over the Kingdom, serving all sorts of Trades, particularly Taylors; they are very Poor; the Province has abundance of Rice and Fish; it is famous for large Soles, but more for Porcelane. The Clay 'tis made of, is only found in one Village, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place the Water to work it, for if they use any other, it proves not so good. In this work there is none of the mystery gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally represented to us, it is meer Clay, but of a most rare quality; it is wrought after the same manner, as ours, in the same time, and of all colours. This Province <hi>Fokien</hi> and <hi>Quantung</hi> meet in an Angle formed of many Mountains, among which is a small Kingdom, the King whereof owes no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him of <hi>China;</hi> they allow the use of Phisitians in sickness, but of no Lawyers in their suits. If any scarcity happen, they go a Robbing in the nature of open War.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Province of <hi>Suchuen</hi> is much in the same Latitude, and has nothing singular; that of <hi>Huquang</hi> is in the same lat. more plentiful of Rice than any; has much Oyl, and Fish in its great Rivers, and Lakes like Seas. The Province <hi>Chekiang</hi> lies between 27 and 32 deg. upon the Sea, is plain and fruitful, and watered with many Rivers, some whereof run through the Towns; it is much Richer than the others, particularly in Silk, which is exported only from thence. <hi>Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheu</hi>
                        <pb n="457" facs="tcp:54711:239"/>
is the Metropolis, the most populous of <hi>China,</hi> so delicious and pleasant, that it is a Proverb, <hi>Glory in Heaven, and</hi> Hangcheu <hi>on Earth.</hi> Three things make it most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, the Lake called the rarest in the World, about two Leagues in compass, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set round with curious Pallaces, and they with delightful Hills, the Water runs in at one end, and out at the other, across it are set Dogs of Stone for People to go over upon, many Vessels ply about it, some very large, being built for pleasure and feasting, with Kitchins fore and aft, in the Midship rooms with Tables, above floors for Women, the windows covered with close nets, that they may not be seen, all painted and gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the abundance of Meat in them is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, in these many spend what they have. The second thing famous, is the Silk, and man ner of working it; the third, the worship of their Idols, and magnificence of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The last of these 9 Southern Provinces is <hi>Nanking,</hi> between 29 and 36 deg. of lat. the best in the whole Kingdom. It permits no Foreign Trade, the Merchants, to enhance the value of their goods, say, they are of <hi>Nanking;</hi> in only the Town of <hi>Xanham,</hi> 'tis said, there are 200000 loomes for Cotton, which yearly yield the King 450000 Ducats. The Court long resided here, and all the tribunals and priviledges of a Court still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the capital City called (as my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will have it,) <hi>Ymthienfu,</hi> but I find it is
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:54711:240"/>
by all others named <hi>Kiangning.</hi> This City is the best in the Kingdom for sumptuous build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, spacious streets, trade, and abundance of all things; it has twelve stately Gates well defended with Canon, without the walls runs another, at a great distance much ruined; the outward circumference will take up a Horseman two Days journey, travelling a good pace, the inward is 6 Leagues; between the two walls are buildings and tillage, the crop whereof is appropriate to the Souldiery that reside within, to the number of 40000 In one quarter of the Town is a Mount and thereon a sphear of a vast bigness, of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous workmanship, but stands not on a frame; there is also a rare Tower 7 stories high with all appurtenances made of Porcelane, a most wonderful work. The River runs by the foot of it, called according to my Author <hi>Yamcuquiam,</hi> by all others I find it named <hi>Kiang;</hi> but <hi>Yamcuquiam</hi> signifies Son of the Sea, because it is one of the greatest in the World, and may perhaps for brevity generally be called <hi>Quiam</hi> or <hi>Kiang;</hi> it has great store of Fish.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Northern Provinces are 6, their names <hi>Honan, Xensi, Xansi, Xantung, Peking,</hi> and <hi>Leav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ung.</hi> The first lies between 33 and 37 deg. of lat. and produces the most delicious fruit, which is prodigiously cheap, so that One hundred of Apricocks is worth about half a Farthing. A Prince lives here in as great state as the King.</p>

                        <pb n="459" facs="tcp:54711:240"/>
8. The Province <hi>Xensi</hi> lies to the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the last in near the same Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; it is large but dry, as the three next to it; bears little Rice, much Barley, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat. Their Sheep are shorn three times a Year, Spring, Summer and Autum, but the first shearing is the best. The Wool serves for Hats and such like work, but is not fit to spin. The Goat's Hair is spun, and of it they weave Stuffs richer than of Silk, but it is only of a sort of Down that grows next the Skin under the long Hair. This Province yields Musk, which grows in the Navel of a Beast like a little Deer, the Flesh whereof is eaten. The Purses brought hither are not all the same in which it grows, because the Musk mixed with other Drugs is too much to be contained by them only, and so Purses are made for it of the Skin. Scarce any Musk comes over pure. Here is also some Gold gathered, but in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, for the Mines of it and Silver are not open. Most of the Rhubarb in the World seems to come from hence; for that which is brought from <hi>Persia</hi> cannot be of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ct of that Country, because none that have travelled there relate they ever saw this Herb grow there. It grows high and bears Leaves bigger than those of Cabbage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much care, and grows not wild, as some would have it.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. This is a Province of great Trade, for the numerous Caravans, some of above One thousand Men, which repair to its two We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Cities, <hi>Socheu</hi> and <hi>Xancheu.</hi> In them
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:54711:241"/>
come Ambassadors from the Mahometan Princes to the King of <hi>China,</hi> every three Years is an ordinary Embassy, and every fifth one extraordinary, they always bring Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents. The Princes are, the <hi>Turk,</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabs, Camul, Samar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Present consists of a quantity of precious Stones, Three hundred and forty Horses, Three hundred small Sparks of Diamonds, some sine Blew, Six hundred Knives, and as many Files. The King returns for each Horse two pieces of Cloath of Gold; Thirty of yellow Silk, Thirty Pounds of <hi>Cha,</hi> Ten of Musk, Fifty of a Medicine called <hi>Tienyo,</hi> and Fifty of Silver.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Cha</hi> (which I suppose to be our <hi>Tea)</hi> is the Leaf of a Tree like Myrtle, in some places bigger than others, they dry it in Iron Pots over the Fire, and so it runs up together. There is of it from a Ducat the Pound to less than a Halfpenny, such is its variety. It is their common drink steeped in hot Water, with it they treat Strangers, and relate many Virtues of it.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Province of <hi>Xansi</hi> lies between 36 and 42 deg. of Lat. the many Mountains make it barren, therefore bears little Wheat, less Rice, and most of <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat; it supplies the Kingdom with Resins. Here are Wells of Fire for the use of Houses, like those of Water in other Parts. They
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:54711:241"/>
make small Mouths, and over them boil any thing. They have Coal-Pits as in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> The Province of <hi>Xantung</hi> lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 35 and 38 deg. of Lat. it is poor, subject to Locusts, and often to Famine. It bears a sort of Apples which is carried over most of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Province of <hi>Peking</hi> between 36 and 42 degrees of Latitude, is now ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the Court in the City of the same name, but more properly <hi>Xunt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Land dry and healthy, but barren; yields <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, but little Rice or Wheat. The Rice used at Court comes from <hi>Nanking,</hi> it is pleasant only boiled in Water without any other Addition. The King keeps One thousand Sail that trade to the South for Provisions. This Province sends abroad no Commodities but Pensils and Persumes. The City is not so large as <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> but far exceeds it in populousness: The Walls are so thick, twelve Horsemen ride abreast on them; they are guarded with as much care in Peace as War. At the Gates are Officers to receive the Duty of all things brought in, and that belongs to the Queen.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Magistrates of this City have but very little State in their Persons and Houses, only the chief of them can go in Chairs, the others on Horseback. All Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have their Faces covered along the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:54711:242"/>
Streets to avoid the Dust, but more to save the Ceremonies to <hi>Mandarines.</hi> The Cold is more violent here than could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Latitude. The River and Lakes are froze over, so that they bear. They use a sort of Stoves that conveys the heat underneath which serve in their Gardens, and anticipate the Spring.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The last Northern Province is <hi>Leao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tung,</hi> famous for a precious Medicinal Root it produces, which adds strength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to such as are in Health, and gives great comfort to the Sick. This being the <hi>Tartar</hi> Frontier, is much ruined, and in part possessed by them. Along it runs that so famous Wall for the space of Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leagues, of great Renown, but little use; for notwithstanding it the Enemy breaks in at pleasure. In all these Provinces there are Four hundred forty four Cities, and Eleven hundred and fifty Towns of Note; the others are not to be numbred.

                     <p n="1">1. THE People of <hi>China</hi> are white, the more Northward the whiter; both Men and Women suffer their Hair to grow to its full length; it is generally black, and they therefore called by some Nations, The black haired People. Their Eyes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly black and small, their Noses little, they look upon ours as deformed, their Beards thin, the black esteemed most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; it is never cut, but they had rather it should all fall off than one hair of the head. They take great pains in dressing it, and have many Barbers who never cut but only serve to order it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are handsomest whilst very young, particularly in the South. The Women of <hi>

                        </hi> are counted the most beautiful, thence the great Men have their Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines. The Men, as they grow above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five Years of Age loose their Colour, but not so much of their Features, yet grow ugly; they are well made, strong, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Labour. In Tillage they are very industrious, sometimes plowing with a Plow of three Coulters that makes as many Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and on it carry a Tray with a hole, through which Kidneys-Beans drop, and the Ground is sowed at once; other Grain
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:54711:243"/>
is sowed after Plowing. Often he that drives a Beast loaded carries a burden.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Nothing that can be of use is lost. There are often seen many Vessels loaden with only w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>s for Candles taken out of the heart of a Rush. Others that carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Paper for Privies, which must have no Letter upon it, esteeming it a Sacriledge to put any such to that use. They are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Merchants. About the Street is fold by Retail, whatever is by Wholesail in Shops. Children sell small things that no Age may be idle. In matters of trust they are most faithful, but in selling the cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of Cheats. They will dig out the Flesh of a Fowl, make it up again, and fell the Skin and Bones as an entire Bird; they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Gammons of Bacon, so that it is hard to discover the Fraud. In fatning, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring and patching up of old, lame and unsound Horses, none equal them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They are much addicted to Chimistry, and believe he that finds the way to make Silver, has a sure Receipt for to live long. Old Men they think have found out this Receipt, and therefore some will maintain them only in hopes to learn it, and others make themselves gray only to get a mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that way.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They are affable and courteous, treat Strangers with Civility, give them the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-hand, lend them Money upon Pawns, but without Use, though they exact it from their own Kindred and Friends, even in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; where the Scum of Nations is, they
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:54711:243"/>
shew Compassion towards them. All that are condemned to Death are beheaded, or strangled, any other Death is accounted Cruel; when many are condemned, only four or five die, the rest remain in Prison. Humility and Chastity are Virtues held in great account.

They lessen themselves to extol Foreigners, and commend all the Works of <hi>Europe,</hi> even to undervaluing their own. Their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Workmanship may be seen by what comes from thence, which is never the best or curiousest. They are incomparable at working of Ivory, Ebony, Coral, and Amber, and most exquisite in Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. A gold Chain of their making has been seen that had Three hundred Links, and did not weigh seven Ounces, their Gold thread is not so fine as ours.

A Visitor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral being long in a Province without exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his Employ, a Friend of his enquiring into the Reason, found he had lost the Seal,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:54711:244"/>
without which no Business could be dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, knowing the Governor was his Enemy, he advised him to set Fire to his own Palace at Night, and when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor came, as of course he must, to see it put out, then to deliver to him the Box in which the Seal is kept, saying, He could in that danger only trust him with the Royal Seal: That if it was the Governor who had caused the Seal to be stole, he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly restore it, because of the trust reposed in him, which if he did not, the World would believe it was lost in his Custody; this was put in Execution, and next day the Governor restored the Box with the Seal in it.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Their Cloaths, as was before said, are made of Woollen, Linnen, Silk, or Cotton. Two hundred Years before Christ they wore short Sleeves (as the <hi>Iapans</hi> descended from them still do) and the fashion lasted while the famous Family of <hi>Honan,</hi> for Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, then it was altered to what is used to this Day, is the same throughout the Kingdom, and cannot be changed without the King's leave. The Habit reaches from the Neck to the feet open before, even to the inward Garments without Buttons; but folding over, the Sleeves large and open like those of a Monk's Cool. For a Band they wear a piece of white Taffety a handful broad, which the better sort as soon as soiled throw away.

After that Age it is put into a Net of Horsehair with a Cap over it; that of the Lawyers square, the others round; it is made either of Silk or Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair, but in Winter of Felt. Much Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is used at the time they first put on the Net. The Rich wear Shoes of Silk, the Poor of Cotton, differing from ours in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion and costly; Leather is only used for Boots, which are rare. In the same manner the Rich wear Stockins of Damask, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther soft Silk, the meaner Sort of Cotton, but all white. Breeches are common to Men and Women. The latter dress their Hair with Flowers, natural or artificial, except the common Women, who are not allowed to use them, nor to live within the Walls.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Apparel of Men and Women is the same in all other Points; but these have Feet less than can be imagined, and to make them so, they swath them hard from their Infancy. The Custom was taken from a Queen, who having deformed Feet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by that means to bring them into shape.</p>

If they happen to go a foot on account of any Pilgrimage, they cover their Faces: If they travel in Boats, they pass by each other, without speaking one word.

It is called <hi>Quenhra,</hi> or the Language of <hi>Mandarines,</hi> because as they spread their Command they introduced it, and it is used through all the Empire, as Latin in <hi>Europe.</hi> It is very barren, and as it has more Letters far than any other, so it has fewer Words, for there are not above 326 that absolutely differ, and of those that only vary in accent and aspiration 1228; most end in Vowels, the rest in <hi>M</hi> and <hi>N:</hi> They are all Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syllables, all indeclinable, as well Verbs as Nouns; so contrived, that often a Noun serves for a Verb, and the contrary, and sometimes for an Adverb. Thus it is easier to be learned than Latin. It is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious, and therefore the most grateful to the <hi>Chineses.</hi> It is rather sweet than harsh, and spoke as they do at <hi>Nanking</hi> pleasing to the Ear, very full of respectful Terms. To bid one take a thing in his hand, among us we repeat the Verb take, which they do not, each word signifies the Verb and Manner, <hi>Nien,</hi> is to take with two Fingers; <hi>Tço,</hi> to

The Author of them (they say) was <hi>Fohi,</hi> one of their first Kings; at first they were fewer in number, plainer, and in some measure like what they expressed: There are now four sorts of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The ancient still used in Books and by Lawyers, but only for Titles and Seals instead or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="14">14. There are Sixty thousand Letters; But they use Abbreviations, so that 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know Ten thousand to write, read and be learned. If they meet any that is not known, they turn to a Book like our Dictionary, and find it: Only nine strokes serves to form all this multitude of Letters, but several Letters and perfect Figures are joined to signifie different things. This stroke —stands for one, crossed with another stroke it stands for ten, another stroke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn under the lower point it signifies the Earth; with another at the top, a King; adding a prick on the left hand between the two first points, a precious Stone; with Dashes before, a Pearl; and all Letters that

signifie precious Stones, must have this last mark; all that signifie Trees must have the Letter that is for Wood adjoined, and so of other things.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Good Writing is valued above the best Painting. All written Paper is looked upon as Sacred; if it lies on the Ground they take it up carefully. The manner of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is downwards from the top to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and from the Right towards the Left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and all the People of the <hi>East.</hi> If a word of Respect, as your Lordship, or the like, fall in the middle of a Line, they write not forward, but begin the next Line, because it is not esteemed Manners to join any word to those; if they write the Name of God, it is set above the rest of the Line.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. They once writ on the Rine of the Barks of Trees, with Iron points, as also on Plates of Metal, which now are highly esteemed. Paper has been invented among them Two thousand Years, and is of so many sorts, and so plentiful, that there is as much in <hi>China</hi> as all the World besides, for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness none to compare to it. The most usual in Printing, and plentifullest, is made of a Tree (called by them <hi>Cho,</hi> by the <hi>Indians Bombo)</hi> made in the same manner as ours, but the best is of Cotton Rags. Instead of Pens they use Pensils of several sorts of Hair, but the Hares is best: There are no Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns but Stones on which the Ink is ground, as Colours among us; it is also sold in Rags in the nature as we have Spanish Wool, but
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:54711:246"/>
the best is Lamp-black, and they that make it are not accounted Mechanicks.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Printing has been used by them Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Years, we said before it was all carved on Wood. The Author writes his Book in the size it must be published, and every Leaf is pasted on a Board, and graved exactly as he writ it, therefore they write and print only upon one side of the Paper, so that every Leaf consists of two, for the Books are sewed along the edges of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, not the middle as we do, the Blanks remain within, and the two Leaves pass as one; the best Wood for this use is Pear-tree. When they would have the Paper black and Letters white, they are carved in Stone, because in the Stone the Letters are cut into the Superficies, and in Wood they make the Superficies. That manner of Printing is only used for Epitaphs, Paintings, Trees, Mountains, and such like things, which are preserved with respect, and are lasting Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials.</p>

FRom their Childhood they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to study, the first Books they read are Morals, then the classick Authors which are entirely learned by Heart, next the Masters exposition, who looks not on the Book when he teaches. The Coppies for writing are laid under the Paper, and the learner draws by it, the Paper being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent. From letters they proceed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, such as are approved of are Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every 3 Years, and learners study them. There are no Universities, every Master reaches all that is requisite for a man to know, as well in learning, as manners and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. The Disciples of quality never go any where without the Master; there are many Schools for the common sort, but no Master can take more Schollars than he can teach himself, for he is not to trust to another. Their Days of recreation are the first 15 in the Year; and some others, but few in the 5th and 7th Moon. The Masters that serve in great Houses Eat at their patrons Table.</p>

of Provinces, where they take their Degrees. These buildings for the most part are all of the same form, some bigger than others, but all large; the greatest of our Pallaces is not equal to the least of them, in every one is an infinite number of little rooms, where such as are to be examined, compose each by himself, with a Soldier to attend him, that the more learned may not help the ignorant.

Out of the 350 are chosen 25, who have Pallaces assigned them, and are subject to the <hi>Colao</hi> that is president of the great College, of him they learn the speculative part of Government.

Servants in great Houses do not bow to their Lords, but at the new Year, or when he has been absent, their sign of respect is to stand upright with their Arms hanging down; Mandarines servants speak to them on their knees, to give or receive any thing with one hand is not courteous betwixt equals, and very rude from inferors to superiors.</p>

When any one is to absent himself for a time, all friends visit and present him, and he is bound at his return to send presents to all that sent him any; they never visit the Sick, but inquire at the Door of their Health; the Person visited sets the Chairs himself, and wipes them with his sleeve, all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siters do the same with his. If there be no distinction of superiority, they take their places according to Age, the Person visited the last; as soon as seated, the <hi>Cha</hi> is brought

and they all Drink. When one speaks of himself, it is with great humility, if they speak of the Son to the Father, they do not say your Son, but the Noble Son; if of the Daughter, the pretious Love; if they inquire about the Sick, they say, How goes the illustrious Sickness; speaking of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they do not say, I, but the Schollar, the Disciple, and Persons of mean profession, as a Carryer, they call The great Rod; the Person visited waits upon the visiter to the street, and they part with impertinent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, then send Messages to and fro, as if they had not seen one another.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. They often send presents of Shooes, Stockins, Linnen, Porcelane, Ink, Pencils, and Eatable things of the best. With the present goes a <hi>Thie,</hi> being a list of the things sent; it is no ill manners to send back all or part; some only send the list of things they design to present, naming very many, as knowing all will not be accepted, and he it is sent to, marks down what he will accept of, others send all the things which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hired, and so restore what is sent back and pay for the rest; he that receives is obliged to return a present.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. They cannot marry into the Fathers kindred, though many degrees removed, nor with any of the sirname, for fear of
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:54711:252"/>
kindred, but may with the Mothers, if not near related. Maids seldom marry with Widdowers; there are Matchmakers: The Bridegroom sees not the Bride till she is brought home to him, nor knows her name till made sure; Portions are not used, nor does the Husband buy the Wife, as has been falsly reported of them. On the Wedding Day the Brides goods are carryed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and she at the end of it in a Chair, lock'd up, and the key sent before to the Bridegrooms Mother, for he goes on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back well attended to fetch her, if by Night, they carry many Lantherns on long Poles, the Inheritance is divided between the Male issue without respect to those by the lawful Wife above the others, yet there are some noble Families where the eldest inherits.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Funerals of the <hi>Chineses</hi> are very costly, they bury all in Coffins, according to every ones ability in value, some cost 1000 Ducats, the Coffins are made of thick planks, varnished with <hi>Charam,</hi> and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with gilding, unless some that are made of pretious Wood; most of them keep their Coffins by them in the House.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. No body is buryed within the Cities; without there are sumptuous Templ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> for their use, with Country Houses about them in places appointed by their Astrologers, the Tombs are covered with polished Stones, and Beasts carved before them, especially the noble ones, as Elephants and Lions, and elegant Epitaphs upon them. Where ever a Man dies, he must be carryed to his own
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:54711:252"/>
place of burial: When one is given over, they carry him into an outward room to die on a pallet Bed, but some that are of great quality die in their Alcoves. The Son as raving with grief, pulls down the curtains upon the Dead body, then it is put into the Coffin with the robes of his dignity, and so closed, that no ill smell can come out. It is laid in a great room hung with Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a Picture of the Dead Man, the Children sit round upon the straw and in Mourning, the Women are weeping behind Curtains, many Ceremonies are used while the Corps lies there.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Coffin lies sometimes 2 Years in the House for want of Money; the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pomp is thus, First, there are carryed great statues of Men and Beasts made of painted Pastboard, Pyramids, and other things in triumphal Chariots, adorned and curiously wrought with Silk; if it be a Person of Quality, all those things are burnt when the Coffin is interred, but the common sort only hire them; after this sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Bonzos</hi> singing and playing on Musick, then other <hi>Bonzos</hi> who never cut Hair nor beard, and live single in communities; these also play on several sorts of Instruments, next another sect of <hi>Bonzos,</hi> who cut their Hair, praying; after them the friends and relations, then Sons and Grandsons in deep Mourning, and barefooted, with little Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons about half a yard long in their hands, on which they lean so, that their Heads hang down near the ground; next them
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:54711:253"/>
comes the Coffin on a thing so big, it is carryed by 50 Men, with a curious Pall over it, and about it many Lanthorns on Poles; the last is a multitude of Women in Chairs, who are heard to cry.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Mourning is of such course Hemp, it makes the Men look monstrous, Sons for their Fathers wear it 3 Years, and in all that time sit not on Chairs, but little wooden stools, nor dine on a Table, touch Flesh, drink Wine, lie on Bedsteads, go to Feasts, go abroad unless in a close Chair, go to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, nor can officiate any publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, and finally (they say) they abstain from Women; Mourning for a Wife lasts a Year, there are for relations of 5 and of 3 Months, and for friends of 3 Days. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Town has a publick place of buryal for the Poor, some save the trouble, burning the Dead and burying the Ashes; these in the Province of <hi>Suchue</hi> are put into pots close stopped and thrown into Rivers.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Funeral of the Queen Mother in the Year 1614, was very magnificent; to omit the Mourning and lesser circumstances. The King with his own hand strewed on the body, Pearls to the value of 70000 Crowns, and laid on the sides of it 50 bars of Gold, and 50 of Silver; all Persons of quality of both Sexes came to worship her; all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates were ordered to their Tribunals, and to fast 3 Days; the Officers of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue to provide wax perfumes, Images and and other necessaries to be burnt, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in only these small things amounted to
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:54711:253"/>
30000 Ducats; the Royal Golledge was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to write Poems fit for that occasion, 1000 Men were posted at each of the nine Gates of the City, thence to the place of buryal, which was 12 miles, a lane of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to be made, 3000 men carryed the Coffin, 1000 accompanyed it, 40000 guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the buryal place, while the Ceremony lasted, the ways were repaired and railed in, that no body might cross them; at every 20 paces was laid a basket of yellow Earth to be spread about when the Coffin went by; many Tents were set up to rest by the way, and provisions for all that attendance that, amounted to 80000.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. After many Ceremonies, the Coffin was placed on a Triumphal Chariot with many lights and perfumes; the King accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed it to the 8th Gate of the Pallace, great was the order and silence observed, the journey was so Ceremonious, it lasted 3 Days. At last the Coffin was removed to a more costly Chariot, they sacrificed a Bull, Aromatick Wine, Perfumes, and many Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Earth, imploring its tutelar Spirits to receive the dead body graciously. The Ceremonies lasted long, the King fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured all that assisted at them, eased the Kingdom of Taxes, set open the prisons, all as an Oblation of filial Love.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>Chineses</hi> follow 3 sects which they endeavour to reconcile; the 2 first natural, the third Idolatrous. The first of the 2 fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Lawyers is Antient, adores no Idols, ownes a superior Power, that can pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:54711:254"/>
and reward, but allows it no Temples, Sacrifice, Prayers, or Ministers, speak ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably of it as of a Divine Being, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute nothing indecent to it, but being blind in their Faith, worship Heaven, Earth, and Man. Only in the two Coorts, there are Temples dedicated to Heaven and Earth, where the King in Person sacrifices, and in his absence the Masters of the Rites; in all Cities there are Temples of the tutelar Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, where the <hi>Mandarines</hi> sacrifice, as they do to the Spirits of Rivers, Mountains, and 4 parts of the World. There are also Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of famous Men, and publick benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in which are their Images; they ask nothing for the next life, but happiness in this, in fine, all tends to the Government, Concord Plenty, and Exercise of Virtue.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The second Sect is of the <hi>Tauçus,</hi> the Author of it <hi>Lautu,</hi> a Philosopher who they say was 80 Years in his Mothers Womb, and lived in the time of <hi>Comfufius;</hi> this Sect has many followers, who live together, do not marry, let their Hair grow, wear ordinary Cloaths, only instead of a Cap they wear a small Crown which holds the knot of their Hair at the top. They own one great God, and others lesser but all Corporeal, allow of Heaven and Hell, the Felicity with the body, and even in this World; they feign, that through certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cercises, Men become young again; they say and believe any thing that comes into their fancy, they have Musick and good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, and are therefore called to Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:54711:254"/>
and Sacrifices; they pretend to Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and promise Rain, which always fails to their shame.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. They also pretend to lay Devils that haunt Houses, and are as successful as in the other; their chief study is a quiet and long Life, but more for the long, which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to purchase at any rate.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The third Sect, (as its Author) is called <hi>Xaca,</hi> he is said to be son of <hi>Maga,</hi> and a dream, for that she dreamed she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived looking upon a white Elephant, was delivered of him through her side, and died immediatly. <hi>Xaca</hi> did pennance for this misfortune on the snowy Mountain, and had there in 12 Years 4 Masters, became learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Science of the first causes, and had many Disciples who spread his Sect through all <hi>Asia.</hi> This Doctrine was brought into <hi>China</hi> about the Year of Grace 63, at the instance of the Emperor <hi>Hamin;</hi> the followers of this Opinion once amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to three Millions, now they are but few.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Their Priests wear neither Hair nor beard, adore Idols; believe there is Reward and punishment in the next Life, and live in community 500 together; they are called to Sacrifices and Burials, and wear a sort of Copes, Eat no Flesh, Fish, Eggs, nor drink Wine, have large inclosures in Villages, and live under a superior; others live in Caves, Dens, and on Rocks, some do most rigid pennance. Some lock themselves in nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Houses, or rather boxes of Wood
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:54711:255"/>
full of spikes, the points inward, and live in these a Month without being able to lean for the spikes, or Eating; only Drinking <hi>Cha.</hi> But others affirm, they go in provided with lumps of Beef hard baked, which they dissolve in that hot liquor, there is another sort called Vagabonds, that are generally villanous fellows, guilty of all crimes espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Robberies. There are also Nuns of these Orders, their Heads shorn, they are but few, and not enclosed.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. They believe the transmigration of Souls, that they descend and pass through nine Hells, then return to be Men at best, or else beasts like Men, or, what is worst of all Birds. The wisest of them direct all their study toward the <hi>Prima causa;</hi> after the last death, they believe there is neither reward nor punishment.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Of Transmigration, they believe if a Man was courteous, he becomes Man again, if subject to passion, a Lion; if cruel a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; if unchast, a Hog; and if given to steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Bird of Prey. From these proceed many other Sects; it is a Proverb of these three Sects, that the Lawyers govern the Kingdom, the <hi>Taucus,</hi> the Body, and the <hi>Bonzot</hi> the Heart.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. In their Sacrifices are offered a beast like a Goat, Swine, Oxen, Cocks and Hens, all sorts of Fish, chiefly the Barble, Rice, Grain, and Wine. If the King sacrifice, the offering is divided among <hi>Mandarines,</hi> if great Men, among their Relations, if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary People, they Eat it among them.
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:54711:255"/>
All other things offered are burnt, as Silk, leaves of Gold and Silver, cut Paper, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, Perfumes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there are no Priests ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this, every one does it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The <hi>Chineses</hi> are great admirers of virtue, and have a sort of Commandments written in their Houses, much of the same nature as ours. There are strangers in <hi>China,</hi> who differ in point of belief, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable. We have already mentioned those barbarous Inhabitants of a part of the Island <hi>Hainan,</hi> and others in the Mountains of <hi>Quantung, Hucheu,</hi> and <hi>Quiangsi,</hi> these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Opinions of the rest of the Kingdom.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Original of the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> the Pallace and Government of it.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THere is no certain account of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of this Kingdom, though their Histories begin at the Universal flood. The first three Kings are esteemed Saints; since that time the succession has been in 22 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; this now reigning, has continued 300 Years; the first of it did all that was possible to secure his line; he abolished all Royalties, forbid under severe Penalties, any of the blood Royal to have any hand in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and gave all the power to Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers who were to attain it by learning and virtue; the Monarchy continues as he left it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They reckon Years from the beginning of the last Reign, the first actions of it are coining of Money, Crowning of the Queen, giving her and the Concubines names, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Sacrifices, giving Alms, treating Magistrates, setting open Prisons, turning the Ladies out of the Court, taking in new ones; all the states acknowledging the King, giving him a new name. He is stiled Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, the Courtiers call him Son of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and pay him a respect more than Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The reason the Ladies are turned out of Court is because many are old, and
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:54711:256"/>
the deceased may have had to do with the young, and therefore the successor must not venture coming where he has been; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Maids are sought for this purpose all over the Kingdom, and the Fathers strive to marry them off, that they may not be carryed to Court.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Women turned out, are all sold at the Pallace Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> to the best bidders, who take them for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; none but mean People buy them, their Faces and hands are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the buyer sees them not till he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them home, and takes them for better for worse.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There are about 3000 of these Women, who live in four Pallaces; one King tired with choosing, was drawn in a Chariot by Goats, and wherever they stopped, he took up, another chose by the Pictures of the beautifullest.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Formerly the Kings were more familiar with their subjects, and visited the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, giving publick Audience; this custom decayed by degrees, and the common way of doing business is by petition, but still the King gives some publick Audiences Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and at the four seasons of the Year goes to sacrifice in a Temple without the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The first that introduced this retirement was <hi>Vamlie</hi> Grand-father to him now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he did it because he was very gross, and would not lessen the Royal Majesty, since his time they are not so often seen as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Temple the King goes to at <hi>Peking,</hi>
                        <pb n="492" facs="tcp:54711:257"/>
is round, all of Marble, and a beautiful structure; that of <hi>Nanking</hi> is long, and has five Isles, born up by many columns, all plain except the Pedestals to show the rarity of them, for that being many in numbers, very high and thick, and all exactly alike, each is made of one Tree. To these Temples there are many Gates adorned with gilded Iron, in them many Altars with Images of the Sun, Moon, Planets, Spirits, Mountains, Rivers, and other things, to signify he, to whom they sacrifice there, is Lord of all. All the rest of the Year besides the times of these sacrifices and audiences, the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in his Pallace, and is seen by none but particular persons.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Some will judge the Kings of <hi>China</hi> live a confined Life, but their Pallace is a City consisting of many Pallaces, Orchards, and Gardens inclosed within a wall of a vast circumference; there is one Pallace for the King, Queen, and small Children, another for the Queen-Mother, another for the Sons that are marryed, another for the Queens, four for the Ladies, another called the cold Pallace for the old Men; Apartments for Eunuchs, Servants, Mathematicians, and Priests, an infinite number of Courts, or Cloisters, and lesser Apartments for all that live within, which are above 17000.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The structure of the Pallace is sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, much after our manner adorned with curious Carving, Painting, and Gilding. A River runs through the Gardens which are adorned with artificial Mounts, and they
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:54711:257"/>
covered with delightful variety of birds and beasts. All is encompassed by two walls distant from each other, the circumference is about 4 Miles, that of <hi>Nanking</hi> about five; there are 4 Gates that look to the four quarters of the World, and have strong guards of Elephants and Soldiers, of these 3000 always do duty in one of the Courts.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Next to the Empress, are six Queens, who upon publick occasions, sit on as many Chairs somewhat below the two Imperial Thrones, then there are 30 that have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular honours allowed them; the last in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are the Ladies. If the Empress has a Son, he takes place of all others, if not the eldest of any of these Women; there are 12000 Eunuchs, with their proper Officers. The President who answers our Secretary of State, may come to the King without asking leave, another who is supream Judge of the Eunuchs, is also Captain of the guard of 3000 Horse and 6000 Foot, the Eunuchs have all the best Employments, and are for the most part marryed.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. In the Court most go on Horseback, few in Chairs, except the great Eunuchs. The Father of the King now reigning, had a most insolent favourite Eunuch, upon the Kings death he kill'd himself, but was drag'd and torn to pieces by the rabble, and the King seized his vast Treasure. Many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers geld their Sons to make them capable of this sort of preferment.</p>

is worthy Admiration; every Body speaks to him on their Knees with the Ivory (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned) before their Mouths. The King's Garments differ not from those of the Subjects in form, but in the costliness, and being embroidered with Dragons which none can wear but he, his Wives, and the Royal Family. It is not easie to know the real value of the King's Revenue, but it is reckoned above One hundred and fifty Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Ducats yearly; Fifty-five are for the King's Expence, the Ninety-five for his Ministers, Examinations, Works and Presents.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. WHEN there were many Kings in <hi>China,</hi> they married into those Royal Families. Now there is but one, and he is forbid by Law marrying out of the Kingdom; he must of necessity marry a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The Great Men will not give the King their Daughters, because they must be first searched, even in those Parts none but a Husband may see, and if not liked they are sent back. Therefore in the Choice, they have no regard to Birth, but Youth,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:54711:258"/>
Beauty, good Inclinations and Parts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Such a one being found, two old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men strip her stark naked, and axamine as well inward as outwardly the Parts not to be named, then put her into a heat to discover whether her Sweat be offensive. All things answering expectation, she is carried to Court in State, and there instructed in such manner as she may deserve to be called Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Kingdom; for that is the Stile they give their Queens. Some of them have proved incomparable.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. No such care is taken in marrying the Princes. The P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="4">4. The Nobility were of another Nature when there were Titles and Lordships. Now all depends upon Learning, which makes any Mechanick a Gentleman; the want of it renders a Gentleman base. This is the reason their Nobility is not of long standing; for the Sons of Learned Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left rich, do not study, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have no Employments, and the Family pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes. Yet they have five sorts of Nobility. First, the Blood-royal thus preserved, the Prince inherits the Crown, the other Sons live in other Cities with Titles, but must not stir thence. Their eldest Sons succeed them,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:54711:259"/>
the others marry the best they can, and so their Children as long as the Family lasts. The Daughters (not looked upon in case of Inheritance) marry with Gentlemen. The second sort consist of those who have Titles, but no Dominions, and are inferior to some Magistrates. The third, the Magistrates. The fourth, the Students, who aim at De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. The fifth, those who live upon their Estates, or Merchandice, who if not very rich, are looked upon no better than the Commonalty.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Government is in the Hands of six Councils, so highly respected, it is scarce credible. Each of them has a President and two Assessors, this is the next Dignity to that of the <hi>Colaos.</hi> So that a Viceroy of a Province is happy, if after his Government expires, he reaches to be one of those As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors. Many more Officers belong to each of these Courts; the first is answerable to our Counsel of State, the second to that of War, the third is of Ceremonies, the fourth of the Revenue, the fifth of the publick Works, the sixth of Criminal Causes. There are also nine other Courts; the first like our Chancery, the second the high Stewards, the third the Master of the Horses, the fourth the Master of the Ceremonies of the Court; the fifth, of particular Rites; the sixth, of the Petitions given the King; the other three of lesser Matters. Every City has its own particular Council, each Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of a Province five distinct Tribunals. Each Town has a private Court.</p>

6. The great <hi>Mandarines</hi> are carried about Town in Chairs adorned with Ebony and Gold by four Men, with others by to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them; before the Chiefest go Men by Pairs with long Staves, always crying out, two others follow these with Tables, on which is writ the quality of the Person car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, after these go six scattering Bamboes, with which they use to bastinade Offenders and others with Fetters and Chains.

When one of these goes by, all things are taken from the Windows, the Images of Funerals are lowred, the People stop on the sides of the Streets, there is no noise, and he passes without moving his Eyes. When he goes to any City, the ancient Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him at the Gate on their Knees. The King bestows Honour on Magistrates Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as they rise; and when they die, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them with Pomp, and assigns them state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pallaces while living.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Prisons are large, and commonly near to the Palaces of the <hi>Mandarines</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="498" facs="tcp:54711:260"/>
it were in the Stocks; over them all run long Chains, so that they cannot turn. The lesser Criminals are more favourably dealt with, but all fare hard; for the Prisons serve to punish as well as to secure Men. The Prisoners have much to do at their Entrance with the Keepers about their Fees, for they pay none at going out.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Their Punishments differ not much from ours, but whipping is used before all other Penalties; the Lashes are given on the bare Buttocks and Thighs, as well to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as Men, and that before the Tribunal, or in the Street when the Crime is done there; no Body values the Shame, but only the Smart. They also have several ways of Racking.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Military Science is very ancient among the <hi>Chineses.</hi> They had tedious Wars with their Neighbours, conquered the Island <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and subdued One hundred and Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Kings. They always entertain a vast number of Souldiers; in <hi>Nanking</hi> there are Forty thousand, in <hi>Peking</hi> Eighty thousand, all over the Kingdom above a Million, but they are all Cowards. Yet of late Years they beat the <hi>Iaponeses</hi> out of <hi>Corea,</hi> and the <hi>Tartars</hi> out of the Province of <hi>Peking.</hi> They use foolish Reviews, in which, like our Boys, they represent <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Chineses,</hi> and the former are always beaten.</p>

but no Skill in the use of it, only shoot at random. Their most usual Arms are Lances, Arrows and Cutlaces. There is a sort of Back and Breast Pieces Proof against Arrows. Their Civil Government is very just, because bad Ministers are severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and the King hears Complaints against them. Thus much may suffice for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>China.</hi>

                     <p n="29">29. To conclude the description of these parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> let us say something of the most exquisite production of Nature it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords; doubtless the most wonderful thing in the World is, a Tree there growing, of which alone are built Ships and Houses, the one loaded, the other stored with all things necessary for Human Life, and on it alone, Men may feed and cloath themselves; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seen no particular account hereof, I will be the more plain in describing it. The Tree is about 50 foot high, on the top grow the leaves like that of a Palm or Date-tree in shape, but more large and beautiful, it bears about 50 of them, and among them about 12 clusters, each containing about 50 of those we call <hi>Cocos,</hi> as big as good Pumpkins, so that one Tree sometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces 600, never less than 400 of them.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. First on the outside is a thick tough shell or rhine, as is over the Walnut-shell, though not of that nature, then a hard shell, and within it a sweet kernel; that outward rhine is spun, and of it all manner of tackle and cordage is made, of the inward shell Porrengers, Salts, Flasks, Spoons, and other curiosities, besides being burnt, it is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant sort of Cole, to this shell sticks the kernel which is hollow, white as Snow, about an inch thick, juycy and sweet as Almonds, it serves to season several things, as Milk
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:54711:267"/>
and Sugar with us, and Eaten alone, is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, strengthening, but hard of digestion; within that hollow is about half a pint of most pleasant Water, which at certain times congeals and forms a substance like an Apple, (called by the <hi>Indians Pango)</hi> of a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful taste, as is the conserve of Sugar, of the same Tree, and this same is the seed that produces the Tree.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. To make Wine, Sugar, Vinegar, and other things of this <hi>Coco,</hi> they suffer not the cluster to grow, but bind the branch hard, when green, with cords made of the same Tree, cut the end of the branch, and put it into a Vessel, into which it bleeds like a Vine. This liquor is called <hi>Sura</hi> and a great quantity of it is gathered; to make Wine they distil it, some is stronger, some weaker, as our Brandy, the hottest they call <hi>Orraca</hi> (and we corruptly <hi>Rack)</hi> to sweeten and colour it, they put in Raisins, and it is a plentiful and pretious Commodity in all that part of <hi>Asia;</hi> Vinegar is made only by leaving that liquor some Days in Earthen Vessels; Sugar by boyling it to a consistence, with this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar they make good preserves, one of the kernel of the same Coco grated.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. Oyl is made of the Coco's prepared and ground; it serves not only to burn, but to Eat, dress Wounds, cure Colds, and purge, it is a considerable commodity; that mass of Coco which has been so pressed or ground, is excellent food for Cattle; so that of the Wood, Leaves and Shells of this Tree
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:54711:267"/>
is made the Ship, Sails and Rigging, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other material, and of the Fruit, Liquors and Preserves are made to load it: Of the Leaves are also made Brooms and Baskets; of the Wood, Darts and Lances not much inferior to Iron; it also bears a a sort of Down that serves instead of Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. When any of these Trees is cut down, they take off the Head, called <hi>Palmito,</hi> which is of an excellent taste, like to that of our Cardoons. It is therefore not to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the <hi>Indians</hi> take much pains to raise a Wood of these Trees, and are so much troubled to have them destroyed in time of War.</p>

Ten Leagues from this Shore, and three from that of <hi>Persia,</hi> just within the Mouth of the Gulph, is the Island <hi>Gerum,</hi> and in it the City <hi>Ormuz,</hi> a Kingdom more famous for its Trade than extent. From thence runs along the Coast of <hi>Caramania</hi> subject to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> for the space of Two hundred Leagues, to the City <hi>Diul</hi> seated on the Westernmost Mouth of <hi>Indus,</hi> which River makes one of the sides of that Continent which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>India,</hi> and is in the form of a Lozenge.</p>

This vast Continent, called by the Natives <hi>Indostan,</hi> is divided into several Kingdoms and Dominions, as are (to begin at the Mouth of <hi>Indus</hi> where we left off) the Kingdoms of <hi>Gurzarate</hi> or <hi>Cambaya, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, Bisnagar;</hi> those of <hi>Malabar, viz.

It is certain the Gospel was in the time of the Apostles Preached in many of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, if not in all. For the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> value themselves upon receiving it from a Servant of Queen <hi>Candace</hi> baptized by Saint <hi>Philip,</hi> and from the Evangelist St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> There is no doubt but <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> flourished with many Saints and Martyrs, and the People of <hi>Bazora,</hi> where <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> fall into the Sea, have a Tradition that the beloved Disciple preached to them.

He was born of a Noble Family at <hi>Pamplona</hi> in <hi>Navarre</hi> in the Year 1497, studied and taught Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy and Divinity at <hi>Paris,</hi> whence he went Companion to St. <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

his Rule, and received Holy Orders at <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. He came to <hi>Portugal</hi> in order to pass into <hi>India</hi> in the Year 1540, and the Reign of King <hi>Iohn</hi> the Third, who sent for him and a Companion from <hi>Rome.</hi> He had the Dignity of Apostolical Nuncio in the <hi>East;</hi> and during the Voyage, and in <hi>India,</hi> was called Holy Father. He Preached in the Island <hi>Zocotora,</hi> at <hi>Goa</hi> and <hi>Travancor,</hi> where he was persecuted. It cost him no less Pains to reclaim the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> debauched with the Riches of <hi>Asia,</hi> than to convert Infidels. In the Island <hi>Ceylon</hi> he Converted the King of <hi>Candea,</hi> went thence to the <hi>Moluco's,</hi> and gained many Souls. After several times traversing the Islands, <hi>India,</hi> and other Parts, he went to <hi>Iapan,</hi> and, with the Prince's leave, Preached at <hi>Cangoxima,</hi> and suffered many Afflictions, then went to <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando, Yamanguchi</hi> and <hi>Miaco,</hi> where with great pains he planted the Faith. Then he returned to <hi>Malaca,</hi> after converting the King of <hi>Bungo,</hi> who soon after died a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, being called <hi>Francis</hi> in Baptism.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Next he prepared to go into <hi>China,</hi> and died at the Entrance of it in the Island <hi>Sancham,</hi> in the Fifty-fifth Year of his Age, and the Eleventh of his Preaching, having first foretold the Day of his Death, which was the second of <hi>December</hi> about midnight: His Body the Year following was translated to <hi>Goa.</hi> He had the Gift of Languages and Prophecy, and was Canonized by Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>

the 15th, in the Year 1622. He had many Disciples and Companions, who wrought and endured much, and were held in opinion of sanctity.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. We have already spoke of the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Christianity into <hi>Ethiopia, India, Iapan, Persia,</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> and of its restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the <hi>Portugueses;</hi> now we will say somewhat relating to the same in <hi>China;</hi> there are still undeniable testimonies that St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> spread the Evangelical Doctrine there, and though no footsteps of it appeared, the same had happened in all <hi>India,</hi> had not <hi>Thomas</hi> called <hi>Cananeus</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, about the Year 800 come to <hi>Mogodover</hi> or <hi>Patana,</hi> who renewing the Apostles Churches, and building others, resettled the Christian Religion, and gave occasion to the mistake (because both had the same name) in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were all the work of the sormer. The same happened in <hi>China,</hi> as shall be made appear; the time Christianity was forgot in both places, differs not much, for as it appears, <hi>Thomas-Cananeus</hi> re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in <hi>India</hi> about the Year Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, so it is plain by what shall be said, that about the Year Seven hundred it began again to take footing in <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. Let us first speak of the antient and then of the modern testimonies. In the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daick</hi> Books of the <hi>Indian</hi> Christians still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at <hi>Cranganor,</hi> and particularly in a breviary, there is a lesson to this purpose; <q>By St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Errors of the Idolatry
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:54711:270"/>
of <hi>India</hi> were abolished; by St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the <hi>Chineses</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> were convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Truth; by St. <hi>Thomas &amp;c.</hi> by St. <hi>Thomas</hi> were spread in all <hi>India,</hi> the rays of the Doctrine of Life; by St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> flew to the <hi>Chineses</hi> the Kingdom of Heaven. And again in an <hi>Antiphon,</hi> the <hi>Indians, Chineses,</hi> the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Islan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> those of <hi>Siria, Armenia, Grecia,</hi> and <hi>Romania,</hi> in commemoration of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> offer adoration to thy Holy Name. </q>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Islanders</hi> may well be reckoned the <hi>Iaponeses;</hi> in the summary of the Synodical Constitutions, and Chapter of those that are Canonical, there is a Canon of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Theodosius,</hi> in which are these words, <hi>So also the Bishops of the great Province, as are most of the Metropolitans of</hi> China. When the <hi>Portugueses</hi> entered <hi>India,</hi> the Governor of the <hi>Malabar</hi> Mountains, called <hi>Iacoh,</hi> stiled himself, Metropolitan of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>China; Paulus Venetus</hi> a true Historian in all points, that can now be proved, assures in his time, there were in <hi>China</hi> many Christians who had sumptuous Churches, and names the Cities in which they were. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Society of Jesus had an account of People who worshipped the Cross. The cause why the Christians and their Churches were quite extinct, and no footsteps of them remains, is that they having favoured the Tartar when he invaded <hi>China</hi> about Three hundred Years since, he being overcome by the <hi>Chineses,</hi> many of them were killed,
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:54711:271"/>
the rest fled, and all that had been theirs was totally extirpated.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. In the Year 1625, digging for a foundation near <hi>Siganfu,</hi> Metropolis of the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi> there was found a flat stone above 9 spans in length, 4 in breadth, and one in thickness; one end of it goes off sharp like a Pyramid, on it is cut a Cross, the ends of it adorned with Flower de luces like that found in the Tomb of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle, about it are Clouds, and at the foot of it three lines, each containing three <hi>Chinese</hi> Letters, all the superficies of the stone is full of those Characters, and the edges, only that on these are some <hi>Sirian</hi> Characters, containing the names of the Bishops then in being. The Governor of the Town set it up there, under an Arch within the inclosure of a Temple. The three first lines have these words, <q>A Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument in Praise and Eternal Memory, of the propogating the law of light; and Truth come from <hi>Iudea</hi> into <hi>China.</hi> Then over the rest of the writing is this Title; the Prologue made by the Priest of the Kingdom of <hi>Iudea</hi> called <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mein.</hi>

                     <p n="12">12. The Substance of the Inscription is this: <q>That the most Spiritual, Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible and Eternal is without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end; That the beginning is three and one without having a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Lord <hi>Olooyu;</hi> That he formed the four Parts of the World in the figure of
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:54711:271"/>
a Cross; That he framed all Creatures and Man; That Man perverted from his Innocence, fell into the Snares of Satan; That hence sprang Three hnndred sixty five Sects; That some assigned Divinity to Creatures, and others believed all was a meer nothing; That all was full of Errors and Confusion; That then the Messiah, concealing his Majesty by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Man, appeared to the World; That an Angel coming to declare the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery to a Virgin, she brought forth the Holy; That a Star appeared, denoting his Birth, and those of the Kingdom of <hi>Pozu</hi> went to offer him Tribute, all sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to what the Twenty-four Saints had said; That he proposed to the World the most pure Law, and filled it with Light and Virtues, opening the way to Life, and shutting that of Death; That he overcame the dark Seat, and the Devil was destroyed, and Man made capable of ascending to the bright Seats; That at noon Day he ascended into Heaven, and there remained Twenty-seven Books of the Holy Scriptures; That he opened the Gate of Conversion by the Water that purifies; That his Ministers used the Holy Cross, and stayed not in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, nor had Servants, nor looked for Riches; That they seven times offered Sacrifice of sweet Odor, wherewith they helped the living and dead; That every seven Days they offered and purified the
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:54711:272"/>
Heart to receive the Holy Innocence; That no proper Name could be given to the true Law, and for want of another they called it, <hi>The Law of Light;</hi> That in the Year of <hi>Chinquon Kieiça,</hi> there came from <hi>Iudea</hi> a Man of great Virtue, called <hi>Olo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puem,</hi> with the true Doctrine; That this was received throughout all the Kingdom, and Churches erected; that afterwards some change of Affairs happening, it grew weak, but in the Time of the Great <hi>Tam,</hi> the Holy Gospel returned to <hi>China;</hi> That in the Year of <hi>Ximbie,</hi> the Priests <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> redressed all, and new Churches were erected; That in the Reign of the Great <hi>Tam,</hi> the second Year <hi>Kienchum,</hi> on the seventh day of the Month of <hi>Autumn,</hi> this Stone was set up, <hi>Kinçin</hi> Governor of the Church of <hi>China</hi> being Bishop.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. By this venerable Piece of Antiquity it appears, that the Christian Faith was planted in <hi>China</hi> about the Year Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty-one. From it also may be inferr'd, that St. <hi>Thomas</hi> first Preached there, but that Christianity being almost forgot, those Priests of <hi>Iudea</hi> and Kings of <hi>China</hi> restored it, as has been shown it happened in <hi>India.</hi> So that what the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> assisted by other <hi>European</hi> Religious Men now perform, is a second Re-establishment of the Faith.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. About the Year 1543, <hi>Fernan Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez Pinto</hi> had this following Information in <hi>China.</hi> He was Travelling from the City
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:54711:272"/>
                        <hi>Mindoo</hi> to that of <hi>Peking,</hi> and seeing by the way the Ruins of another, was informed, that about Two hundred Years before it was a most flourishing Place. That a Holy Man coming thither raised some dead to life, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Jesus Christ, and his Vicar upon Earth; that the Heathen Priests designing to burn him, he quenched the fire, making the sign of the Cross over it; that they stoned him to Death, and being thrown into a River, the Stream stood still five days, the holy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being born upon the Superficies all the time; that this occasioned the Conversion of many People, of which there was a great number in that Province. Further upon a Mountain was a Stone Cross, which this Writer saw some People Worship, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing these Words: <hi>Christ Iesus; Mary conceived him being a Virgin, brought him forth a Virgin, and remained a Virgin.</hi> These were Disciples descended from a Weaver, called <hi>Iohn,</hi> in whose House that Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr was entertained. They preserve a Book of his Life, which says his Name was <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Escandel,</hi> by Birth an <hi>Hungarian,</hi> and had been an Heremite on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> That History related, that he being taken out of the River and buried nine days after, the City was swallowed up with Four thousand <hi>Bonzos,</hi> who only durst stay in it, the People having abandoned it, by reason of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes that happened before.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. At the same time the same Writer found in the Cities <hi>Sampitay</hi> and <hi>Quiangsi</hi>
                        <pb n="524" facs="tcp:54711:273"/>
of <hi>China,</hi> many Christians who had been converted Twenty-five Years before, which was Sixty Years before the Jesuits entered <hi>China,</hi> which is now One hundred and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years since. And this is the Reason those Fathers found some Monuments of Christianity, but so obscure that little could be made out by them.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The same <hi>Feruand Mendez</hi> relates, That in the City <hi>Timplan,</hi> the Court of the Emperor of <hi>Caminam,</hi> a Borderer on <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> he found most ancient Monuments of the Christian Faith, and some account of the Holy Scripture. <q>Those People said, That the Creation of the World was the work of the Will of the Creator; That he was not visible, nor to be felt; That there were Eighty-two thousand Moons since the Earth was separated from the Water; That on Earth God had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a most delightful Garden, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therein the first Man called <hi>Adda,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Baragom:</hi> That he forbid them the Fruit of the Tree <hi>Hisaforam,</hi> and they transgressing this Command, all Men became liable to the Punishment of that Guilt: That the Man broke the Precept, being deceived by the Woman, and she by the Serpent <hi>Lupantoo:</hi> That for this Disobedience they were cast out of that delightful Place: That by reason of the Sinfulness of Man, God had drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the World; That only one just Man with his Family escaped in a Wooden
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:54711:273"/>
House, and by them Mankind was resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: That God would punish the Wicked, and reward the Good: That one <hi>Iohn,</hi> a Disciple of <hi>Thomas Modeliar,</hi> (a Servant of God, whom the Citizens of <hi>Digun</hi> killed, because he preached that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Man, and suffered Death for the Sins of Men) had Preached the same in that Country, and lost his Life for so doing. <hi>Thomas Modeliar</hi> is the Apostle St. <hi>Thomas.</hi>
                        </q> The People of <hi>Calaminam</hi> own the Blessed Trinity; when they Sneeze they say some Words that declare it, and they make the sign of the Cross.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The last Testimony was discovered in the Year 1635, but the thing in it self is at least as antient as the Stone already spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WHen Almighty GOD, the only Founder of Empires, is so pleased with a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as to possess them of a New one, He generally Endows the first Founders with a wonderful proportion of Heroick Virtues, as <hi>Sincerity, Magnanimity, Valour, Majesty,</hi> and an almost more than <hi>Mortal Staidness:</hi> The solid Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations to support the greatest Monarchies. Such Founders rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeded Three in Number. Let the Learned (by the help of
<pb facs="tcp:54711:278"/>
this not yet Vulgar Remark) seek Foreign Examples; it shall be my Care only to shew those of my own Country. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Portugal</hi> was founded by Three Heroes, <hi>(HENRY, ALFONSO,</hi> and <hi>SANCHO)</hi> most visibly adorned with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> those Virtues which merit to erect Imperial Thrones, and from them to Command many Kings, many Princes, and many Nations. Their Successors began to decline. The Dominion, the same Distributer of Power was pleased to give them in <hi>Asia,</hi> was also founded on Three, as appears in the beginning of this Work: They were <hi>DUARIE PACHECO, D. FRANCISCO DE ALMEYDA,</hi> and <hi>ALFONSO DE ALBUQUER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUE.</hi> Scarce had they one Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor who did not manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, or at least had a mixture of
<pb facs="tcp:54711:278"/>
                     <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Timerousness,</hi> of <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and <hi>Covetousness,</hi> with that unhappy distinction, that still the <hi>Timerousness</hi> and <hi>Avarice</hi> were most predominant. No Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puts away his Young Ones, till they can shift for themselves: So Almighty GOD, when He erects Monarchies, cherishes them with particular Care, till they gather strength, and then (tho' He does not wholly abandon) puts them into the hands of Men, that they may perceive the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Divine and Human Care. Let an unbiassed Judgment here reflect upon the Exploits of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> in gaining this <hi>Asiatick</hi> Crown, and it will appear that only <hi>PACHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CO</hi> could have forged it with that fiery Heart, which melted the Arms and Riches of the obstinate <hi>Zamori;</hi> That only
<pb facs="tcp:54711:279"/>
                     <hi>ALMEYDA</hi> could have filed and polished it, by applying his own and his Son's Sword, which brought it into form by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the <hi>Turkish</hi> Pride; And that only the Great <hi>ALBUQUERQUE,</hi> giving the finishing stroaks, could have set in it the most Precious Jewels of <hi>Goa, Malaca</hi> and <hi>Ormuz.</hi> For they so far removed from their Country, that they had not only lost sight, but even the hopes and memory of it, entring with a few indifferent Vessels and a most inconsiderable number of Men, where scarce a Tree offered them a secure shade, amidst Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and well Armed Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons and Castles, and through showers of heavy Ball and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned Arrows; by the force of their Swords opened deep Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, raised high Walls, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to themselves famous Cities
<pb facs="tcp:54711:279"/>
and large Countries. Let those who have since acted less, having so good a ground to perform much more, not take it ill if we say, <hi>That the Bounds of our Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in</hi> India, <hi>are almost reduced to what they were in the Beginning.</hi> It is true, some of the Successors (a few among so many) added some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Foundation; but it was an inconsiderable Copy of the Great Original. It is also true, others valiantly desended that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>dation, but it was an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable Duty. Let not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirits call this a <hi>Rash Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which the Brave will only style <hi>Unbiassed;</hi> or say, <hi>We endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to lessen the Merits of Hero's;</hi> our only Design, is to shew the Ways and Means the Giver of Crowns takes to frame and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them to Mortals; and how far less capable they are to Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb facs="tcp:54711:280"/>
than He to Form them. The Divine Providence gave a sufficient Demonstration hereof in the erecting this Empire, and they no less in diminishing of it. Hereof we have seen much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and shall see yet more; yet not without singular Acts of Valour: That it may be manifest the Cause of our Ruin is, <hi>That the Souls are not always the same; for the Hearts always are.</hi>

                        <p>The Government of the Vice-Roy <hi>D. Garcia de Noronha,</hi> from the Year 1538, till the Year 1540, in the Reign of King <hi>John</hi> the Third.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. IN the Month of <hi>November D. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia de Noronha</hi> the Vice-Roy began <note place="margin">1538.</note> to take upon him the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Affairs in <hi>India.</hi> He had set out of <hi>Lisbon</hi> with 12 Sail, and Arrived with 11, and in them three Thousand fighting Men; many of Note. One of the Ships was never heard of, which was esteemed a Judgment; because it was full of Malefactors taken out of Gaols.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54711:288"/>
whose Punishment was changed into Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though this Fleet was fitted out chiefly to oppose the <hi>Turks,</hi> who now oppressed <hi>India;</hi> yet the Vice-Roy suffered them to batter <hi>Diu,</hi> without relieving it farther, than with the hopes of Relief. <hi>Antony de Sylva Meneses</hi> was the second that was sent thither with 24 small Vessels, and came late; yet contended with the Great <hi>Antony de Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyra</hi> for the Honour of that Victory: So much he valued, having been only a Witness of it. The Vice-Roy was ready to Sail for <hi>Diu</hi> with a Fleet of 160 Sail of several sorts, and in them five Thousand fighting Men and a 1000 Pieces of Cannon, when the Advice came that the <hi>Turks</hi> had raised the Siege. He was overjoy'd (it is not known for what) and discharging the Merchant-Ships that were ready to attend him retained Ninety. With these he set out for <hi>Diu,</hi> but sailed so slowly, that it appeared as if some ill Omen threatned his ruin there, since he avoided not only seeing of it in danger, but even now in Peace. Its quiet was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed by <hi>Lurcan</hi> and <hi>Coje Zofar,</hi> who ranged about with Fire and Sword. The Vice-Roy heard of this at <hi>Dabul,</hi> and sent against them <hi>Martin Alfonso de Melo</hi> with his Galley, and the Vessels that went with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony de Sylva.</hi> He went; but being hard set by the Enemy, was forced to take shelter under the Fort. The Vice-Roy at the same slow rate removed to <hi>Bacaim,</hi> nothing moved with the News he received from <hi>Diu.</hi>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54711:288"/>
It was murmured, he either consulted his Safety or his private Interest. But when least expected, he Steered thither on the first of <hi>Ianuary;</hi> when a Storm rising, which lasted eight days, dispersed the Fleet into several Ports; two Gallies, and some other Vessels, perished.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The first thing the Vice-Roy attended to, was to hear <hi>D. Gonzalo Vaz Confino,</hi> who came with five small Vessels from <hi>Onor,</hi> whither he had been sent by the late Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> upon this occasion. One of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Gallies, that had been at <hi>Diu,</hi> was forcod into that Port; and 'twas thought that Queen (then a Widow) violated the Peace concluded with us by protecting it. <hi>Gonçalo Vaz</hi> calling her to account, she An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>The Gally was there against her Will she not being in a condition to binder it; but should be glad it were taken by our Vessels.</hi> The Captain attempted it, and after a sharp Engagement was forced to desist, having lost 15 Men, and among them his Son <hi>Iames.</hi> He sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Queen had assisted the Enemy, and refusing some Refreshment she sent for the wounded Men, returned some rash Words mixed with Threats. The Queen cleared her self, and again offered Peace, which was concluded, and some <hi>Portugueses</hi> left in that Port, to observe what the Queen did towards expelling the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. We will conclude this Year with the memory of the Arrival of six Ships at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> from <hi>India,</hi> rather for the Bones than the Riches they carried. In one of them
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54711:289"/>
was the Body of the Great <hi>D. Vasco de Gama,</hi> which the King caused to be laid in his Tomb, with the greatest Magnificence that has been seen in this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Year <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> the second time was made Commander of the famous Fort <note place="margin">1539.</note> of <hi>Malaca.</hi> Immediately resorted to him Embassadors from the Neighbouring Kings, to congratulate and confirm Peace with us. The first was of the <hi>Bataas</hi> in <hi>Sumatra,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ocean where the Island of Gold was imagined to be, and which we earnestly desired to discover; but that Design being later, we will then speak of this Embassy. The second was of <hi>Aaru</hi> in <hi>Sumatra;</hi> both demanded Assistance against him of <hi>Achem. Faria</hi> had not yet taken possession of the Command, which still <hi>D. Stephen de Gama</hi> held for a few Weeks. One excused himself, because his Power was expiring; the other, because he had not yet commenced. Whereas both ought to joyn in relieving that King, as well because his Fidelity me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited it, as because his Kingdom lay between <hi>Malaca</hi> and <hi>Achem,</hi> and served us for a Bulwark. <hi>Gama</hi> was most in fault, being in possession, and much pressed by <hi>Faria</hi> to grant it. But we shall soon see him more blameable, refusing then what he now urged should be granted. Such the Inconstancy of Man.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Afterwards <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> sent that King some Relief; but it was inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and came late. The King of <hi>Achem</hi> sent against him his Brother-in-Law <hi>Heredim
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54711:289"/>
Mahomet</hi> with 160 Vessels, all of Oars, and 12000 Fighting Men. He from the Mouth of the River <hi>Puneticam</hi> battered <hi>Aaru</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, but to no effect; so he Landed and entred the Works: But was again beaten out, with loss of Men and Canon. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegers persisting some days, lose 3000 Men. They bribe an Officer of the Besieged, who treacherously led the King to a dangerous place, where he was killed by a Musquet-Ball. The Enemy enters the Works, and putting all (even the Sick) to the Sword, flew 2000. The Body of the dead King was carried to Him of <hi>Achem,</hi> who caused it to be cut in pieces and boiled in Oil.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Queen of <hi>Aaru,</hi> who was in a Wood, hearing the Death of her Husband, would have burnt her self alive; but being hindred, with about 300 Men fell upon the <hi>Achems,</hi> who were plundering the City, and slew 200. Being too weak to proceed, she returned to the Woods, and from thence made Excursions; but not able to hold out, went over to <hi>Malaca</hi> with about 600 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in her Retinue, in 16 Vessels. <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> sent his Son <hi>Alvaro,</hi> who had the Command of the Sea, to receive her upon the River with pomp and grandeur.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Faria</hi> treated her with much Respect; but kept her four Months with only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Succour, till she Despairing, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly reproached him for this Neglect, and he without any regard gave no other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, than Turning his Back. Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest drew away the Commander from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54711:290"/>
the performance of what he owed to a Royal Matron, who for her Husbands sake deserved our Aid, for her Misfortunes our Pity, and for her Merit. Respect.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The afflicted Widow went to the King of <hi>Ujantana,</hi> then at <hi>Bintam,</hi> who scandalized at <hi>Peter de Faria</hi>'s Proceedings, offered Assistance, and Married her, to have the better Title to pretend to the Kingdom of <hi>Aaru.</hi> He sent his Embassador to <hi>Achem,</hi> to demand that Crown as his Right by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. The Tyrant would not hear the Embassador, nor receive the Present he brought, which is the greatest Affront a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those Princes; but sent a Letter full of Reproaches, saying among other things, His <hi>Letter had been writ upon the Wedding-Table.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. The King of <hi>Ujantana</hi> provoked by this Affront, immediately set out 200 Sail under the Command of his Admiral <hi>Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xemena,</hi> who Anchored before the Fort of <hi>Puneticam,</hi> and carried it at the first Assault, killing 1400 <hi>Achems,</hi> and their Commander <hi>Morat Arraez</hi> a <hi>Turk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. By this time <hi>Heredim Mahomet</hi> was Sailing that way with such another Fleet, and in it 12000 Fighting Men. The two Fleets met, and after a sharp Engagement, <hi>Heredim</hi> being killed by a Canon-Ball, his Men dismayed, and most of the Fleet was taken by <hi>Lacxemena,</hi> most of the <hi>Achems</hi> slain, and only 14 Vessels got off.</p>
                     <p n="12">
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54711:290"/>
12. The King of <hi>Achem</hi> caused the 14 Captains to be Beheaded, because they fled, and the Souldiers Beards to be cut off, and that upon pain of being sawed alive they should ever wear Womens Habit, with a sort of Tabor in their Hands; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they affirmed any thing upon Oath, they should say, <hi>As I hope to see my Husband safe;</hi> or else, <hi>As I hope to see the Children I have bore prosper.</hi> This was put in Execution, and let it not seem strange; for in the time of King <hi>Sebastian,</hi> two Gentlemen for Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardise were Condemned either to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, or walk the City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> with a Spinning-Rock at their Girdle, and one of them chose this last.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. But above 20 years after this, in 1564, <note place="margin">1564.</note> the King of <hi>Ujantana</hi> possessing <hi>Aaru</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apprehension, he of <hi>Achem</hi> furiously fell upon and took Him and his Women, and put them all to death with barbarous Torments. The Kingdom of <hi>Aaru</hi> he gave to his eldest Son, who after died before <hi>Malaca,</hi> as shall appear in its place.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Continues the Government of the Vice Roy, <hi>D. Garcia de Noronha.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. LEt us return to our Vice-Roy, whom we left at Sea. After the danger and loss above related, he entred the Port of <hi>Diu</hi> with 50 Sail. He applauded, as was due the Bravery of <hi>Antony de Silveyra,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the Fort, and delivered it to <hi>Iames Lopez de Sousa,</hi> to whom the Command was given by the King. Let it suffice once for all to note, That these Commands are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways given by the King, and so many Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors named, that many of them are in their Graves before they succeed in the Post. A Treaty of Peace was set on foot, and concluded little to our advantage; which the Common Vogue (I know not whether Infallible) attributed to Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Ruy Lorenço de Tavora,</hi> Commander of <hi>Bazaim,</hi> was close shut up in his Fort by the Forces of the King of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> who were Masters of the Field, after having done all that could be expected from him. The Vice-Roy sent to his Relief <hi>Tristan de Ataide,</hi> late Commander of <hi>Malaca,</hi> with a Galeon and 3 Barques well Manned. The two being joyned, repulsed the Enemy with very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable loss of Men, Baggage and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54711:291"/>
Mean while the Vice-Roy prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Works at <hi>Diu,</hi> and sent <hi>Martin Alfonso de Melo</hi> to Command at <hi>Ormuz, Peter de Faria</hi> to <hi>Malaca</hi> the second time, and <hi>Michael Ferreyra</hi> a Gentleman of Worth, 70 years of Age, with 12 small Vessels and 400 Men, to assist the King of <hi>Cota</hi> in <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> against his Brother <hi>Madune Pandar,</hi> King of <hi>Ceitavaca,</hi> who distressed him. <hi>Ferreira</hi> did great damage in several Towns, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Inhabitants. In the Port of <hi>Putulam</hi> he surprized <hi>Pate Marcar</hi>'s Fleet, consisting of 16 <hi>Paraos,</hi> and easily gained them; and with the same Success carried the Works and Cannon ashoar, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by 2000 Men. He Anchored in the Bay of <hi>Columbo</hi> with the Ships, Cannon and other Booty. Then he marched to <hi>Cota;</hi> thence towards <hi>Ceitavaca</hi> at the head of the Army of the King he Relieved, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying all before him; and seeking <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dune,</hi> who had 6000 Men, saw them fly to the shelter of the Woods. Thence he sent to beg Peace, which was granted upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he should send the Heads of some <hi>Morish</hi> Officers, especially <hi>Patè</hi> and <hi>Cunale Marcar.</hi> He opposed this Condition as much as he could, but there being no other Medium to appease his Adversary, consented, and killing them two and others, sent 9 Heads upon as many Spears, a Present so accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Ferreyra,</hi> that he presently made Peace between him and <hi>Cota,</hi> and went off himself with Honour.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54711:292"/>
3. The same time the Vice-Roy sent <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand de Morales</hi> with a great Galeon, laden on the Kings account, to Trade at <hi>Pegu.</hi> As soon as arrived at that Port, the King won him with Promises and Favours, to aid him against the King of <hi>Brama,</hi> who invaded that Country with such a Power, that the two Armies consistssed of two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Men and 10000 Elephants. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales</hi> went into a Galliot, and Commanding the Fleet of <hi>Pegu,</hi> made great havock among the Enemies Ships. <hi>Brama</hi> came on by Land like a Torrent, carrying all before him, and his Fleet covering the River, though as great as <hi>Ganges.</hi> With this Power he easily gained the City and Kingdom of <hi>Pegu. Ferdinand Morales</hi> met the Fleet with his, in respect of the other scarce visible, at the Point <hi>Ginamarreca,</hi> where was a furious, bloody and desperate Fight. But the <hi>Pegu's</hi> overpowred by the <hi>Brama's</hi> deserted <hi>Morales,</hi> who alone in his Galeot maintained himself against the Enemies, performing Wonders with vast slaughter of them, till oppressed by the Multitude he was killed. But the memory of his Bravery still lives among those People.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The cause of this Revolt of <hi>Brama,</hi> who was Tributary to <hi>Pegu,</hi> was this: Above 30000 <hi>Brama's</hi> laboured in the King of <hi>Pegu</hi>'s Works, this being one Condition of their Vassalage. The King used to Visit them with his Women, because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to see Foreigners and the notable Works, and never carried any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54711:292"/>
The Labourers (what Wickedness would not they in Idleness invent, who thought so much in their Labour) resolved to rob the Queens or Concubins, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly murdered the King, stripped them and fled to their Country. <hi>Dacha Rupi,</hi> Heirto the deceased, was not only deprived of Means of Revenging this Villany, but even of maintaining himself, for many of his Subjects rebelled. <hi>Parà Mandarà,</hi> King of the <hi>Brama's,</hi> desiring to enlarge his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and seeing that his Pickaxes and Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels had opened a Way to his Cimiters and Standards, rushes out with that Violence, and over-runs the Kingdoms of the <hi>Lanjoes, Laos, Iangoma's,</hi> and others, that like his were Tributaries to <hi>Pegu.</hi> Thus this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant possessed himself of his ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ava,</hi> that extends two Months Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at ordinary Journeys, and contains 62 Cities. On the N. E. a Months Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, is that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> containing as many Cities, which the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> had taken from him of <hi>Cathay.</hi> The Kingdom of <hi>Bimir</hi> lies West of <hi>Ava,</hi> of the same extent, and has 27 populous Cities. North of this that of <hi>Lanjam,</hi> of equal greatness, has 38 Cities, and great store of Gold and Silver. On the East is that of <hi>Mamprom,</hi> as great, but has only 8 Cities; on the East it borders on <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> on the South with <hi>Siam,</hi> afterwards conquered by <hi>Brama;</hi> and East of this is the great Kingdom of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodia.</hi> All the Inhabitants of these Kingdoms are Pagans, and the most Superstitious of all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54711:293"/>
the East. They believe in one only God; but in time of need have recourse to many Idols. Of these they have some dedicated to the secret acts and necessities of Nature, in the same form they are performed. They hold the Immortality of the Soul; are zealous in giving Alms, and bear great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to their Religious Men. These are very numerous, follow a Rule, and keep a Choir much like ours; they live upon what is given them that day, without keeping any thing for the next; they eat neither Fish nor Flesh, because they kill nothing that has Life; their Cloaths are yellow Cassocks and Cloaks, with Hats of oiled Paper; they observe <hi>Lent</hi> and <hi>Easter</hi> after the Christian manner. Whence may be inferred, That these are some Remains of the Doctrine of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle, though mixed with many Errors. The People are all white, the Women very beautiful.

                     <p n="5">5. The Vice-Roy being at <hi>Goa, D. Iohn de Albuquerque,</hi> a Spaniard, presented him King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Patent, by which all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests from the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> to <hi>India,</hi> were made subject to his Diocess, with liberty to erect the Church of St. <hi>Catherine</hi> of that City into a Cathedral. The Patent was obeyed, and thus a Spaniard was the first Prelate of the Conquests; as if <hi>Spain</hi> had now taken the Power in Spirituals, it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54711:293"/>
was afterwards to possess in Temporals. At this time the <hi>Guzaratas</hi> streightned <hi>Ruy Lorenco de Tavora</hi> in <hi>Baçaim.</hi> He sallies with 350 Men, and put them to the rout. <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> comes on with his Men, and puts him into a dangerous condition. <hi>George de Lima,</hi> Commander of <hi>Chaul,</hi> having Notice hereof, sent 100 Men with speed, with which assistance the Enemy was repulsed, and time given to repair the damage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Four Ships arrived in <hi>India</hi> from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> to return with Merchandize. In one of them the Great <hi>Antony de Sylveyra</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued. The Flag-Ship perished in her Return, and was never heard of; but <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyra</hi> arrived safe at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and had scarce Anchored, when the Great Men of the Court came aboard to Conduct him to the King and Princes, who with Joy waited to see and honour him: And no wonder, since all the Christian Princes visited him by their Embassadors, led by the admiration of his Glorious Exploits. The French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador had his Picture drawn, which was hung up in the Gallery of Fame among the other Hero's. He was of a middle Stature, strong built; of a clear Judgment, ready Wit, a great Heart, and very Liberal. His Liberality did as much at <hi>Diu,</hi> as his Valour; for it is vain for a Miser ever to expect to purchase Glorious Victories: Yet this Virtue was prejudicial to him in <hi>Portugal;</hi> for the King having appointed him Governour of <hi>India,</hi> was disswaded by some, who said,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54711:294"/>
That Empire was too little for his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The late success of our Arms, chiefly in <hi>Cambaya,</hi> terrified all the Eastern Princes, our Enemies; so that <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> and <hi>Hidalcam</hi> immediately sent their Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to confirm the last Peace concluded with them. <hi>Zamori,</hi> to obtain the more favourable Reception with the Vice-Roy, took <hi>Emanuel de Brito,</hi> Commander of the Fort of <hi>Chale,</hi> for his Mediator. <hi>Brito</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised his Interest, and accompanied the Embassador <hi>China Cutiale,</hi> who came to <hi>Goa</hi> with a splendid Retinue. The Vice-Roy received him with Courtesie and Grandeur. The Peace was Concluded much to our Credit. Had not the Vice-Roy fallen sick, he designed to go to <hi>Calicut,</hi> to perform the Ceremony of Swearing to the observation of the Articles; but sent his Son <hi>D. Alvaro</hi> to this purpose, under the Direction of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Men, because he was young. They came to <hi>Panane</hi> with a numerous Fleet, where that Prince expected them, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the Kings of <hi>Chale</hi> and <hi>Tanor.</hi> They met with great demonstrations of Joy; the Peace was sworn, and lasted 30 years, which was one of the greatest Blessings we enjoyed in <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. About the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> this Treaty was Concluded, and the Vice-Roy sent towards <hi>Cambaya, D. Peter de Castello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branco,</hi> with 14 Sail, who returned to <hi>God</hi> without any Action of Note. <hi>Iohn de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulveda</hi> coming from <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and hearing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54711:294"/>
that <hi>Ruy Lorenço de Tavora</hi> was streightned by the Enemy in <hi>Baçaim,</hi> relieved him with diligence; and they forced the Enemy to leave the Field. <hi>Antony Carvallo,</hi> with 8 small Vessels, went to seek some Pirates that coursed between <hi>Baticala</hi> and <hi>Anchediva.</hi> They fled; but being overtaken, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, their Ships burnt, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try laid waste. <hi>Carvallo</hi> returned with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Goa,</hi> where the Vice-Roy growing so weak, he could not attend the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he proposed a Worthy Person might be chose to supply his place, and then said, It should be no other than his Son <hi>D. Alvaro.</hi> This surprized all Men, being a violation of the Publick Liberty of Choice: And might have proved of dangerous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, had not his Death prevented it; for sometimes it is expedient One should dye for the good of the People.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Vice-Roy being dead, the first Patent of Succession was opened, and <hi>Martin Alfonso de Sousa</hi> was therein named, who not long before was gone to <hi>Portugal.</hi> The second being opened, named <hi>D. Steven de Gama,</hi> who lived Indisposed without the City. All rejoyced at the Election, as few were grieved at the Death of the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, who nevertheless was honourably Interr'd. His Picture represents him in the ancient Habit of <hi>Portugal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

brought with him two Embassadors of the King of <hi>Cota.</hi> He desired of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> That in case he had no Son, his Grand-Child might be sworn King. To this effect the Embassadors brought his Image in Gold, which held in its Hand a Crown set with Jewels, for the King to Crown the Statue with. The King did it publickly, with much solemnity, and the Embassadors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned well pleased, as dispatched to their Prince's satisfaction.</p>

                        <p>The Government of <hi>D. Stepen de Gama,</hi> from the Year 1540, till the Year 1542, in the Reign of King <hi>JOHN</hi> the Third.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>DOn Stephen</hi> entred upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the beginning of <hi>April;</hi> he was Son of <hi>D. Vasco de Gama.</hi> The first thing he did, was to cause all he had to be publickly Valued, that it might not be thought afterwards he had got his Estate by that Government; at the end whereof it was found considerably diminished. The first Act was hard to be imitated; so the second, which was, That he advanced a great Sum to the Publick, seeing the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54711:295"/>
exhausted. Next, he refitted the Fleet, which was laid up. The care of Temporals did not lessen his attention to Spirituals; so he founded the Colledge of St. <hi>Faith,</hi> for the Heathen Youths that are Converted: This was the second Colledge erected in that Empire, and the first at <hi>Goa;</hi> and the first Rector of it was that singular person the Vicar Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Michael Vaz.</hi> He sent his Brother <hi>D. Christopher,</hi> young in years, but not in abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to attend the Repairing the Ships at <hi>Cochin.</hi> He sent Advice to several Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, in order to be in a readiness to oppose the <hi>Rumes,</hi> who, it was said, were Sailing towards our Coasts. <hi>D. Christopher</hi> set out with 600 Men against the King of <hi>Porca</hi> and a <hi>Caymal</hi> of his, because they had robbed <hi>Sebastian de Sousa</hi> coming from <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divia,</hi> and refused to make Restitution. He marched up the Country, slew many of the Enemy, and routed the rest; Beheaded the <hi>Caymal,</hi> and laid the Country waste; which produced an advantagious Peace, and an Agreement between this King and him of <hi>Pimienta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Being advertized, That the <hi>Rumes</hi> could not set out this Year, he attended other Affairs. <hi>Emanuel de Vasconcelos</hi> was sent with 20 Sail to the Coast of <hi>Malabar;</hi> and <hi>Antony de Castelobranco</hi> with 30 to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya.</hi> Scarce were they gone, when 4 Ships arrived from <hi>Portugal.</hi> They carried new Orders from the King, as dangerous as they were new; for whoever deprives Men of the hopes of Advancement, takes away
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54711:296"/>
their Courage. Such were these, being the sullen thoughts of Ministers, who thinking all too little for themselves, think every thing too much for others. The Ships being sent to <hi>Cochin,</hi> to load and return home; <hi>D. Stephen</hi> prepared to set out for the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> in order to burn the Turkish Gallies at <hi>Zues;</hi> but first he sent some Commanders to the Post assigned them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When <hi>Badur,</hi> King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> made over the Lands of <hi>Baçaim</hi> to the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> he took them from <hi>Bramaluco,</hi> a brave Man, to whom he had before given them. He thought the death of the Vice-Roy <hi>D. Garcia,</hi> furnished him a convenient opportunity to regain them by surprize. He set out of <hi>Damam,</hi> in the dead of Winter, with 300 Horse and 5000 Foot. <hi>Ruy Lorenço de Tavora,</hi> Commander of that Fort, considering if the Enemy once took footing, it would be hard to remove them; sets out with 650 <hi>Portugueses,</hi> the later number were Horse and Men of known Valour. The Foot he divided into four Battalions, and reserved to himself the 50 Horse and about 400 Blacks. Hearing the Enemy was lodged in the Village <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi> two Leagues up the Country, he resolved to surprize him at Noon, when they use to Bathe. Half a League from the place he halted to Rest the Men; and the Enemy having Intelligence thereof, came on with such diligence and secrecy, that they had put them to the Sword, had not <hi>Ferdinand de Silva,</hi> who led the Van with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54711:296"/>
much Bravery, given a check to their Fury. <hi>Antony de Sotomayor</hi> relieved him, already wounded in the Leg, was himself wounded and lost some Men; but did great Execution. This gave <hi>Tavora</hi> time to make ready, whose furious coming up made great havock. Our Men turning Back to Back, and facing the Enemy round, did Wonders. <hi>Ruy Lorenço,</hi> with his Horse ranging about, did them great harm, till falling on their Flank many were slain, the rest fled without hopes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Next, he resolved to take a Great Ship of <hi>Bramaluco</hi>'s, that was newly finished in the Dock of <hi>Agaçaim.</hi> He marched thither by Land, and <hi>D. Luis de Ataide</hi> went by Water. The latter by force of Arms made his way to the City, at such time as the other was reducing it to Ruins; break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through a Multitude of Enemies, who endeavoured to stop his Fury, each of them lost six Men. <hi>D. Luis</hi> Landed, and both together cleared the Field, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled the City, and then set Fire to it. The Ship was carried to the Port of <hi>Baçaim,</hi> and for many years Traded to <hi>Lisbon. Bramaluco</hi> sued for Peace, and he being a suspected Subject of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> our Governour treated with that King, and by this means secured the former Peace, and obtained a Grant of half the Customs, whereof only the Third part was offered before.</p>

5. Let us now return to the Fleet, in which the Governour was to sail. His great Liberality brought him more Men than he desired, whereof he chose the best. The Fleet consisted of 80 Sail of sundry sorts and sizes, and carried two Thousand Men.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. While this Fleet was fitting, the King of <hi>Achem</hi> falling upon the King of the <hi>Bataas</hi> unexpectedly, made a great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his People, killing among the rest three Sons he rather adored than loved The King desirous of Revenge, sent his Brother-in-Law Embassadour to <hi>Peter de Faria,</hi> then Commanding at <hi>Malaca.</hi> The Embassy was to confirm the Peace before concluded, and desire assistance of Arms and Ammunition; and the better to obtain it, sent him a rich Present, and offered a free Trade in his Dominions, which abound in Gold, Pepper, Benjamin and Camphir. <hi>Faria,</hi> who was intent upon Profit, as well as his King's Service, plentifully supplied him with Arms and Ammunition, offering his utmost assistance, and entertaining the Embassadour with splendour. The King of <hi>Bataa</hi> attacked his Enemy with Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; but was beaten after having almost gained the Victory, and retired with great Grief to his City <hi>Panaaju.</hi> Here he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched <hi>Pinto,</hi> sent thither by <hi>Faria</hi> to Trade, who narrowly escaped being lost in the River <hi>Parles</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Queda,</hi> by reason of the Revolution had then hapned in the City of that Name, the Court of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54711:297"/>
that Prince, who had murdered his Father and married his own Mother. The first he denyed, and pretended he had done the latter in Honour to her, having refused many considerable Matches. <hi>Pinto</hi> brought News of the Island <hi>del Oro,</hi> or <hi>of Gold,</hi> the great motive of his Voyage.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But now our Governour enters the <hi>Red Sea</hi> with his Fleet. He found most of the Islands and Cities abandoned, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple having had notice of his coming. The chief Island was <hi>Maçua<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> The principal City <hi>Suanquem,</hi> in about 19 Degrees of North Latitude, well built and rich. The King, who was fled a League up the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, entertained the Governour with shews of Peace, that he might not destroy the Island. But the greatest damage was, that hereby he prevented the burning the Ships at <hi>Suez,</hi> gaining so much time as carried thither the News of this Design. The Governour in Revenge, marched with his Brother <hi>D. Christopher</hi> and 1000 Men, made a great slaughter, was Master of the Field, and took a great Booty: Then turning to the City, it was plundered, and private Men got four or five thousand Ducats each; then it was burnt to the ground. The Waters being shoal, the Governour resolved to go over to <hi>Alcoçer,</hi> and other places, with only sixteen Catures or Barges, the rest of the Fleet he sent to <hi>Maçua,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Lionel de Lima.</hi> There was a great dispute about who should go with <hi>D. Stephen,</hi> and he had much difficulty
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54711:298"/>
to compose it. They set out of the Bay for this Reason called <hi>De los Agraviados,</hi> or <hi>Of the Offended.</hi> Many Gentlemen went in the Barges as private Souldiers, accepting any place so they were admitted; such was their desire to be in this Action. The number of Men was Two hundred and fifty. At <hi>Alconçer,</hi> which is in the Latitude of 25 Degrees, they did the same as had been done before at <hi>Suanquem.</hi> Crossing over to <hi>Tor</hi> or <hi>Toro,</hi> they took some Vessels of the Enemy. The Turks at first opposed the Landing, but some being slain, fled and abandoned the City, in which nothing of Value was found. The Governour would not burn it in reverence of St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> and a Monastery found there with Religious Men under her Invocation, which at their Instance he visited. To his great glory, he was the first <hi>European</hi> Commander that took that City, where he Knighted several, who held this Honour done them there in great esteem; and it was afterwards envied by the Great Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, as shall appear in its place. Our People, and those Religious testified great Regret at parting. They are of the Greek Church, and of the Order of St. <hi>Basil.</hi> The City is in the Latitude of 28 Degrees, and is thought by Learned Geographers, to be the ancient <hi>Elana.</hi>
                     </p>

8. The Governour went over to <hi>Suez,</hi> and after many brave Attempts made by several to sound and view the Harbour, which all failed, he resolved in Person and in open Day to discover the Gallies. He saw them, and desiring to do something considerable, Landed; the Enemies Shot flew from the Town, and 2000 Turkish Horse broke out of an Ambush; some few whereof were killed by our Canon; but our Men obliged to Retire, much grieved that this Voyage was disappointed. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour returned to his Fleet at <hi>Maçua,</hi> where he found the Severity of <hi>Emanuel de Gama</hi> had caused a Mutiny, which gave occasion to 80 Men to run away with a Ship, designing to go over to <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> They were met by a Captain of the King of <hi>Zeila,</hi> and after a vigorous Resistance, most of them killed. On a Gallows hung five, whom <hi>Gama</hi> had Executed, for concealing the design of the other 80; they at Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion summoned him to answer before the great Tribunal, and he within a Month run Mad, and died.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. AT this time <hi>Grada Hamed,</hi> King of the Country, called by some Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, <hi>Trogloditis,</hi> vulgarly <hi>Adel;</hi> having submitted himself to the Turk, to obtain Assistance of Men, casting off the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he owed to the Emperour of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> began furiously to over-run that Country with a Powerful Army. To excuse his Ambitious Designs, he laid hold of the Opportunity his Sovereigns tender years offered, and in a small time made himself Master of such part of <hi>Abassia,</hi> that the Emperour <hi>Atanad Sagad,</hi> or <hi>Claudius,</hi> was obliged to retire towards the Kingdom of <hi>Goiame,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Saban,</hi> or <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with the <hi>Barnagais,</hi> got into the rugged Mountain <hi>Dama,</hi> a place naturally impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, which rising to a prodigious height over a vast Plain, on its Top forms another almost Round and about a League over, in which is an indifferent Town, with Fruit and Cattel that maintains it.

2. The Queen reduced to this condition, hearing <hi>D. Stephen</hi> was in the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> sent <hi>Barnagais</hi> Embassadour to him, to desire his Assistance against that Tyrant, who over-running her Kingdoms destroyed the ancient Churches, and carried away Slaves the Religious Men and Priests. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour was heard, and received a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Answer. It was Resolved in Council to send Relief, and <hi>D. Christopher</hi> named Commander in Chief, of Four hundred Men it consisted of. He had with him eight Field-Pieces, many small Fire-Arms, and plenty of Ammunition. <hi>D. Iohn Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudez,</hi> the Patriarch, much desired by that Emperour to introduce the Roman Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, accompanied them. The two Brothers <hi>D. Stephen</hi> and <hi>D. Christopher</hi> took leave on the shoar, never to meet again: Let us conduct the one into <hi>India,</hi> and then return to the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. About <hi>Iuly</hi> the Governour was taken in such a violent Storm, that a Galliot sunk down right, a Barque was lost, and all the Fleet scattered. Many Religous Vows were made in the danger; but that of a private Souldier was pleasant, who Vowed he would marry <hi>D. Isabel de Sa,</hi> Daughter to <hi>D. Garcia de Sa,</hi> after Governour of <hi>India,</hi> and the applauded Beauty of all those parts, which afterwards gave pleasant matter of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. At length the Governour arrived at <hi>Goa,</hi> and perceiving the Ships did not come from <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that he was exhausted with the charge of the last Fleets, he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54711:300"/>
loaded the Goods, provided for the Ships expected, on four Galeons, and sent them away. <hi>Peter de D. Castello Branco,</hi> late Governor of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> Commanded one of these Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons, and was taken by the French near the Islands <hi>Azores.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Nizamoxa</hi> desired to possess himself of the Forts of <hi>Sangaça</hi> and <hi>Carnala,</hi> held by two Subjects of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> on the Frontiers of that Kingdom, and formidable for their strength and situation. The Commanders <hi>Nicoda Amorgin,</hi> and <hi>Atridican</hi> being absent, he assaults and enters them. The Owners had recourse for the Recovery of them to <hi>D.

He went in person with Three hundred <hi>Portugueses,</hi> a party of the Natives, and each of the Proprietors, Two hundred Men.

Those who at first fled fell into the second Ambush, and endeavouring to shun it returned to the first, with whom the others were engaged. The Moors thinking this had been a fresh Relief, fled; our Men took heart, and struck such Terrour into the Enemy, that running to <hi>Cangaça,</hi> they raised their Camp, leaving all the Ground about the Fort strowed with all sorts of Weapons and Ammunition. <hi>D. Francis</hi> returning from the Pursuit, found they had slain about 500,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54711:301"/>
and lost 20 Men. He stored the Forts, and went back to his Command.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. I shall relate a thing scarce Credible, but most true: In this Action a Giant-like Portugues of prodigious Strength, called <hi>Trancoso,</hi> seeing a Moor well wrapped in a large Veil falling from his Head, laid hold of him thereby, as if he had been a Buckler, and so carried him before his Breast, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon him all the stroaks of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Weapons, and thus continued, making him his Shield till the Fight was ended.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. However, considering the keeping of those Forts was of greater Charge and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than Advantage could be made of them; and because <hi>Nizamoxa,</hi> our Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, offered for them 5000 P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

9. <hi>Peter de Faria,</hi> who Commanded at <hi>Malaca,</hi> had received some Information of the Affairs and Seat of the Island <hi>del Oro,</hi> or <hi>of Gold,</hi> which was said to be in the Sea of the River <hi>Calandor,</hi> in five Degrees of South Latitude, 150 Leagues from the Point of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> encompassed with great Banks of Sand and strong Currents. He adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the King, who sent to that Discovery and Conquest <hi>Francis de Almeida,</hi> that died by the way. One <hi>Iames Cabral</hi> of <hi>Madera</hi> succeeded him, and the Governour <hi>Martin Alfonso de Sousa</hi> displaced him, to give that Charge to <hi>Hierom de Figueredo.</hi> He set out in the Year 1542, with 80 Men in three Ships, and laying aside the Enterprize, through Covetousness, went in search of some Ships of <hi>Meca</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Tanauçarim,</hi> took them, and in them a rich Booty; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing them their shares, they tied his Hands and Feet and left him on the Sands at <hi>Gale,</hi> in the Island <hi>Ceylon.</hi> Thus for that time was the King disappointed of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>

He was also to deliver Goods of the Value of Ten thousand Ducats to his Factor at <hi>Pam.</hi> They had made up Fifty thousand Crowns in Diamants, Pearls and Gold, and were ready to Sail next day, when a sudden Confusion hapning that Night, they lost all. There resided in that City an Embassadour from the King of <hi>Borneo,</hi> with his Wife. He catched the King of <hi>Pam</hi> lying with her, and killed him. The Death of the King being noised, the People ran about, not so much for Revenge, as to Rob. About Four thousand Men were presently butchered; the two Factors being robbed, and some of their Companions killed, esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and fled to <hi>Patane.</hi> They, and other <hi>Portugueses,</hi> asked leave of that King, to make Reprizal on three Vessels belonging to the Merchants of <hi>Pam,</hi> which came richly laden from <hi>China,</hi> and were then at Anchor 18 Leagues off in the River <hi>Calantam.</hi> He consented; they set out to the number of 80 in Three Ships, and after a sharp En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, took and brought the Vessels into <hi>Patane.</hi> The Prize was worth above Three hundred Thousand Ducats. The People of <hi>Patane</hi> pressed the King to take them from the <hi>Portugueses;</hi> but he urged the Fifty thousand Crowns ought to be made good. The Merchants accepted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

paid the Mony, and continued their Voyage.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. WHile what is above-related hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the Three years last past, <hi>Antony de Faria</hi> and <hi>Sousa,</hi> did Actions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Eternal Fame; which I shall relate without affection to our Kindred, but with my usual sincerity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Peter de Faria,</hi> Commander of <hi>Malaca,</hi> sent his Kinsman <hi>Antony de Faria</hi> and <hi>Sousa,</hi> to the King of <hi>Patane,</hi> to treat of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Affairs, and preserve the Peace, which was very beneficial to that place. He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him Goods to the Value of Twelve thousand Ducats, and finding no Sale for them there, sent them to the Port of <hi>Lugor,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> a place of great Trade, where he was informed they would go off to great advantage. He committed this Affair to <hi>Christopher Borallo,</hi> who being come to an Anchor in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54711:303"/>
Mouth of that River, was surprized by <hi>Coja Hazem,</hi> a Moor of <hi>Guzarate,</hi> in a Vessel well stored with Artillery, and Manned with 80 Turks a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>d Moors. This <hi>Coja</hi> was a sworn Enemy to the <hi>Portugueses</hi> ever since <hi>Hector de Silveyra</hi> took a Ship of his in the Sea of <hi>Diu,</hi> killing his Father and two Brothers, and had kept his Oath, robbing and murthering all he met.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Borallo</hi> thought himself happy that he escaped falling into the Pyrats hands, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Vessel and swimming ashoar. He carried the News to <hi>Antony Faria</hi> at <hi>Patane,</hi> who Vowed, never to desist till he had destroyed that Moor. This was the Motive that led him to all those brave Actions. He fitted a small Vessel with 50 Men, and sailed from <hi>Patane</hi> on Saturday the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>May.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. He steered North-East, towards the Kingdom of <hi>Champa,</hi> to examine that Coast, and saw the Island <hi>Pulo Condor,</hi> in the Latitude of 3 Degrees, 20 Minutes, then to the Eastward rounded one six Leagues from the Continent of <hi>Cambodia.</hi> Entring the Port of <hi>Bralapisam,</hi> he found there a Vessel of the <hi>Lequii,</hi> that had on board an Embassadour from the Prince of the Island <hi>Lossa,</hi> in the Latitude of 36 Degrees, to the King of <hi>Siam.</hi> As soon as this Vessel spied ours, they weighed Anchor and sailed. <hi>Faria</hi> sent after them a <hi>Chinese</hi> Pylot with a Civil Message, who brought back this remarkable Answer: <hi>We return Thanks; The time will come when our Nation shall have

commerce with that Captains in real Friendship, through the Law of the Supream God, whose Clemency is boundless, since by his death he gave life to all Mankind, and remains an everlasting Faith in the House of the Good: We confidently hold this will be when half the Times are past.</hi> He also brought a rich Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter in a Case of beaten Gold, the Hilt and Scabbord of the same set with some Pearls of value. The Captain would have made some Return, but the Vessel could not be overtaken.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Thence he Coasted to the River <hi>Pulo Cambier,</hi> which divides the Kingdoms of <hi>Cambodia</hi> and <hi>Tsiompa.</hi> At the Town <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timpar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="6">6. Coasting along still, he Anchored in the Mouth of the River <hi>Toobasoy,</hi> fearing to go up it. Suddenly they spied a great Vessel, to which making signs of Peace, they received a rude Answer. Night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, it was thought fit to expect the Day;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54711:304"/>
but in the Dark they discovered first one, then three Vessels, and Counterfeiting, they leapt 40 out of the first Vessel, boarded them, who were all slain, and their Vessel taken, the others burnt. A Black that was taken declared, He was a Christian and Slave to <hi>Gaspar de Melo,</hi> whom (with 26 <hi>Portugueses)</hi> that Pyrat had taken and dashed out their Brains, and that he had left another large Vessel richly laden in the Port with only a few Sea-men. This Pyrat was found to be <hi>Similau,</hi> and he (with the other Prisoners) were put to the same Death they delighted to give to others. As soon as Day appeared he took the other Vessel, and found the Booty in Silver only amounted to 60000 Ducats, besides other Goods.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Thus increased, he goes on to the River <hi>Tinacoreu,</hi> or <hi>Varela,</hi> where the <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>Malaca</hi> Ships, Trading for <hi>China,</hi> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Goods for Gold, Calamba and Ivory, with which that Country abounds. He Anchored off of <hi>Tayquileu,</hi> a small Town; the Inhabitants called them the <hi>Bearded People;</hi> not but those People have Beards, but theirs are short and thin, ours then were at their full growth, and some reached to the Waste. By them the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was informed, that River was formerly called <hi>Tauralachim,</hi> that is, <hi>Great Stock,</hi> to express its Greatness; it is deep for Eighty Leagues up to <hi>Moncalor,</hi> then shallower and wide, where is a Country for Eight days Journey Unpeopled, by a multitude of Birds, 40 years before the great Kingdom

of the <hi>Chintaleuho</hi>'s. In the middle of it is the great Lake <hi>Cunabetee,</hi> or <hi>Chiamay,</hi> whence spring four great Rivers. It is 180 Leagues in compass, beset with Mines of Silver, Copper, Tin and Lead.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Hence he directed his Course for the Island <hi>Hainan,</hi> passed in sight of <hi>Champiloo,</hi> in the Latitude of 13 Degrees, and at the entrance of the Bay of <hi>Cochinchina.</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on he discovered the Promontory <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locampas,</hi> whence is seen the Point of <hi>Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan:</hi> Westward is a River, up which <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallo</hi> was sent in a small Vessel with 16 Men, who discovered at least Two thousand Sail, and a large Walled Town.

In that Vessel were found 70000 Quintals or Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight of Pepper, much other Spice, Ivory, Tin, Wax and Powder, all valued at 60000 Crowns, besides good Cannon, Baggage and some Plate.

The Governour of the City somewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed the Sale, so they were obliged to

hasten it; the Goods were paid for in Silver uncoyned, and amounted to Two hundred thousand Crowns. This was the beginning of the Year 1541.</p>

Here he met <hi>Hinymilau,</hi> a bold Pyrat and a great Enemy to Christians, whom he delighted to put to cruel Deaths. They had a bloody Fight with, and at length took him. He gave a bold Relation of the Cruelties he had exercised against the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and was therefore with four more immediately killed. The Prize was valued at 70000 Ducats.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Action struck such a Terrour into many of those that were there in that River, that they sent a Message to <hi>Faria,</hi> offering him 30000 Crowns to take them into his Protection, calling him King of those Seas, and desiring of him Passes for their safe Trading therein. He received the Mony, and gave the Passes by only
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54711:306"/>
Writing, of which in Twelve days time a Servant of his got 6000 Ducats. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the City offered to make him Admiral of those Seas for the King of <hi>China,</hi> with a Pension of 9000 Crowns, if he would serve. Such a Name had he already got in those parts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They run all along this Coast with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remarkable Occurrence, only saw many, though not large Towns, and a very fruitful Country; and were informed, there were there Mines of Silver, Tin, Salt-Peter, and Brimstone. The Souldiers now weary of looking after the Pyrat <hi>Coja Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem,</hi> demanded their shares of the Prizes, to be gone. They agreed, and directed their Course for the Kingdom of <hi>Siam.</hi> By a furious Storm they were wrecked upon the Island <hi>De los Ladrones,</hi> where of Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, only Eighty six got ashoar naked; of these Twenty eight were <hi>Portugueses.</hi> Here they were fifteen days almost without any thing to eat. A Bird flying over them with a Fish, dropt it, and afterwards they saw many others, that frighted at their Shouts, let fall their Prey; this, and a Deer they found killed by a Tyger, kept them awhile, but some died with Want. Being thus in despair, because the Island was not Inhabited, they discovered a small Vessel making to the shoar, where they cast An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and presently Thirty Men landed; some carried Wood and Water, and others diverted themselves. They were <hi>Chineses.</hi> Our Men agreeing together upon a sign,

run furiously, and possessed themselves of the Vessel, and with the same swiftness put to Sea. The <hi>Chineses</hi> were astonished at that unexpected Misfortune, and our Men overjoyed, finding in the Vessel good Provision and much Silk. In the Barque they found only an Old man and a Child, whose Father was left ashoar.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Sailing for <hi>Liampo</hi> in Port <hi>Xamoy,</hi> they took a Vessel of <hi>Chineses,</hi> and went to the Island <hi>Luxitay,</hi> where they stayed fifteen days, went over to the great Vessel, and Refitted the small one, and then went on. Upon the Coast of <hi>Lamau</hi> they discovered a great Vessel, which as it came near be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fire Fifteen great Guns it carried; but coming closer, they discovered Crosses and Portugues Habits on both sides; so they hailed each other, and the Vessel appeared to belong to <hi>Quiay Panjau,</hi> a Chinese, and great Friend to the Portugueses, whereof he had Thirty Souldiers aboard. He came to <hi>Farias</hi>'s Vessel, and brought a present of Amber, Pearls, Gold and Silver, worth Two thousand Ducats. After other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course our Captain told him he was bound for <hi>Liampo,</hi> to furnish himself with Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, in order to attempt the Mines of <hi>Quamjaparu,</hi> where he was told he might get a Treasure. <hi>Quiay Panjau</hi> offered to accompany him, demanding for himself only the Third part of what should be taken; which was agreed.</p>

Putting to Sea again, he found eight Portugueses naked and wounded in a Fisher-Boat. They told him, the Pyrat <hi>Coja Hazem</hi> had taken their Ship in the Port of the Island <hi>Cumbor,</hi> that it was worth Two hundred thousand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, and that they with difficulty had escaped in that condition. <hi>Faria</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed to hear News of that Pyrat, and turned eight Leagues back to <hi>Layloo,</hi> to provide for the Fight. There he changed his Old Vessels for New, provided Arms, Ammunition and Men, paying generously for every thing. He had in his four Vessels Five hundred Men, whereof 95 Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses, 40 Pieces of Cannon, 160 Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, 6000 Darts, other Arms and much Ammunition. In a day and half he came to the Fisheries, where <hi>Coja Hazem</hi> had robbed those Portugueses, and was informed by Fishermen, that he was two Leagues off in the River <hi>Tinlau.</hi> To be sure, he sent one to discover him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Before Day began a most furious Fight, and the Pyrats four Ships were reduced to great streights, when four small ones came to their relief. One of our Cannon was so well pointed, that it sank the first of them downright, and killed some Men in another. The Fight was renewed, and <hi>Coja</hi> encouraged his Men, till <hi>Faria</hi> board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gave him such a Cut over the Head as struck him down without sense, and

with another stroak Ham-strung him, that he could not rise. His Men gave our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain three Wounds; but he being relieved, the Victory was compleat; it cost 43 Men, eight of them Portugueses. Of the Enemy almost 400 died, above half drowned, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over to save themselves.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Faria</hi> Landed, and buried his dead. He found in a House 96 Men left there by <hi>Coja Hazem</hi> to be cured; these, though they cried for Mercy, he destroyed, firing the House. Here he performed a most Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous act, which was, That he restored the Portugues Ship to the Owners, and gave liberty to the Slaves, paying their Masters, as he had Vowed when he went on this Design. What booty remained to him was worth 100000 Crowns.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Sailing hence that Night, rose such a violent Storm, that <hi>Faria</hi>'s Ship and another were cast away, and most of the Goods of the others was thrown Over-board, to the Value of Two hundred thousand Ducats.

The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was such, as obliged him to resolve to hazard all, to obtain by force what he could not effect with Courtesie and Mony Our Men were fearful of the greatness of the Enterprize; but he so encouraged them,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54711:308"/>
that they resolved to follow him. He had in all 470 Men, 60 of them <hi>Portugueses;</hi> out of the whole he chose 300 for this Action, which hapned the beginning of the Year 1542.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. After sending another Civil Message, to which the Governour answered by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Messenger, he Landed; as they marched, Twelve thousand Foot and an hundred Horse came out of the City to meet them; our Musqueteers killed at least Three hundred of them, and pursued the rest to a Bridge that led into the City. The Governour was within on Horseback with Six hundred Men, maintaining the Pass till killed by a Shot; at that sight his Men fled; <hi>Faria</hi> pursues them with great slaughter till they run out at the other end of the Town. The City being plundered, he that got least was Rich; the remainder was consumed to Ashes. Our Victorious Captain returned, carrying the Prisoners he had recovered, and many beautiful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. He lost eight Men, one a <hi>Portugues,</hi> and many wounded. Now he prosecutes his Voyage towards the Mines.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Course was to <hi>Pulo Hindor,</hi> an Island not inhabited, where he designed to Winter and take some Rest; it was fifteen Leagues off. About the Islands of <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> he was attacked by two great Ships, in which were Two hundred Resolute Men, Commanded by the Pyrat <hi>Premata Gundel,</hi> a mortal Enemy to the Portugueses, to whom he had done great harm; but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54711:308"/>
thought now these had been <hi>Chinese</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. One of the Pyrats boarding one of ours, <hi>Quiay Panjau</hi> came to his Relief with all his Sails abroad, and run so furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously foul of the Pyrat, that they both sunk down right. <hi>Quiay</hi> and most of his Men were saved by the care of our Men. The Pyrat himself had boarded <hi>Faria,</hi> who was in danger of being lost; but at length was Victorious, killing 90 Moors that had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred his Ship. Then he boarded the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and put all to the Sword. This cost us 17 Men, five of them Portugueses, above forty were wounded, and <hi>Faria</hi> himself had two great Cuts and a hurt of a Spear. The Prize was valued at 120000 Ducats. They staid 20 Days in the Island <hi>Buncaleu,</hi> to cure the Wounded men. Thence they steered to the Gates of <hi>Liampo,</hi> which are two Islands three Leagues distant from the City of that Name, built by the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses, who there Governed in the nature of a Commonwealth.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>ANntony de Faria</hi> being Anchored at those Gates of <hi>Liampo,</hi> sent to ask leave of the Inhabitants to enter the Port: They returned a courteous Answer, praying him to defer it six days, till they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a House to entertain him. The term expired upon Sunday Morning, when he hoised Sail and went up accompanied with many Boats sent from the Town to receive him, with Three hundred Townsmen, who saluted and welcomed him, the River re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounding with the noise of Musical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. About Two hundred Ships then in the Port were placed in two Lines, and made a Lane, through which as <hi>Faria</hi> passed, all the Cannon of the Vessels and ashoar were fired. Some <hi>Chineses</hi> seeing this great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, asked Whether that was the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Brother, or near Kinsman; and were Answered, He was his Smiths Son; which so surprized them, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> to be the greatest in the World. From his Ship
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54711:309"/>
                        <hi>Faria</hi> went into a Barge shaded with a Natural Chesnut Tree, the Fruit hanging on the Boughs, and was seated on a Silver Chair placed upon six Steps adorned with Gold. On the sides were six beautiful Maids richly clad, who sang and play'd sweetly; and thus he was carried to the Key.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Where was a richer Chair carried upon Mens shoulders, covered with a rich Canopy; about it 60 Halberdeers, and before it went 16 Men mounted on fine Horses, before these eight with Silver Maces, all in most rich Attire. <hi>Faria</hi> long refused to be thus carried, but was forced to subm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>, and in this manner came to a large Scaffold, covered with fine Tapistry. There he was placed on his Chair, and received the Complements of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in the Name of the City, and of others for the Gentry. He received them standing, and returned their Courtesie with great Civility.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. From the Key to the City, which was a considerable distance, was a Lane in nature of an Arbour of Chesnut, Pine and Laurel Trees, the Ground strewed with Flowers; at distances many Perfumes, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Companies of Dancers, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of People all the way. At the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Town was a Castle built for this Occasion. On the Front of it, the Arms of the <hi>Faria's,</hi> which are Sanguin, a Tower Argent, in Base a Man torn to pieces. <hi>Faria</hi> being come hither, was received by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54711:310"/>
a Reverend Old man (attended by four Mace-Bearers) who after some Ceremonies made a long Speech in praise of his Family, and concluded extolling his own Actions, and welcoming him to that place.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Speech ended, the old Orator in the Name of the City, offered him five Chests full of Silver Bars, to the Value of Twenty thousand pieces of Eight, which he could not be prevailed with to accept of; but returned his Thanks, and promised to endeavour in part to deserve the Honours they did him. Then he went on foot through many sightly Arches to our <hi>Ladies</hi> Church, where (under a Canopy) he heard Mass, and a Sermon of his own Praises.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Hence he was conducted by above a Thousand <hi>Portugueses,</hi> to a large place that was before the House, provided for his Entertainment. This place was shaded with variety of Trees set, as if they had grown there, the Ground strewed with Flowers and sweet Herbs. In the middle were three long Tables richly covered, and Side-boards. <hi>Faria</hi> being seated, all departed, but about 80 who were to Dine there, and 50 Souldiers. At a distance stood the Halberdeers to keep off the People. As soon as seated, the Musick began to play.</p>

7. Presently eight beautiful Maids ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared playing on Instruments and Danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eight others stood by him singing. The Dishes were brought by fine Women, and set on by Men. The Plenty and Cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness was great. After Dinner they went to another place, where there was a Bull-Feast, and some wild Horses among them; at the death of every one followed Danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Musick, and other Divertisements.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. HEre <hi>Faria</hi> continued five Months always entertained with great splendour, and had Dogs and Horses to go a Hunting, that place being stored with all sorts of Game. The time being come to set out for the Mines of <hi>Quamgiparu,</hi> the Chinese <hi>Quiay Panjau,</hi> who was to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him in that Voyage, was snatched away by a violent Sickness. All things were in forwardness when the Chinese, <hi>Similau,</hi> dissuaded <hi>Faria</hi> from that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, representing the great Difficulties, and proposing other Undertakings much more easie, and no less beneficial. Among
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54711:311"/>
the rest he said Great things of the Island <hi>Calempluy,</hi> where were the ancient Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Kings of <hi>China,</hi> and in them great Treasures. To this he soon gave Ear; for Covetousness is of great force to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, even in a Man so generous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding as he was. Happy if he had returned to <hi>India,</hi> satisfied with his past Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories and Triumph.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. About the middle of <hi>May</hi> he set Sail with <hi>Similau</hi> in two Galliots, in which were 146 Men, 52 of them Portugueses, and among them the Priest <hi>Iames Lobato.</hi> Next day they discovered the Islands of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitur,</hi> and then entred Seas till then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to Portugueses. Crossing a Gulph of 40 Leagues, they discovered the high Mountain <hi>Nangalaci,</hi> and held on their Course Northward. At the end of Ten days they Anchored in a River where they saw White People, like the <hi>Chineses,</hi> but differing in Language, and could never prevail to have any commerce with them. After Eight days sailing they entred the Streight of <hi>Silcapaquim,</hi> in which they spent five days in sight of many populous Towns. But this Course appearing dangerous, they steered another by the advice of <hi>Similau.</hi> This was up the River <hi>Humhepadam,</hi> which they entred, and to the West saw the Mountain <hi>Fangus,</hi> and thirteen days after the Bay <hi>Buxipalem,</hi> in the Latitude of 30 Degrees, which produces Fish, Serpents and Crocodils of wonderful sorts and greatness, and many Sea-Horses. Farther on they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54711:311"/>
came into the Bay of <hi>Calindam,</hi> girt with high Mountains covered with Trees, from them four great Rivers fall into the Sea.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Next they sailed under <hi>Botinasora,</hi> a Mountain abounding in Lions, Abada's, Tygers, Ounces, and other wild Beasts; then <hi>Gangitann,</hi> the habitation of the <hi>Giga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hui,</hi> a wild Gigantick People, some ten, some eleven Spans high, of which they saw fourteen of both Sexes: They have good Complexions, being white and red; but ill Features. <hi>Faria</hi> gave them some Porcelane Dishes and Silk, for which they appeared thankful, but could not be understood, and brought some Cows and a Deer. At length they came into the Bay of <hi>Nanking,</hi> and within six days to the great City <hi>Pamor</hi> whose Bay was almost hid under Three thousand Vessels. Fearing Danger here, they stood off and came to <hi>Tanquilem,</hi> where <hi>Similau</hi> and Thirty six Chinese Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men run away for fear; because our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain weary of the Voyage, and finding he could give no good Account where they were, had threatned to kill him. He was not so ignorant; but terrified with the ill Usage of the Portugueses he knew not what he said, and they feared either he knew not the Coast, or designed to betray them. It was a great Error, to believe him at <hi>Liampo,</hi> and use him ill at <hi>Nanking,</hi> where they had most need of him. In fine, They gave themselves for lost, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where they were, till some of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54711:312"/>
informed them, they were but Ten Leagues from the Island <hi>Calempluy,</hi> which made them repent the wrong they had done <hi>Similau.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Turning Cape <hi>Guinaytarau</hi> (after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Voyage of two Months and a half) they discovered in the middle of the River the Island. It is plain, and to appearance four Miles in compass. It was then Night: Next Morning <hi>Faria</hi> went about it with his Galliots, and saw it was enclosed with a Wall of Jasper Stone, which were joyned so close, it appeared all of a piece. It rose about 19 Foot above the superficies of the Water, and was terrassed within. The Top of the Wall was a massy Twist: Upon it were Brass Rails, and at distances little Columns, on which were the Statues of Women with Balls in their Hands, all of the same Metal. At some distance from these appeared several Figures of Iron of Monstrous shape, that seemed to give one another their Hands. Farther yet were several curious Arches of Stone of many Colours: Within was seen afterwards a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful variety of small Woods of Orange Trees; among which were 366 Chappels, dedicated to the Gods of the Year. On one side a great Building, not all of a piece, but divided into seven parts, all over glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering with Gold.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:54711:312"/>
5. In the Evening the Captain entred the Island at one of its eight Gates, with sixty Men, four of them Portugueses. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring one of the Chappels, they saw an Old Man, in appearance an hundred years of Age, who with the fright of seeing them fell down; but recovering, and seeing the Souldiers take out the Bars of Silver out of the Tombs, he rebuked the Captain, giving him Advice to be saved. <hi>Faria</hi> courteously took his leave, having Information what was in the other Chappels, and resolving next day to plunder them all, he retired to his Ships with the Silver taken in this, which was a considerable quantity.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. About Midnight there appeared Lights upon the Top of the Great Building, and Bells began to ring throughout the Island. <hi>Faria</hi> was advised to be gone, being they were discovered; but he returned to the Island with only six Men, and could see no more than what he had from his Vessels. Being returned aboard, all protested he ought to retire, and he no longer able to withstand the Mutiny; said, <hi>He was obliged in Honour to see what he fled from;</hi> and went ashoar again with the same six Men. He entred a Chappel and found two Old Men, whom he brought away with some Candlesticks and a Silver Idol he found, and immediately left that place. He understood by the Old Men, that the Alarum was given, and the Island would soon be relieved; that the first Hermit had given Notice. Then <hi>Faria</hi> found, how
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54711:313"/>
much he had erred in not bringing him away, as he was Advised.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. He went away in a Passion, that he should lose that Treasure through his own fault; and having sailed almost a Month, one Night, being the fifth of <hi>August,</hi> there arose such a terrible Storm; that his Galliot was swallowed up, as was guessed by those in the other by the miserable Cries; for they could not see it. A few days after the other also perished, only fourteen of them escaping. Thus ended that brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; doubtless a just Judgment for the Robbery he designed to commit.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. No less Unfortunate was the End of the City <hi>Liampo,</hi> where this Captain had been so Nobly received, and was the effect of a base and insatiable Avarice. <hi>Lancelot Pereyra,</hi> a Judge of that City having lost a Thousand Ducats by the Chineses, went out with a Body to rob and plunder others, as if this might be done though they have been the Debtors. This barbarous, hellish Action, brought the Governour of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince with Threescore thousand Men upon that City, which in four hours time was burnt, with Eighty Ships that were in the Port; Twelve thousand Men killed, of them a Thousand <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and three Millions of Gold lost. Scarce any thing was left, but the bare Memory of <hi>Liampo;</hi> but it appeared that whatever the <hi>Portugueses</hi> gained by their Valour, they lost by their Covetousness. It was admirably said of one of those we call Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54711:313"/>
the Actions of the Portugueses in <hi>Asia</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated: His Words were these; <hi>Let them go on; for whatever they gain as Couragious Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they will lose as Covetous Merchants: They now conquer</hi> Asia, Asia <hi>will soon conquer them.</hi> Who was most Barbarous; he that said this, or they who did what he said?</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Liampo</hi> had above Three thousand Inhabitants, all Catholicks, and almost half Portugueses. Those who escaped that Storm, though quite discredited among the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses, obtained leave with great Presents, in the Year 1547, to Settle in the Port of <hi>Chincheo;</hi> where there was a Village, which began to flourish with a rich Trade; but came to the same End as the other, as shall appear the Year 1549.</p>

Through this they marched in two days to the City <hi>Barua,</hi> Metropolis of the Province <hi>Barnagasso;</hi> though damaged by the late Invasion, yet of sightly Buildings, divided by a great River, encompassed with good Villages and Country-houses. At the Gates they were received by several Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Men singing a Litany, one of which made a Speech to Welcom them, and extol their Generosity in coming to their relief; after which our Men visited the Church, and Encamped.</p>

2. <hi>Don Christopher</hi> sent Advice of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival to the Emperour, who was far off; and to the Queen Mother, who was near. He desired of her, to leave that Mountain and put her self under his guard. <hi>Barnagais</hi> was sent to Conduct her with two Companies of Portugueses. She came with a great Retinue of Women and Servants. Our Men were drawn out to receive her, and the Cannon fired. The Queen sat upon a Mule, whose Trappings reached the ground, and she was hid by Curtins fixed to the Saddle; her Cloathing was white, on her Shoulders a short black Mantle with gold Fringes; and from her white Head-Cloaths fell a Veil that covered her Face. <hi>Barnagais</hi> led the Mule, his Arm naked, and a Tygers Skin upon his Shoulders, (a Token of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect) a Lord on each side in the same Garb. She opened the Curtains to see the Portugueses, and lifted her Veil to be seen by <hi>D. Christopher.</hi> The Reception on both sides was Courteous. Afterwards <hi>D. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher</hi> went to Visit Her, and by Advice of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> it was resolved to Winter there, and expect the Emperour's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Answer came, expressing his Joy for the Arrival of the Portugueses, and desiring <hi>D. Christopher</hi> to march the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Summer. It was put in execution: Some Light Horse led the Van to discover; then followed the Artillery, next the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage; after it the Queen, guarded by fifty Portugues Musqueteers. <hi>D. Christopher</hi>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:54711:315"/>
brought up the Reer; <hi>Barnagais</hi> and his Officers made up the Flanks. In eight days they came to the Mountain <hi>Ganè,</hi> of most difficult ascent; on the Top of it was a City, and on the highest Cliff a Chappel, near which a House, hung round with Three hundred embalmed Bodies, sewed up in Hides, which being rent with Age shewed the Bodies white and uncorrupt. Some were of Opinion they were Roman Conquerors of that Country; others, and among them the Patriarch, supposed them to be Martyrs. At the sight of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses, many of the People resorted to the Queen.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Don Christopher</hi> marched on to the Mountain <hi>Canete,</hi> well Watered and stored with Cattle, impregnable by Nature, and yet strengthned by Art. Formerly the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours were Crowned here; now it was held for the Tyrant by a Thousand Men, who at times came down to Ravage the Country. <hi>D. Christopher,</hi> contrary to the Advice of the Queen and her Counsel, resolved to assault that Den of Thieves. He divided his Men into three parts, and led the one himself, and boldly assaulted the Three Passes that led to it; but were forced this day to desist, by reason of the great Stones the Enemy rouled down upon them. Having heared Mass on <hi>Candlemass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> they returned to the Assault, playing their Cannon, and lost some Men by the Stones thrown down; yet they came to the first Gates and broke them open, making
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54711:315"/>
their way with much slaughter and loss of three Men to the second Gates. Those who were within these and the third Gates, seeing so few of our Men, opened them, and the Portugueses as freely rushed in; where was a hot Dispute, till <hi>D. Christopher</hi> and the others coming up, pressed the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my so hard, that many of them threw themselves headlong down the Rocks. Many Women and Children were taken, and there was a considerable Plunder. The Queen and her Retinue went up with a general Admiration; the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> having always held that Fort to be impregnable. The Patriarch blessed a Mosque, dedicating it to our Lady, where Mass was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with great Joy to both Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Mountain being provided, and garrisoned under the Command of an <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> the Army marched. As they entred the Country of the Rebel <hi>Iarse,</hi> he submitted himself to the Queen, and brought his Men to her Service, thinking nothing could withstand those who had conquered Nature; in such Esteem did they hold the taking the Mountain. The King of <hi>Zeila</hi> came on now, covering the Plains and Hills with his Numbers, and joyful to have to do with our Men. <hi>D. Christopher</hi> Encamped in good Order near a Mountain, both Armies in sight. <hi>Palm</hi> Sunday and Monday were spent in Skirmishing with equal Loss, only the Portugueses had so much the Advantage,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54711:316"/>
that the Enemy retired to their Works. <hi>D. Christopher</hi> was forced to move his Camp for want of some necessaries, chiefly Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The King of <hi>Zeila</hi> perceiving their motion from the higher Ground, came down to encompass our Men, who marched in good Order, pouring their Shot in upon the Enemy: Who pressing on, <hi>D. Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> ordered <hi>Emanuel de Cuna</hi> with his Men to face them, who performed it so suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully, that he obliged a Body of Turks to retire, after losing many of their Men. They rallied, and coming on again had somewhat distressed him, till <hi>D. Christopher</hi> came in person to their Relief, fighting with such Resolution, that he felt not he was wounded in the Leg. The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self came on, thinking to put an end to the days Action, and it turned to his loss; for our Cannon cut off many of his Men. <hi>D. Christopher</hi> was in danger of being slain, but still lost no Courage, and the Fight continued till the Tyrant was struck down by a shot which pierced his Thigh. His Men furled their Colours, and fled with him, as they thought dead, though he was alive. This Victory cost eleven Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses, two of them Men of Note. The Queen her self with great alacrity tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Don Christopher</hi> and all the wounded Men.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. After a Weeks respit, the Army marched towards the Enemy, who was Encamped at no great distance, and came to meet them, carrying their King in an
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54711:316"/>
open Chair. It was Resolutely fought on both sides. A Turkish Captain with fifty Horse thinking to recover the Honour lost the other day, Charged in the midst of our Men, and was entirely cut off. <hi>D<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher</hi> mounting on Horseback, led his Men with such fury into the Heat of the Battle, that he obliged the Enemy with great slaughter to turn their Backs. The King had infallibly been taken, had there been more Horse to pursue him. Eight Portugueses were lost in this Action: The Victorious Army marching down to a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant River, found it possessed by the Enemy, who immediately quitted it, the King flying at the sight of our Men.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The King sent an Embassy to the Bassa of <hi>Zibit,</hi> acquainting him with his Distress: He mollified by Presents, sent him almost a Thousand Turkish Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers. <hi>D. Christopher</hi> Wintered in the City <hi>Ofar,</hi> expecting the Emperour. Here a Jew proposed, That if he wanted Horses and Mules, he would shew him a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not far off inhabited by Jews, where there was store of both. The King of <hi>Zeyla</hi> had a Garrison of Four hundred Men there. <hi>D. Christopher</hi> having enquired into the truth of this Information, marched with two Companies of his own, and some Ethiopians, to the Foot of the Mountain, which is twelve Leagues about. In the Ascent some Moors, who guarded the Passes, were killed. On the Top met him the Captain with all his Men. <hi>D. Christopher</hi>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:54711:317"/>
immediately rnnning at, struck him down dead with his Lance. Our Shot being poured in among the Moors, they soon quitted the place and fled, leaving many dead. Great quantity of Horses and Mules were found, and about eight Thousand Jews, who lived in six or seven Villages on that Mountain, were brought under Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. There was a Tradition, That these Jews dispersed about <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Nubia,</hi> are descended from some of the dispersion of the Ten Tribes.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Jew, who led our Men, astonished at their Valour, was Converted and Baptized, and by common Consent appointed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of that Mountain, which being called before <hi>Caloa,</hi> was after known by the Name of the <hi>Iews Mountain.</hi> The second day after <hi>D. Christopher</hi> returned to the Army; the King of <hi>Zeila</hi> appeared now more bold with the increase of the Turkish Musqueteers. <hi>D. Christopher</hi>'s Youth now transported him as well as his Valour: For whereas he ought to have retired to a Mountain till the Emperour joyned him, it being impossible to withstand so great a force, he never considered it till it was too late. On the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> the Turks gave the Onset, and were repulsed by <hi>D. Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> who lost four Men and went off wounded in the Leg: <hi>Emanuel de Cuna</hi> did the like Service, with loss of three Men. <hi>Francis de Abreu</hi> fighting like a Lion was killed, and his Brother <hi>Humphry</hi> going to fetch him off, fell down dead upon him.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54711:317"/>
                        <hi>D. Christopher</hi> returns like a furious Tyger, and performed Wonders, till a Musquet-Ball broke his Arm; a couragious Souldier carried him off. He was scarce drest, when he heard <hi>Fonseca</hi> and <hi>Vello</hi> were killed, and the Enemy entred the Works. He caused himself to be carried where the greatest Danger was: But the Tyrant being now undoubtedly Victorious, some of our Men fled, as did the Patriarch and the Queen on Fleet Mares, each taking a different Way, he for fear and she by choice. <hi>D. Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> sent after and obliged her to come back, because her absence brought utter Ruin. But at length seeing all lost, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair he grasped his Sword in the Left Hand and said, <hi>Let who will follow me, for I am going to dye amidst the Enemies.</hi> He was drawn from that Resolution by meer force, and carried out of the Field with only fourteen Men, and the Queen and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gais</hi> among them, seeking some place of Refuge. The Night being dark they lost the Way; but the Queen and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagais</hi> hit it better, taking up a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. <hi>D. Christopher</hi> wandring with his Companions, fell into the hands of the Enemy, who carried him to the Tyrant, who coveted no greater Prize. The Victors cruelly run, hewing those that had any Life left them, which moved one to set fire to a quantity of Powder that was in one of the Queens Tents, and blew up all that were about it.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:54711:318"/>
9. The King overjoyed that <hi>D. Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> was taken, caused him to be brought to his presence, and said, <hi>What would you have done with me, had I been defeated?</hi> He Answered: <hi>I would cut off your Head, and divide your Body, and the Limbs should be set up in Publick places for a Terrour to other Tyrants.</hi> The King caused him to be buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted with his Slaves Buskins, his Body to be bathed in melted Wax, and his Beard wove with waxed Threads, which were fired, and he led through the Army. Being brought back, the King himself cut off his Head; his Body was quartered and set upon Poles. It is said, Where the Head fell there gushed out a Spring, the Water whereof drank cured many Diseases: The same hour, the Air being calm, a Tree was tore out by the Roots in the Garden of certain Religious Men; and afterwards the same Hour the Emperour having vanquished this Tyrant, caused his Head to be struck off; the Tree that was then dry, re-planted it self in the same place, and was covered with Leaves.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Most of the Portugueses that were taken, perished in Slavery or Dungeons. <hi>Alfonso Chaldeira,</hi> with Thirty, followed the Queen. <hi>Emanuel de Cuna,</hi> with Forty, got to <hi>Barnagasso,</hi> and was well received. Others followed the Patriarch; they made up in all One hundred and thirty: Whereof Ninety (because <hi>Cuna</hi> with his Forty Men were too far off) went to the Emperour, who then drew near, and very much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54711:318"/>
the slaughter of that Body, and loss of such a Commander. What those Portugueses did in the Service of that Prince afterwards, does not belong to this place; because the Affairs of <hi>India,</hi> whence we have made a long digression call upon us.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THe Governour <hi>D. Stephen</hi> perceiving the Ships from <hi>Portugal</hi> stayed long, and guessing they were at <hi>Mozambique,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to make use of the Merchandize they brought. To this purpose he sent <hi>Luis de Mendez</hi> to <hi>Vasconcelos,</hi> in a Galley, to give Orders about it, and to Advertize him, Whether a Successor was sent him in those Ships. He guessed not ill; for <hi>Martin Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso de Sousa</hi> sent to succeed him with five Ships, was detained at <hi>Mozambique</hi> by the Weather, and a tedious Sickness.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Fleet was happy, in that it brought over to <hi>India</hi> one of the first Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Society of <hi>Iesus;</hi> as well in respect of Time, as that he was one of the Chief in Piety and Virtue. This was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54711:319"/>
the Famous St. <hi>Francis Xaverius,</hi> who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured much, and was very successful in converting those Infidels.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. St. <hi>Francis</hi> was the first that had in the East, the Dignity of <hi>Apostolick Legate</hi> in all <hi>Asia.</hi> But because we shall hereafter have occasion to touch upon his great Virtues, and wonderful Actions, let this suffice here as to the time of his coming.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Most of them that enter upon the Government of <hi>India,</hi> look upon it as no small happiness, if they can send off their Predecessor with Disgrace, and therefore endeavour to come upon them by way of surprize. <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> desiring to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass that, commanded <hi>Leuis Mendez</hi> not to acquaint <hi>D. Stephen,</hi> that he had found him at <hi>Mozambique.</hi> But <hi>Mendez,</hi> who was <hi>D. Stephens</hi> Kinsman, and resolved to do his Duty, sent a man to carry him Advice. <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> heard of it, and imprisoned him. He met with bad Weather in his Way to <hi>Goa,</hi> and light upon <hi>Iames Suarez de Melo,</hi> called the <hi>Gallego,</hi> who flying a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death he had incurred, was passed to <hi>India,</hi> and with 120 Men in two Vessels, was become a Pyrat. Him <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> received and pardoned, because he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he could say much against <hi>D. Stephen.</hi> Much he might have said that was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, very little to his Discredit. What ought to have procured him severer Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was the cause of his favourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Let us remember this <hi>Suarez,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to Rise more than was due to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54711:319"/>
him, by these hellish Contrivances; and we shall hereafter see him rise to the highest pitch, and then cast down to the depth of Misery.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Martin Alfonso de Sousa</hi> being come to an Anchor in the Port of <hi>Goa,</hi> sent Advice of his Arrival to <hi>D. Stephen</hi> at a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable Hour, being the dead of Night, and that in such manner, as well signified the Ill-will he bore him. Which obliged <hi>D. Stephen</hi> to send an Answer unworthy of them both, and to make him a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie Visit, when he resigned up the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to him. <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> sound nothing to lay to the Charge of <hi>D. Stephen,</hi> as those desired, who set him upon it; for he being a Gentleman of much Honour, could never desire it of himself.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But whereas he ought to have check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself, finding nothing against him, he grew the more obstinate: For it is Natural to men in the wrong to persist, and believe they take Wing when they are deepest stuck in the Mire. He vented his Malice in allowing him the worst Conveniences for his Voyage, and <hi>D. Stephen</hi> was so disgusted at these Proceedings, that he never saw his Face after he resigned the Sword to him. At length he Arrived in <hi>Portugal;</hi> for his Enemies had no power on the Seas and Winds, and was received with general Joy of the Court, and with Favour by the King; who offering him a Wife, he refused her, and thereupon (as others for Accepting) was put out of Favour. He
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54711:320"/>
obtained leave, and went to live at <hi>Venice;</hi> for <hi>Portugal</hi> was always ready to despise or banish Great Men. The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth persuaded him to return to his Country, assuring him of his Prince's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. He returned and found none; for Princes are more fixed in punishing a little omitted to please, than in rewarding much done to serve them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This is what <hi>D. Stephen</hi> did in <hi>India;</hi> this the Reward he had for Governing it well. He was of a middle Stature, thick and strong, a thick Beard and black Hair, his Complexion ruddy. He was very Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and not a little Positive, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause: A great Horseman. In the number of Governours the Twelfth, first of the Name, second of the Sirname, and held it two years and a Month. He made an Inventory of what he was worth when he entred upon the Government, and so when he left it, and was found 40000 Crowns the worse, the full Value having been 200000. On his Tomb is only this Epitaph, <hi>HE THAT MADE KNIGHTS ON MOUNT</hi> SINAI <hi>ENDED HERE.</hi> So much did he value the Honour of that Action, and not without Reason.</p>

                        <p>The Government of <hi>Martin Alfonso de Sousa,</hi> from the Year 1542, till the Year 1545, in the Reign of King <hi>JOHN</hi> the Third.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THis Chapter must begin with what hapned in the time of both Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, one ending and the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing. <hi>Homaum Paxa,</hi> King of the Mogols prosecuting his Ambitious Designs of enlarging his Empire, undertook the Conquest of the Kingdom of <hi>Patane,</hi> then possessed by <hi>Xa Holan,</hi> whom Fortune had once much favoured, and now seemed to neglect. Nothing withstood the Mogol, till he came to the City <hi>Xamanea,</hi> before which he fat down. His Enemy encamped a League off on the other side of <hi>Ganges,</hi> and entertained him with continual Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, generally with equal Loss. <hi>Homaum</hi> still pressed, and <hi>Halon</hi> despairing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving him by open Force, had recourse to Stratagem, wherein he was singular. He endeavoured to protract the Time the best he could, till the Season that <hi>Ganges</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows, which generally drowns all the Plain for the space of eight Leagues. Mean while he dug vast Ponds to receive the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54711:321"/>
River, and then dammed it up; and as the Floods began to swell he broke the Damms, which caused the Waters to spread abroad with the greater violence. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>us all on a sudden, when the Mogol least thought of it, they gushed out upon his Army, and before he imagined it swallowed up 50000 of his Men, and an infinite quantity of Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Homaum,</hi> by the help of a Carrier, escaped upon a Mule; and the Queen, who was with Child, on an Elephant. The Queen was delivered of a Daughter, and fearing her Husband should hate her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not a Son, she changed it for one the Wife of a <hi>Cornaca</hi> had then brought forth. <hi>Cornaca's</hi> are the Men that govern the Elephants. Some said the Child, thought to be changed, was got on the Queen by the <hi>Cornaca,</hi> there being a suspicion he had had to do with her upon the Elephant. There is no need of disputing the Possibility of the thing; for on the Elephants are Castles, those Castles loansom, and Solitude and Idleness produce wanton Thoughts. Queens are Women, and Women have ready Wits. However it was, <hi>Homaum</hi> esteemed the Son as his own, and he was called <hi>Gelaldim Hacbar.</hi> As to his person, he was more like the <hi>Cornaca,</hi> than <hi>Homaum;</hi> but the Endowments of his Mind were equal with the Greatest of Men. This Prince, when he came to the Crown, being offended at the Innundations of <hi>Ganges,</hi> prevented them by drawing it into several
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54711:321"/>
Channels, and built there a Palace of such Wonderful structure, that Ten thousand Men spent Thirty years in the Work. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maum</hi> being come to the City <hi>Delhi,</hi> cloathed the Carryer in Royal Robes, entertaining him with a splendid Train, and made him sit three days in the Regal Throne; during which time he enjoyed the whole Revenue of the Crown, and had the full power of Government. From this time forward a Mule was stamped upon all his Coyn, that even the Beast might not pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. About the same time <hi>Antony de Mota, Francis Zeymoto,</hi> and <hi>Antony Peixoto,</hi> sailing for <hi>China,</hi> were thrown by a Storm among the Islands of <hi>Nipongi,</hi> or <hi>Nifon;</hi> by the Chineses called <hi>Gipon,</hi> and by us <hi>Iapan.</hi> In one of these they were well received, and had the Honour to be the first that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them, though accidentally. They lye far Eastward of all <hi>India,</hi> opposite to <hi>China,</hi> between 30 and 40 Degrees of North Latitude. They are many; the Principal, <hi>Nipongi,</hi> or <hi>Iapan,</hi> in which is the City <hi>Meaco,</hi> the Imperial Court. According to the Natives, the Length of the Island is 366 Leagues, according to our computation One hundred less: It is divided into Fifty six Governments. The Chief Islands about it are <hi>Cikoko, Tokoesi, Sando, Sisime, Bacasa, Vuoqui, Taquixima</hi> and <hi>Firando.</hi> The Japans have the vain Pride to esteem themselves descended from the Gods. They say a great Giant made the World of a Cocks
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54711:322"/>
Egg, and of the Earthly part a Woman, who engendring with a Crocodile brought forth a Man, from whom they descend. And the Family of the <hi>Conguis</hi> among them to this day wear Tails like those of Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles hanging at their Breeches in token, they are the immediate Line. The truth is, they are descended from a Chinese Prince, who being banished passed thither; but they are so vain, they would rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from a Cock and a Crocodile, than from the Chineses. In Matters of Religion they have several Sects: That of the <hi>Xexuni,</hi> who deny the Immortality of the Soul, and is followed by the Nobility; it is not only in <hi>Iapan</hi> they follow it: That of the <hi>Foc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenxuni,</hi> who adore the Sun, and allow a Second Life: The <hi>Xodexuni,</hi> that adore the Idol which they think saves them, if they name it: That of <hi>Xocoxu,</hi> who believe there is a Reward for the Good, and Punishment for the Wicked, and is followed by the Country People: That of <hi>Xamabuxe,</hi> the Professors whereof adore the Devils, and converse with them so familiarly, that when one would be Revenged of another, he orders them to enter into him; they call them with a Horn. Their Priests are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bonzes:</hi> But above all they adore an Idol called <hi>Seuto,</hi> who lives in Heaven, and is the beginning of all things. Parricide and Treason, they hold as sins that cannot be forgiven. Pity this Doctrin should not be held among those that pretend to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>

4. <hi>Fernan Mendez Pinto,</hi> in his Travels, appropriates this Discovery to himself; Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>He came to the Island</hi> Tanixuma (which I suppose to be <hi>Taquixima,</hi> one of those about <hi>Iapan) with his two Companions</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Borallo <hi>and</hi> James Zeimoto; <hi>not by way of Shipwreck; but designedly, in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a Pyrat, who had taken them up when cast away.</hi> Both Relations mention three Names, one of them is the same in both, and both agree upon the same Year 1542. I will say something I find in that Author, because it is rare and worthy Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Nautaquim</hi> was then Prince of that Island, and seeing the three Portugueses he stood amazed, and uttered these mysterious words: <hi>Let me dye, if these</hi> (meaning the Portugueses) <hi>be not the</hi> Chinchicogies <hi>our ancient Records speak of, who flying over the Waters, shall come to be Lords of the Lands where God placed the greatest Riches of the World; and it will be very fortunate for us, if they come as Friends.</hi> Let us return to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The first thing the Governour did, was lessening the Souldiers pay; for saving of Charges is a great means to gain the Favour of Princes: And Ministers never express their Zeal, by retrenching their own large Allowances; but by cutting off the small ones of the Poor. This caused great Discontent among the Commonalty. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Two thousand Men were raised, and imbarqued in Seventy Vessels of several
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54711:323"/>
sorts, with which the Governour set out for <hi>Batecala,</hi> a City seated on the Banks of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon the Coast of <hi>Canara,</hi> well built and encompassed with a fruitful Country. The occasion of this Voyage, That the Queen refused to pay her Tribute, and entertained Pyrats in her Port to the detriment of the Publick.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Fleet entred the Port, and the Queen seeing so great a force, and that the Governour demanded the Tribute, and delivery of the Pyrats Ships that had retired thither and fortified themselves; she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to hold him in hand till the time came he must go to <hi>Cochin.</hi> This Artifice was soon disappointed; for he Landed with Twelve hundred Men in two Battalions, the Command of one he gave to <hi>Ferdinand de Sousa</hi> and <hi>Tavora,</hi> and ordered Twenty light Vessels to go up the River and attack the City by Sea. The Governour marching through a Wood, was met by a Body of Musqueteers: Our Men made no halt, but drove them before to the Gates, and entred with them, not without great opposition, the Queen her self with much Bravery encouraging her Men. A Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues Souldier being beset by Two hundred of the Enemy bravely defended himself, till another envious of that Honour came up to him, and both Back to Back kept their Ground; at length a Party of our Men, fell upon the Enemy, and with great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them rescued the two.</p>

8. It was Night when our Men possessed themselves of the City. In the Morning they not only plundered the Portugueses that were there; but falling out about the Booty had such a Battle among themselves, that all were hurt, and none enriched. The Enemy who perceived this from a Hill, pours in a shower of Arrows; the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Orders all to march to Revenge it; but those who are grieved by the lessening their Pay, Answer, <hi>That the Gentlemen who are Rich may march; for they only came to make up by Plunder what they are unjustly deprived of. Garcia de Sa</hi> went out with a sew Lances, and after some Retreats reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally on both sides, almost all the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses were put to shameful flight, running to their Ships in such haste that some were drowned.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Governour hearing this, run to them with Reproaches, crying out, <hi>He did not know them, and thought they were not the same he left two years before in</hi> India. This seemed a Reflection upon his Predecessor; but they with as loud Voices undeceived him, Answering, <hi>That the Men were the same, but the Governour was not; that this was the fruit of lessening their Pay, to give Gratuities to those who knew better how to beg, than deserve them.</hi> He retired to the Ships, and resolved the next day to burn the City, and destroy the Country. The City run with the Blood of all Living Creatures of both Sexes, and all Ages, before it was burnt; then the Country was laid waste, and all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54711:324"/>
the Woods cut down. This caused such a general Terrour, that whereas before throughout <hi>India,</hi> it was commonly said, <hi>Beware of</hi> Batecala; they afterwards chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to <hi>Beware of</hi> Martin Alfonso. The Queen no longer able to resist, submitted, and purchased Peace with a heavier Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; for generally they draw on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a greater burden, who proudly throw off that they have.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> abhorred that so many Men quitting the Service, turned Merchants; to prevent this, and considering the vast Frauds of the Custom-House at <hi>Malaca,</hi> he sent new Orders thither. He lowered the Customs of Strangers to invite them to Trade there, and raised them to the Portugueses, to lessen their desire of Trading thither. The first succeeded well; for the Customs after that amounted to much more than before. The second took no effect. Much of the same nature was what he did at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and therefore we will mention it in this place. That King was in Arrears for Tribute Five hundred thousand Ducats, which he refused not to pay, but was not able; for from Twelve thousand that <hi>Albuquerque</hi> at first imposed on him it was raised to almost One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand; so that the King from a Tributary was become a Slave, not having a competent Maintenance left him. <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> finding he was not able to pay the Debt, proposed to him to make over the Customs for payment: He to be rid of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54711:324"/>
submitted, and as before he was a King without a Revenue, now he had some he seemed no King; for the Custom-House is the support of that Crown. No doubt it was a Judgment for the Wickednesses of the Portugueses, in taking from that King what was his due, that the Persians, whose it had been, should take it from them. The oppressed King making Virtue of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, resigned his Crown with Praises of him that took it from him; for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument began with these vain Preambles: <hi>I command all to obey this Supream Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it may be understood that between me and my Lord</hi> (meaning King <hi>Iohn</hi> the Third) <hi>who in greatness reaches to Heaven, and has Power over all the circumference of the Earth, and in Grandeur is equal to the King of</hi> China, <hi>Great King of Iustice</hi> (as if any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice were now done him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>Greatest of all Kings in the World; Key of the Treasure that is on Earth, that is, Vertue and Nobility, of whom is learnt the Wisdom of Reigning, bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Sea of Kingdoms, &amp;c.</hi> Could any man wronged flatter him, that injured him more? It is certain, He who gave the Praises, deserved them better than he that received them.</p>

Orders came from <hi>Portugal.</hi> Afterwards the Governour <hi>D. Iohn de Castro</hi> sent back <hi>Aeiro</hi> with the Title of KING, to prevent the Disorders that happen by many Heads. This last belongs to the Year 1545; but I insert it here, not to break the Series of these Affairs.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. About this time in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour marched against the King of <hi>Adel,</hi> or <hi>Zeila.</hi> He was followed by the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses who escaped the former Defeat, except 40 who were with <hi>Emanuel de Cuna</hi> in <hi>Barnagasso,</hi> who being sent for could not come time enough. Those with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour were Ninety, by whose Advice he marched towards the Enemy, giving them the Van of his Army, for the great Opinion he had of their Valour. In the Province <hi>Ambea,</hi> at the Foot of the Mountain <hi>Oena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> they met Seven hundred Horse and Two thousand Foot, led by a Captain of <hi>Zeila,</hi> to joyn the King. Fifty Portugues Horse advanced to attack them, the formost <hi>Antony Cardosa,</hi> who killed the Enemies Captain the first stroak of his Lance; the others following his Example, slew many; when <hi>Barnagais</hi> first, and then the Emperour coming up Charged furiously, and killing Eight hundred put the rest to flight, who went rather to terrifie the Tyrant with this Relation, than Reinforce him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. He was a League off with his Army in Battalia; it consisted of two Bodies of Foot, Three thousand Men in each; he marched in the Front with Five hundred
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54711:327"/>
Horse. The Emperour met him with the like Number, and in the same Order. The Portugueses, who were the Forlorn of this Body, Charged the Five hundred and slew many, losing two. The Emperour in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son behaved himself bravely, till the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horse fled to the Wings of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The King was wanting in nothing, shewing his Son, Ten years of Age, to stir up his Men to fight. The Fight was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and the Emperour in great danger; but a Portugues shooting the King in the Belly killed him, and his Horse carried him about hanging, being tied to the Saddle. Only a few Turks chose rather to dye, than fly, and made a great slaughter of Ethiopians. <hi>Iohn Fernandez,</hi> Page to the Unfortunate <hi>D. Christopher,</hi> at two stroaks of his Lance killed the Turkish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. In fine, Few of the Enemy esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by flight, the King's Head was cut off, and his Son made Prisoner. The Emperour acknowledging how great a share the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses had in this and the late Victories, did them great Favours. <hi>Cuna</hi> returned to <hi>Goa</hi> with 50 only; the rest stayed and married with Women of the Country, whose Progeny still continues there.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. At <hi>Goa,</hi> the Governour heard the <note place="margin">1544.</note> Complaints of the King of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> brought hither by <hi>D.

whereas his Madness was no other, than the Avarice of those would make him so. They endeavoured all they could to hinder his Restauration; but seeing him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inthroned, they poysoned him, and what caused his Imprisonment and was the cause of his death was not punished. After this Injustice followed the Justice executed upon <hi>Hierome Diaz</hi> a Portugues Physician, of Jewish extraction; he was burnt for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</p>

The People hardy and good Seamen: The Soil pleasant and well Watered, and has good Towns and Villages. Some Portugueses hearing the Cstristian Faith was received there, went thither, and among them <hi>Antony de Payva,</hi> that went as a Merchant, not a Preacher; but proved more Preacher than

Mercahnt. He had before had some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with one of the Kings of the Island about Religion, who seemed well pleased therewith.

                     <p n="2">2. However, the King remained dubious, and <hi>Payva</hi> sailing thence went to the Port of <hi>Sian;</hi> the King whereof, on account of the grateful Conference they had before, received him with kindness. The Discourse of Religion was renewed, and <hi>Payva</hi> at large explained all Points to him, and at the same time urged the absurdness of the Adoration of Idols.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Conference ended, the Sky till then being serene, there arose a Storm of Thunder, Lightning and Rain, which was esteemed as a Heavenly Confirmation of the Truth of what <hi>Payva</hi> had said; and he laying hold of that advantage, urged the King to embrace the Faith. He was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; but his Subjects, and the Moors that Traded there, obstructed him. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded time to Consider. At this time arrives the King of <hi>Supa,</hi> and hearing he of <hi>Sian</hi> had desired time, said, <hi>A work so good ought rather to be put in execution, than delayed; that he was only sorry for the Time he had lost, but would attone by being the first, and desired to be immediately Baptized.</hi> All stood amazed, and there being no Priest, the Ancientest of the Portugueses performed the Function;

                     <p n="4">4. Mean while the Governour fitted out a Fleet of 45 Sail, in which were Three thousand Seamen and Souldiers. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was kept secret, and was to rob the Pagod of <hi>Tremele,</hi> which is twelve Miles up the Inland of St. <hi>Thomas Meliapor,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Bisnagar:</hi> For which he had express Orders from King <hi>Iohn,</hi> upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <hi>India</hi> was wasted; as if any pretence could justifie such a Robbery.

they brought two Casks so heavy, they loaded many Men: It was said they carried Water; such as were not easie of belief, affirmed it was pure Gold and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones. The truth was never known.

However it was, whilst the Portugueses marched to their Ships, the Pagod and Town flamed, and Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Nayres set out to Revenge this Loss, Commanded by the Keeper of the Pagod. They appeared on an Eminence over our Men, who marched through a <hi>Defileé,</hi> and poured their Shot and Arrows upon them, which killed Thirty.

This was a notorious act of Injustice, and <hi>Martin Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso</hi> being led by Interest, and naturally so haughty that none durst Advise him, <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> resolved to do it, encouraged by his Quality, the great Offices he had born, and his great Age, being 80 years Old. Late at Night he repaired to the Governour's Tent, and having prepared him to hear, laid before him all the Motives that could persuade, to desist from so unjust an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, with much submission, gravity and discretion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> submitted to <hi>Faria</hi>'s Reasons. As soon as Day appeared, the Governour pretending other Causes, gave over the Design and returned to the City, securing <hi>Meale Can.</hi> At this time died <hi>Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decan,</hi> the Promoter of this Discord; and <hi>Hidalcan</hi> came down the Mountain-Gate with a powerful Army, reducing his Rebels, and in few days recovered the Kingdom of <hi>Concam,</hi> which not long before we had
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54711:330"/>
hoped to possess, if not dissuaded by the Experienced <hi>Faria,</hi> to whom <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> confessed he owed his Life and Honour: For had he gone to <hi>Concham,</hi> it was much to be doubted whether ever he had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> still fearing <hi>Meale Can,</hi> offered for him, if he were delivered to him, the Lands of <hi>Salsete</hi> and <hi>Bardez,</hi> valued at Fifty thousand Ducats a Year. It had been a breach of Trust, to deliverup a Man that had put himself into our protection. Therefore the Governour Answered; <hi>If what was offered were given, he would send him where he should not disturb</hi> Hidalcan. He admitted this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and performed on his part; but had not entire satisfaction from us; for <hi>Meale</hi> was carried from <hi>Goa</hi> to <hi>Cananor,</hi> and from <hi>Cananor</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> in the Eyes of <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> as the Politick said, To keep in Awe; but the State Criticks said, It was a Bait to draw Presents. Some were sent soon after.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> had moreover granted to the Governour upon this Treaty, the vast Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <hi>Acedecan</hi> had laid up when he Rebelled, and which at his Death fell into the hands of <hi>Cojecemazadim,</hi> and was worth Ten Millions of Ducats. He persuaded the Governour it was not above a Million, and delivered so much to him. One Record says, He sent almost half of it to <hi>Portugal</hi> in Bars of Gold: Another, That he applied Two hundred and fifty thousand Ducats to the Kings use in <hi>India;</hi> if we may not take into this Account, One hundred thousand given by <hi>Hidalcan</hi> upon the late Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54711:331"/>
But if these did make up the Sum, he afterwards discharged a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, discharging the King of some Debts.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> gave him Notice of the great Fraud used in delivering the Treasure, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading him to recover the Remainder of <hi>Cojeçemazadim,</hi> who was at <hi>Cananor.</hi> He used Means to take him; but not succeeding, resolved to endeavour it in person. He fitted out Twenty four great Ships, and many Vessels to row, and without saying any thing what he intended, landed at <hi>Cochin.</hi> Putting to Sea again, he steered several Courses, and Anchored at Mount <hi>Delij.</hi> At Night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making it known to the Fleet, he went into a Barge with five or six Gentlemen, and ordering three of the lightest Vessels to follow, came with incredible speed to the Fort of <hi>Cananor,</hi> where <hi>Iames Alvarez Tellez</hi> Commanded. He spoke to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being known to any other, ordering him to endeavour to secure <hi>Cojeçemazadim,</hi> or <hi>Pocarale Aderrajam,</hi> who Governed him. Then he returned to the Fleet, and with it to <hi>Goa,</hi> all men admiring the Voyage and Preparations, without seeing the Design or Effect of them. <hi>Tellez</hi> could not take <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazadim,</hi> for he was upon his Guard; but he ordered <hi>Henry de Sousa,</hi> Commander in Chief of <hi>Malabar,</hi> to take <hi>Pocarale.</hi> He attempted it, and many coming in to his Relief, <hi>Pocarale</hi> and a Brother of his were both killed. This enflamed the King and People against the Fort, and though they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54711:331"/>
were appeased, yet the Hatred to the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses for this Action was not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished; but raised one of the greatest Storms we weathered in <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The King of <hi>Xiraz</hi> caused some Disturbance at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> appearing in the Neighbourhood with a considerable Power; but he soon drew off, coming to Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with that King. Sultan <hi>Mamud,</hi> King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> aimed at the Recovery of <hi>Diu,</hi> not forgetting the Death of his Uncle <hi>Badur,</hi> and being troubled to have us so near Neighbours. One of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable Articles of Peace, which the Vice-Roy <hi>D. Garcia</hi> had admitted was, That the Kings Subjects might build a Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Town and our Fort. The Wall was raising, and displeased <hi>Emanuel de Sousa</hi> and <hi>Sepulveda,</hi> who commanded there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it looked like somewhat more than a bare Partition, which was the true intent of the Articles. He fortified himself, then beat off the Workmen, threw down the Wall, and made use of the Materials. The King was heinously offended, and at the instigation of his great Subject <hi>Coje Zofar,</hi> he began secretly to stir up that Great Part of the World, with Letters to the several Princes, to unite and expel the Portugues, not only <hi>Diu,</hi> but all <hi>Asia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Let us see what hapned while this Storm was rising. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> pressed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, either to restore what he had given him on that score, or else to send away <hi>Mealeacan.</hi> The Governour endeavoured
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54711:332"/>
to please him with Artifice, rather than Performance, and to this effect sent <hi>Iohn Fernandez de Negreyros</hi> Embassadour to him. Him, and all the Portugueses that were in his Court, the King put in Prison, keeping them as Hostages for the performance of what was before agreed, and now demanded. This was a great Provocation to the hot Nature of <hi>Martin Alfonso;</hi> but submitting to Necessity, he began to appease <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> assuring him, That as soon as the Season would permit, <hi>Meale</hi> should be sent to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca.</hi> Three Ships Arrived now from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> of five that sailed thence; one was forced back, and another Cast-away on the Coast of <hi>Melinde,</hi> the Men saved.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This Year the <hi>Tartar</hi> entred <hi>China,</hi> and besieged <hi>Peking.</hi> A great part of his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army, which consisted of almost Millions of Men, Threescore thousand of them Horse, marched to the City <hi>Quamsi</hi> and plundered it, killing above Threescore thousand persons of all Sexes and Ages, and then went on towards <hi>Peking.</hi> By the way, the Fort <hi>Nixiancoo</hi> defended it self so brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the General <hi>Nanticor</hi> thought it impregnable, having lost Three thousand Men before it. Among the Prisoners taken at <hi>Quamsi</hi> were Nine Portugueses, one of them called <hi>George Mendez,</hi> offered, if he might have his and his Companions Liberty, to put him in a way to take the Fort. The General admitted the Proposal, and by this Man's Advice took it with the slaughter of above Two thousand Chineses and Mogols.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54711:332"/>
He went on to <hi>Peking,</hi> and in pursuance of his Promise obtained of his Prince the Portugueses Liberty, and did them great Honours, endeavouring with large Gifts to detain them in his Service. <hi>George Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez</hi> stayed, and was afterwards allowed a Pension of Six thousand Ducats. These Accidents often cause the Portugueses in <hi>Asia,</hi> to forget their Country and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their Religion. This was when they came to <hi>Tuymican,</hi> the Tartar's Court, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he retired after the raising the Siege of <hi>Peking,</hi> which lasted almost seven Months, with the Loss of Four hundred and fifty Thousand Men, most destroyed by Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, besides Three hundred thousand that deserted to the Chineses.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Four small Vessels, with One hundred Portugueses in them, cruised upon the <note place="margin">1545.</note> Coast of <hi>Tanauzarim,</hi> and were much dreaded, having (among other Prizes) taken three great Ships. The Maritim Towns complained to their Sovereign, the King of <hi>Siam;</hi> and he sent out against them <hi>Heredim Mahomet,</hi> a Turk, with a Royal Galley, four Galliots, and five other Vessels that Rowed, in which were Eight hundred Men, Three hundred of them Janizaries, the rest Turks, Greeks, Achems, Malabars and Mogols; all brave Men. A poor King of the Neighbouring Island, <hi>Pulohinor,</hi> who was newly Converted, gave our Men notice of the Danger. They left the Port and run up a Creek, both because it was more hid, and for that at the Mouth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54711:333"/>
of it were some Ruins, that might serve instead of a Fort, to defend themselves. The Turk missing them in the Port, thought they were fled to some of the Neighbouring Islands, and sent the Ships and Galliots in search of them, staying behind with only the Galley. They who were upon the Watch, fell upon the Galley at Night, and destroyed Three hundred Men that were in her, and the Admiral, with loss of only One Man. Of the other Nine Vessels, three were Cast-away and six were taken by our Men; with great slaughter of the Enemy, and only two killed on our side.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Governour dispatched the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bound Trading Ships, whereof one was Cast-away at <hi>Zanzibar.</hi> Those from <hi>Portugal</hi> arrived in <hi>India,</hi> and brought him a Successor, which he so earnestly desired, that a few days before being at Mass with <hi>Iames Silveyra,</hi> who was coming for <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi> he said to him at the Elevation of the Host; <hi>Speak to the King, to send one to succeed me, for I dare not Govern</hi> India, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Men are so changed from Truth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Or else I swear by that Sacred Host, and by the true Body of Christ I behold in it with the Eyes of Faith, That I will open the Patents of Succession, and resign the Government to whoever is named therein; and desire his Highness, not to expose such a Subject as I am, to the danger of having his Head cut off.</hi> This was the Condition of <hi>India,</hi> almost past hope of Recovery: For if the Governour was tolerable, those that were governed were
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54711:333"/>
intollerable; and the contrary. <hi>Martin Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso</hi> had served well in <hi>Brasile</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> in other Posts. He was Violent in his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, a great discoverour of Mens Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and knew better than many to save what was superfluous, and spend what was necessary. He instituted those Officers of the King's Revenue, that are called <hi>Surveyors,</hi> in <hi>India.</hi> He was of a handsom and large Stature, his Complexion white, his Beard Chestnut-colour. He Governed three years and four Months; was the <hi>13th</hi> had the Title of <hi>Governour,</hi> and first of the Name.</p>

                        <p>The Government of <hi>D. John de Castro,</hi> from the Year 1545, till the Year 1548, in the Reign of King <hi>JOHN</hi> the Third.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. ABOUT the latter end of <hi>August,</hi> or beginning of <hi>September,</hi> Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">1545.</note> at <hi>Goa</hi> six Ships from <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> Commanded by <hi>Don Iohn de Castro,</hi> who went to Ease <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> of the Government. Immediately (as is Customary in <hi>India)</hi> Complaints were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the New Governour against the Old.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54711:335"/>
The chief, the Crying-down the Value of Money; which was immediately restored to its former Value. This gave occasion to <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> to go away dissatisfied, and the other to remain so upon the manner of his Discontent, falling out after having very well agreed. These Governours, and their Governments, seem to resemble the Soul and Body, which never part without great struglings.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Don Iohn</hi> began his Government as is usual, sending Commanders and Officers to several Forts and Towns. <hi>Bernardin de Sousa</hi> went to succeed <hi>Iurdan de Freytas,</hi> at <hi>Ternate,</hi> carrying with him the King <hi>Aeiro,</hi> to hold that Crown till other Orders came from <hi>Portugal,</hi> it being left to our King by the deceased <hi>Tabarija,</hi> as was said before. <hi>Ferdinand de Sousa &amp; Tavora,</hi> who was sent against the Spaniards, Commanded by <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalobos,</hi> reduced him to a necessity of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring himself, and continuing at <hi>Ternate</hi> till the Season of sailing for <hi>India,</hi> where he and his Men might either remain in the Portugues Service, or return in their Ships to <hi>Europe.</hi> This Difficulty surmounted, <hi>Sousa</hi> resolved to take Revenge of <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruno,</hi> King of <hi>Gilolo,</hi> for the Injuries he did the Portugueses and New Converts since he Tyrannically usurped the Crown, killing his Lawful Sovereign.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Sousa</hi> consulted his own Men, and the new Guests, who approved of his Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Villalobos</hi> offered to bear him Company. They made up Four hundred
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54711:335"/>
Spaniards and Portugueses, and Fifteen hundred Ternatenses. Coming to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in the Port, they found the Tyrant ready to receive them, well fortified and provided with Cannon. The Christians began to batter them; but received more damage than they did. <hi>Sousa</hi> perceiving there was no way, but by giving an Assault, gave the first of the Attack to <hi>Iohn Galvan</hi> and <hi>Bernard de la Torre,</hi> the first a Portugues, the other a Spaniard, who sticking in the Thorns the Tyrant had designedly strewed about, and scarce able to move, stood as a Mark to the Enemies Bullets and Arrows. <hi>Catabruno</hi> Charges them with Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men. <hi>Sousa</hi> comes to their Relief, and the Fight was desperate; for both Spaniards and Portugueses did Wonders. Night part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Morning brought them together; the Dispute was hot, till <hi>Galvan</hi> being killed his Men were put in disorder; all our Body came to their Relief, and brought them off, forcing the Enemy to retire to their Works. Our Captain seeing no likelyhood of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, returned to <hi>Ternate;</hi> whence he went to <hi>India</hi> with the Spaniards, as had been Agreed, only <hi>Villalobos</hi> excepted, who died in the Fort.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Coje Zofar,</hi> at <hi>Cambaya,</hi> now his Princes Favourite, kept a fair Correspondence with the Portugueses; but with the natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiousness of a Moor. He persuaded the King a second time to endeavour the shaking off the Yoak of the Fort of <hi>Diu,</hi> and to this effect drew together a great
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54711:336"/>
Number of Men; yet had more hopes to succeed by Policy, than strength. He agreed with an Infamous Portugues, called <hi>Ruy Fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>

An Ethiopian, a Turk and a Woman Slave, discovered the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> was astonished to see his Design discovered, and began to Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>D. Iohn Mascarenhas,</hi> Commander of the Fort; pleading, That the Cause of breaking the Peace had been, because they obstructed building that Wall, which <hi>D. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia de Noronha</hi> had so weakly allowed, and <hi>Emanuel de Sousa</hi> had couragiously beat down. <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> dissembled while he gathered a great Power, and <hi>D. Iohn</hi> perceiving the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that threatned him, prepared to meet it, and gave Advice thereof to the Governour and Neighbouring Commanders.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A considerable number of Men was already drawn together in the City <hi>Diu,</hi> and among them Five hundred Turks, sent from <hi>Mecha</hi> by the King of <hi>Zibit. D. Iohn</hi> assigned every Man his Post, and placed an Officer with 30 Men in each of the four Bastions; his Lieutenant over the Gate with Twenty, another with the like Number in a small Work; reserving Fifty for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be wherever the greatest Danger called. This was the Number of Men he had, and thus ordered, when <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> came on with all his Power, resolving to attack the Bastion of the Sea, with three Castles built upon a Ship of prodigious
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54711:336"/>
bigness, well stored with Cannon to batter the Wall. Within the Castles were Two hundred Turks, who were to distract the Desendants by pouring in continually all sorts of Artificial Fire-works. This Design succeeded not, for our Commander having notice of it, sent <hi>Iacome Leite</hi> to burn that Ship. He took twenty Men in two Vessels, and though he set out by Night, was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; yet did not desist, but coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously went on and set fire to it; then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring, saw a great part of it fly into the Air, with most of the Turks, the Remainder casting such a Flame, as at a distance disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Enemies Army running in Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions to quench the Fire. <hi>Iacome</hi> seeing them in Clusters, let fly his Cannon and killed many of them. In this Action he had seven Men wounded. He went on to the Mouth of the River, and took from the Enemy some Vessels of Provision, with which he returned to the Fort, much admired of all.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> began to build the Wall, that had been before beat down, which could not be hindred, though our Cannon killed many of the Workmen; but was brought to such perfection, that he planted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>hereon Sixty great Cannon, besides many small, and one of such extraordinary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that it shook the whole Island, and made pieces of the Fort fly; it was managed by an expert French Renegado. At this time arrived <hi>D. Ferdinand de Castro,</hi> Son to the Governour, sent by him with some
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54711:337"/>
Relief of Men. <hi>Mascarenhas</hi> wanted some Intelligence from the Enemies Camp. <hi>Iames de Anaya Coutino,</hi> a Gentleman of Note and Man of great strength, knowing of it, at Night putting a Helmet on his Head, with a Sword by his side and Spear in his Hand, let himself down the Wall, and lying close at some distance from the Fort, discovered two Moors, who being come up to him, he killed the one with the Spear, and taking up the other in his Arms run with him to the Gate of the Fort, and calling threw him in, to the great admiration of those that beheld it. This was much; but what follows is more: He had borrowed the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met he carried, and promised on the word of a Gentleman to restore it, or dye. In this Scuffle it fell off, and he mist it not till the Owner asked for it. He said nothing; but letting himself off the Wall again, went to look for, found and restored it. Nothing could be more brave; nothing more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The King came from <hi>Champanel</hi> with Ten thousand Horse, to see (as <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> said) that place taken. This caused an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Motion in the Army, and <hi>D. Iohn</hi> desired to know the cause of it. Six of our Men sallied out at Night and fell among sixty Moors, who were all asleep, whereof they killed some, and the rest waking at the Noise, as also some that were not far off, our Men were forced to retire, leaving two dead; the four brought a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner with them, who informed our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54711:337"/>
of what he desired. This Action incensed the King and <hi>Coje Zofar,</hi> so that they renewed the fury of their Batteries, and did much harm. The Renegado Frenchman was struck dead by a chance Dart, and the Gunner who succeeded him being Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, did more harm to his own Party, than to us, which was some Revenge. All the Neighbourhood resounded with the Noise of the Cannon and Cries of dying Men, when a Bullet of ours falling in the Kings Tent, sprinkled him with the Blood of one of his Favourites who was near him, and beaten to pieces. This so terrified the King, that he instantly fled, leaving the Command of the Horse to <hi>Iuzarcan,</hi> a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Ethiopian.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> pressed the Besieged, and there was great slaughter and destruction on both sides; the more visible and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the Fort, by reason of its little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, and the small number of Men. <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carenas</hi> appeared wherever there was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as hoping to gain no less Honour than <hi>Antony de Silveyra</hi> had done there a few years before. He was no less Fortunate in couragous Women; for those that were in the Fort encouraged the Men; assisted and relieved them at the work. And when the Turks entred the Walls, one of them hearing they were got into a House, run in with a Spear and fought till <hi>Mascarenas</hi> came and put them all to the Sword.</p>
                     <p n="9">

9. <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> omitted nothing that could be devised to fill the Ditches, and lay open the Fort. All industry was used on our side to repair the Breaches. The prime Gentry did the Duties of private Souldiers and Masons, the Walls and Bastions were ruined at Night, and repaired by Morning. <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> was astonished to see all he destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed restored. Coming on in a Rage with fresh Men, a Cannon Ball took off his Head and right Hand, whereon he leaned it. Thus he fulfilled his Mothers Prediction, who being at <hi>Otranto,</hi> still persuaded him to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Church, and perceiving she prevailed not, superscribed her Letters to him thus: <hi>To</hi> Coje Zofar <hi>my Son, at the Gates of Hell.</hi> His Son <hi>Rumecan</hi> succeeded him as well in Wickedness, as the ardent desire of taking that Fort. He took upon him his Father's Command, and inherited his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Our Commander was obliged to send fresh Advice to the Governour at <hi>Goa,</hi> and the Captains of the Neighbouring places. A Priest was the Messenger, who run very great danger, the Sea at that time being scarce Navigable. But then <hi>Portugal</hi> had some <hi>Decij,</hi> and some <hi>Reguli:</hi> Now it has only the grief of wanting them.</p>

Yet at length, Valour was forced to give way to Numbers, and the Enemy mounted St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s Bastion: But Despair administring Fury rather than Valour, the few Portugueses rush upon the multitude of Enemies, and making a wonderful slaughter, throw head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from the Wall such as had escaped the Sword, so that the Dead lay in heaps.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Rumecan</hi> thinking <hi>Mahomets</hi> displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was the cause of this Misfortune, spent this Night in Prayers and Processions. In the Morning, thinking he had attoned, he renewed the Assault: After mounting the two Bastions he was forced to retire, having lost almost Two thousand Men, and among them the Ethiopian <hi>Iuzarcan,</hi> General of the Horse: An Uncle of his of the same Name succeeded him. In this Action seven Portugueses were lost. Several other Assaults
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54711:339"/>
were given with like Success. In one of these the Fire was so close and furious, that several who were clad in Cotton, which soon took flame, ran and dipt themselves in the Water, and so returned to their Posts. Those who wore Skins escaped better. Our Commander taking notice of this, caused some gilt Leather, wherewith his Rooms were hung, to be made into Coats for the Souldiers. Another time <hi>D.

Peter de Almeyda,</hi> with One hundred Men, sallied to destroy a Mount raised by the Enemy to over-look the Fort, and effected it, killing Three hundred Moors. <hi>Martin Botello</hi> another time went out with Ten Men, to take some Body to give Intelligence; and falling upon Eighteen put them to flight all, except a bold <hi>Nubij,</hi> who standing all the Eleven, wrestled with <hi>Botello;</hi> and he finding it hard to overcome him whilst he could touch the ground with his Feet, like another <hi>Hercules</hi> with <hi>Anseus,</hi> ran with him in his Arms to the Fort.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Attacks were still renewed, the Defendants spent with Labour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all with Hunger, feeding even upon nauseous Vermin. A Crow taken upon the dead Bodies was a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>nty for the Sick and sold for five Crowns, the Ammunition was almost spent, and now the Enemy gives a hot Assault with fresh Men, Ten thousand having newly joyned them. They entred St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Bastion, and retired. Scarce had they left it, when it blew up, and in it 73 of our Men, ten whereof came down
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54711:339"/>
alive. <hi>Iames de Sotomayer</hi> fell into the Fort with a Spear in his hand; a Souldier in the same manner fell among the Enemies, and was killed by them. It was no Fable, that Armed Men were seen in the Air this bout. Our Captain <hi>Mascarenas</hi> foreseeing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, had ordered them to quit the Bastion; but one <hi>Reynoso</hi> protested, he would accuse them of Cowardize, if they did. The one Commanded prudently, the other Advised couragiously; yet was guilty of Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thirteen thousand of the Enemy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Breach they had made; only five Souldiers withstood them till <hi>Mascarenas</hi> came with fifteen more. The Women assisted the Men, and ran even to brave Death. The Priest, who was returned from carrying the Advice to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places, appeared encouraging all with a Crucifix lifted on high. The Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done here were incredible; but Night coming on the Enemy retired, having lost Three hundred Men. <hi>Mascarenas</hi> spent all the Night in repairing the Damages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Enemy daily renewed their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks with the same success, and held out by means of their vast Numbers. <hi>Rumecan</hi> fell again to Mining, and pierced the very Rocks that stood in his way; but met not with such success as he had done the time before; for <hi>D. Iohn</hi> perceiving his Work, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it, and it flew all back upon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegers, killing many of them. <hi>D. Alvaro,</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:54711:340"/>
the Governours Son, sent with Supplies, seemed to sail in opposition to the Seas and Winds, through Storms almost incredible: Yet they all arrived at <hi>Baçaim,</hi> and <hi>Antony Moniz Barreto,</hi> with 8 Gentlemen, got first into <hi>Diu,</hi> who though so few, by their Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very were no small comfort to the besieged. One of these, called <hi>Michael Darnide,</hi> a Man of prodigious Strength, <hi>Barreto</hi> refusing to take him into his Boat, leaped into the Water with his Musquet in his Mouth and swam after him, so he was obliged to take him up.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Next came <hi>Luis de Melo &amp; Mendoça</hi> with nine Men; then <hi>D. George</hi> and <hi>D. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arte de Meneses</hi> with seventeen; after them <hi>D. Antony de Ataide,</hi> and <hi>Francis Guillerme,</hi> with fifty each; and lastly, <hi>Ruy Freyre,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Chaul,</hi> with Twenty four. All toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fell upon the Enemy, then possessed of some of our Works, and among them the Bastion <hi>Santiago.</hi> The Dispute was hot; yet the Enemy set up their Colours on the Walls. <hi>Antony Moniz Barreto</hi> made good his Post with only two Souldiers, and was going to quench his Flames in the Water; but one of the two, who was in the same condition, detained him, and both did things worthy admiration. <hi>Antony Correa</hi> sallied out with Twenty Men to discover the Enemy, and saw Twelve Moors sitting about a Fire; he exhorted his Men to fall upon them, but they seeing him go on, fled; however he went on thinking to take one that might give Intelligence: He fell
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54711:340"/>
on and behaved himself bravely; yet he was taken and carried to <hi>Rumecan,</hi> who Examined him about the posture the Fort was in, which being then very miserable, he represented so powerful, as drove him into despair, and moved him to cause the unfortunate Prisoner to be dragged through the Streets, and his Head cut off, which was set upon a Pole next day in sight of the Fort.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Enemy had now lost Five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men; the Besieged Two hundred, and had not so many more left, and not above half them able to do Duty, when <hi>D. Alvaro</hi> arrives with the Supplies, which consisted of Four hundred Men, and a sufficient quantity of Ammunition, having by the way taken a Ship of <hi>Cambaya</hi> richly laden. The Joy of this Relief was soon allayed; for the Souldiers that came with <hi>D. Alvaro,</hi> fearing the Mines, proposed to meet the Enemy in open Field: But the Governour prudently refusing, they broke out into open Mutiny in contempt of all Military Discipline, scarce known, or at least not respected by the Portugues Nation. <hi>D. Iohn</hi> seeing himself in danger of perishing in the Fort by his own Men, chose rather to dye in the Field among the Enemies. He sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with almost Five hundred Men in three Bodies. At one heat they gained the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies advanced Post, forcing them to retire to their Works. Those who insolently forced their Commander to this Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, stood heartless at the Foot of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54711:341"/>
Trenches, seeing others mount who had said less. <hi>D. Iohn</hi> seeing them in this posture, cried out, <hi>Whether it was thus they had promised to fight? Where was now that Boldness that obliged him to come into the Field? Where the Threats, that they would fight the Enemy without him? Behold your Commander you accused of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize, calls you to the danger: And who is there follows me of those that would have led me hither? Within the Walls you were fierce, and now in the Field timorous. Your Courage suits with your Tongues; for those who said much, always acted little.</hi> They ashamed to be thus justly upbraided, took Heart and mounted: The whole Army came down upon them, and the Portugueses having done wonders, were forced to retire in disorder. This was the time the Enemy had possessed himself of the Fort, had not <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carenas</hi> with his Prudence and Valour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented <hi>Mojatecan,</hi> who with Five thousand attempted to enter, and was valiantly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by <hi>Luis de Sousa</hi> in St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark. Threescore Men were lost in this Action: <hi>D. Alvaro de Castro</hi> was mortally Wounded in the Head. This was the fruit of that insolent Disobedience.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Moors had taken the Cannon of the Bastion <hi>Santiago,</hi> when <hi>Vasco de Cuna</hi> and <hi>Luis de Almeyda</hi> brought a fresh Relief. The latter immediately went out with <hi>Payo Rodriguez</hi> and <hi>Peter Alfonso</hi> in three Caravels, and as soon returned with two great Ships of <hi>Meca</hi> and some other Vessels, whose Loading was worth
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54711:341"/>
Fifty thousand Ducats. At the Yard-Arms hung many Moors, whose Heads were then cut off, as was the Captains, who was a Janizary and offered Three thousand Ducats for his Ransom.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. NOw begins the Month of <hi>November,</hi> and the Siege had lasted eight Months, when the Governour <hi>D. Iohn de Castro</hi> covers the Sea with a great Fleet of all sorts of Vessels for the Relief of <hi>Diu.</hi> All <hi>Goa</hi> admired the Constancy wherewith he received the News of the Death of his Son <hi>D. Fernando;</hi> for though he highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it he dissembled his Grief, and dressing himself gayer than ordinary, went in Procession, to give God Thanks, That <hi>Diu</hi> was still in the possession of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses; and then went to a publick Feast, which is an Imitation of a Fight, wherein they use Canes instead of Lances.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:54711:342"/>
2. The Fleet consisted of above Ninety Sail, besides three of the Ships that then came from <hi>Portugal;</hi> and several Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that came in them, went in other Vessels.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Governour being come to <hi>Baçaim,</hi> waited the coming up of the Vessels that were scattered, and the mean while sent <hi>D. Emanuel de Lima</hi> to scour the Coast. On the Coast of <hi>Damam</hi> he took several Ships, and cutting the Moors that were in them in pieces, threw them into the Mouths of the Rivers, that the Tide carrying them up, they might strike a Terrour in all that Coast. Entring the River of <hi>Suratt,</hi> after a vigorous Resistance made, he destroyed all that belonged to the Town called, Of the Ethiopians. The same was done at the City <hi>Ansote,</hi> not far distant, without sparing Beauty, the finest Women of the <hi>Bramens</hi> and <hi>Baneans</hi> being slaughtered. So in other Neighbouring Towns; and then <hi>D. Emanuel</hi> withdrew, leaving an Universal Terrour all along that Shoar.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Fleet appearing in the Sea of <hi>Diu,</hi> the Enemy stood amazed, though they had just then received a supply of Five thousand fresh Men sent by the King. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour went privately into the Fort, and afterwards Landed his Men. He proposed in Council, Whether it was fit presently to march out and fight the Enemy? The Question was debated, till the Experienced <hi>Garcia de Sa</hi> put an end to it, saying, <hi>They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ught to fight.</hi> They marched in this order:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54711:342"/>
                        <hi>D. Iohn Mascarenas,</hi> Commander of the Fort, led the Van, consisting of Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men: <hi>D. Alvaro</hi> led as many: <hi>Don Emanuel de Lima,</hi> the like number. The Governour led the rest, which were One thousand, and a Body of <hi>Indians.</hi> Among the Men were some Portugues Women in mens Cloaths, to assist the Wounded. In the Fort was left the Lieutenant with Three hundred Men. That Night they fixed their Arms, and next Morning prepared their Souls. The Governour appointed Rewards for those who first mounted the Enemies Works.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. At Break of Day, on the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> this small Army marched out to attack the numerous Forces of the Enemies, who were well intrenched and provided with Cannon. Our Men gave the Onset with much Bravery, and some fell. Two Gentlemen, who had Challenged each other, now agreed he should be owned as Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious over the other, who first mounted the Enemies Works; both honourably strove for this Glory, and both died gloriously in the Attempt. At length our Men mounted the Works; such was each man's eagerness to be the first, that it could not be known who really was so. <hi>Payva</hi> having lost a Leg, fought on his Knees till he was killed. The <hi>Tanadar</hi> cut down a Turk, and stoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make an end of him, was slain by another Turk. <hi>Francis de Azevedo</hi> was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, after having made a great slaughter.</p>

6. The brave <hi>Mascarenas</hi> and <hi>D. Alvaro de Castro,</hi> having taken a Bulwark, make themselves room in the Field. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour comes up and enflames the fight. He orders his Ensign to fix the Colours on the Enemies Works, and is immediately obeyed by him. Twice was the Ensign thrown down, and twice he remounted. Our Men encouraged by the Governour, press forward, and the Enemy gives way. The Portugueses enter their Works pell-mell with them, and <hi>Rumecan</hi> comes on with the whole Body of his Army; but after a hot dispute retires, leaving his Enemies Masters of his Works.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Rumecan</hi> joyns <hi>Iuzarcan,</hi> who on the other side was worsted by <hi>Mascarenas.</hi> The Governour marches out of the Works to meet them, giving the Van to his Son <hi>D. Alvaro.</hi> The Portugueses were much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, when <hi>F. Antony del Cazal</hi> appeared before them with a Crucifix on the Point of a Lance, encouraging them with godly Words. They take Courage, and covering the Field with dead and wounded Men, put <hi>Rumecan</hi> to flight; but he rallying, forced the Portugueses to retire in great disorder. The Governour exposing himself to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, renewed the Fight, and restored good Order: At this time a Stone broke a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> Arm of the Crucifix, and the Priest calling upon the Men to revenge that Sacriledge, they fell on with such fury, that having done incredible Execution, they drove the Enemy to the City, who still gave way,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54711:343"/>
facing us. The first that entred the City with them was <hi>D. Iohn,</hi> then <hi>D. Alvaro,</hi> and <hi>D. Emanuel de Lima</hi> and the Governour, all several ways, making the Streets and Houses run with Blood. The Women escaped not the fate of the Men, and Children were slain at their Mothers Breasts, one stroak taking away two Lives. The first part of the Booty was Precious Stones, Pearls, Gold and Silver; other things, though of value, were slighted as cumbersom.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Rumecan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and his General Officers, rally their Men, and appear again in the Field with Eight thousand. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and his Son, and <hi>D. Iohn Mascarenas</hi> encompass them, the Fight was bloody; in the heat of it <hi>Gabriel Teyxeyra</hi> killing the Bearer, took the Standard of <hi>Cambaya</hi> and dragged it about the Field, proclaiming Victory. <hi>George Nunez,</hi> from among the Dead, brought out <hi>Rumecans</hi> Head, and presented it to the Governour. Others took <hi>Iuzarcan,</hi> who was Wounded. Our Men were left absolute Masters of the Field. Of the Portugueses One hundred were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, others say only Thirty four; of the Enemy Five thousand, and among them <hi>Azedecan, Lucan</hi> and other Men of Note. Free Plunder was allowed, some were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched; many got much, and all were satisfied. There were taken many Colours, forty Pieces of Cannon of an extraordinary bigness, which with the lesser made up Two hundred, and a vast quantity of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:54711:344"/>
9. Many particularly signalized them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this Action. The Governour play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the part of a Souldier, as well as a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. <hi>D. Iohn Mascarenas,</hi> after a Siege of eight Months, did more (with respect to such Merits) than all. <hi>D. Alvaro de Castro,</hi> of whom it is enough to say, He did like his Father. The Ensign <hi>Barbado,</hi> who being several times thrown down, as often mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Works. <hi>F. Antony,</hi> who with the image of Life, banished the fear of Death. And many more, as well of those who were killed, as they that survived. The Enemy confessed, that one day during the Siege they saw over the Church of the Fort, a beautiful Woman cloathed in White, from whom proceeded such Rays that blinded them; and this Day, in the Field, some Men with Lances, who did them the greatest harm. The King in a Rage for this Loss, caused Twenty eight Portugueses he had in Custody, to be torn to pieces in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Whilst the Governour was employed in <note place="margin">1547.</note> Repairing the damage received, <hi>D. Emanuel de Lima</hi> by his Order scowred the Coast of <hi>Cambaya</hi> with thirty Ships, extirpating all the Towns on that shoar. The City <hi>Goga,</hi> one of the Chief of that Kingdom, was taken without any resistance, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants flying to the Mountains. It was plundered and burnt; then pursuing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, they were found at Night about a League off asleep, and all put to the Sword. All the Cattle in the Fields were
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54711:344"/>
either killed or Ham-strung. The City <hi>Gandar</hi> had the very same fate. The same was done in several other Towns, and with many Ships along the Coast of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roche.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. Great was the Joy at <hi>Goa,</hi> for the News of what had hapned at <hi>Diu,</hi> carried thither by <hi>Iames Rodriguez de Azevedo,</hi> by whom the Governour desired the City to lend him Twenty thousand Pardao's for the use of the Army, sending a Lock of his Whiskers in pawn for the Mony. The City returned the Pawn with Respect, and sent him more Mony than he demanded; and the Women their Pendants, Necklaces, Bracelets, and others Jewels. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour punctually restored all, as it was sent; being the day before supplied by a rich Ship of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> taken by <hi>Antony Moniz Barreto</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Mangalor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Fort being Repaired, and put into a better condition than it was before the Siege, and Five hundred Men into it, and <hi>D. George de Meneses</hi> with six Ships upon the Coast, and the City better inhabited through the good Usage of the Governour to the Moors, he sailed for <hi>Goa,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there on the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> He was received with loud Acclamations, and a splendid Triumph prepared by the City, in imitation of those of <hi>Rome.</hi> The City Gates and Streets were hung with Silk, the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows thronged with fine Women; all places resounded with Musick and noise of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and the Sea was covered with Vessels
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54711:345"/>
richly adorned. The Governour entred under a rich Canopy, where taking off his Cap, they put on his Head a Crown of Laurel, and a Branch of it in his hand. Before him went the Priest with the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix, as he carried it in the Fight, and next to him the Royal Standard. Then <hi>Iuzar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> his Eyes fixed on the Ground, perhaps that he might not see his Prince's Colours dragged and ours flying, and among them Six hundred Prisoners in Chains. In the Front the Cannon, and all other sorts of Arms in Carts, very delightful to behold. The Governour walked upon Leaves of Gold and Silver, and rich Silks. The Ladies from the Windows sprinckled him with sweet Water, and threw Flowers on him. Our Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> hearing the Relation of his Victory and Triumph, said, D. John <hi>had Overcome like a Christian, and Triumphed like a Heathen.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. SCarce was the Triumph over, when the Governour sent <hi>Iames de Almeyda Freyre</hi> with One hundred and twenty Horse, Eight hundred Foot, and a Thousand <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> to drive out of the Lands of <hi>Salsete</hi> and <hi>Bardes,</hi> some Troops sent to <hi>Hidalcan</hi> to possess themselves of them; because the Conditions upon which he delivered them were not performed. The Enemy appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Cowlij</hi> to the number of Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, who fled at the News of our approach. So the Lands were recovered without draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sword. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> sent the same Troops again, with Nine thousand more, and a Company of Renegado Portugueses, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Gonzalo Vaz Coutino,</hi> who flying the punishment of his Crimes, defended himself by committing greater. <hi>Iames de Almeyda</hi> marched again with the same Force as before; but being too weak, was forced to quit what before he had regained. The Governour marched in Person with Three thousand Men in five Batalions. <hi>Francis de Melo</hi> joyned them with about Fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. The Enemy hearing of it, though
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54711:346"/>
so numerous, retired to the Fort of <hi>Ponda.</hi> Our Army followed, and <hi>D. Alvaro de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro,</hi> who led the Van, took a Ford de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Two thousand Musqueteers. The other twelve or thirteen Thousand were drawn up in good Order about the Fort; but fled, after receiving our first Fire, leaving the Fort so clear, it appeared they had no design to maintain it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Victor never wants Friends. <hi>Cidoça,</hi> King of <hi>Canara,</hi> sent to Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>D. Iohn de Castro</hi> upon this Victory.

                     <p n="4">4. The Governour was informed, the King of <hi>Cambaya</hi> would come upon <hi>Diu</hi> with a greater Power than before, and with all diligence prepared to relieve it. The City of <hi>Goa</hi> advanced Mony for this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and the Women again sent him their Jewels by their little Daughters, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had not made use of them the last time, and desiring he would now: But he sent them back with Presents. The Fleet consisted of 160 Sail.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They sailed to <hi>Baçaim,</hi> and thence to <hi>Suratt,</hi> where <hi>D. Alvaro,</hi> who set out eight days before, had taken a Work, killed some Moors and got Cannon. Next, they entred the Port of <hi>Baroche,</hi> whence they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

the King of <hi>Cambaya</hi> covering the Plain with 150000 Men, and 80 Cannon in the Front; the Army made a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle and covered a League of Ground. <hi>D. Iohn</hi> boldly leaped ashoar, not only to shew he feared him not, but with design to fight him. The most Experienced Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers dissuaded him, representing it was a rashness for 3000 to attack 150000; that it was enough that he had Landed, and drawn off with as much leisure, as if Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. He was forced against his Will, to submit to the Advice of his Elders. He went on to <hi>Diu,</hi> and giving the Command of that Fort to <hi>Luis Falcam,</hi> because <hi>D. Iohn Mascarenas</hi> was returning to <hi>Portugal,</hi> he run like an inundation along the Coast of <hi>Por</hi> and <hi>Mongalor.</hi> The beautiful and strong Cities of <hi>Pate</hi> and <hi>Patane</hi> were aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Inhabitants, and by us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, near Two hundred Vessels burnt in their Ports, and a rich Booty taken. The same hapned to <hi>Dabul,</hi> but with some opposition. This was done in revenge for <hi>Hidalcan</hi>'s ravaging the Lands of <hi>Salsete</hi> and <hi>Bardes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Calabatecan,</hi> his General, had lately possessed those Lands with Twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men. The Governour went to meet them with Fifteen hundred Horse and Four thousand Foot; but the Enemy scarce heard them, when they fled to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Cowlij,</hi> leaving their Tents and Baggage for haste. Our Army rested, and at Break of Day marched to give a good
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54711:347"/>
Morrow to <hi>Calabatecan,</hi> who slept not, but came down with Two thousand Horse to maintain the Ford. But <hi>Almeyda</hi> passing with a few Horse, struck him down with his Lance; yet he rising nimbly had killed our Captain with his Cimiter, had not his Page again cast him down with a stroak of a Lance. He again rose, and was again beat down by <hi>Almeyda,</hi> and cut to pieces. His Arms, Horse and Furniture were of such value, that the share of <hi>George Madera,</hi> one of those that killed him (being the Cimiter, Dagger, Chain and Rings) were worth Eight thousand Crowns. The Moors and Christians fell to it desperately; but the former knowing their General was killed, soon fled, losing almost Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Soon after the Governour marched to the Coast, where he left neither Town, Wood, nor Flock or Herd of Cattle that could be seen, but what he destroyed with Fire and Sword. He was so pleased with this Success, that he entred <hi>Goa</hi> in manner of Triumph, giving the best share of it to his Son <hi>D. Alvaro.</hi> These were rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of Joy, than Triumphs; if otherwise, the Triumphs were too many.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Sometime before <hi>F. Antony del Padron</hi> (the first Commissary of St. <hi>Francis</hi> in <hi>India)</hi> with some Companions had entred into the Island <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and Preaching had wrought no small effect along the Coast. <hi>F. Pascalis</hi> was so well received by the King <hi>Iavira
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54711:348"/>
Pandar</hi> of <hi>Candea,</hi> that desiring to become a Christian, he was only deterred for fear of his Subjects rebelling, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired assistance of the Governour in case of any Commotion. <hi>Antony Moniz Barreto</hi> was sent to this effect. Mean while the King of <hi>Cota</hi> persuades <hi>Iavira,</hi> That he should no sooner be a Christian, but the Portugueses would deprive him of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The King giving Credit to this wicked Device, resolved to kill all the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses sent to his assistance. But the better to execute it, feigned himself still of the same Mind. <hi>Barreto</hi> (it is not known how) had Intelligence of the Design, and finding more danger in Returning to the Ships, than going on to <hi>Ceitavaca,</hi> where that King was our Friend, he caused those One hundred and twenty Men he had Landed to burn all they had, except some little Provision, to let them know they were to save nothing, but their Lives. Three days they marched, fighting with Eight thousand Men so fortunately, that they arrived at <hi>Ceitavaca</hi> without losing one Man: To the great Honour of their Captain.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Our irreconcileable Enemy, the King of <hi>Achem,</hi> about this time sent against <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca</hi> a Fleet of sixty Sail, and in it Five thousand Land-men; among which were Five hundred <hi>Orobalones,</hi> commonly called, <hi>Of the Gold Bracelets;</hi> because they wear them, and are very brave; but his best Regiment was of Turks and Janizaries.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54711:348"/>
This Body was Commanded by a Valiant Moor, who had the style of Dr. King of <hi>Pedir.</hi> He Landed by Night at <hi>Malaca,</hi> and found nothing but some Geese, which he took to shew his Prince, as a Testimony of his Landing: But those Fowl alarming the City (as formerly the Capitol,) caused all to be in readiness, which was but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the Town being then very scarce of Men.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. However, the Enemy was forced to retire and imbark, having burnt two Ships of ours that were ready to sail. Without they took seven Fishermen, and cutting off their Noses Ears, and Feet, sent them to the Commander <hi>Simon de Melo,</hi> with a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge writ with their Blood. The Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge was made a Jest of, because there was no Force there to Answer it. But the Great St. <hi>Francis Xaverius,</hi> who was zealous for the King's Honour, as well as the Service of God, being there then, he disapproved the Jest, and advised to meet the Enemy at any rate. The Governour and others excused themselves, urging there were in the Port but eight small Vessels, which, as being rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and unfit for service, lay aground. This was true, but the Cause of it was the Neglect and Avarice of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Great <hi>Xaverius</hi> took so much pains, that he prevailed with some Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to fit out those Vessels, prophetically promising two Galliots would come to their Aid. The time prefixed was near expired,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54711:349"/>
when they appeared sailing for <hi>Patane,</hi> and came into <hi>Malaca,</hi> though they had not designed it. The Saint went aboard, found they were Commanded by <hi>Iames Suarez de Melo,</hi> called the <hi>Gallego,</hi> and his Son <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasar;</hi> he persuaded them to have a part in that Action. These Ten poor Vessels being fitted and manned with Two hundred and thirty Men, sailed to find out the Enemy under the Command of <hi>D. Francis Deça.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. Being about to return Home, after two Months spent in search of the Enemy, they found him in the River <hi>Parles,</hi> and Engaged upon a <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning. The Fight was desperate; our Men behaved themselves with incredible Bravery, and had a most compleat Victory, killing Four thousand of the Enemy, sinking several of their Ships, and taking most of the rest, whereof they carried away but Twenty five, for want of Men, and burnt the rest. Three hundred Pieces of Cannon were taken, and almost a Thousand Musquets. This Victory cost us but Twenty five Men, some say, only four.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. At the time of this Fight St. <hi>Francis</hi> was Preaching at <hi>Malaca,</hi> and pausing, on a sudden related all the particulars of it to his Auditory, who were in great Care for those Ships, having had no News of them in two Months. His Prediction was verified a few days after by their Arrival.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THe Governour began this Year with the utter destruction of the Coast subject to <hi>Hidalcan.</hi> He had the same Fleet as before, and began in <hi>Ianuary</hi> at the River <hi>Charopa,</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Goa.</hi> He spared neither Living Creature, Vegetable, nor the very Stones; but burnt and slaughtered all as far as the City <hi>Dabul,</hi> which was reduced to Ashes, the Inhabitants being fled with the best of their Goods. Hence he ran in the same manner to the River <hi>Cifardam,</hi> which parts this Kingdom from that of <hi>Melique.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The King of <hi>Campar,</hi> who had taken the City <hi>Adem</hi> from the Turks, being threatned by them, had recourse to the Portugueses, submitting himself to our King; and to this effect <hi>D. Payo de Norona</hi> was sent to him with a Supply by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54711:350"/>
of <hi>Ormuz. D. Payo</hi> behaved not himself as he ought to have done on this Occasion; for the King marching out to fight the Turks, by whom he was beaten and slain, and having left him to guard the City, he (over-fearful of Treachery) retired to his Ship, and returned not though he saw the Town Assaulted. Some Turkish Galleys came and besieged the place, and <hi>D. Payo</hi> having promised the Prince assistance left him, carrying away the few Portugueses he had brought. <hi>Emanuel Pereyra</hi> resolved to stay there, and <hi>Francis Vieyra,</hi> who was raising Men at <hi>Campar,</hi> made his way in. Both behaved themselves bravely; but the Turks entring by Treachery, the Prince and one of his Brothers were killed; the Portugueses with another retired to <hi>Campar,</hi> to expect the Succours were to come from <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>D. Alvaro</hi> went with Three hundred Men in Thirty Vessels, loaded with Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. The Governour was overjoyed with the News of the submission of <hi>Adem.</hi> But this Joy was soon allayed by a dangerous Fever, and a violent Mutiny raised for want of Bread. <hi>Emanuel de Sousa &amp; Sepulveda</hi> prudently appeased it; and the Governour being recovered, caused his Hand to be cut off who Beat the Drum to Call the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and two others of the Chief, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned.</p>

4. D. <hi>Iohn de Ataide,</hi> or <hi>Meneses,</hi> sent before by D. <hi>Alvaro</hi> to <hi>Adem,</hi> entring boldly as believing it to be in the possession of D. <hi>Payo,</hi> lost two Vessels and all the Men that were in them, who were either killed or made Slaves by the Turks. <hi>Noronha</hi> met D. <hi>Alvaro</hi> at <hi>Canequirim,</hi> and earnestly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to represent how great the Danger was that obliged him to quit that place. But the dead Kings Embassadour and his own Silence, when accused, were Witnesses against him. He came afterwards to <hi>Goa,</hi> and one of his Servants having taken a Hen from a Slave, the Slave was complaining at the Door they would not restore it: When a Portugues passing by told him; <hi>Leave off, for in that House they love Hens: If it were</hi> Adem <hi>they would soon part with it, but not a Hen.</hi> Now in Portugues by a <hi>Hen</hi> they signifie a <hi>Coward,</hi> as well as the Fowl; and the word <hi>Adem</hi> signifies a <hi>Duck,</hi> and was the name of the place he quitted. D. <hi>Alvaro</hi> finding the posture of Affairs so changed, desisted from the Enterprize.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He had Orders, as soon as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at <hi>Adem</hi> to go to <hi>Caxem,</hi> that first being laid aside, he went to the second. The King of <hi>Caxem</hi> impatiently expected his assistance against the Turks, who had taken his Castle of <hi>Xael.</hi> They assaulted it, and those within (being only Thirty) offered to surrender upon Honourable Terms. The Portugueses against the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the King and D. <hi>Alvaro,</hi> refused to give any Conditions, and wrongfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54711:351"/>
them that came to Treat. Pride and Injustice seldom go unpunished. The Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses attack the Fort, and the Besieged turning their Submission into Rage, died couragiously, killing Five hundred Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses: The rest returned in Triumph to <hi>Goa,</hi> which was no ways grateful to the Governour; and 'tis thought the Cowardize at <hi>Adem,</hi> and Rashness at <hi>Xael,</hi> were two great Causes that carried him to his Grave, for all he endeavoured to dissemble it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The News of the Victory at <hi>Diu</hi> being brought this Year to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to send a greater Fleet than usual to <hi>India,</hi> and to Honour D. <hi>Iohn</hi> with unusual Favours; for they were the first that any Governour of <hi>India</hi> received from his Prince, for good Service performed. The Fleet consisted of seventeen Sail. D. <hi>Iohn</hi> had the Government continued to him with the Title of <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> a Present of Mony, and his Son D. <hi>Alvaro</hi> made Admiral of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Seas.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. D. <hi>Iohn</hi> was almost dead when these Bounties reached him, and he died of a Disease that nowadays kills no man, though it did formerly; for even Diseases dye. It was grief for the miserable estate <hi>India</hi> was reduced to, without any means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing it; and the Actions of some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, among them that of his Son at <hi>Xael.</hi> He publickly begged pardon of many for Writing against them to the King, that it may appear, even Great Spirits purchase Favour by mean Whispers.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:54711:351"/>
8. D. <hi>Iohn</hi> find ing himself unable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Government, appointed a Council of select Persons to supply his place. And when he saw there was no hopes of Life, he called them before him, and some others, and said, <hi>Though he neither hoped nor desired to live, yet while he continued in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion something must be spent: That he had nothing, and desired that they would order something out of the King's Revenue, that he might not dye for want.</hi> Then he ordered a Mass-Book to be brought, and laying his hand upon it, his Eyes lifted up to Heaven, swore, <hi>That he had no way made use of the Kings, or any other mans Mony: That he had not drove any Trade, to increase his own Stock;</hi> and desired that this Act of his might be Recorded. Soon after he gave up the Ghost in the Arms of St. <hi>Francis Xaverius,</hi> on the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> in the <hi>48th</hi> year of his Age, having Governed two Years and eight Months. In his private Cabinet was found a Bloody Discipline, and three Royals, which was all his Treasure.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. He was buried in the Church of Saint <hi>Francis.</hi> In the Year 1576 his Body was brought to <hi>Portugal,</hi> and laid in the Church of <hi>Bemfica</hi> of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> on a Hill not far from <hi>Lisbon.</hi> He is painted Crowned with Palm-branches, and cloathed in Red. He was a great Latinist, and well skilled in Mathematicks. Being desirous to know why the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> appears of that Colour, he made Men Dive to the bottom and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54711:352"/>
bring up what they found, whereof he writ a Treatise.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. D. <hi>Iohn</hi> Governed without suffering himself to be over-ruled by Pride, as others did before and after him. He asked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for himself as a Superiour; what the Necessities of the Government required, he asked as an Equal. He valued Men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Merit, not Fancy. He so much loved every one should look like what he was, that seeing a fine Suit of Cloaths as he passed by a Taylors, and being told it was his Sons, he cut it in pieces, saying, <hi>Bid that young man provide Arms.</hi> He was the <hi>14th</hi> in the number of Governours, and may be accounted the <hi>4th</hi> Vice-Roy, and first of the Name.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. It is fit something should be said of this Great Man's descent and first Actions. He was born the Year 1500, and was Son of <hi>Alvaro de Castro,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and of D. <hi>Leonor de Noronha,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of D. <hi>Iohn de Almeyda,</hi> Count of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brantes.</hi> In his Youth he served in <hi>Tangier,</hi> and returning home had a Commendary, valued at 500 Ducats a year conferred on him, which was all a man of his Birth and Merits was ever worth. In those days the Revenues were small, and Men great; afterwards the Revenues grew great, and the Men little. A Great Soul then did much with a little; now they do nothing with a great deal. The Year 1505, when D. <hi>Francis de Almeyda</hi> went first Vice Roy of <hi>India,</hi> his Salary was but 15000 Royals a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54711:352"/>
year. D. <hi>Constantine</hi> fifty years after, because he was of the Blood Royal, had 40000. Now they have 100000. See who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the greatest Exploits in that Post.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. He served afterwards under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Fifth, in the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Tuniz,</hi> and refused his part of a Present in Mony that Prince made to the Portugues Officers, saying, <hi>He served the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and of him expected his Reward.</hi> After this he commanded a Fleet upon the Coast, and was sent with another to the Relief of <hi>Ceuta,</hi> which joyning with that of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Spaniard hearing the Moors were drawing near, would draw off to Consult concerning the manner of giving Battle; but D. <hi>Iohn</hi> refused to stir. The Moors not knowing the Fleets were parted, retired, and D. <hi>Iohn</hi> remained with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this Action.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. When the Vice-Roy D. <hi>Garcia de No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronha</hi> went to <hi>India,</hi> D. <hi>Iohn</hi> was Captain of one of his Ships.

                     <p n="2">2. He received an Embassadour from <hi>Hidalcan</hi> to Treat of Peace, which was concluded much to our Advantage. About the beginning of <hi>August</hi> came in eleven of the seventeen Ships sent from <hi>Portugal</hi> this year:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54711:353"/>
The other six were arrived before. In this Fleet were the first Fathers of the Order of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> that went to build a Convent at <hi>Goa;</hi> they were six, and their Chief <hi>F. Iames Bernardez</hi> a Spaniard, and a Learned and Pious Man.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Governour sent <hi>Martin Correa de Silva</hi> to <hi>Diu;</hi> hastned the departure of the Trading Ships, and sailed for <hi>Baçaim</hi> with some Men in thirty Vessels, designing to gain some advantage over the King of <hi>Cambaya.</hi> He was disappointed; but it was some satisfaction that he had Advice there, That the King of <hi>Tanor</hi> being Converted, desired succour against such as should rebel upon his change of Religion. <hi>Garcia de Sá,</hi> the Governours Nephew, was sent with Threescore Men of Note, who had good success, as shall appear in its place.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. At this time the Governour splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly received the Embassadours of <hi>Zamori, Canara, Nizamaluco, Cotumaluco,</hi> and other Princes, who came to confirm the former Peace. At last <hi>Sultan Mamud,</hi> King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> made Overtures, tired with ill success, and the Peace was established to our Credit.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Spiritual Conquest was now very successful. <hi>Xaverius</hi> erected Churches, and Converted many among the <hi>Patava's,</hi> and two Kings with a multitude of People in <hi>Malaca. Iohn Soarez,</hi> Vicar of the Fort of <hi>Chale,</hi> converted the King of <hi>Tanor,</hi> with his Queen and Children. He desiring to see the Offices of the Church solemnly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54711:354"/>
at <hi>Goa,</hi> and be confirmed by the Bishop, came to the City, was nobly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and departed well satisfied, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to make his Subjects follow his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Persuasions of <hi>Zamori</hi> wrought no effect upon him now; but afterwards it seems they prevailed, for we shall see him in Arms against those who received him with such Honour.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. One <hi>Bislald,</hi> an Ethiopian and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the King of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> rebelled against him at <hi>Manojam.</hi> The King sent against him a good Body of his Men, supported by 120 Portugueses, to which were afterwards added 1000 of the first, and 180 of the latter; but all to no purpose, for he still kept himself out of reach. D. <hi>Emanuel de Lima</hi> finding he could not do any thing by open force, resolved to reach him by Craft. He agreed with a <hi>Gallego,</hi> That he should counterfeit he fled from him, and getting into <hi>Baslala</hi>'s Camp, kill him the first oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. The <hi>Gallego</hi> soon performed, and all was quiet.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This Year we shall see a bloody War between <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Siam,</hi> for an Elephant. The King of <hi>Siam</hi> had a white Elephant, a Beast coveted by all the Princes of the East. The King of <hi>Pegu</hi> demanded it by way of Superiority; and he of <hi>Siam</hi> refused it, not so much for the value of the Beast, as for the manner of asking. He of <hi>Pegu</hi> entred his Dominions, and reduced him to desire a Peace upon any Terms, so the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant were not comprehended. They
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54711:354"/>
agreed the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> should have the <hi>Siam</hi>'s Daughter and a Noble Woman every year, as an acknowledgment: But the latter not performing, the other returned with 1500000 Men, 4000 Elephants, and an incredible Train; with him came the Kings that depended on him, and <hi>Iames Soarez de Melo</hi> with 180 Portugueses. Above two Thousand Workmen went before, who every Night set up a stately Wooden Palace, richly painted and adorned with Gold. He made a prodigious Bridge of Boats over the rapid River <hi>Menam,</hi> a League over, to pass his Army. In his Way was a narrow Pass, where the <hi>Siamite</hi> had raised a strong Wall, guarded by 25000 Men. <hi>Iames Soarez</hi> was sent to gain it with 30000, which he performed with some loss to himself, but utter destruction of the Enemy. At length he sat down with his wonderful Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the City <hi>Odia,</hi> the Court or the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> who was within with 60000 Men, and 4000 Cannon, some of a prodigious magnitude. <hi>Odia</hi> is eight Leagues in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, about it a strong Wall, and round that a wide and deep Water.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Battery began. In the Town were 50 Portugueses, Commanded by <hi>Iames Pereyra,</hi> who behaved themselves to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The King of <hi>Pegu</hi> endeavoured to corrupt them with Bribes; but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all his Offers. The King astonished, despaired of gaining by the Sword, what could not be bought with Gold, and removed to the City <hi>Camambee,</hi> where were
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54711:355"/>
the <hi>Siamites</hi> Treasures; the Place strong, and defended by 20000 Men. After many Attempts this vast Power was forced to march off without doing any thing.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Xemindoo</hi> rebelled against the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> who sent <hi>Iames Soarez</hi> with Two hundred Portugueses to suppress him. He followed him to the City <hi>Cevadi;</hi> and he slipping by, got into <hi>Pegu,</hi> because the City sided with him. The Queen fled to the Castle, where she was defended by twenty Portugueses, till the King came and put the Rebels to flight. The Army entred the City, and put to the Sword not only Men, Women and Children, but even the Beasts; nothing escaped, but what was within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Iames Soarez</hi> his House, which the King had ordered should be exempted; above Twelve thousand saved themselves therein. The Plunder was unaccountable, <hi>Iames Soarez</hi> alone got above three Millions. At his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession the King pardoned a Portugues, who had furnished <hi>Xemindoo</hi> with Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Though the King escaped the hands of <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> he could not the Villany of <hi>Ximi de Zatan, (Ximi</hi> is equivalent to a Duke, and he really was one of Satan's creating) who murdered him in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful City <hi>Zatan.</hi> The Traytor was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately proclaimed King, and falling among the murdered Princes Men, killed three of those that belonged to <hi>Iames Soarez,</hi> who fled to the City <hi>Ovà,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Pegu</hi> was reconciled to this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54711:355"/>
New King, till <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> who fled before, came on again with a powerful Army. <hi>Ximi</hi> commanded <hi>Iames Soarez,</hi> and his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses, to march with him against the Enemy; but before he came thither, the punishment of his great Insolencies reached him, as shall be seen hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Zatan</hi> was taken and Beheaded by <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> who gave out it was for the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Soarez,</hi> as if the murder of the King had not been a more justifiable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Thus the first Rebel possessed himself of the Crown, till <hi>Mandaragri,</hi> the late Kings Brother-in-Law, claimed it in right of his Wife; and coming to a Battle, gave him such a total Defeat, that <hi>Xemindoo</hi> fled to the Mountains, where he married a poor Fellows Daughter. He discovered himself to her, and she revealed it to her Father, at such time as great Rewards were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to such as should discover him. The Father-in-Law delivered him up to the King, who cut off his Head.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The King not throughly satisfied with the People of <hi>Pegu,</hi> built not far from it another great and strong City. Then he marched with an Army of 1600000 Men, and over-run many Neighbouring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. But another Rebellion breaking out at <hi>Pegu,</hi> the Queen was forced to fly to the Castle, chiefly relying upon 39 Portugueses, who defended her till the King came and vanquished the Rebels. Then the King sent an Officer to bring those Men, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Queen, to his presence. He
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54711:356"/>
brought him some Moors of Note; but the King knowing the Portugueses were the Men, said in Anger, <hi>I sent you for Men, and you bring me Cowards; Go, bring me Men.</hi> The Portugueses being brought, he bid them ask whatever Reward they would, and they with the Surprize doubting, the King loaded them with Riches, Praises and Honours.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Now were the Inhabitants of the City <hi>Chincheo,</hi> the second Portugues Colony in <hi>China,</hi> in a flourishing condition, and seemed to have forgot the sad Fate of <hi>Liampo,</hi> destroyed through their Wickedness and Avarice. <hi>Ayres Coello de Sousa</hi> came thither to be Judge of the Orphans, and Proveditor for the Dead; his Intention being to rob the Living and Dead, his Countrymen and Strangers. He committed many Villanies to lay hold of 12000 Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, belonging to an <hi>Armenian</hi> Christian, who died there, and 8000 more of some <hi>Chinese</hi> Merchants, upon pretence they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the dead Man. These and other Insolencies provoked the Chineses to do, as they had done at <hi>Liampo;</hi> to wit, to raze the Town, and destroy all the Inhabitants. Only Thirty escaped of Five hundred Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses that lived there. These, and some others they gathered, went over to the Island <hi>Lampazau;</hi> and afterwards, in the Year 1557, obtained of the Chineses that of <hi>Gaoxam,</hi> where they built the City now called <hi>Macao,</hi> as shall be seen in its place.</p>

14. Our Governour studying some Means to relieve the great Wants of the Souldiers, was suddenly snatched away by Death, about the beginning of <hi>Iuly.</hi> He was much regretted for his Prudence, Affability and Integrity; for being Seventy years of Age, and having born considerable Offices, he was forced to give all he had to Match two Daughters, and yet the best part of their Portions was their Beauty, and that He was their Father. He had a graceful Presence; a comly Countenance, always Smiling, without lessening his Gravity: For it is not necessary to be like a Statue, to appear like a God. He was of the first Quality of his Country: His Beard very white and full, falling upon his Breast: Governed a Year and a Month, and was the <hi>15th</hi> in that Rank; the second of the Name, and first of the Sirname.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Government of <hi>George Cabral,</hi> from the Year 1549, till the Year 1550, in the Reign of King <hi>JOHN</hi> the Third.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Patents of Succession being opened, there was found in the first <note place="margin">1549.</note> 
                        <hi>George Cabral,</hi> a Gentleman by Birth, and of known Worth, who not long before was gone to take possession of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Baçaim.</hi> He received the News with small signs of Joy, an ill token for him that expected the Recompence of carrying it: But he being a generous Man, did not lessen the Reward. It was not want of desire to Govern that made him dissatisfied; but that he feared another coming soon from <hi>Portugal</hi> to succeed him, he should lose the great Advantages he might have made of the Command he was in, and which he was to hold four Years. With him was his Wife <hi>D. Lucretia Fiallo,</hi> who had double Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions to be vain, as a Woman, and as a Beauty, and had now a third, in the News of being Wife to the Governour of <hi>India;</hi> so she laughed to see her Husband doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he should receive what was offered.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:54711:357"/>
2. <hi>Cabral</hi> revolved a thousand Thoughts with himself, not knowing whether to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or refuse the Government, and these Cares so disturbed him, that he could not Rest at Night. His Wife finding him so dubious, and fearing to be disappointed of the Pride of sitting, though never so short a time in the Throne of <hi>India,</hi> took him one Night to task, and using all Arts of an ambitious Womans Tongue, and the Allurements of that place, prevailed with him to lay aside all Doubt, and accept of the Honour offered, which he had seemed averse to, and which she so ardently desired.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He admired her efficacy in Persuading, no less powerful in the beauty of her Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, than that of her Person. Though he always thought her a Woman of Sense; (for Beauty and Folly are not always inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable) yet he could not but conclude, the desire of Greatness is a great matter of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Who could resist a resolute Beauty? Had it been to draw on Mankind another Universal sin, he must have been an <hi>Adam</hi> to that <hi>Eve;</hi> much more to accept of a Command for which he was sufficiently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified. In fine, The New Governour sailed to <hi>Goa,</hi> in this only Governed by his Wife; for <hi>India</hi> might vie with her in the desire of seeing him possess that Throne many years: For <hi>Cabral</hi> deserved to have been long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that Post, and <hi>India</hi> was obliged to his Wife for the short time he held it. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not always hurtful: But in those
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54711:358"/>
days there were some Beautiful and Gay without being quite Mad.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. At our Governours coming from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi> there was not a right Understanding between that King and him, because he ordered <hi>Francis de Silva</hi> to attemp to Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pagod of <hi>Palurte,</hi> which was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, and he lost three Portugueses; and the Loss had been greater, but that the King was then absent. This was the Cause that three Ships set out for <hi>Portugal</hi> late, and ill Laden. Now came the News, That above 100 Sail were fitting out at <hi>Suez,</hi> to transport Turks into <hi>India.</hi> The Governour applied himself to provide for such a Storm, he acquainted the Chief of our Towns. <hi>Goa</hi> offered much, <hi>Chaul</hi> 30 Sail, <hi>Bazaim</hi> 20. Whilst these Preparations were making, <hi>F. Antony Criminal,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Jesuit, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Cape <hi>Comori,</hi> received the Crown of Martyrdom at the hands of a multitude of the King of <hi>Bisnagar</hi>'s Subjects, who assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as he Preached. He was run through with three Lances, and then his Head cut off. King <hi>Iohn</hi> was so mightily delighted with this Exploit, that he immediately sent Advice to <hi>Baltasar de Faria</hi> his Embassadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> to communicate it to the Pope, who received it with due applause.</p>

                        <p>Continues the Government of <hi>George Cabral.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>ZAmori,</hi> and the King of <hi>Pimienta,</hi> were joyned in a League against him of <hi>Cochin,</hi> which threatned that State with dangerous consequences. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour set out to prevent them with a Fleet of 90 Sail; but returned to <hi>Goa</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing, because the Season was unfit. He only consulted with the King of <hi>Cochin</hi> about the manner of carrying on the War against those Confederates, since they could not be brought to a Peace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Weather being seasonable, the King of <hi>Pimienta</hi> took the Field at <hi>Bardela</hi> wth 10000 Nayres, the King of <hi>Cochin</hi> did the same with his Men, and 600 Portugueses, Commanded by the rash <hi>Francis de Sylva,</hi> Captain of that Fort. The Armies being drawn up in sight, the King of <hi>Pimienta,</hi> at the Request of <hi>Sylva,</hi> gave him a Meeting between them. <hi>Sylva</hi> pressed for an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, which the King condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to upon reasonable Terms, was broke off by our Captain; who having more natural Strength than natural Reason, acted more like a Brute than a Man. The Armies
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54711:359"/>
charged each other Couragiously, and the King of <hi>Pimienta</hi> was carried off Wounded, and died before he knew the event of the Battle. His Men fled, and were pursued into their City with great slaughter; the Royal Palace was fired, which among them is the hainousest Affront; whereupon they Rallied, and fell upon the Victors with such Fury, that they obliged them to retire in great disorder. <hi>Sylva</hi> discharged some few that stood by him, and rushing into the thickest of the Enemies, was killed. Above fifty Portugueses were lost here, which abundantly countervailed for our Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Five thousand Nayres, all sworn to Revenge the death of their King, or dye, entred the Country of <hi>Cochim,</hi> killing many, and forcing others to fly to the Fort. The Commander of the Fort, <hi>Henry de Sousa,</hi> marced out, and finding them engaged with the <hi>Indians,</hi> who fought desperately, killed Five hundred. Two strange and contrary Accidents hapned upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: One was, a Man that lay dying arose, and taking a Lance did great Execution among the Enemies, and perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his health: The other, a Man in perfect health, who fell down dead with the Fright.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All the Joy of this Success vanished at the sight of <hi>Zamori,</hi> who came attended by the Princes of <hi>Malabar,</hi> with 140000 Men. He Encamped with 100000 at <hi>Chembe,</hi> ordering those Princes (who were
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54711:359"/>
eighteen in number, and among them the King of <hi>Tanor,</hi> lately so fond of us and our Religion) with the other 40000, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of 5000 had devoted themselves to pass over into the Island <hi>Bardela.</hi> Our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, upon the first Advice, prepared to meet this Storm. He sent before <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel de Sousa &amp; Sepulveda</hi> with four Ships, and Orders, That having joyned those that were at <hi>Cochim,</hi> he should shut up those Princes in the Island till he came, being resolved to follow at his Heels. <hi>Sepulveda</hi> did his part, and the Governour his, for he sailed immediately; the Cities of <hi>Goa, Chaul,</hi> and <hi>Baçaim,</hi> furnishing what they had offered for the Expedition against the Turks, which came to nothing. The Fleet consisted of above 100 Sail, and almost 4000 Landmen. The first Execution was at <hi>Tiracole,</hi> where many Houses, Ships and Goods were burnt. <hi>Coulete</hi> suffered the same Fate, after a vigorous Resistance, which cost the Lives of many of them, and sixteen of ours. At <hi>Panane</hi> the same, and we lost eight.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Our Governour Landed at <hi>Cochim,</hi> and found that King with Forty thousand Men; he had himself Six thousand, Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand having joyned him there. The Island being beset, and Signal given to fall on, those within began to waive a white Flag, for a Parley. It was concluded, those eighteen Princes should put themselves into the Governours hands, upon promise of Life. He finding they delayed, resolved to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54711:360"/>
fight them the next day, but was hindred by a great Flood; yet he concluded he might put his design in execution the day after. But what security is there in human Felicity? <hi>Cabral</hi> was almost in possession of one of the most glorious Actions that had been seen in <hi>India,</hi> when the sudden Arrival of the Vice-Roy <hi>D. Alfonso de No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronha</hi> ravished this Honour from him, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> suffering him to proceed, nor concluding himself what was so well begun. On the contrary, he suffered all those Princes to escape with their whole Army.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. St. <hi>Francis Xaverius</hi> seeing how many great Enterprizes were disappointed through the malice or Envy of the Governours, wrote a Letter to the King, acquainting him therewith, and advising to punish such Miscarriages with severity, whereby they might for the future be prevented. But Ministers serve as they please; Saints advise well, and Princes Eyes are never opened. Commonly, the want of due Punishment is the cause of publick Calamities.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Whilst <hi>George Cabral</hi> was at <hi>Cochim,</hi> waiting to embarque in the Ships that were bound to <hi>Portugal,</hi> one Night about the middle of <hi>February</hi> there was a Report, That Eight thousand sworn Nayres would enter the City. <hi>Cabral</hi> run to the Gates, with <hi>Emanuel de Sousa &amp; Sepulveda,</hi> in order to march out and meet them at Break of Day; but was hindred by the Council of the City. He stayed with a competent Number of Men to guard the Town, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54711:360"/>
sent <hi>Sepulveda</hi> with Fifteen hundred Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses and the Natives. They found those desperate Men in a Neighbouring Town, acting all that Rage and Malice could sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest. They Charged them; the Fight was very desperate, fifty Portugueses were slain, and above a Thousand of the <hi>Amouco's</hi> or devoted Nayres, the rest fled.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Let us see what was done during this time by the Captains, sent by the Governour to several parts. The King of <hi>Cota</hi> had asked Succour against his Brother <hi>Madune Pandar,</hi> King of <hi>Ceitavaca,</hi> who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to expel him his Kingdom; he offered in requital for the Relief, to pay a greater Tribute than before. <hi>Caralea Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> Prince of <hi>Candea</hi> (not following the Example of his Father, who was bent against the Religious Men, who made him a Christian) desired to be Baptized, and fled with the Priests to a Fort, from whence he sent to beg the Governour's assistance. Both these places being in the Island <hi>Ceylon,</hi> he sent thither <hi>D. George de Castro</hi> with six hundred Men. <hi>Madune</hi> scarce saw him, when he raised the Siege he had laid to <hi>Cota,</hi> where his Brother was. The King of <hi>Cota</hi> and <hi>D. George</hi> followed him; and he so fortified the Passes, they were forced in some places to fight their way through showers of Bullets, Stones and Arrows, with some loss of Men, and no small slaughter of the Enemy. Being come in sight of the City <hi>Madune</hi> met them, and there ensued a bloody Battle desperately fought on both
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54711:361"/>

Thus we see Princes bestow the very same Places on some as Rewards, which they give to others as a step to Merit: The fault is not in the Gift, but in him that bestows it. But it seems, the King in part ballanced this Favour by assigning him a Council, by whom he must of necessity be Advised in <hi>India.</hi>

3. <hi>Don Alfonso</hi> set out of <hi>Lisbon</hi> with four Ships; one had been sent before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to give Advice why the rest stayed, and <hi>D. Alvaro de Gama</hi> (Son to the Great <hi>Vasco)</hi> sailed so late, it was never expected he would get thither; yet he overtook the others, the Seas being favourable to all that descend from his Father; for it was never known any of them was Cast-away. The Vice-Roy was received at <hi>Goa</hi> with the usual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of Joy, proceeding rather from the hatred they bear him that lays down the Sword, than love to him that takes it up.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He immediately sent Advice of his Arrival to all Parts, and dispatched Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders to several Forts, and for Sea. <hi>Luis Figueyra</hi> was sent to the <hi>Red Sea</hi> with five Vessels, where they met the Turk <hi>Cafar</hi> with five Galliots. <hi>Figueyra</hi> attacks <hi>Cafar</hi>'s Galliot, and was slain, much admired by the Enemy for his Valour. The four sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Captains stood looking on and saw him killed, without coming to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. One of them, <hi>Gaspar Nunez,</hi> ashamed of what he had done, went away with all his Men into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and was never more heard of. <hi>Soveral,</hi> another of them, met one of those Galliots, fought, and they parted upon equal Terms.

5. The Arabs of <hi>Catifa</hi> delivered up to the Turks the Fort of that City, which highly offended the King of <hi>Ormuz.</hi> The Turks had also expelled his Kingdom the King of <hi>Baçora,</hi> who yet kept the Field with Thirty thousand Men, in hopes to recover his Kingdom with the assistance of the Portugueses. To this effect he sent an Embassy to the Vice-Roy, offering leave to build a Fort in his Harbour, and other Advantages to the Crown of <hi>Portugal. D. Antonio de Noronha,</hi> Nephew to the Vice-Roy, was sent to assist these two Kings, with Twelve hundred Men in nineteen Vessels. Being come to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> they marched with Three thousand of that Kings Men, and set down before the Fort of <hi>Catifa.</hi> Four hundred Turks that were in that Garrison behaved themselves bravely; but finding it in vain to resist, fled by Night, and being discovered were pursued and routed. The Fort was taken, and the Captain of <hi>Ormuz</hi> not daring to maintain it, it was thought fit to be razed. A Mine was made, which taking fire before the time, and blowing up, the Work buried 40 Portugueses.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

At length <hi>Sá,</hi> to prevent Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, submitted. <hi>Sousa</hi> immediately sets out with 180 Portugueses, and sails for <hi>Gilolo,</hi> to destroy the Fort was raising there. The King of <hi>Ternate,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Bacham,</hi> followed with 5000 Men.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The King of <hi>Gilolo</hi> couragiously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the coming of his Enemy in the the Fort, with 1200 Men and many Pieces of Cannon. <hi>Baltasar Veloso</hi> led our Van; the Prince of <hi>Gilolo</hi> breaking out of an Ambush with Four hundred Men, fell upon and distressed him; but <hi>Veloso,</hi> though se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years of Age, made such havock among the Enemies, they were forced to fly. Our Captain received some damage, continues his Battery, and sits down to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege the place. He cut off their Water, which obliged them, after a Siege of three Months, to Capitulate, and Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded upon these hard Terms, That the

The King of <hi>Ujantana</hi> had sent an Embassadour to <hi>D. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro de Silva,</hi> Commander of <hi>Malaca,</hi> whose chief business was to discover what Force was in <hi>Malaca. D. Pedro,</hi> on the other side,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54711:364"/>
was privately informed by <hi>Laximena,</hi> the Embassadour's Father, of the King's design, which was to surprize <hi>Malaca</hi> by giving o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The King entred the Port, and burnt what Ships were in it, and at the same time possessed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the Suburbs. Then he intrenched, planted his Cannon, and began to batter the Fort furious and successfully, and at length reduced the Inhabitants to feed upon such things as are loathsom.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>D.

But <hi>D. Garcia</hi> did not long survive this Honour; for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to gain a Gun that did much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Town, he was killed, and with him above thirty Portugueses, brought by <hi>D. Pedro de Silva</hi> to rescue him. Mean while several Portugues Ships came into the Harbour from divers parts, the News of the danger <hi>Malaca</hi> was in had reached. The Enemy endeavoured to oppose them, and <hi>Gomes Barreto</hi> conducted them in with safety.</p>

11. The Enemy resolved to Assault the City, and the Commander <hi>D. Pedro</hi> having Notice of it, provided to receive them. Scarce did they begin to mount their Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when there fell on them a Storm of great pieces of Timbers, Stones and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado's, so that in an instant above Eight hundred of them lay dead under the Wall. This obliged them to retire to their Works, and they resolved to starve the City. Our Commander fearing the Consequence of this Resolution, was advised by an unknown Souldier, (who before at the Assault pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the throwing of Beams) to send abroad some Ships, and give out, They were going to put those King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They believing it, left the Siege, which was prosecuted by the Queen of <hi>Iapara,</hi> with the Men of <hi>Iava,</hi> till <hi>Giles Fernandez de Carvallo</hi> coming unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly with Two hundred Men, there ensued a bloody Fight; and at length the Enemies were put to a shameful flight, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost above Two thousand Men, many Ships, and all their Cannon and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, whereof was a great quantity, and it was of great consequence to the City. What the Enemy could not execute by force when present, they did by perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness after their flight. They poisoned a Well, whereof our Men drinking, above Two hundred died, to the great terrour of all, till the Cause was known.</p>

12. The Affairs of <hi>Ceylon</hi> were now in a very turbulent posture; for <hi>Madune,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Agreement, distressed the King of <hi>Cota,</hi> who had recourse to <hi>Gaspar de Aze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedo,</hi> Commander of <hi>Columbo,</hi> and he (with the King's Men and 100 Portugueses) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Enemy. But the King of <hi>Cota</hi> being killed by a Musquet-shot, he of <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavaca</hi> renewed his Pretensions. The suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess was not answerable to his expectation; for the New Prince, assisted by the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses, gave him a total Rout. At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>September</hi> the Vice-Roy prepared to go in Person to remedy these Disorders. At the same time arrived from <hi>Portugal</hi> five Ships, and soon after two more. One was forced back to <hi>Lisbon</hi> by ill Weather. The Vice-Roy set out the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> with 3000 Men in 70 Sail.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The first thing he did after his Arrival at <hi>Ceylon,</hi> was to put upon the Rack some Subjects of that King he went to succour, that they might discover where their Princes Treasure was buried, as if he had been an Enemy, or had sent for him to make him his Treasurer. In the second place, he searched the Dead Man's Palace, and found 80000 Ducats. Thirdly, He demanded 200000 Ducats for his Charges, which was immediately granted. And, Fourthly, he took the Field with his Three thousand Portugueses, and Four thousand of the Kings Men. The King of <hi>Ceytavaca</hi> met them with a like Number; but soon fled into the Mountains, followed only by 100 Men.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54711:366"/>
His City was plundered, and the Booty very considerable. The Vice-Roy turned over the Earth, and dug up the Foundations of Buildings, to discover hidden Treasures. One was found, consisting of many Gold and Silver Idols of a large size, and other things. One half of right belonged to the King we pretended to Relieve, according to Agreement; but the Wants of <hi>India</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no performance of Promises. Had the Indian broke his Word with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, he had been a Barbarian. I know not what a Christian is, that breaks his with the Barbarian: Perhaps wiser Men know. It appeared we went in search of hidden Treasures, not to Relieve distressed Kings; when this King desiring Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Portugueses might be left with him, to prevent his Enemies making Head again, he was left without any, because there was no more hopes of Treasure. But we shall soon see the King of <hi>Cota</hi> revenged by the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that it may appear the Actions of Kings are Divine, when they are their own.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Mean while <hi>Don Antony de Noronha</hi> scoured the Sea of <hi>Calicut,</hi> making great havock in it, and along the shoar. The Vice-Roy returned to <hi>Cochin,</hi> bringing with him a Kinsman of the King of <hi>Cota,</hi> who was become a Christian; went to <hi>Portugal,</hi> where he was received with Honour, and sent back to <hi>India,</hi> and died in the Faith. The Vice-Roy found the dispatch of the Homeward-bound Trading Ships, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54711:366"/>
by the Prince of <hi>Chembe,</hi> he resolved to punish him, and set out with a Fleet that contained Four thousand Men. Thirty thousand were gathered from <hi>Calicut</hi> to oppose him, and some endeavoured to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Landing, but were soon put to flight.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Our Men landed and marched to the City; the Enemy met them, and there followed a bloody Battle, in which we lost forty Men; but the Enemy was put to flight, and the Vice-Roy satisfied with ravaging the Country, returned to <hi>Cochim,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the Ships for <hi>Portugal.</hi> In them went an Embassadour from <hi>Nautaquim,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tanixumaa,</hi> or <hi>Taquixima,</hi> one of the Islands of <hi>Iapan,</hi> and a rich Present; he desired Five hundred Men to conquer the Island <hi>Lequio,</hi> and in return offered to pay Tribute. The Embassadour was one <hi>Iames Gomez de Almeyda,</hi> who was lost in the Unfortunate Ship in which <hi>Emanuel de Sousa &amp; Sepulveda</hi> was Cast-away, with his Wife <hi>D. Leonor de Albuquerque &amp; Sá,</hi> who being put ashoar at the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> endured incredible hardships, and at length died miserably, giving occasion to sundry Relations that are spread about the World, which being in part false, I will here give a brief Account of the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p n="16">
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:54711:367"/>
16. They got ashoar at the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> to the number of Five hundred and thirty Souls; and at first marched in good Order, with Colours and a Crucifix on high, designing for <hi>Mozambique.</hi> They began their march the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and about the end of it several were left behind Famished, and among them a Natural Son of <hi>Emannel de Sousa. D. Leonor</hi> marched afoot; for those who had carried her were no longer able to support themselves. At the end of three Months and a half they came to the Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of <hi>Oinhaca,</hi> a little Prince on the Banks of the River <hi>Del Espiritu Sancto:</hi> This good Old Man entertained them with great kindness, offering to relieve them till some Portugues Ships came to the Neighbouring Shoars, whereof his People had always Notice. He also warned them, That further on was the Little Prince <hi>Ofumo,</hi> who would do them all the harm he could, if they proceeded on their Journey. <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel de Sousa</hi> following his Destiny, went on; but seeing that of Five hundred and thirty Persons, he had but One hundred and twenty left, and that his Wife <hi>D. Leonor</hi> could hardly go farther, taking her turn with the Slaves in carrying her little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he began to shew some signs of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, which was an incredible Grief to his Wife, who doted on him. Being come to <hi>Ofumo</hi>'s Country, forgetting the Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Oinhaca</hi> had given, he trusted him, and resolved there to wait for Portugues Ships. <hi>Ofumo</hi> designed to rob him, but feared his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54711:367"/>
Mens Arms. He persuaded him to deliver them up, and he should have all Necessaries abundantly provided; pretending his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects did not supply him for Fear. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all Persuasions to the contrary, he delivered them, and had scarce done it when he was robbed of all his Jewels, and only their Cloaths left them. At this he run quite Mad, and his Wife taking him by one hand and her son in the other, her Slaves following, and some few Men, they went on till the <hi>Cafres</hi> fell upon and strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them. <hi>D. Leonor</hi> endeavoured to defend her self to no purpose, and with hazard of her Life, till her Husband persuaded her to choose the lesser Evil; but she thought it less Ill to dye, than be seen Naked by any, but her Husband. As soon as she was stripped, she made her Slaves stand about her, and sitting down on the Sand, made a Hole, where she covered her self to the Waste: Then looking upon the Pylot, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Vaz,</hi> said, <hi>You see how God permits, as a punishment of my sins, that my Husband, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and I perish in this miserable manner. If you get to</hi> Portugal, <hi>or</hi> India, <hi>give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.</hi> The Pylot not able to return an Answer for grief, went whatever way Chance guided him. <hi>Emanuel de Sousa</hi> had run to the Wood, to gather some wild Fruit for his Wife and Children, who were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing with Hunger, and returning found one dead, and her with the other scarce alive. He buried the dead Child, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for more Fruit, but too late; for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54711:368"/>
when he came they were both dead. After pausing a while, he made a Hole and buried his Son, and then his Wife; after which he ran into the thickest of the Wood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out once looking back. Three of his Slaves got to <hi>India,</hi> who gave this Relation, as others who reached <hi>Moçambique</hi> did, of other Passages. Among these was <hi>Sebastian de Sá,</hi> who in this Misery experienced two Notable things: One, That the Gravity even of a Portugues Gentleman (as he was) must yield to Misfortunes; for he, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the <hi>Cafres</hi> to give him some Sustenance, played the Antick, or Buffoon.

                        <p>Continues the Government of the Vice-Roy, <hi>D. Alfonso de Noronha.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Great Turk offended at what we had done at <hi>Caxem,</hi> or <hi>Catifa,</hi> and attempted at <hi>Baçora,</hi> studied Revenge; and to execute it set out <hi>Pirbec,</hi> an Old Pyrat, with Sixteen thousand Men in strong Galleys and other Vessels. <hi>D. Alvaro de Noronha,</hi> Commander of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> concluded this Storm threatned him. He sent some to discover the Enemy, and among them <hi>Simon de Costa,</hi> who met <hi>Pirbec</hi>'s Son sent also before in a Galley to discover. Our Barque slipped under his very Oars so swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that two of the Men were left hanging at them; the Galley pursues, but <hi>Simon</hi> scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Mony among his Men, may be said to have got off with <hi>Golden Oars.</hi> The young Man raged that this Prize should escape him; but was somewhat appeased when he met another Barque, in which was the Wife of <hi>Iohn de Lisboa,</hi> Commander of <hi>Mascate,</hi> and those of some other Portugueses that lived there, with two Old Men, all sent away to <hi>Ormuz</hi> for fear of the Enemy. The Women were secured, and the Men put to the Oar.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:54711:369"/>
2. The Enemies Fleet came before <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> which held out almost a Month against that great Power; but was forced to submit and capitulate. <hi>Pirbec</hi> broke the Articles, putting the Captain and sixty Men to the Oar; some of them were afterwards ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed. This done, <hi>Pirbec</hi> goes on to <hi>Ormuz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> D. Alvaro de Noronha</hi> had Nine hundred Men in that Fort, and in it was the King, his Wife, Children, and the Chief of their Court, who had taken Sanctuary there. He laid up Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition for a long Siege, and secured forty Sail that were in the Bay, among them one of those that the year before went from <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Turk being come to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, presently Landed and Encamped. He Intrenched, raised Batteries, planted much Cannon, and played it furiously without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission for a whole Month. Finding he sustained much Loss, and laboured in vain, he plundered the City and went over to the Island <hi>Queixome,</hi> whither many considerable Men of <hi>Ormuz</hi> had withdrawn themselves; here he got a great Booty, and retired.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Before <hi>Pirbec</hi> departed from <hi>Ormuz,</hi> he offered our Commander to ransom the Prisoners taken at <hi>Mascate,</hi> and sent him as a Present the Wife of <hi>Iohn de Lisboa,</hi> the two Old Men, and the two Souldiers that hung to the Oars of his Sons Galley. <hi>D. Alvaro</hi> received the two last, and sent back the others with some Presents, and this Message; <hi>That the Present was in return for the Men he received: That the Old Men he sent, because they had not rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>hose to lose their Lives,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54711:369"/>
than Liberty; and the Woman (though Innocent) to punish her Husbands guilt, by seeing her return into slavery.</hi> This Proceeding was no ways justifiable; and <hi>Pirbec</hi> to shew he did not again receive what he had once given, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to be left upon the Shoar.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Governour informed of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that threatned <hi>Ormuz,</hi> but not of its deliverance, with great diligence fitted a Fleet to go in Person to relieve it. All Ranks vied in aiding him towards this Work, at such time as six Ships arrived from <hi>Portugal,</hi> it being the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> He sailed as far as <hi>Diu,</hi> and hearing <hi>Ormuz</hi> was out of danger, returned to <hi>Goa.</hi> At this time <hi>D. Duarte Deça</hi> sailed for <hi>Ceylon,</hi> to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>D. Iohn Enriquez,</hi> deceased; with him went St. <hi>Francis Xaverius,</hi> carried by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of making a Spiritual Conquest.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A bold Turk, by Consent of <hi>Zamori,</hi> scoured the Seas with fifteen large Vessels well Manned. He fell upon <hi>Punicale,</hi> where <hi>Emanuel Rodriguez</hi> Commanded with seventy Portugueses. The Fight was sharp, till <hi>Antony Franco</hi> taking the Enemies Colours, they fled. The Turk enraged sent again Fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, who put all our Men to flight, except the Captain and seventeen, and these made a desperate resistance; but at last were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to quit the Town and fly to <hi>Bisme Naique,</hi> a Subject of <hi>Canarà,</hi> who made them all Slaves. The Turk, after plundering the Town, returned to his Ships Victorious. The News being brought to <hi>Coc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>im,</hi> stirred up a general desire of Revenge. Whilst
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54711:370"/>
things were debating, <hi>Giles Fernandez de Carvallo</hi> offered himself to go, and bear all the Charge, desiring only Shipping. All was provided with great diligence, and he set out in search of the Enemy; but by ill Luck <hi>Lawrence Coello</hi> fell into their hands, and was slain with all his Men, having fought bravely, <hi>Carvallo</hi> being no way able to come to his Relief, by reason of the contrary Wind.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. On the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> he fell upon the Turks with great Fury, and was received with no less Courage. The Fight lasted some hours with much bravery; all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Ships were boarded and taken, but much shattered; many killed in them, and others swimming to the Shoar. Then <hi>Giles Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez</hi> went to ransom the Prisoners, and restored <hi>Emanuel Rodriguez,</hi> not only his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but also Goods of great value the Turk had taken from him at <hi>Punicale.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. At this time the two Brothers, <hi>D. Alvaro de Ataide</hi> and <hi>D. Pedro de Silva,</hi> at <hi>Malaca,</hi> were at Variance about that Command; the former was most to blame, endeavouring to Remove the other before his time. <hi>Iames de Melo Coutino</hi> and <hi>D. Duarte Deça</hi> acted worse in <hi>Ceylon;</hi> for, after the Example of the Vice-Roy, having taken Mony of that Prince to assist him with each fifty Men against his Enemy, the King of <hi>Ceytavaca;</hi> the first after demanding more Mony, sent but Twenty; the other after receiving his, sent none, and because he refused, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the Feud he ought without any Bribe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54711:370"/>
to appease. <hi>Melo</hi> had secured that Princes Father by <hi>D. Alfonso</hi> his Order; upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Suspition; in reality, because he owed him 12000 Ducats of 100000 he promised on account of being succoured. <hi>Deça,</hi> instead of mending this Fault made it worse, keeping the Old Man with more rigour, and much more when he heard he was converted to the Faith, which might hinder his wicked Designs. A wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of many Portugueses, who hindred the Conversion of many Souls, because it was an obstacle to filling their Purses. The Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Wife bribing the Guards got him out, and set him at the Head of a Body of Men she had in readiness to revenge this Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. He began to act successfully, till his Son appeased him. This year departed this Life St. <hi>Francis Xaverius,</hi> and the next was brought to <hi>Goa</hi> with great solemnity.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. At <hi>Constantinople Pirbec</hi>'s Head was cut <note place="margin">1553.</note> off, for going beyond the Commission he received from the Turk, notwithstanding he made him a Present of all the Riches he carried. At the same time <hi>Moradobec</hi> set out by that Prince's Order with fifteen Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, to prevent the harm the Portugueses might do in revenge for what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. <hi>Moradobec</hi> was the Captain that lost <hi>Catifa,</hi> and desired to recover his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. On the Coast of <hi>Persia,</hi> D. <hi>Iames de Noronha</hi> met him with his Fleet. They sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted one another with showers of Bullets and Arrows. In the height of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Wind calming, left our Galleons
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54711:371"/>
without motion. That of <hi>Gonzalo Pereyra Marramaque</hi> was far distant from the rest. The Turk laying hold of this opportunity besets him with his Galleys, tears all his Rigging and pierces him in a thousand places. However <hi>Pereyra</hi> stood firm, and did much Execution among the Enemies, but receives more harm; for almost all that was above Water of the Galleon was torn in pieces. The Gentlemen, Souldiers and Seamen fought with incredible Courage, and appeared wherever there was occasion, though weakned with several Wounds.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Captain was always where the greatest danger threatned, and the Turks never durst board him. Our Admiral raved that he could not relieve and share with him in that Honour, and after making his Vows to Heaven, without being heard, even railed at Providence, stamped and tore his Beard for madness. He sent some Boats, but they could not reach the Galleon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Galleys compassed it round. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Night the Wind began to freshen, and the Admiral to move. The Turk not daring expect him, retired. The Admiral came up to the Galleon, admired the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; but scarce knew the Men, they were so disguised with Wounds, Blood and the Smoot of the Powder. He embraced every one, and bestowed due Praises on them.</p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:54711:371"/>
10. <hi>Pereyra</hi> his Galleon and Men were not in a condition to proceed, so they were sent to <hi>Ormuz</hi> with some Barques. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral pursued the Galleys, which kept close in with the Shoar. Our light Vessels forced a Ship that had been taken by <hi>Pirbec</hi> to run aground; the Men leaped Over-board to save themselves and were killed. The Ship was taken and brought off, and our Admiral returned to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> having in vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to overtake <hi>Moradobec,</hi> who run up the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where there was not Water for our Galleons. At this time arrived in <hi>Goa</hi> only one Ship from <hi>Portugal;</hi> four set out thence, one of them was forced back, the other two came later. In the first Ship went our admirable Poet <hi>Luis Camoens,</hi> to try if he could advance his Fortune by the Sword, which had been so little favourable by the Pen.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Now comes the King of <hi>Cota</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge (as was promised before) for those Wrongs done him by the Portugueses. One of the Orders <hi>Fernandalvarez Cabral,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Ship newly come from <hi>Portugal,</hi> carried, was, <hi>That all that had been exacted from that King, should be restored;</hi> Which, though slowly, was executed. Another, <hi>That</hi> Bernardin de Sousa <hi>should be Imprisoned for what he had done at the</hi> Maluco's: He was Imprisoned, but not long. And another, <hi>That the Vice-Roy should no way employ</hi> D. James de Almeyda <hi>Commander of</hi> Diu; <hi>for that the King had struck him out of his Books, never to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54711:372"/>
execution. <hi>Almeyda</hi>'s Crime was, <hi>That he had seemed to undervalue the Kings Favour, refusing some Grace offered him.</hi> The Vice-Roy was concerned, that the differences between the Kings of <hi>Pimienta</hi> and <hi>Cochi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> grew daily greater. Towards the End of <hi>November,</hi> the Vice-Roy sailed with a good Fleet to assist the latter, who was our Friend. He was met at Sea by <hi>D. Iames de Noronha</hi> and his Fleet, with whom came <hi>Gonçalo Pereyra Marramaque,</hi> who was received with much Joy, for his great Bravery in the late Action with the Turks. It was agreed, after some Consultation, to land in the Islands called <hi>Alagada's,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Pimienta.</hi> The Natives in crowds opposed our Men landing with showers of Arrows; but the Cannon made way. After a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Resistance all was destroyed with Fire and Sword; only one Man was lost on our side.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Gomes de Silva</hi> was left to prosecute the War, which he did so successfully that the King sued for Peace, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to our advantage, and he was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the restitution of the Islands, his Wife, and the People taken in them. The Vice-Roy dispatched the Ships for <hi>Portugal.</hi> That of <hi>Ferdinand Alvarez Cabral</hi> was Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away at <hi>Aguada de S. Blas;</hi> some of the Men got ashoar in Boats. After a tedious Journey by Land, <hi>Cabral</hi> and <hi>D. Alvaro de Noronha,</hi> with his Family, were drowned in a River. The Vice-Roy sent his Son <hi>D. Ferdinand,</hi> with a good Fleet to the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi> He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54711:372"/>
to gain the Fort of <hi>Dofar,</hi> but was repulsed with loss of seven or eight Men; so he returned without any effect.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. At <hi>Diu</hi> arose New Troubles on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the death of the King <hi>Sultan Manaud.</hi> He was bred with Poison (like <hi>Mithridates,)</hi> that none might hurt him. When his Women were near their time, he opened them to take out the Children. He was one day hunting a Deer with some of them, and falling off from his Horse hung by the Stirrup; the Horse dragged him, and one of the Women running cut the Girts with a Cimiter; in requital he killed her, saying, <hi>A Woman of such courage, had enough to kill him.</hi> A Page, in whom he had great confidence, murdered him; for Tyrants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dye by the hands of those they trust. A Child, accounted his Son, succeeded him. The Nobility offended at the Insolence of <hi>Madre Maluco,</hi> who with the Title of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> managed the Affairs of the Crown, rebelled in several parts. One of these was <hi>Abixcan</hi> at <hi>Diu,</hi> who suffering his Men to Affront ours, obliged <hi>D. Iames de Almeyda</hi> to enter the City with Five hundred Men, killing a great number, and plundering their Houses. <hi>Abixcan,</hi> though late, saw his Error, and came to Composition; and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more submissive than had been at first desired of him.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:54711:373"/>
14. D. <hi>Iames de Noronha</hi> succeeded <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meyda</hi> in that Post, in pursuance of the Kings Order before-mentioned. The Moors for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting their Fault, and the Punishment they had incurred, relapsed again. <hi>Noronha</hi> with Six hundred Men so refreshed their Memories, that they abandoned the City. <hi>Cide Elal,</hi> who Commanded in the Castle that was in the City, offered to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; but seeing our Men begin to scale it, submitted to march away without Arms. The Castle was demolished. Scarce was it done, when <hi>Abixcan</hi> appeared with Four hundred Men. <hi>Ferdinand de Castanoso</hi> advanced to meet him with One hundred and twenty; but Three hundred of the Enemies Horse obliged him to retire in such disorder, that on a sudden he found he had but seventeen Men left. He posted himself where the Horse could not come, and the Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Enemies dismounting beset the 18, who back to back defended themselves till they were all killed, their Hearts cut out, and carried to the General.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>D. Iames de Norona</hi> marched on with the rest of the Men, ignorant of what had happened; but so impatient to engage with <hi>Abixcan,</hi> that he could no way be dissuaded from pressing forward. Meeting the Three hundred Horse, he fell on furiously and put them to flight; but <hi>Abixcan</hi> coming on with his Cannon, <hi>D. Iames</hi> was forced to retire, rather losing than gaining Reputation in this Action. Common Conveniency brought them to an Accommodation. <hi>Noronha</hi> this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54711:373"/>
day lost by his Rashness, what he often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for his Valour; for the Factor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to stop his fury, and saying to him, <hi>He ought to consider the King's Fort would be lost.</hi> He Answered in a Passion, <hi>No matter, when I am gone, all is gone.</hi> This saying was remembred when he was in election to be Vice-Roy of <hi>India,</hi> and deprived him of that Post; because it was thought, so great a Trust could not with safety be reposed upon so rash a Man.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Great Turk hearing <hi>Miradobec</hi> was come off worse than the Unfortunate <hi>Pirbec,</hi> and <hi>Alechelubij</hi> making great boast of what he would do, gave him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of fifteen Galleys. <hi>D. Ferdinand,</hi> who was come out of the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> went after them. On the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> he had sight of them near <hi>Mascate. Alechelubij</hi> not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to give Battle, endeavoured to get off with all his Galleys; but six of them could not escape, being taken by our Caravels.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>D. Ferdinand</hi> put into <hi>Mascate,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted the Galleys, bought the Slaves, and appointed them Captains. <hi>Alechelubij</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by some of our Vessels was drove into <hi>Suratt</hi> with seven of his nine Galleys, and there shut up by <hi>D. Hierome de Castellobranco, Nuno de Castro</hi> and <hi>D. Emanuel Mascarenhas.</hi> The other two were pursued by <hi>D. Ferdinand de Monroy</hi> and <hi>Antony Valadares,</hi> till they were beaten to pieces on the Coast of <hi>Damam</hi> and <hi>Daru.</hi>

18. But because one is coming to succeed our Vice-Roy, let us say somewhat of him. He was modest, easie, and not active, which was the Cause his Government answered not expectation. As to his Person, he was of a middle Stature, a graceful Countenance and agreeable Behaviour; his Complexion swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; his Hair black. In the number of <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> he was the <hi>5th,</hi> in that of <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> the <hi>17th,</hi> and held it four years, the second of the Name and Sirname.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the Vice-Roy <hi>D. Peter de Mascarenhas,</hi> from the Year 1554 till 1555, King <hi>JOHN</hi> the Third still Reigning.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>DOn Peter de Mascarenhas</hi> was of one of <note place="margin">1554.</note> the best Families of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and had born the most considerable Offices in the Kingdom, and was 70 years of Age when named Vice-Roy of <hi>India.</hi> He set out of <hi>Lisbon</hi> with six Ships, one of them was drove back, and that in which he went, as soon as he Landed at <hi>Goa,</hi> sunk downright. In these Ships were Two thousand Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The first thing the Vice-Roy did,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54711:374"/>
he appointed his Nephew <hi>Ferdinand Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez</hi> Admiral, to the great dissatisfaction of all Men. <hi>Martinez</hi> had 32 Sail given him, and Orders to bring to <hi>Goa</hi> the 7 Turkish Galleys that were blocked up at <hi>Suratt. Cáraçen,</hi> Commander of that place, would not permit it, and gave good sufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for his refusing; so by consent of both sides they were taken to pieces, and the Turks fled into the Woods and Mountains: The late Vice-Roy <hi>D. Alfonso de Noronha</hi> now failed home with the Trading Ships; whereof that Commanded by <hi>Belchior de Sousa</hi> was lost, with all the Men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Great Turk (as it were) fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the Fate of <hi>Alechelubij,</hi> immediately sent after him <hi>Zafar,</hi> a Janizary, to take upon him the Command of the Galleys: But too late; for he only came time enough to hear the News of their Destruction. He took four Merchant Ships of ours bound for <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and returned rich to <hi>Suez.</hi> About the same time <hi>Gemes de Silva</hi> took several Prizes in the Sea of <hi>Calicut.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Vice-Roy sent <hi>F. Gonçalo Rodrigues,</hi> and <hi>Bro. Fulgentius Freyre,</hi> of the Society of <hi>Iesus,</hi> to persuade the Emperour of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> to redress the Abuses introduced among his People in Matters of Religion, and with them went <hi>Iames Diaz,</hi> well versed in the Affairs of that Empire. The Emperour could not be moved to admit our manner of Baptism, and abolish Circumcision; the Priest continued at his Court, but to no effect. In <hi>February</hi> set out <hi>Emanuel de Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concelos</hi>
                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:54711:375"/>
with three Galleons, and five small Vessels, to discover what <hi>Zafar</hi> was doing at <hi>Suez.</hi> He spent some time under Mount <hi>Felix,</hi> and returned without doing any thing. With him went the Famous <hi>Luis de Camoens,</hi> who finding no employment for his Sword, exercised his Pen.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Some great Subjects of <hi>Hidalcan</hi> at this time, Treated with the Vice-Roy about making <hi>Mealecan,</hi> who had lived long at <hi>Goa,</hi> King of <hi>Visapor;</hi> and assisting to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him in that Title. In Return, they offered to make over to the Crown of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> the Lands of <hi>Concan,</hi> worth a Million of yearly Revenue. A great Bait for our Avarice. The Profit was considered, but not the Difficulties, and <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> his Advice to <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> on the same occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was now forgot. We shall see in its place, how much more proper it had been to consider the Difficulties, than the Profit. The Offer was admitted, and <hi>Meale</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Proclaimed King of <hi>Visapor;</hi> and his Wife and Children left at <hi>Goa</hi> as Hostages for the performance of our Hopes. Three thousand Portugues Foot, and Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horse, marched with a Body of the Natives of the Island. After a small Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance they took the Fort of <hi>Ponda,</hi> and sent Advice to the Vice-Roy, who set out with the New King, and at <hi>Ponda</hi> delivered him to his People that there waited for him. He left <hi>D. Antony de Norona</hi> to Command the Fort with 600 Men.</p>

5. The Vice-Roy returned so sick to <hi>Goa,</hi> that he died in a few days; and it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved if he had continued in that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment some years, he had re-established Truth, Justice and Honesty in <hi>India.</hi> It is a mark of his Justice, That he gave no Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to any of his Servants; because he would not deprive them of it to whom it was due by Merit.

                        <p>The Government of <hi>Francis Barreto,</hi> from the Year 1555, till 1558, in the Reign of King <hi>JOHN</hi> the Third.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>FRancis Barreto</hi> succeeded <hi>D. Peter Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carenas</hi> with the Title of <hi>Governour.</hi> He was a Gentleman of Merit, and qualified for this Post, and had gained much Esteem, being Commander of <hi>Bazaim.</hi> His Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment began with a Fire kindled by a Squi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>, which burnt Ten the finest Vessels in <hi>India,</hi> notwithstanding he used the utmost dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and promised great Rewards to save them: Yet this Care saved the rest of the Fleet. He soon repaired this Damage, building others no less beautiful.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He went to <hi>Ponda,</hi> to carry on what his Predecessor had began, by Installing <hi>Mealeacan</hi> King, and appointed Officers to receive the Revenues about <hi>Ponda,</hi> leaving <hi>D. Ferdinand de Monroy</hi> in that Fort, and sending <hi>D. Antony de Noronha,</hi> who had it before, to receive the Revenues at <hi>Concam. Xacolim Aga,</hi> who was gathering the same for <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> with Seven thousand Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him. The Governour sent a supply of Ammunition to <hi>Noronha,</hi> which he no sooner received, but he marched to <hi>Cural<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>

of which he took possession, (the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of it being fled) and with Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness attracted the Natives to come and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit the Town and Country, leaving Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugues Officers to look to the Revenue. Then hearing that <hi>Xacolim</hi> continued ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Rents, he went to find him. By the way he met two Ships, in which was <hi>Xacolim</hi>'s Wife, Children, and Goods of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, which he fearful of some danger sent to <hi>Cambaya. Noronha</hi> easily made himself Master of all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Not far from <hi>Achara</hi> he halted, and designed to pass the Night. <hi>Xacolim</hi> sent a Thousand Men to surpize ours; but they were upon their Guard, and <hi>D. Iohn</hi> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risco</hi> falling upon them killed Seventy, and put the rest to flight; after the Pursuit he returned to <hi>D. Antony.</hi> They marched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to meet <hi>Xacolim,</hi> who was drawn up in good Order on the other side of a River. After a vigorous opposition our Men forded it, and there ensued a bloody Battle, in which <hi>D. Antony</hi> and <hi>Xacolim</hi> met, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving tryed each other parted. In this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were lost 24 Portugueses, above 1000 of the Enemy were slain, the rest fled. Our Men proceeding, gathered the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Mean while <hi>Meale</hi> was solemnly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King at <hi>Visapor.</hi> He enjoyed it not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54711:377"/>
purchasing Fifteen thousand Men of the King of <hi>Bisnagar,</hi> that were so successful, they killed the Chief of those had made <hi>Meale</hi> King, and took him Prisoner. <hi>Hidal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> immediately sent Forces to recover the Lands where <hi>D. Antony</hi> was employed. The Governour hearing of it sent him Orders to withdraw, as also to <hi>Ferdinand de Monroy,</hi> who was at <hi>Ponda.</hi> They unwillingly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, remembring how prudently <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> had before dissuaded this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This year sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> five Ships, one of them was Cast-away at the Island <hi>Tercera,</hi> and another at the Islands beyond <hi>Madagascar.</hi> The Captain of this last left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Four hundred of his Men on that Shoar, and in his Long-Boat got to <hi>Goa.</hi> These Four hundred who were left, built a small Vessel and arrived at <hi>Cochim.</hi> In the other Ships went the Bishop <hi>D. Belchior Carnero,</hi> a Jesuit, and some other Religious Men, sent by the Pope to the Emperour of <hi>Ethiopia. D. Alvaro de Silveyra</hi> was now made Admiral of a Fleet of 21 Sail, provided for the Sea of <hi>Calicut,</hi> and against the Queen of <hi>Olala,</hi> who refused to pay her Tribute. He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run all those Coasts with Fire and Sword, destroying many Towns and Ships, and all things that stood in the way; particularly the City <hi>Mangalor,</hi> and a sumptuous Pagod. <hi>Zamori</hi> sensible of his Losses, desired Peace, which was concluded. <hi>Silveyra</hi> returned Victorious.</p>

6. Let us return to <hi>Ceylon. Tribuli Pandar</hi> having made his Escape (as was related) out of Prison, fled to <hi>Balande. Madune</hi> subtilly exasperates him against the Portugueses, and sent him Six hundred Chingala's, with whom and his other Men he was so succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that he reduced the Towns of <hi>Paneture, Caleture, Maça, Berberi, Gale</hi> and <hi>Beligam,</hi> to the last Extremities, destroying our Churches, and killing many Christians, Converted by the Religious of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who first Preached there. Now comes <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso Pereyra de Laçerda</hi> to take upon him this Command: <hi>Madune,</hi> who before had assisted <hi>Pandar,</hi> now offers to aid <hi>Laçerda</hi> against him. He accepts the Offer. The King sent his Son <hi>Raju</hi> by the way of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leture</hi> with an Army. <hi>Laçerda</hi> sent <hi>Ruy Pereyra</hi> with Two hundred Men, and <hi>Antony de Spinola</hi> with One hundred two other ways to assault the City <hi>Palandu,</hi> where <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli</hi> was. They beset the Town at one time, and after a vigorous Resistance the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses entred it; the King fled, his Wife was taken, and many of his Men killed. The Portugueses returned Victorious, and <hi>Madune</hi> obtained one of the Ends he had proposed to himself, which were either, That the Portugueses should destroy <hi>Pandar,</hi> or he them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The beginning of this Year sailed <hi>Iohn Peixoto</hi> with two Galleys for the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1556.</note> to discover what was doing at <hi>Suez.</hi> He found all quiet, and being loath to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without doing something, he Landed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54711:378"/>
before Day in the Island <hi>Suanquem,</hi> with the King whereof we were at Variance. It being a dead time of Night, he found all asleep, and might say (as a Prince who killed a Man that was sleeping) that he left those Islanders as he found them; for many were killed before they awaked, others after. The same fate befell the King in his Palace. <hi>Peixoto</hi> returned to his Galliots, carrying Slaves and Booty without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the least damage. Next day, keeping along the Coast he destroyed several Towns, and returned to <hi>Goa,</hi> having purchased as much Honour with two small Vessels, as others with many. He brought away <hi>F. Gonçalo Rodriguez,</hi> whom he found at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quico,</hi> much dissatisfied that he had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with the Emperour of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> to admit of the Rites of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The King of <hi>Baçora,</hi> oppressed by the Turks, made now the same Offers to the Governour, he had done before to the Vice-Roy <hi>D. Alfonso de Noronha,</hi> in case he would assist him to throw off the Turkish Yoak. The Conditions were admitted, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this time did it succeed; for <hi>D. Alvaro de Silveyra</hi> going upon this Design with twenty Sail, met not with the success he had the year before against the <hi>Malabars.</hi> A terrible Storm so disabled him in that Port, that he was not in a condition to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing a second time. <hi>Michael Rodriguez Coutino</hi> prospered better, going to the Lands of <hi>Salsete</hi> and <hi>Bardes</hi> against some Parties of <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> who sought Revenge
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54711:378"/>
for our favouring <hi>Meale.</hi> All the Sea-Ports were destroyed with Fire and Sword, and many Ships perished. He killed and took many Prisoners, and returned with Honour and Riches to <hi>Goa.</hi> The chief of the Booty was a great Ship of <hi>Meca,</hi> taken at <hi>Dabul</hi> after a sharp engagement; for there were Two hundred Moors in her, who killed eight of our Men.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. This Misfortune the more enraged <hi>Hidalcan;</hi> and to mend it, he sends a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Army into those same Lands. The Governour set out with a strong Body to oppose him. The War lasted all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without any Action worthy relating. In <hi>September</hi> arrived four Ships from <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;</hi> in them went <hi>Ferdinand de Sousa</hi> and <hi>Castellobranco,</hi> Embassadour to the Emperour of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>F. Iohn Nunes Barreto,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of that stubborn People. His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion was the Bishop <hi>Andrew de Oviedo,</hi> who did nothing, because the Emperour could not be reduced to change his Old Rites. With these came to <hi>India F. Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çalo de Sileyra,</hi> to be Provincial; he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards received the Crown of Martyrdom in <hi>Monomotapa.</hi> All this shall be related in its proper place.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Governour set out to Visit our Forts in the North, with a Fleet consisting of One hundred and fifty Sail of all sorts. He gained the Mountain and Fort <hi>Azarim</hi> for a small purchase, by the means of <hi>Coje Mahomet,</hi> a Trusty Moor, living at <hi>Bazaim.</hi> This Mountain is not far from the City,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54711:379"/>
and rises very upright for the space of a League; a little below the Top it is girt with a sort of Border standing out, which renders it almost inaccessible, the rest being very difficult of ascent. It is kept by Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Men, who need no other Arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them but the Stones that lye there, which rolled down the Passes, must carry before them all that is in the way. The Garrison lives upon the Top, which is plain and almost round. They light themselves with sticks of Wood that grow there, and burns like a Torch, with that odds, that they cannot be quenched by Wind or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Antony Moniz Barreto</hi> was sent to take possession of this place; he left there a Captain and 60 Portugueses, and went on to take the Fort of <hi>Manora,</hi> not far distant, which the Inhabitants abandoned; he left there <hi>George Manhans</hi> with 120 Men, and returned to <hi>Bazaim,</hi> where he found the Governour receiving an Embassy from the King of <hi>Cinde,</hi> who desired Succour against a Tyrant that infested him. We were desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of this Prince's Friendship, and thought fit to purchase it by Relieving him. Seven hundred Men were sent to him in Twenty eight Vessels, all Commanded by <hi>Peter Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto Rolim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Fleet arrived safe at <hi>Tatá,</hi> the Court of the King of <hi>Cinde.</hi> The Prince, who was there, visited <hi>Barreto,</hi> and sent word of his Arrival to his Father, who was absent in the Field: He Answered, desiring
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54711:379"/>
our Commander to wait till he Advised what was fit to be done. <hi>Barreto</hi> stayed, and soon after hearing the King was agreed with his Enemy without giving him notice; he asked of the Prince leave to depart, and that he would pay the Charge of the Fleet, as was promised by the Embassadour. The Answer was so little to satisfaction, that <hi>Barreto</hi> landed his Men, entred the City, and in the Fury killed above Eight thousand Persons, and destroyed by Fire the value of above two Millions of Gold, after load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vessels with one of the richest Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that had been taken in <hi>Asia.</hi> He lost not one Man in this Action. He spent eight days, destroying all on both sides <hi>Indus.</hi> The Fort of <hi>Bandel</hi> made some Resistance, but being taken was demolished.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Gaspar de Monterroyo,</hi> a Souldier of Note, going accidentally into a Wood, met some Blacks, who bid him go no farther; for hard-by there was a Serpent had just then devoured a Bullock. He desiring to see such a Monster as they described, went on till he discovered the Head, which was of a wonderful bigness; and not satisfied, came so near as to touch it with the Point of his Sword, and the Monster lifted up its Head; and he gave it such a fortunate stroak on a soft place, that it soon after died. It was thirty Foot long, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable in bigness. <hi>Barreto</hi> returned thus Victorious over Men and Monsters to <hi>Chaul.</hi> There he found Orders to go to <hi>Dabul,</hi> where he would find <hi>Antony Pereyra Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>

Admiral of that Coast. They were to joyn in order to destroy that City in part of Revenge, for the damage <hi>Hidalcan</hi> did us. Being joyned they attacked the City, and though vigorously defended, it was taken, and wholly reduced to a heap of Rubbish. Then they did the same to all the Villages upon the shoar of that River.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Five Ships arrived now from <hi>Portugal,</hi> three of them were Cast-away in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home; one at <hi>Tierra del Natal,</hi> another at the Island St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the third at <hi>Madagascar.</hi> The arrival of these Ships, and some damage we had done <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> obliged him to conclude a Peace, which we sued for, yet was not dishonourable.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>D. Duarte Deça,</hi> Commander of <hi>Ternate,</hi> was not idle. He was harsh and covetous, so easily falling out with the King, he Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian-like Imprisoned him, his Mother and Brother <hi>Cachil Guzarate,</hi> using them very unworthily, and to compleat his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, ordered they should have nothing to eat. Publick Complaints obliged him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Hospital of <hi>Misericordia</hi> should main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them; and his desire of killing them made him so base as to poison their Water, which was discovered by a Stone the King had in a Ring. The <hi>Ternatenses</hi> took Arms, and called in the <hi>Tidores,</hi> so that the Fort was in great danger.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>D. Duarte</hi> having received Relief, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to fight at Sea with as good success, as if Justice had been on his side: But the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses themselves no longer able to endure his Obstinacy, put him into Custody, and discharged the Prisoners, which put an end to that Discord. No Man would take upon him the Command of the Fort, till <hi>Antony Pereyra Brandam</hi> was forced by the People to accept of it in Trust, till the Governour
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54711:381"/>
disposed of it. Whilst some Portugueses in the <hi>Maluco's,</hi> by their Actions, appeared most barbarous Heathens, some Infidels became Christians; a thing to be admired, having such ill Examples before them. The King of the Island <hi>Bacham</hi> was converted by <hi>F. Antony Vaz,</hi> a Jesuit.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The War continued at <hi>Goa.</hi> A Moor with Five hundred Men waded over the Ford of <hi>Zacorla,</hi> in the Island <hi>Choram,</hi> and surprizing those few Portugueses that were in it, gained some advantage, till others coming in from several Parts, drove them headlong into the Water, where many of them were drowned. The Governour hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, marched to their Relief, and sent before <hi>George Mendoça,</hi> Commander of the City, with some Gentlemen, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themselves well, and brought many Heads of Moors to the Governour. All was kept quiet afterwards by <hi>D. Francis Masca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renhas,</hi> who was left in the Island with 300 Men.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Governour desiring to secure the Promontory of <hi>Chaul,</hi> asked leave of the King <hi>Nizamuxa</hi> to fortifie it. He not only refused it, but secured the Messenger, and sent 30000 Men, who began to build an impregnable Fort there. The Governour sent <hi>Alvaro Perez de Sotomayor</hi> with some Ships, to keep the Mouth of the Port till he came, which was soon after. He brought 4000 Portugueses, besides Natives. The Enemy better advised, proposed a Peace, which was concluded to our content, on
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54711:381"/>
Condition the Work of the Fort should not advance. The Governour returned home. A Miracle was seen here, which was, That the Moors could never cut down, or remove with force of Elephants, a small Wooden-Cross, that was fixed upon a Stone.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Governour having setled Affairs at <hi>Goa,</hi> was wholly employed in fitting out a mighty Fleet against the King of <hi>Achem,</hi> who is the only Terrour of <hi>Malaca.</hi> In a few Months he provided 25 Galleons, 10 Gallies, and 80 Galliots, all so well furnished, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the hopes of fixing our Empire in <hi>India.</hi> But all this Industry falls to nothing; for now a new Governour comes, and the New ones never prosecute the designs of the Old. However this Force was well employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though not as our Governour designed.</p>

A Portugues Souldier on the Coast of the Island <hi>Ceylon,</hi> met a <hi>Iogue</hi> (that is, a sort of Penitent Heathen,) who among other things had picked up a brown Pebble, of the shape and bigness of an Egg, on which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the Heavens in several Colours, and in the midst of them the Image of our Blessed Lady with our Saviour in her Arms. The Souldier gave him some small thing for this Stone; and afterwards it came to the hands of <hi>Francis Barreto,</hi> who presented it to Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi> and by virtue of it God wrought several Miracles in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi>

In him ended the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as did that of <hi>India</hi> in the Vice-Roy sent thither, after his death, by those who managed the State during the Minority of King <hi>Sebastian. D. Constantin,</hi> Brother to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> was 30 years of Age when he accepted this Charge. What he wanted in Age for so great an Employ, was made up by being of the Blood Royal, and by his great Parts and natural Endowments.</p>

2. He sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> on the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> with four Ships and two Thousand Men, and arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> about the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> Three things remarkable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Voyage and at his Arrival; the first, that he had not the least bad Weather in his Passage; the second, the great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of Joy wherewith he was received; and the third, that he no way affronted the Governour that went off, as was always used in <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Our Vice-Roy commenced as usual, by sending Commanders to Forts. <hi>D. Payo de Noronha</hi> went to <hi>Cana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Vice-Roy sent four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Sail to their assistance, and gave the Command of them to <hi>Luis de Melo de Silva.</hi> The Vice-Roy was bent upon possessing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the Town of <hi>Damam,</hi> a place of consequence, to secure the Lands of <hi>Baçaim,</hi> and whereof <hi>Francis Barreto</hi> had obtained a Grant from the King of <hi>Cambaya.</hi> The difficulty lay in wresting it out of the hands of <hi>Cide Bofata,</hi> who was in Rebellion against his Prince, which was the chief Motive why he so freely gave what he could not get for himself. <hi>Bofata</hi> was well provided, and with a Resolution not to sell the place at an easie rate. The Vice-Roy having held a Council about it, the result was, he should go thither in person.</p>

4. He first dispatched the Trading Ships for <hi>Portugal,</hi> in which went his Predecessor; the Ships were seven, and only three of them came to <hi>Lisbon.</hi> One was lost at the Island St. <hi>Thomas:</hi> Two were forced back to <hi>Mozambique,</hi> in one of which was the late Governour <hi>Francis Barreto:</hi> The Captain of a fourth finding her sinking, got into a Long-Boat with 60 Men, and came to <hi>Goa,</hi> the rest of the Men all perished. <hi>Francis Barreto,</hi> at <hi>Mozambique,</hi> spent 20000 Ducats of his own in refitting the two Ships. They set out again, and being in distress, the other Ship ungratefully forsook him; yet he afterwards seeing her perishng saved all the Men, so that he had 1137 Persons aboard. In this condition, not able to go forward, he almost miraculously returned again to <hi>Mozambique.</hi> This year ended with the Foundation of that Fort, and return of <hi>Barreto</hi> to <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Luis de Melo,</hi> at <hi>Cananor,</hi> being assaulted in his Trenches by 3000 Moors, put them to shameful flight; and while he sent for Succours to the Vice-Roy, followed Fortune that now seemed to Favour him. Mean while the Vice-Roy set out with the Fleet, had been fitted out by <hi>Barreto,</hi> having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased it to 100 Sail.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Vice-Roy arriving at <hi>Damam,</hi> sent <hi>D. Iames de Noronha</hi> to take a view of the Works; he found them strong, and defended by 4000 Men. Notwithstanding all this Preparation, no sooner our Men landed but the Enemy fled, abandoning both City and Fort. The Vice-Roy entred, and giving
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54711:383"/>
Thanks to Almighty God for this Bloodless Victory, blessed the Mosque under the Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Purification of the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, on which day it was taken.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Enemy, after their flight, encamped at <hi>Parnel,</hi> two Leagues off, and thence with 2000 Horse infested the Vice-Roy. <hi>Antony Moniz Barreto</hi> offered with 500 Men to remove them. He marched all Night to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Enemy, and being come up with them, found that he had but 120 Men, the rest wandring in the dark through unknown ways; yet thus he attacks and puts them to flight, as believing the Vice Roy was there with his whole Force. The Morning disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering from how small a number they had fled, <hi>Bofata</hi> and his Men come down from a Hill, whither they had retired, and falling upon <hi>Barreto</hi> pressed him hard, till those that were scattered coming up, he again routed the Enemy, killing 500 of them. In their Camp were found 36 good Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, some Cart Loads of Copper-Mony, and other Plunder.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Vice-Roy with Liberality and good Usage attracted the Country People, who were fled for fear; and confirmed to the Neighbouring King of <hi>Sarçeta</hi> the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he had in <hi>Damam.</hi> For the more security he resolved to possess himself of the Island <hi>Balzar,</hi> not far distant. He intended to go thither in Person, but sent before <hi>D. Peter de Almeyda</hi> with 150 Horse, and as many Foot. The People of <hi>Balzar</hi> abandoned the Town, which <hi>D. Peter</hi> entred, and the Vice-Roy
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54711:384"/>
being come, left <hi>Alvaro Gonzales Pinto</hi> to Command there with 120 Men, and some Cannon. Being returned to <hi>Damam,</hi> he sent <hi>D. Alvaro de Silveyra</hi> with 20 Sail to the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> being informed <hi>Cafar</hi> was fitting out his Gallies. This Fleet was dispersed by Storms, and put into several Ports of <hi>India,</hi> without effecting any thing.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>D. Iames de Noronha</hi> was appointed Commander of <hi>Damam,</hi> and had 1200 Men given him under five Captains, who were to keep Tables for them. Tables are kept in <hi>India</hi> for such as have not any thing of their own; or if they have, yet will accept of this Liberality. I admire there are men that will stoop to receive this, but much more there are any that give it; for the same Men when they come to <hi>Spain,</hi> have not the Heart to give a stick of Wax, which there is worth nothing, and here a Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peny. The Vice-Roy after this success re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. In the City St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> or <hi>Meliapor,</hi> a Portugues, one of those who more religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously worship their Interest, than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens their Idols, and of those there are many in <hi>India;</hi> persuaded <hi>Rama Rajo,</hi> King of <hi>Bisnagar,</hi> to march against the City, telling him the Plunder would be worth two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and it would be a great Service to the Idols he worshipped, which were there thrown down by the Christians. He was a good Christian, that was so zealous for Idols. The King hearkning to the hopes of Gain, set out with 500000 Men. <hi>Peter
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54711:384"/>
de Ataide</hi> encouraged the Inhabitants to defend themselves; but they, to palliate their Fear said, <hi>It was but Reason the King should be admitted to waht was his own. Ataide</hi> went away to <hi>Goa;</hi> the Townsmen prepared for the reception of the King, and sent him a Present of 4000 Ducats, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was somewhat appeased. He En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped and would not enter the City; but ordered all the Inhabitants of both Sexes, and all Ages, and all their Goods, to be brought to his presence. Which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, he found the whole Value did not exceed 80000 Ducats. Enraged at the Wickedness of the Informer, he ordered him to be thrown to the Elephants, who tore him to pieces. He discharged the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and restored all their Goods so pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, that only a Silver Spoon being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing among them all, it was sought and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Luis de Melo de Silva,</hi> who sailed last year for the Coast of <hi>Malabar,</hi> did much harm there, and ruined the Trade of the Moors. At <hi>Mangalor</hi> he ordered two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to bring him a Vessel belonging to our Enemies of <hi>Cananor,</hi> that was in the River, but the Owners and some of the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men coming to defend it, our Men were worsted. <hi>Melo</hi> enraged hereat assaulted the Town, and put all Living Creatures to the Sword; then fired it. An old Moor lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Company of the Inhabitants that fled, with a Dagger in his hand met our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and struck him through the Arm.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54711:385"/>
He laying hold of his long Hair, delivered him to those that were near, saying, <hi>Take away that Devil.</hi> He had scarce said it, when the Moor was cut in pieces. <hi>Melo</hi> having burnt the City with loss of some few Men, returned to his Ships.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Thirteen Ships of <hi>Calicut</hi> and <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> were coming up to attack <hi>Melo;</hi> but he went out to meet them with only seven. He was formost in his Galliot, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>Calicut,</hi> a Turk, advanced before the rest to meet him. As soon as they came within Cannon-shot, our Gunner made one so fortunate, it swept him from Stem to Stern, and in a Minute the Keel of the Ship appeared above Water, all the Men perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Three other Ships board the Galliot, and kill many of the Men; but <hi>Melo</hi> step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping forward, not only cleared his own Deck, but pursued into the Ships, in which not one Man was left alive. Our other Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels took the other three Ships of <hi>Calicut,</hi> so that not one of them escaped; and the Admiral of <hi>Cananor</hi> fled with his seven, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only stood by as a Witness of what the others did. The Enemy lost above 400 Men. For a long time after the People along that Coast would not eat Fish, because a man's Fingers were found in the Belly of one.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Luis de Melo</hi> went thus Victorious to <hi>Goa,</hi> and the Vice-Roy confined him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had done those Actions when his Presence was required at <hi>Cananor.</hi> His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement was censured, and the Vice-Roy
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54711:385"/>
being none of those that will obstinately persist in their Opinion, though it do never so much mischief; he went in person to be Friends with <hi>Melo</hi> at <hi>Pangim,</hi> where he was in Custody. <hi>Melo</hi> knowing well how to esteem such Favours from Superiours, was abundantly satisfied, and returned with his Fleet, by the Vice-Roy's Order, to <hi>Cananor,</hi> because <hi>D. Payo de Noronha,</hi> was in some distress there. <hi>Emanuel de Vasconcelos</hi> went to <hi>Ternate</hi> with three Ships, and other small Vessels.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Luis de Melo</hi> was the Life of <hi>Noronha:</hi> who was in great danger at <hi>Cananor,</hi> being threatned with a Siege by all the Princes of <hi>Malabar</hi> stirred up by <hi>Ade Rajao,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some provocation given by <hi>Noronha. Rajao</hi> with 100000 Men attacks the Fort, and enters the Trenches. <hi>Melo,</hi> who was in them with 60 Men, flew about like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Antony de Villena,</hi> with Fifty, did Wonders among the Moors, who had entred his House. In fine, the whole number, which was 500 Men, did more than human Actions among that multitude of Enemies. It is said, <hi>A Religious Man at his Prayers saw the Holy Ghost in the form of a Pigeon on a Beam of the Church, and shewed it to many others.</hi> Our Men hearing of it fell on with new Vigour, and so effectually that they put the Enemy to flight, having killed 15000 of them. Of the Portugueses 25 were lost. The fight lasted 12 Hours. <hi>Luis de Melo</hi> played the part of a Souldier as well as Commander. <hi>Francis Risca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="1">1. AT this time the Emperour of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> was much molested by the Turks and Moors, and obtained some Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories over them, having some Portugueses in his Service. Our Bishop could not work upon him to leave his Heretical Customs, and therefore resolved to leave him; but stayed at the Request of the Portugueses.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54711:386"/>
The Emperour being Invaded by the King of <hi>Mallassays,</hi> contrary to the Advice of the Portugueses, marched to meet him, and they followed. He was slain by <hi>Malassays;</hi> and they seeing his Subjects fly, cast themselves among the Enemies, and after doing more than is credible, were most of them killed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Turk desiring to possess himself of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Ports on the side next <hi>Persia,</hi> sent this Year an Officer with two Gallies and seventy Barques, with 1200 Turks and Janizaries, against the Fort of <hi>Baharem. Rax Morado,</hi> a resolute Commander, was in it, who provided the best he could, and sent Advice of the danger he was in to the King of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and <hi>D. Antony de Noronha,</hi> then Commanding that Fort. <hi>D.

                        </gap>diers, that Mutinying they obliged them to give Battle. <hi>Rax</hi> joyned the Portugueses with 300 Persians, well Armed, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the Turks, who purposely (though with loss) gave way, till they drew them to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54711:387"/>
an Ambush, which put them into disorder in spight of all <hi>D. Alvaro</hi> could do, till he fell by a Musquet-Ball that hit him in the Throat. The Portugueses fought desperately, some to defend, and others to bring him off, but to no purpose, for the Turks cut off his Head. Above 70 of our Men were killed, and several taken. <hi>Rax Morado</hi> retired with many to the Fort, after behaving himself in such manner as might be envied by the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses. Thus was the rashness of those that were so hot for fighting punished.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Peter Peixoto</hi> succeeded in the Command of our Men, and following the Advice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore despised, besieged the Island, and so streightned the Turks they sued for Mercy; whereby it appeared how great a Fault it was not to take this course at first. <hi>D. Antony de Noronha</hi> receiving Advice at <hi>Ormuz</hi> of our loss, presently set out to revenge it. The Siege continued, and in conclusion the Turks surrendred on Condition to return our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners (they were about Thirty,) and deliver up their Cannon, Arms and Horses, and 10000 Ducats. They were to be carried to <hi>Baçora,</hi> but were so weak with Hunger and the Pestilential Fever, which about that time rages at <hi>Baharem,</hi> that only two hundred of them lived. Many of our Men died of the same Disease.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. About the end of this Year arrived in <hi>India</hi> five Ships from <hi>Portugal;</hi> six sailed thence, but one was drove back. In them went <hi>F. George</hi> of St. <hi>Lucy,</hi> and <hi>F. George Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudo,</hi> the first was Bishop of <hi>Malaca,</hi> the

                     <p n="5">5. The Vice Roy understanding the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was fitting out Ships on the Coast of <hi>Malabar,</hi> where <hi>Luis de Melo</hi> was, sent to his Aid 17 Sail with 600 Men. <hi>Melo</hi> distributed them about the Mouths of the Rivers, and he himself ran along destroying the Towns and Woods. Seven strong Parao's, well manned and equipped, came down the River <hi>Maim,</hi> where <hi>Gonçalo Perez de Alvelos</hi> was, firing their Cannon upon him, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering sunk one of them: But the Powder taking fire in one of our Ships, blew it up and all the Men in it; so the Enemy esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. <hi>Melo</hi> continued the War this Year and the next with success, and utter desolation of all that Coast.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Bofata,</hi> not long since defeated, now marched towards our Fort of <hi>Balzar</hi> with 600 Horse, and a great Body of Foot. Our Commander <hi>Alvaro Gonçalez Pinto</hi> boldly meets him with 20 Horse, 100 Portugues Foot, and 500 Natives. The first Charge they killed 50 of the Enemy; but being overpowered by the Multitude were routed, the Captain and most of the Portugueses killed, and 150 of the Natives, the rest fled. <hi>Bofata</hi> immediately attacks the Fort, not at all doubting to carry it; but was vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously opposed by the Valour of <hi>Gomez de
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54711:388"/>

Not long after he returns, and our Commander <hi>Alfonso Diaz Pereyra</hi> meeting him in the Field, had the same success as <hi>Pinto,</hi> and was killed as well as he; all the difference was, that the Enemy now entred the Fort pell-mell with our Men; but <hi>Vincent Carvallo</hi> drove them again out headlong. <hi>Calisto de Sequeyra</hi> killed 20 with his own hand. They were quite spent with continual Fatigue when <hi>Luis Alvarez de Tavora</hi> brought Relief from <hi>Damam,</hi> at sight whereof the Enemy retired.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. However, by the Vice-Roy's Order, the Fort was abandoned, and the Enemy returning razed it; then went on doing great harm in the Villages, till they came to <hi>Tarapor,</hi> where <hi>Martin Lopez de Faria</hi> was with 40 Men; they attacked his Works and were repulsed with such loss, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted and went on. This Action cost <hi>Lopez</hi> his Life, being mortally wounded, whereof he died at <hi>Damam. D.

10. <hi>Bisminaique,</hi> Lord of the Pearl-Fishery, seeing those of <hi>Punicale</hi> would pay no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er acknowledgment than One days Fishing, resolved to right himself by force. He marched with 1000 Men, <hi>Melrao</hi> lead the the Van, doing much harm. <hi>D. Duarte de Meneses</hi> after several Skirmishes killed him, and stopped the current of his Men, till the useless People, as Aged Men, Women and Children, with the best of their Goods, got off in a Ship, where they suffered much Hunger, and such Thirst that they drank their own Water. The Commander of the Fort, <hi>Emanuel Rodrigues Coutinho,</hi> Charged a Body of those that <hi>Melrao</hi> had Commanded, and did good Execution; but <hi>Bisminaique</hi> coming up with his Army, <hi>D.

14. The Vice Roy came on, and six or seven Men were killed about him. The Prince coming down another Street made some resistance, but to no effect. Night coming on the King retired to his Palace, and not thinking himself safe there, set fire to it and withdrew to a Fort a League off. Thus the Vice-Roy was left possessed of that beautiful City. He marched after the King, who thinking that Fort too weak, was fled farther off. <hi>D. Constantin</hi> took possession of it, and sent several parties to pursue the King, the first of them Commanded by <hi>Luis de Melo,</hi> the <hi>Achilles</hi> of those times. They pursued him till he cried for Mercy; and to purchase an Accommodation, offered to restore the Treasure taken from <hi>Tribuls Pandar,</hi> and his Mother-in-Law, Wife to the King of <hi>Cota,</hi> to pay an Acknowledgment to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and give up the Island <hi>Manar.</hi> The Vice-Roy accepted the Conditions, considering how difficult it was wholly to deprive him of that Crown, and restore it to his Brother, though he had never so much right.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Fortune is as quick in over-turning, as bestowing her Favours. Whilst the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were putting in execution, the Natives falling upon the Portugueses, who were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in their Submission, killed many. The Vice-Roy escaped narrowly and got aboard the Fleet, whence he sent <hi>D. Antony de No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronha</hi> with 400 Men to relieve the Fort, where <hi>Ferdinand de Sousa</hi> was, and had killed many of the Natives in defence of it.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54711:390"/>
They two being joyned made themselves way and marched to the Shoar, carrying all that was in the Fort, and killing all that opposed them. The Vice-Roy thus succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at first, and afterwards unfortunate, set Sail, carrying with him the Prince, given as an Hostage for performance of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Peace. He sailed to the Island <hi>Manar,</hi> where he built a Fort, and translated thither the Inhabitants of <hi>Punicale,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them from the Tyranny of that Nayque who would fleece them. <hi>Emanuel Rodriguez Coutinho</hi> was left to Command there, and with him some Franciscans and Jesuits, all satisfied with the equal distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Vice-Roy made of all things. Then he sent <hi>Balthasar Guedez de Sousa</hi> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in chief in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and with him the King of <hi>Cota,</hi> his Grandmother and Kindred, whom the King of <hi>Iafanatapan</hi> had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him, being one of the Conditions of that unfortunate Treaty.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. AMong the Treasure lately taken from the King of <hi>Iafanatapan,</hi> was an Idol adored throughout all the Coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> and so highly esteemed by all those Princes, particularly the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi>
                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:54711:391"/>
that he every year sent Embassadours with rich Presents, to get a Print of it. This so much worshipped Relick was nothing but a Tooth of a white Monkey. Some say, the rarity of the Colour was the cause of his being so much admired, as the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s white Elephant: Others affirm, besides his Whiteness, he came into such esteem by finding out the Wife of an ancient Indian King, that was run away from him, and had been sought for through all parts to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the King loving her beyond expression. The King in requital made much of the Beast while it lived, and after its death erected Altars to it: Others are of Opinion, it was a Mans, not a Monkeys Tooth, and perhaps the Man had the same Employ as the Monkey; for all was no better than Pimping, a great step to Preferment with Princes. However it was, the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> hearing our Vice-Roy had the Tooth, sent to offer him 300000 Ducats for it, and it was not doubted his Zeal would extend to give a Million, if the Bargain were well drove. Most of the Portugueses were for taking the Mony, and some wished they might be employed in carrying the Tooth to <hi>Pegu,</hi> not doubting but they should gather a Treasure by shewing it by the way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Vice-Roy doubtful whether he should accept, or reject the Offer, and to throw the blame of either Resolution from himself, had a meeting of the Chief of the Clergy and Laity, where the Question was discussed long, and with much
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54711:391"/>
heat. The Resolution was, That the Tooth should not be sold, but consumed to As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>s. The Vice-Roy accordingly, in the presence of them all, caused it to be beaten to dust in a Mortar, and then burnt. All men at that time seemed to applaud the Act; but not long after, (two Teeth being set up instead of that one, as shall be related in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>D. Antony de Noronha)</hi> they as much condemned and railed at it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>D. George de Meneses Baroche</hi> at this time did much in <hi>Ceylon</hi> in defence of the King of <hi>Cota</hi> against his Brother <hi>Madune. D.

without losing one Man. The Enemy forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himself in a convenient place, and <hi>D.

Cedemecan</hi> gave credit to the Fiction, and going to Visit his Brother-in-Law in the Camp, persuaded him to Sup with him in the Town, and carry with him the principal Heads of his Army. Scarce were they in his House when he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them all, and falling upon the Camp put the Army to the rout with great slaughter Thus <hi>Noronha</hi> avoided this Danger without drawing Sword, and <hi>Cedemecan</hi> drew on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

another, to shun that which did not threaten him. The Manager of this Intrigue was, <hi>D. Iames Pereyra,</hi> a Gentleman of great Prudence and Vigilance, who performed it very dexterously, not without great danger to himself.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Chinguiscan</hi> with a prodigious Power marches to <hi>Suratt,</hi> to revenge the Death of his Father, and enters the City; <hi>Cemedecan</hi> retiring into the Fort, <hi>Chinguiscan</hi> sets down before, and begins to batter it furiously, and <hi>Cedemecan</hi> omitted nothing towards his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, when 10 Ships arrive, sent by <hi>D. Iames</hi> under the Command of <hi>Luis Alvarez de Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vora,</hi> with Orders so to manage himself, that either of the two Enemies might believe he came to their assistance. <hi>D.

Then he had a meeting with the King of <hi>Pimienta,</hi> with whom he was at variance, and they agreed. The Princes of <hi>Calicut</hi> being sent to be bred at <hi>Cananor,</hi> and those of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanor</hi> at <hi>Calicut,</hi> caused such a Confusion, that <hi>Iohn Pereyra,</hi> Commander of <hi>Cananor,</hi> was in some danger, attempting to hinder the Passage of the <hi>Malabars,</hi> who had possessed themselves of the Island <hi>Primbalam,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Cochim,</hi> which might prove the loss of our Fort. The Vice-Roy sent first <hi>D. Francis de Almeyda</hi> with ten Ships, and after him <hi>Luis de Melo de Silva</hi> with 500 Men, and the King of <hi>Cochim</hi> assisted with his Forces. There was a great Fight, many of the Enemies were killed, and the rest expelled the Island. <hi>Martin Alfonso de Melo</hi> afterwards cleared all the Passes, and restored the Island to the King. <hi>D. Constantin</hi> returned to <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. He sent Commanders to several Forts; and a Fleet of 21 Sail under the Command of <hi>Sebastian de Sá,</hi> to assist the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çora</hi> against the Turks, for which he offered to permit us to build a Fort there. This Fleet was by bad Weather scattered and put into several Ports. <hi>Cedemecan</hi> sent to acquaint the Vice-Roy, That <hi>Chinguiscan</hi> was again marching towards him, and he being in no condition to oppose him, would deliver up that Fort to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> only upon Condition to be carried with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Treasure where he should appoint.

                        <hi>Don Constantin</hi> immediately fitted out four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Ships, the Command whereof he gave to <hi>D.

Iames de Noronha.</hi> There they found four Galliots of <hi>Sebastian de Sá</hi> his Squadron that was dispersed, and so made up 500 Men, and passed to <hi>Suratt.</hi> They went up the River through such showers of Bullets, that there was scarce a Vessel but lost some Men. Then they Landed, and immediately entred a Work, and after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Engagement <hi>Chinguiscan</hi> with above 20000 Men, was beaten by 500 Portugueses, and our Captain remained Master of the Field.</p>

Some say, he durst not do it for fear his own Men should kill him; and 'tis likely it was so, for <hi>D. Antony</hi> being gone to <hi>Goa,</hi> they would have murdered him only for the Intention; so that he was forced to make his escape from them, and being taken by <hi>Chinguiscan</hi> had his Head cut off. <hi>Caracen</hi> his Brother-in-Law succeeded him in <hi>Suratt,</hi> and found the means of obliging <hi>Chinguiscan,</hi> so that he left him in peaceable possession.</p>

Accordingly King <hi>Sebastian</hi> was Proclaimed in all the Neighbourhood, he that Resigned still keeping the Title and Government. <hi>Vasconcelos</hi> having made War against the King of <hi>Tidore,</hi> soon after died. <hi>Sebastian Machado</hi> his Lieutenant succeeded him, and sent <hi>George Ferreyra</hi> against the <hi>Sangaje</hi> of <hi>Gilolo,</hi> who brought him to Submission.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Government of the Vice-Roy <hi>D. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Coutinho,</hi> Count <hi>de Redondo,</hi> from the Year 1561, till 1564, in the Reign of King <hi>SEBASTIAN.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. IN the beginning of <hi>September</hi> arrived at <hi>Goa D. Francis Coutinho,</hi> Count <hi>de</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1561.</note> 
                        <hi>Redondo,</hi> no less known for his witty Sayings, than his Actions in Peace and War. He brought five Ships, and sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> the beginning of the Year. The Count having sent Commanders to several Forts, dispatched five Ships for <hi>Portugal,</hi> in one of which went D. <hi>Constantin.</hi> Next he sent D. <hi>Francis Mascarenhas</hi> with 650 Men in 23 Ships, to seek out <hi>Cafar</hi>'s Gallies that were abroad a pilfering; but he missing of them through neglect, returned to the Coast of <hi>Malabar,</hi> where he secured the Trading Ships for the term of three Months, and then went into Port.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In <hi>February</hi> the Vice-Roy sent <hi>George de Moura</hi> with three Galleons, and some small Vessels, to secure our Ships that were to come from <hi>Ormuz</hi> against <hi>Cafar</hi>'s Gallies. On the Coast of <hi>Caxem</hi> he met a Ship of <hi>Achem</hi> of great strength and value, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried 500 fighting Men and 50 Pieces of Brass Cannon. Towards Night <hi>Peter Lopez de Rebelo</hi> stood up with and boarded her, whereupon ensued a bloody Fight. The
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54711:395"/>
Enemy fired the Galleon, and <hi>Antony Cabral</hi> coming up in the Night with another, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was the Ship, attacks the Galleon. Perceiving his Mistake he drew off, and the Ship taking fire both were inevitably lost. <hi>Cabral</hi> saved <hi>Rebelo</hi> and his Men. Of the Enemy only a few escaped in the Long-Boat. <hi>Moura</hi> was coming on with the rest of the Ships, when discovering a Sail he gave it chase, but in vain. He cruized there some time and saw several Ships, but could not fetch up any.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In <hi>September</hi> arrived in <hi>India</hi> 6 Ships from <hi>Portugal,</hi> with 3000 Land-men. The Vice-Roy was preparing to set out for the Sea of <hi>Calicut,</hi> whilst <hi>Cide Meriam</hi> was marching to besiege <hi>Damam</hi> with 800 Horse and 1000 Foot, after doing much harm in the Neighbouring Villages. Our Men went out to meet them, a <hi>Dominican</hi> carrying a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix before them; at the first Charge several of our Men fell, and among them the <hi>Dominican;</hi> a Souldier took up the Crucifix and marched before till a Ball broke the Arm of it, which much stirred up our Men to revenge. In the heat of the Action <hi>Cide</hi> appears, calling upon <hi>Garcia Rodriguez,</hi> who spurring his Horse met, and with a stroak of his Lance dismounted him; but <hi>Garcia</hi> fell too, and <hi>Meriam</hi> recovering came at him with his Cimiter; <hi>Garcia</hi> embraces him fast, and so they strugled till one of our Souldiers run <hi>Meriam</hi> through with a Pike. Our Captain mounted again, and running into the thickest of the Enemy, they were
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54711:395"/>
disordered and fled; many were killed, many taken, and a considerable Booty.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. About the beginning of <hi>December</hi> the Vice-Roy set out of <hi>Goa</hi> with 140 Sail, in which number were ten very large Gallies; in this Fleet were 4000 Men. All this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was only to meet <hi>Zamori,</hi> and Swear to the Peace already concluded. They met at <hi>Tiracole,</hi> the Vice Roy walking through a Lane made by his 4000 Men, and the King through another of 40000. After the usual Ceremonies the Articles were read, and then sworn to by each after his own manner.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Count returning to <hi>Cochim,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the Ships for <hi>Portugal,</hi> which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived safe, except one that was never heard of. The Portugueses of this great Fleet having no other employments for their Swords, fell to Challenging one another, by which means above 50 were killed. The grounds of these Quarrels are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly so idle and ridiculous, that it is not worth time to mention any of them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Vice Roy began this Year, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some Commanders to several Parts: <note place="margin">1563.</note> But there was nothing of moment, but the Business of <hi>Amboina,</hi> one of the Maluco's, whither he sent <hi>Henry de Sá</hi> with some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. <hi>Amboina</hi> is an Island in that Eastern Sea, about 16 Leagues in compass; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in that little Space many good Towns. <hi>Iordan de Freytas,</hi> Commander of <hi>Ternate,</hi> got a Grant of it for himself (as is before said) from the King of it, who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54711:396"/>
by his means repayed him with that Gift, which afterwards fell to the Crown of <hi>Portugal. Sá</hi> sent his Nephew <hi>Vasco</hi> thither to build a Fort; but he behaved himself so ill, that he estranged the Hearts of all the People, chiefly the Inhabitants of <hi>Ative,</hi> where he was; and those of <hi>Aito,</hi> not far distant. The better to compass their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, they offered Subjection to the Queen of <hi>Iapara,</hi> in the Island <hi>Iava,</hi> that she might assist them with her Shipping. The other Islands also sent a Fleet, and joyning with those that were in Arms, killed many of the Christians newly converted by St. <hi>Francis Xaverius.</hi> One of these called <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> gathering a Number, put a stop to this Current, till <hi>Henry de Sá</hi> joyning they totally defeated all those Enemies, with a great slaughter of them. Then <hi>Sá</hi> took in hand the punishing the Rebels, among which were two Infamous Portugueses, who had laid the muzzles of their Musquets to <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> because he defended the New Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; that it may appear, there are many New Christians better than the Old. Peace being setled, the Spiritual Conquest was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In <hi>Ceylon Madune,</hi> always aiming to deprive his Brother, the King of <hi>Cota,</hi> of his Kingdom, kept his Son <hi>Raju</hi> in the Field with a good Force. <hi>Raju</hi> with 30000 Men besieges the Fort of <hi>Columbo,</hi> Commanded by <hi>Baltasar Guedez de Sousa.</hi> He battered it several days with great Fury, but found such opposition he was forced to draw off, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54711:396"/>
marched to the City <hi>Cota,</hi> two Leagues distant, not doubting to carry it, having been reinforced and believing the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses were not in condition to Relieve it. Yet <hi>Baltasar Guedez</hi> was there as soon as he with 400 Men. The City was besieged, and the Attacks carried on vigorously, and backed with Elephants. Many Portugueses were here seen fight with those Beasts single, and with many Wounds drive them back upon their own Men.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Though bravely defended, the Town was in great danger by reason of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies great number, had not <hi>Iames de Melo Coutinho,</hi> Commander of <hi>Manar,</hi> come op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely with 400 Men and Provisions. <hi>Raju</hi> seeing this Relief raised the Siege, having lost 2000 Men. On our side twenty were killed, and three <hi>Franciscans.</hi> The King repaired his Works, and <hi>Coutinho</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Command, leaving the Men he brought.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. This Year sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> four Ships, one of them was forced back, three arrived at <hi>Goa,</hi> one whereof sunk there. The Vice-Roy sent <hi>D. Francis de Mascarenhas</hi> to <hi>Cananor</hi> with fifteen Sail, we being then at War with that King. <hi>Hierom Diaz de Meneses</hi> staid behind with his Ship, in which were forty tried Souldiers. He met three Parao's of <hi>Malabars,</hi> and could not with Honour avoid them; so making up to the formost layed it aboard, and killing most of the Moors, had taken it, but that the other two coming up forced our Men to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54711:397"/>
defend their own Ship, and though they behaved themselves with great bravery, were by the multitude of Enemies drove into the Poop, whence breaking out again they cleared their Decks, killing 60 Moors. They parted, and <hi>Diaz</hi> pursued his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Vice-Roy dispatched two Ships for <hi>Portugal,</hi> which after a dangerous Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age arrived safe. Hearing what had hapned, <hi>Hierom Diaz</hi> with the Malabars, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their Piracies contrary to the Peace so lately sworn, he complained to <hi>Zamori.</hi> He Answered coldly, because his Intentions were never sincere, <hi>That those were some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and whosoever met them might punish them.</hi> The Count meditating Revenge, heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 80 Vessels of Malabars were sailing for <hi>Calicut;</hi> these he resolved to destroy, and if <hi>Zamori</hi> complained, to Answer after this manner, <hi>That they were some Rebels had done it, whoever took might punish them.</hi> To this he sent <hi>Dominick de Mesquita,</hi> a Man of Valour and no nice Conscience, as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for such an Action, with 120 Men in three Ships. He cruised upon the Coast of <hi>Carapatan,</hi> and took by two and three at a time twenty four Sail. The Vessels he sunk, some of the Men he beheaded, others he sewed up in their Sails and threw them into the Sea. Above 2000 died after this manner, so that all the Coast of <hi>Malabar</hi> was filled with Cries for the loss of Friends and Goods. This Action soon after produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a very tedious War.</p>
                     <p n="11">

11. This was the Vice-Roys last Action, and scarce came to his knowledge; for he died very suddenly about the end of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.</hi> His Death was lamented, because he was beloved. He was neither Prodigal, nor Covetous, a great lover of Justice, and so happy in witty Expressions, that all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Sayings were Fathered upon him. His Countenance was jovial, his Eyes lively. In the number of Vice-Roys he was the <hi>8th,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="12">12. At this time our Famous Poet, <hi>Luis de Camoens,</hi> was at <hi>Goa,</hi> and had been well looked upon and favoured by the two last Vice-Roys. The Governour <hi>Francis Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto</hi> had Imprisoned, and then banished him for Debts and some youthful Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and the Count towards the End of his Government, had again given him up to the Law, and he was cast in Prison. We shall hereafter see him deceitfully carried to <hi>Zofala,</hi> and there sold. Such is the hard Fate of great Wits.</p>

                        <p>The Government of <hi>John de Mendoza,</hi> for six Months of the Year 1564, in the Reign of King <hi>SEBASTIAN.</hi>

                        </gap> with the Title of Governour. As soon as he had taken the Sword, there came to him Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours from <hi>Zamori,</hi> complaining of the Harm <hi>Dominick de Mesquita</hi> had done the beginning of the year to his Subjects, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Peace so solemnly sworn. The Governour answered as the Count designed to have done; <hi>That it was perhaps some Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugues who was in Rebellion; that they might punish him if taken, and he would do the same.</hi> The Embassadours had nothing to say; but before their departure came in <hi>Dominick de Mesquita,</hi> and the Governour (not to carry on the Shew too far) caused him in their presence to be apprehended. As soon as their backs were turned he released, and rewarded him as his good Service de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Woman of a bold Spirit, and of good Repute among her People, Wife to one of those killed by <hi>Mesquita,</hi> running about the City of <hi>Cananor</hi> with loud Cries and Complaints, stirred up the Moors to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54711:398"/>
revenge that Action. They all run to Arms, swearing not to lay them down, till they had rooted out the Portugueses from among them. They beset the Fort where <hi>D. Payo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>

                        </gap>ode under the shelter of it. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour sent immediately <hi>Andrew de Sousa</hi> with six Sail to the relief of that Fort, where <hi>Adé Rajao</hi> already was with a great Power. Thus began the War of <hi>Malabar,</hi> and went on slowly.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It being now the beginning of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> the Ships arrived from <hi>Portugal,</hi> in which went the Vice-Roy <hi>D. Antony de No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronha,</hi> to whom the Governour delivered the Sword, and went out of <hi>India</hi> poor, after bearing honourable and advantagious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. He was the <hi>22th</hi> Governour, and held it half a year, was the second of the Name, and first of the Sirname.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Since the short time of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment afforded not Matter enough for a Chapter, I will give some Account of the <hi>Zamories</hi> and Preaching of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle. It is before related how <hi>Perimal,</hi> who divided the Empire of <hi>Malabar</hi> into several Kingdoms, was persuaded to Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metanism, and went to end his days at <hi>Meca.</hi> This was a false Invention of the Moors; for there were several Sovereign Princes in <hi>Malabar</hi> 500 years before the Birth of Christ. <hi>Malabar</hi> lies between the Points of <hi>Cananor</hi> and Cape <hi>Comori,</hi> 150 Leagues in length, and about 15 in breadth up the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54711:399"/>
expiring at the Foot of a Mountain that runs through all that length. The chief Sovereignties therein are <hi>Cananor, Tanor, Moringue, Cranganor, Parum, Mungate, Repelim, Cochim, Diamper, Pimienta, Turun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gule, Maturte, Porca, Marta, Pitimene, Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coulam, Coulam, Changernate, Gundra</hi> and <hi>Travancor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The differences that often arose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these Sovereigns, obliged them to chuse an Arbitrator, who was to be but of indifferent Fortune, to prevent his growing too powerful; and the Office was not to be hereditary, but he always chose by consent of those Princes. This Arbitrator they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Xara Perimal,</hi> and appointed his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be in the City <hi>Calicut;</hi> so ancient is this Employment. The great concourse of Merchants from all parts to that City, caused it in time to rise to an Empire, though such care had been taken to prevent it. This Dignity of Emperour (which is signified by the word <hi>Zamori)</hi> continued till the Year of Grace 347, according to the Records of <hi>Calicut;</hi> but according to those of <hi>Cochim,</hi> till 588. Whensoever it was, <hi>Xara Perimal</hi> then Reigned, who tired with the Cares of a Crown, and having some knowledge of the Evangelical Doctrin, as being a great Favourer of the Christians of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> inhabiting at <hi>Cranganor,</hi> he resolved to end his days at <hi>Meliapor,</hi> serving in that Church. By Consent of all his Princes he resigned the Crown to <hi>Manuchem Herari</hi> his Page, esteemed worthy and able
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54711:399"/>
to Govern that Empire. <hi>Perimal</hi> died at <hi>Meliapor,</hi> and it is thought one of those Bodies found with the Apostles was his. Since his time till now have been above 110 <hi>Zamories,</hi> of whose Names we do not make a Catalogue, because they are all called <hi>Manuchem</hi> and <hi>Zamori,</hi> in memory of that first Successor of <hi>Perimal.</hi> Another Relation says; This <hi>Perimal</hi> was one of the three Kings that went to adore our Saviour, new Born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and perhaps that might be the Reason of his following the Apostle St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> In an ancient Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of two hundred years standing, I have found what follows: <hi>Melchior</hi> was King of <hi>Nubia</hi> and <hi>Arabia; Baltasar,</hi> of <hi>Goli</hi> and <hi>Saba; Gaspar,</hi> of <hi>Tharsis, Insula,</hi> and <hi>Grisola,</hi> where the Body of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> lies, and they were afterwards by him made Bishops, and suffered Martyrdom with him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In this Empire (so in all the Kingdoms of it) the Sons do not Inherit, but the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews born of Sisters, by reason of the ill conceit they have of the Mothers, believing this way they secure the Royal Descent. The Princesses that bring forth these Heirs, get them in this manner: The Princess is Married to a Neighbouring Prince, who leaves her untouched; a Nayre of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Naburii,</hi> destined for this Employ, gets her Maidenhead, and then departs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more to be seen in the Country upon pain of Death. The Princess afterwards chooses others among the <hi>Naburiis,</hi> of whom she makes use till she has Conceived.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54711:400"/>
She has liberty to choose among them all, but none of them can court her upon pain of Death. The Nayres are very poor, few of them can maintain a Wife; and he that can, need not fear another corrupting of her. For this Reason three or four of them joyn to maintain a Woman, and that is their manner of Marriage: When one goes to the Wife, he leaves his Buckler at the Door, which is a sign one is within; and if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comes, he must stay. The Kingdom of <hi>Cochin</hi> was subject to this Empire, though without paying Tribute, and made free by the Portugueses in requital, for the fidelity of the King <hi>Uniramacoul,</hi> who Reigned when we first discovered <hi>India,</hi> and exposed himself to utter danger of being ruined, rather than deliver up the Portugueses to <hi>Zamori.</hi> King <hi>Emanuel</hi> sent him a Crown of Gold by the Vice-Roy <hi>D. Francis de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meyda,</hi> which he received, submitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as a Subject to <hi>Portugal,</hi> without any other acknowledgment; but is yearly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with two pieces of Gold; the one a Portugues, being a Coin worth 18 Ducats, on the <hi>1st</hi> of <hi>Ianuary;</hi> the other on the day of the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> is a Cup worth 640, Thus much of the Empire of <hi>Malabar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. As to <hi>Meliapor,</hi> for what relates to the Apostle: It is the received Opinion he was killed at <hi>Antenodur,</hi> a Mountain a League distant from the Town, where he had two Caves, whither he retired to Pray. The nearest now belongs to the Jesuits, the other is the Church of our Lady of the Mount.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54711:400"/>
He being one day at Prayer in the former, opposite to a Clift that gave Light to it, one of the Bramens, who was watching, thrust a Lance through that Hole in such manner, that a piece of it remaining in his Body, he went to the other Cave, and there died, embracing a Stone on which a Cross was carved. Hence his Disciples removed and Buried him in his Church, where he was found by <hi>Emanuel de Faria,</hi> or <hi>Frias,</hi> and the Priest <hi>Antony Penteado,</hi> sent thither on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by King <hi>Emanuel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. In the Year 1547, being about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair that Oratory where the Apostle died, digging they found a Stone, which seems to be the same he held then. It is about a yard long, and three quarters wide, the Colour grey, with some red spots. In the middle of it is carved a Portal round at the Top, with Letters between the two Borders; within two Banisters, rather than Pillars; being turned, on which are two twisted Figures, like Dogs sitting, from whose Necks rises a graceful Arch of five Borders, and between every two are knots like Beads. In the hollow of this Door is a Pedestal of two Steps, from the uppermost of which rises a Branch on each side, and over them, as it were in the Air, is a Cross, the ends of it like to that of the Military Order of <hi>Alcantara,</hi> as the History relates; but the Print shews them like three half Moons, the Convex sides outwards, and the Points meeting, as commonly we see in many ancient Churches in <hi>Europe.</hi> Over all is a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54711:401"/>
Dove flying, as it were descending to touch the Cross with its Beak. There are ancient Pillars in the East with Doves after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. One preserved in the Pagod of <hi>Negapatan,</hi> has carved on it a Cock, a Rope and a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. There is a Tradition, it came of it self to those parts by Sea, with a Candle burning.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Chappel being repaired, or beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Year 1551, the Stone was solemnly set up in it, and at the time the Priest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced those words of the Gospel; <hi>Missus est Angelus</hi> Gabriel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it began to change colour, and became black and shining, then sweating turned to its own colour, plainly discovering the spots of Blood which before were obscure. The Letters about it could not be understood till the Year 1561; a Learned Bramen said, they were 36 Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks, every one containing a Sentence, and were to this effect: <q>In the time of the Son of <hi>Sagad</hi> the Gentile, who Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 30 years, came upon Earth one only GOD, and was Incarnate in the Womb of a Virgin: He abolished the Law of the Jews, whom he punished for the Sins of Men, after he had been in the World 33 years, and taught Twelve Servants the Truth he preached. A King of Three Crowns, <hi>Cheralacone, Indalacone, Cuspandiad;</hi> and King <hi>Alexander</hi> of the Kingdom <hi>Erti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabarad,</hi> with <hi>Catherine</hi> his Daughter, and many Virgins and six Families, voluntarily followed the Law of <hi>Thomas,</hi> because it was the Law of Truth, and he gave them the Sign of the Cross to adore. Going up
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54711:401"/>
to the place of <hi>Antenodur,</hi> a Bramen run him through with a Lance, and he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced this Cross, which was stained with his Blood, and his Disciples carried him to <hi>Maiale,</hi> and Buried him in his Church with the Lance in his Body. And because We the above-named Kings saw this, we carved these Letters here.</q> Hence, besides the Story, is gathered, That <hi>Maiale</hi> was the ancient Name of the City <hi>Meliapor,</hi> now called St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> This Stone afterwards sweated sometimes: Till the Year 1561 it was a good Omen; since then a bad one.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. In the time of the Priest <hi>Penteado</hi> were also found three Brass Plates about a Span long, and half as broad, in shape like a Scutcheon, on the top a Ring. On the one side was a Cross and Peacock, the ancient Arms of <hi>Meliapor;</hi> on the other, Characters which were explained by another Learned Bramen. The first part was Titles of the King; <q>
                           <hi>Boca Raja,</hi> Son of <hi>Campula Raja,</hi> and Grandson of <hi>Atela Raja.</hi>
                        </q> He begins confessing, One God without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Maker of all things. And says of  himself, <q>That he is as Great a Gentleman as the Beast <hi>Chigsan,</hi> and as one of the five Kings who conquered 99: That he is as strong as one of the eight Elephants that the World stands upon, and that he Conquered the Kingdoms of <hi>Otia Tulcan</hi> and <hi>Canara,</hi> cutting his Enemies to pieces with his Sword.</q> The other Plates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Grants of Lands to St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to himself, and calling him <hi>Abidarra
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54711:402"/>
Modeliar.</hi> Whence may be gathered, these Princes Reigned at the time that Christ suffered. One of them begins thus: <q>After the Year 1259, in the first Year called <hi>Icarrana Rachan,</hi> on the <hi>12th</hi> day of the New Moon of the good Year, I give in Alms to the Saint <hi>Abidarra Modeliar, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Thus Another: <q>This is a Token of Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds to purchase Paradice, and all Kings that perform them shall obtain much more, and he that disannuls them shall be 60000 years with the Worms in Hell, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. It has always been controverted, which way St. <hi>Thomas</hi> came into <hi>India.</hi> The Heathen History says, <q>That St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and St. <hi>Thaddeus</hi> being in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> they parted at the City <hi>Edessa;</hi> and the former sailing with some Merchants came to the Island <hi>Zocotora,</hi> and after Converting the People, passed to <hi>Mogodover Patana,</hi> a City of <hi>Paru</hi> in <hi>Malabar,</hi> where he built a Church. The King keeping there the Wedding of his Son, some Jewish Women came to sing, and their Musick was Texts of Scripture, many of them fulfilled by the Life and Death of our Saviour. St. <hi>Thomas</hi> being present, was so rapt, hearing those Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from them People, that a Heathen observing it gave him a Box on the Ear. Soon after going to fetch Water, a Tiger bit off his Hand. He came running to tell his Misfortune, and after him a Dog with the Hand in his Mouth. The Apostle took, and set it on again, so that no Mark re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. Then he went to <hi>Calicut,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54711:402"/>
                           <hi>Xa Perimal.</hi>
                        </q> There is an Account, That he went to the Mogol's Country, where <hi>Chesetrigal</hi> then Reigned, and after being in <hi>China</hi> recurned to <hi>India,</hi> visiting the Province of <hi>Tibet,</hi> and setled at <hi>Meliapor,</hi> where he ended.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. In the Year 800 arrived at <hi>Mogodover,</hi> or <hi>Patana,</hi> a rich Christian <hi>Armenian,</hi> called <hi>Thomas Cananeus,</hi> who with his Company pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented himself to the King: He received him with Kindness, and soon after won by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, gave him the Lands of <hi>Cranganor</hi> and City <hi>Patana,</hi> where there was scarce any Footsteps of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Church. On those Foundations he built another; another at <hi>Cranganor</hi> by the name of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> now standing within our Fort; another of our Lady, and another of St. <hi>Ciriacus.</hi> These be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Works of <hi>Thomas Cananeus,</hi> made them erroniously be believed the Apostles. Afterwards were found other Plates contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grants of Lands to the Disciples and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of the Apostles.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. It may reasonably be believed, that Pagod where <hi>Gama</hi> entred, as he went from <hi>Calicut</hi> to <hi>Zamorie</hi>'s Palace, was of this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, because the Image of our Lady was there called <hi>Mary</hi> by the Heathens; and it being believed one of the three Kings that went to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was of <hi>Malabar.</hi> The Heathens yearly celebrate a Feast to St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> to preserve their Ships; because formerly many of them used to be Cast-away sailing to <hi>Parvi.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE great <hi>Alfonso de Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> was drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">1515.</note> the last Period of his Life, when King <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> as if he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen it, sent a new Governor with a Fleet for <hi>India.</hi> The Governor was <hi>Lope Soarez de Albergaria,</hi> the Fleet consisted of thirteen Ships, and in them fifteen hundred fighting Men, many Gentlemen by Birth, most such by their Actions. Among them was <hi>Duarte Galvam,</hi> a Person of Learning, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Judgment, who went Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54711:404"/>
to <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> with rich Presents; some for him, some for the Church. The Governor being arrived at <hi>Cochin,</hi> by his (perhaps rather affected than natural) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedness became disagreeable to many, and particularly to the King, who was used to <hi>Albuquerque</hi>'s discreet Civility. <hi>D. Garcia de Noronha,</hi> who took Charge of the Dispatch of the homeward bound trading Ships, went away with them after no small Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement with <hi>Lope Soarez.</hi> Till this time the Gentlemen had followed the Dictates of true Honor, esteeming their Arms the greatest Riches; from this time forwards they so wholly gave up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to trading, that those who had been Captains became Merchants, so that what had been Command became a Shame, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor was a Scandal, and Reputation a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> entred upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. He visited the Forts, placed in them new Captains, gave out Orders and such other Affairs of small moment, which rather serve to fill Paper than increase the Substance of a History.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This year sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> five Ships under the Command of <hi>Iohn de Silveyra,</hi> three of them arrived in <hi>India,</hi> the other two were lost on the Sands of <hi>St. Lazaro.</hi> The Governor prepared, according to the King's Order, for the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> and being informed, that the Soldan was fitting out a great Fleet at <hi>Suez,</hi> he sailed in search there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">1516.</note> from <hi>Goa,</hi> on the eighth of <hi>February,</hi> with twenty seven Sail of several sorts and Sizes.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54711:404"/>
In this Fleet were twelve hundred <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> eight hundred <hi>Malabar</hi> Soldiers, and eight hundred Seamen of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He arrived before the City <hi>Aden,</hi> the Commander whereof <hi>Miramirzan,</hi> finding himself defenceless, by reason a piece of the Wall was beaten down by <hi>Raez Soliman,</hi> Admiral of the <hi>Suez</hi> Fleet, <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> went in search of, he made a Virtue of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and offered the Keys to <hi>Lope Soarez,</hi> affirming he would have done the same to <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> had not he begun by Acts of Hostility. <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> pleased with this Flattery, trusted to him, and took not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the City, but went away in search of <hi>Raez Soliman,</hi> thinking first to find out him, and then take the City; and neither did he take <hi>Aden</hi> at his return, nor meet <hi>Soliman</hi> as he went. He went up the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> in quest of <hi>Solyman,</hi> but with bad Fortune; for <hi>D' Alvaro de Castro</hi> was lost with forty Men through Covetousness; for having taken some. Vessels, he so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded his own with the Goods, that it sunk down to rights. Other Ships sustained much damage. Hearing that <hi>Solyman</hi> was drove by stress of Weather to <hi>Ioda,</hi> and had no Defence, he resolved to sail thither.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Ioda</hi> (or as the <hi>Arabs</hi> call it) <hi>Gidda,</hi> is seated in <hi>Arabia Felix</hi> in twenty one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and half of North Latitude, in a most barren Soil, being all a deep Sand. It was a Colony of <hi>Moors,</hi> who attended more to Trade, than Delight. The Buildings are good, but not the Harbour; the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54711:405"/>
of two sorts, the native <hi>Arabs,</hi> and foreign Merchants. The Town was forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Mir Hozem,</hi> after he was defeated by <hi>D. Francisco de Almeyda,</hi> for his own Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, being afraid to return to the Soldan, but upon pretence of the Defence of the Sepulchre of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his Prince. When <hi>Hozem</hi> was busie in this Work, came to the Soldan <hi>Raez Solyman,</hi> a <hi>Turk</hi> of base Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, but a powerful and bold Pyrate, born in the Island <hi>Mitylene</hi> of the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> He offered himself to command the Fleet of twenty seven Sail, that was preparing at <hi>Suez</hi> to fall upon <hi>Aden,</hi> an employ <hi>Mir Hozem</hi> had set his Heart upon. The old Servant was laid aside, and the Stranger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. The punishment of this Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy soon fell upon <hi>Ioda.</hi> For <hi>Solyman</hi> after repairing the Loss sustained at <hi>Aden</hi> (where many of his Men were killed) and taking a great Booty in the City <hi>Zeibid,</hi> returned to <hi>Gidda,</hi> where he slew <hi>Mir Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem,</hi> and then delivered the City to the <hi>Turk,</hi> who not long before had killed the Soldan in Battel. This was the occasion that <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> found <hi>Solyman</hi> at <hi>Gidda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Port being dangerous, <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> anchored a League from the City, in which there was so good Cannon, that three or four Peices reached the Ships at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. There came a Messenger from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman,</hi> offering a private Combat between Man and Man, or as <hi>Soarez</hi> should propose. The Challenge was received by <hi>Gaspar de Silva,</hi> and <hi>D. Antonio de Meneses,</hi> but the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54711:405"/>
Governor would not permit, saying he would answer ashore. He sounded a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel that goes up to the City, which was terrified by the firing of a Galeon. <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> appeased the Tumult, and appeared with some Men without the Walls, whilst multitudes appeared on them, filling the Air with loud Cries. <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> delayed the landing two days, till his Men began to complain of the delay. He appeased them by shewing his Instructions, wherein he was ordered to fight the Fleet, which he could not compass, not to attack that City where there might be much danger and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle profit. Tho Votes differed, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in Council to desist. He retired to the Island <hi>Camaran,</hi> whence he sent some to several parts of that Sea. Here died <hi>Duarte Galvam,</hi> a studious and ingenious Man, who had been Embassador in several parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and was going now in the same quality, being above seventy years of Age, to <hi>Prester Iohn.</hi> At his death he said, that his Son <hi>George Galvam</hi> and all his Men were cast away in their Vessel, and that in the Island of <hi>Dalaca</hi> they had cut off the Heads of <hi>Laurence de Cosme</hi> and others that were sent thither. It being impossible this News could be brought to the Island where he died, yet was afterwards found true.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. After suffering much through Famine, whereof some Men died, and losing seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>Portugueses,</hi> taken by the <hi>Moors,</hi> and carried to <hi>Gidda, Lope Soarez</hi> set sail, and appeared before the City <hi>Zeyla,</hi> on the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54711:406"/>
Mouth of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Shoar, called by <hi>Ptolomy, Emporium Avalite,</hi> being the great Market of those parts. The Town was easily taken, being unprovided, and burnt, and then the Fleet bent its course to <hi>Aden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Here <hi>Soarez</hi> found how much he had been to blame in not taking possession when offered by <hi>Miramirzan;</hi> for he finding his Enemy now weaker, and the Wall repaired, refused by forming Delays what afore he offered with haste. <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> fearing to lose time, durst not call <hi>Miramirzan</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but set sail, designing to do the same at the City <hi>Barbora,</hi> as he had done at <hi>Zeyla.</hi> But the Fleet was scattered by Storms, and drove to several Ports, and when they came after to hear of one another, it was found above eight hundred Men had perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Hunger, Sickness and Shipwrack. All which Misfortunes made the loss of the most fortunate <hi>Albuquerque</hi> be the more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Whilst these Disstasters attended <hi>Lope Soarez,</hi> another threatened the City <hi>Goa,</hi> where <hi>D. Gutierre de Monroy</hi> commanded. According to the Orders left him by <hi>Soa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> some Ships of the Enemy were taken of more Value than Reputation, and with more Danger than Profit. One <hi>Alvaro Madureira,</hi> who was married in <hi>Goa,</hi> fled to the Enemy, and turned <hi>Moor,</hi> then was reconciled, and falling again, brought the <hi>Indians</hi> to attack our Ships, putting them in great danger. And because Troubles sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54711:406"/>
come alone, it happened that one <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando Caldera,</hi> who also was married there, flying the punishment of Crimes, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Example of <hi>Madureira,</hi> or (as was said) terrified by the Threats of <hi>D. Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierre,</hi> who desired his absence, being in love with his Wife. This is likely, since there was scarce ever any great Mischief without a Woman at the end of it. <hi>Caldera</hi> went to serve <hi>Ancostan,</hi> an Officer of <hi>Hidalcan. D. Gutierre</hi> demanded him, because he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired not his absence that way. <hi>Ancostan</hi> refused to deliver him. The other chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged him, but he accepted not. <hi>De Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierre</hi> sent one who pretending to be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serter should kill <hi>Caldera,</hi> he executed it, and was killed upon the Body by the <hi>Moors. Lope Soarez</hi> arriving at <hi>Goa</hi> was informed by <hi>D. Gutierre</hi> what had passed, and left it to him take the revenge he thought fit of <hi>Ancostan,</hi> which produced the loss of Men and Reputation, and brought upon the City a dangerous Siege. It fell out thus.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. As soon as <hi>D. Gutierre</hi> had this leave of the Governor, he prepared to put his Designs in execution, and when he thought time, sent out his Brother <hi>D. Fernando</hi> with one hundred and fifty <hi>Portugueses,</hi> whereof eighty were Horse, and a great number of <hi>Canaras,</hi> against <hi>Ancostan.</hi> At <hi>Ponda</hi> they routed the <hi>Moors,</hi> who rallying, obliged <hi>D. Ferdinando</hi> to retire, having lost two hundred Men, killed and taken. This caused all the Country to rise in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and <hi>Hidalcan</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54711:407"/>
the Peace was broke, to order his General <hi>Sufo Lari</hi> to besiege <hi>Goa. Sufo Lari</hi> appeared with four thousand Horse and twenty six thousand Foot, and attempted to pass into the Island, but was repulsed. Hunger began to press the Besieged, till three Ships arrived, one from <hi>Portugal,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Quiloa,</hi> and another from <hi>China,</hi> so <hi>Lari</hi> raised the Siege, and the former Peace was confirmed.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The same Misfortune attended <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> through the ill Government of <hi>George de Brito,</hi> and Animosities of others. The People fled from <hi>Malaca,</hi> because of their tyrannical Usage, and the King of it that had been prepared to recover it, sending before to this effect his General <hi>Cerilige de Raja,</hi> with considerable Forces, and some Cannon. He intrenched himself, and so pressed the Besieged, that had not <hi>D. Alexius de Meneses</hi> come to take the Government with three hundred Men, then had ended the <hi>Portugues</hi> Possession of <hi>Malaca.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Anthony de Saldana</hi> arrived now in <hi>India</hi> with six Ships from <hi>Portugal.</hi> In this Fleet went one <hi>Alcacova</hi> as Surveyor of <note place="margin">1517.</note> the King's Revenue, with such a Power as lessened that of <hi>Lope Soarez,</hi> and with a will to take it all away. There soon broke out the Flame of Contention between these two. <hi>Alcacova</hi> bore down by such as envied him, took revenge on himself by returning to <hi>Portugal,</hi> and on them there by causing them to be called to account for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Hence began the hearing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54711:407"/>
against the Governors and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of <hi>India,</hi> and hence it was that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny took more care to heap Riches than Honor, knowing them to be a protection against all Crimes. <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> sent <hi>D.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexius de Meneses</hi> to <hi>Malaca, Manuel de la Cerda</hi> to <hi>Diu,</hi> and <hi>Antony de Soldana</hi> with six Ships, by the King's Order to the Coast of <hi>Arabia.</hi> They arrived at the City <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bora</hi> near to <hi>Zeyla,</hi> and not unlike to it, but much less. It was taken without resistance, the Inhabitants being all fled. It was burnt, and the Fleet, without doing any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, returned to <hi>India</hi> at such time as <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> was sailing for the Island <hi>Ceylon.</hi>

THE Island <hi>Ceylon</hi> is opposite to Cape <hi>Comori,</hi> and is the Southermost Land of <hi>India,</hi> within <hi>Ganges,</hi> distant from the Continent sixteen Leagues, once, as some imagine, join'd to it, in length about eighty Leagues, and forty five in breadth. The Southermost Point is in the Latitude of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54711:408"/>
six degrees, the most Northerly in about ten. In this Sea is a Fishery of precious Pearls. The ancient Inhabitants of it called it <hi>Ila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Arabs, Seradib.</hi> It took the Name of <hi>Ceylon</hi> from the Sea that parts it from the Continent, because being dangerous, and the <hi>Chineses</hi> having lost a great Fleet there, called it <hi>Chilam,</hi> that is to say, Danger (it somewhat resembles <hi>Scylla)</hi> and corruptly it was called <hi>Ceylon.</hi> This is the ancient <hi>Trapobana,</hi> and not <hi>Sumatra,</hi> as some have imagined. It produces ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, Cinnamon better than that of all other places, Rubies, Saphires and other precious Stones, much Pepper and Carda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, Brasil Wood, and other Dyes, great Woods of Palm-trees, the Elephants bred there the most sensible, much Cattle, has good Ports, and several Rivers of good Water. The Mountains are covered with pleasant Woods, one particularly rising the space of seven Leagues, on the top whereof is a round plain of about thirty paces Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, in the Center whereof rises a smooth Rock about six spans above the rest, on the Superficies whereof is the Print of a Mans Foot about two spans in length. This Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>step is held in great veneration, being thought to be of a holy Man born at <hi>Delhi,</hi> who lived many years on that Mountain, preaching to the Inhabitants the Belief of one only God, who afterwards returning to his own Country, sent one of his Teeth to the Kings of that Island, as a Token to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him, and they keep it as a Relict where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54711:408"/>
they repose much Confidence in time of Danger. On this account resort thither many Pilgrims from places a thousand Leagues distant. The Island is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nine Kingdoms, the chiefest <hi>Columbo</hi> on the West. The others <hi>Gale</hi> on the South; <hi>Iaula, Tanavaca, Cande, Batecalon, Vila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem, Triquinamale,</hi> and <hi>Iafanapatam.</hi>

The King of <hi>Columbo</hi> in <hi>Ceylon</hi> had a Trade with the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> desired their Friendship, and furnished them with Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon from the time of <hi>Albuquerque. Lope Soarez</hi> went thither now with a Design to oblige him to pay Tribute, and to build a Fort as King <hi>Emanuel</hi> desired. He had with him seven Gallies, two Ships, and eight small Vessels with the Materials and Workmen for the Building, and 700 <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugues</hi> Soldiers. They had bad Weather, but arrived safe. The King presently grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leave to build a Fort, and the <hi>Moors</hi> as soon altered his mind, and he received <hi>Soa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> going to begin the Work in such manner as put him to a streight; but in the end the Enemies were put to flight. They had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified themselves to hinder the Work, and <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> did the same now to begin it. The King came to composition, the Articles were that he should be a Subject to <hi>Portugal,</hi> paying a yearly Tribute of twelve hundred Quintals of Cinnamon, twelve Rings of Rubies and Saphires, and six Elephants, for <hi>Soarez</hi> would not admit his Excuses, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he blamed the Foreign Merchants.</p>

3. At this time arrived from the <hi>Maldives, Iohn de Silveyra</hi> with four Sail; in his way he took two Ships of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and the King of the Island granted leave to erect a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. He went with the same Design to <hi>Bengala,</hi> where he was in great Danger, for there a <hi>Bengalian</hi> young Man that sailed with him, discovered the taking of the two Ships which were sent to <hi>Cochin,</hi> and so he was looked upon as a Pyrate not worthy to be heard. It had been worse with him, had not <hi>Iohn Coello</hi> arrived then with his Ship from <hi>Pacem,</hi> being sent on the same Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand by <hi>Ferdinando Perez de Andrade,</hi> to the King of <hi>Bengala. Don Iohn de Silveyra,</hi> set Sail hence after passing the Winter with great hardship, especially through Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. He was invited by the King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racam</hi> to his Port, who, with the Messenger sent him a Present, but all his Kindnesses ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to destroy him at the instigation of the Governour of the other Port. This Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery took no effect, and he arriv'd at <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> at the time that <hi>Lope Soarez</hi> finished the Fort, who gave him the command of it, and left <hi>Anthony de Miranda de Azevedo</hi> with four Ships to cruise in that Sea.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

Sea. <hi>Duarte Coello</hi> was sent with an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy and Present from King <hi>Emanuel</hi> to him of <hi>Siam,</hi> the substance of it was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Peace, and as a token of it, that he would send People to inhabit <hi>Malaca,</hi> that so the <hi>Moors</hi> whom he hated as much as we, might be totally expelled. He granted all with great satisfaction, and as a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Sincerity, caused to be erected in a remarkable place of the City <hi>Hudia,</hi> where he then was, a Cross with the Arms of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> on it. <hi>Coello</hi> having thus succeeded was thrown by stress of weather upon the Coast of <hi>Pam,</hi> the King whereof received him friendly, and voluntarily submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> with an year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tribute of a Gold Cup. This action was done rather in hatred to the King of <hi>Bintam</hi> than of any love to us.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> where <hi>Coello</hi> had now been setling Peace, is one of the three greatest of <hi>Asia,</hi> the others are that of <hi>China</hi> and that of <hi>Bisnagar.</hi> The great River <hi>Menam</hi> runs through the middle of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> as it lies in length, the River has its spring in the great Lake <hi>Chiamay</hi> in the Latitude of 30 Degrees, and falls into the Sea in 13 Degrees, so that the length of this Kingdom is 330 Leagues. On the West of it is <hi>Bengala,</hi> on the South <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca,</hi> on the East <hi>Cambodia,</hi> and on the North <hi>China.</hi> It contains much Mountain and Plain, and in both sundry sorts of People, some most barbarous and cruel, who feed on human Flesh, as the <hi>Guei</hi> who for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament

make figures on their Bodies with hot Irons. Here are bred many Elephants, black Cattle and Buffaloes. It has many Sea-port Towns and populous Cities. <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> is the Metropolis or Court. The Faith of the <hi>Siamites</hi> agrees in many considerable points with the Christian, as one God, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell, Good and Bad Angels at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending each body. They build sumptuous Temples, in which they place Idols of vast bigness. They are very religious, sparing in Diet, much given to divination, studious, particularly in Astrology. All the Land is most fruitful, abounds in Gold and Silver, and other Metals. The memorable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Subjects are recorded to be read to the Prinçes, not the favours of the Kings. Against this King takes the Field, he has in a readiness almost 300000 Men, 10000 Elephants, and other Beasts of burthen.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. About this time <hi>Fernan Perez de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drade</hi> (sent by the King to several discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) sailing towards the Bay of <hi>Bengala,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Pacem</hi> the Metropolis of one of the Kingdoms of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> where he found <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> trading, and was well received of that King. Here he lost his biggest Ship, burnt by a Candle carelessly set up, and was thereby obliged to return to <hi>Malaca,</hi> sending away <hi>Iohn Coello</hi> in a Ship of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala</hi> to expect him there with what Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he could get till he returned from <hi>Malaca.</hi> Hence <hi>Coello</hi> set out with fresh Instructions for <hi>China,</hi> and met with furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Storms and other Dangers.

In the City were only 200, many sick, and most unprovided. But this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize cured many of their Feavers, and all Men running to oppose the danger, on both sides there was a sharp engagement for the space of three hours with great loss to the Enemy, and some on our side. Twenty days the King lay before the Town, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54711:412"/>
then retired having lost 330 Men, of ours 18 were killed. Then he lay to hinder the bringing of Provisions till the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour sent relief, and the <hi>Portugueses</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the damage they received from the Fort of <hi>Muar,</hi> whence <hi>Sansotea Raja</hi> made inroads, they resolved to gain it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly gave the assault, and after a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous resistance entered, having killed most of the Defendants, which were 800 <hi>Moors,</hi> and then burnt it after securing the spoil, in which were 300 Cannons, some of Brass.

of those People were publickly read, began to read in a Book, and then taking some yellow Paper (a colour dedicated to their holy uses) with some sweet Leaves of Trees, whereon were certain Characters, set Fire to it all, and then taking the Hands of the King's Minister and holding them over the ashes, said some words, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Oath inviolable. <hi>Anthony Correa,</hi> to answer this Solemnity, ordered his Priest to put on a Surplice and bring his Brevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which was so tottered and torn, that it was scandalous those Heathens should see how little respect was paid to our sacred Books. <hi>Correa</hi> observing this, ordered to be brought instead of it a Book of Church-Musick, which was more creditable, being bigger and better bound, and opening it, the first Verse he met was. <hi>Vanity of Vanities.</hi> This passed among those People as well as if it had been the Gospel. The Metropolis of this Kingdom is <hi>Bagou,</hi> corruptly called <hi>Pegu.</hi> On the West of it is the Bay of <hi>Bengala,</hi> on the East the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> on the South that of <hi>Malaca,</hi> and on the North that of <hi>Arracam.</hi> The length almost a 100 Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and in some places the same bredth, not including its Conquests. The Land is plain, well watered, and therefore fruitful, producing several Plants and plentiful of Provisions, as well of Cattle as Grain. In it many Temples with multiplicity of Idols and much variety of Ceremonies. The People believe themselves to be descended from a <hi>Chinese</hi> Dog and Woman, who only

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Garcia de Sa</hi> encouraged with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief brought by <hi>Anthony Correa,</hi> resolved to shew himself to the King of <hi>Bintam.</hi> He fitted 30 Ships, and in them 500 Men, whereof 150 were <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and gave the command of all to <hi>Anthony Correa.</hi> They sailed to the place where the King was lodged, which was defended by a Fort well mann'd and with much Cannon.

6. His success in the beginning of this War encouraged the Kings of <hi>Pacem</hi> and <hi>Achem</hi> to commit some outrages against the <hi>Portugueses. Garcia de Sa</hi> being now victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, set out a Ship commanded by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel Pacheco</hi> to take revenge of the harms sustained. After some success he sent out a Boat for water, rowed by <hi>Malayes</hi> with only five <hi>Portugueses</hi> in it, on a sudden they espied three Ships of <hi>Pacem</hi> with each 150 Men, the Commander made up to them before the others, and they finding it impossible to escape, boarded the Ship, and laid about them with such fury that they soon covered the Deck with dead Bodies of the Enemy, the rest leaped over-board, and after them the Captain, rather to punish them than save himself, being seen to hue them with his Cymater as he swam. The five <hi>Portugueses</hi> were left in possession of the Ship, which the other two perceiving fled. The King of <hi>Pacem</hi> terrified with this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction offered Peace and Satisfaction for all the damage he had done, and so <hi>Emanuel Pacheco</hi> returned to <hi>Malaca</hi> with Honor, where the Ship taken was preserved as a monument of so notable an action. <hi>Duarte Coello</hi> was then ready to sail for <hi>China.</hi> More of him in its proper place, let us see what was done by the Commanders sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by <hi>Iames Lopez de Sequeyra.</hi>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54711:415"/>
in the Port, and some Prizes in the Neighbourhood. The Inhabitants of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çua</hi> were fled for refuge to the Port of <hi>Arquico</hi> belonging to <hi>Prester Iohn;</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Town sent a Messenger with a Letter to <hi>Iames Lopez,</hi> desiring he would make Peace with those People that had fled to his Protection. He asked nothing in behalf of the Town because they were all Christians, and because there was a Prophecy among them foretelling the coming of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Christians to settle a correspondence with them, which he seeing the Christian colours looked upon to be fulfilled. <hi>Iames Lopez<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> returned a courteous answer, and stood in to the shoar, where some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians came abroad to him. They told him their Prince <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> had some years since, sent an Embassadour whose name was <hi>Matthew,</hi> to a King of the end of the World, whose Fleet then conquered <hi>India,</hi> to inform him of those remote Christians, and demand succour against the <hi>Moors,</hi> but that he never returned. <hi>Sequeyra</hi> hearing this, was convinced those Men dealt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously, because he brought that Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour with him, and had orders from King <hi>Emanuel</hi> to land him safe in his Prince's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. The Embassadour was placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, who received him with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and joy, which was no less in him for being restored to his Country after ten years absence.

                        <p>A continuation of the Government of <hi>James Lopez de Sequeyra,</hi> from the Year 1520 till the Year 1521, and reign of King <hi>Emanuel.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Kingdom of <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> now discovered, is most known by this name, though improper, and is properly called the Kingdom of <hi>Abassia,</hi> or Empire of the higher <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> It was so called from that great <hi>Iovarus</hi> (corruptly <hi>Prester Iohn)</hi> who came to it from the Christians of <hi>Tartary,</hi> with a Cross before him like our Bishops. And this King carried a Cross in his hand, with the Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> as being a <hi>Iacobite</hi> Christian. The Dominions of this Prince lye between the Rivers <hi>Nile, Astabora</hi> and <hi>Astapus.</hi> On the East it runs along the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> 120 Leagues, this being the least side, which in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 670 Leagues. On the West it borders on those <hi>Blacks</hi> who possess the great Mines
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54711:416"/>
of Gold, for which they pay him Tribute. On the North divided from the <hi>Moors,</hi> by a Line drawn from the City <hi>Suanquem</hi> to the Island <hi>Meroe,</hi> or <hi>Noba.</hi> On the South it borders on the Kingdom <hi>Adea,</hi> from whose mountains falls the River <hi>Obi,</hi> that loses it self in the Sea at the Town of <hi>Quilmance</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Melinde.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Kings of <hi>Abassia</hi> pretend to be descended from <hi>Solomon</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Saba,</hi> she being delivered on the way, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Child <hi>Meilech,</hi> and sent him to his Father to be by him declared King of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> who when he anointed gave him the name of <hi>David</hi> his Grandfather. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Houshold, and gave him Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his own, and for High-Priest <hi>Azaria</hi> the Son of <hi>Sadoc,</hi> who stole the Tables of the Law out of the Temple, and carried them with his new Prince. They affirm, that the Descendants of those same Officers still possess the same Employs. They had knowledge of the Law of Christ by the means of Queen <hi>Candace,</hi> in whom they glory as being of their Country. But their true Apostles were S. <hi>Philip,</hi> and S. <hi>Matthew.</hi> The King, in memory of his Descent, begins his many Titles thus: <hi>David</hi> beloved of God, Pillar of the Faith, of Kin to the Stock of <hi>Iuda,</hi> Grandson of <hi>David,</hi> Son of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Son of the Pillar of <hi>Sion,</hi> Son of the Progeny of <hi>Iacob,</hi> Son of the Hand of <hi>Mary, &amp;c.</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the great and high <hi>Ethiopia, &amp;c.</hi> The People are very religious, have many
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54711:416"/>
Churches, and many Monasteries of only two Religious Orders, the one of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> the other the Canon Regulars. They have no considerable Towns, little practice of Learning, no skill in Mechanicks, and so are very rude in their Diet and Cloathing. In such Houses as use more Grandeur, all the Furniture is of other Countries. There are as expert Thieves among them, as our Gypsies in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Religious Men who live in Convents wear long Habits of Cotton; the others and their Priests and Nuns, Skins, which does not cover as much as Modesty requires. Their Prince for the most part lives in the Field in a populous City of Tents, often removing. In his Messages he uses that style of <hi>Portugal;</hi> I the King greet you. This was what our Discoverers could then gather; let others say what is since found, and what Alterations have happened.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now came the <hi>Barnagax</hi> or Governor of that Province, having received the News of the arrival of <hi>Matthew</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, and our Fleet. He appeared on the Shoar with two hundred Horse, and two thousand Foot. After some difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the place for him and <hi>Iames Lopez</hi> to meet, they met on the Edge of the Water, and were seated on Chairs upon the Sand, which then burnt with the heat of the Sun; there <hi>Matthew</hi> the Embassador was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and with him <hi>D. Rodrigo de Lima,</hi> sent Embassador by King <hi>Emanuel</hi> to <hi>Prester Iohn.</hi> There they treated of building a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54711:417"/>
Fort either on the Island <hi>Camaran,</hi> or that of <hi>Maçua</hi> against the <hi>Moors.</hi> Lastly, they both swore the Sincerity of this Agreement on a Cross, and after they parted, sent some Presents on both parts. <hi>D. Rodrigo de Lima</hi> set forward on his Journey without <hi>Matthew,</hi> who soon after died in the Monastery of the Vision, which he had earnestly desired to reach. <hi>Iames Lopez</hi> erected a great Cross in that Port in memory of the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val there of our Fleet, and caused many Masses to be said in the Mosque of <hi>Maçua.</hi> Hence he went to the neigbouring Island of <hi>Dalaca,</hi> and having burnt the City, deserted by its Inhabitants, stood over to the Coast of <hi>Arabia.</hi> One Galley and most of the Men were cast away by bad Weather, and he came to an Anchor at <hi>Calayate,</hi> where he found <hi>George de Albuquerque,</hi> who waited his coming, and going on to <hi>Mascate,</hi> left him to winter there with the Ships, and he went on with the Gallies to <hi>Ormuz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Whilst our Governor was in the <hi>Red Sea, Chrisnarao,</hi> King of <hi>Bisnagar,</hi> covered the Hills and Plains, and drank up Rivers, with an Army of thirty five thousand Horse, and seven hundred thirty three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot, five hundred eighty six Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, loaded with Castles, in each of which were four Men, and twelve thousand Water-carriers, to supply all parts, that the Men might not dispe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:54711:417"/>
belonging of right to his Ancestors, who still left the Recovery of it as a Charge to their Successors, and was possessed by <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalcan,</hi> with whom to this effect he waged War.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The City <hi>Rachol</hi> was naturally almost impregnable, seated on a high Mountain, fortified with several Walls, and large and deep Ditches, strong Towers, stored with Artillery, and all other Defence, garrisoned by four hundred Horse, eight thousand Foot, and twenty Elephants, with Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Ammunition enough to tire the most patient Besiegers. <hi>Chrisnarao</hi> encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped about it, and gave many Assaults to no effect for the space of three months, when <hi>Hidalcan</hi> came to the Relief with eighteen thousand Horse, one hundred and twenty thousand Foot, one hundred and fifty Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and much great Cannon. After many Preludes these two Princes came to a Battel, wherein at first <hi>Chrisnarao</hi> received great damage, but recovering himself, made such havock among <hi>Hidalcan</hi>'s Men, that only those escaped the Sword, or Captivity, who at last moved pity in the very Enemy. The principal Booty consisted of four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horses, one hundred Elephants, four hundred great Cannon, besides the small, and other Riches. Here died valiantly forty <hi>Portugueses</hi> who were in the service of <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> who saved himself by flight. As <hi>Chrisnarao</hi> returned in a rage against the City, there came to his Camp <hi>Christopher de Figueredo,</hi> with twenty <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54711:418"/>
brought some <hi>Arabian</hi> Horses to sell to the King. They discoursed about the Siege, and he asked leave to view the place which was granted. He gave two Assaults, and being backed in the second by <hi>Crisnarao,</hi> the Town was enter'd. <hi>Crisnarao</hi> was puffed with this Victory when <hi>Hidalcan</hi>'s Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers came to beg the Booty taken in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. He answered, It should be restored, if <hi>Hidalcan</hi> came to kiss his Foot, as supreme Lord of the Empire of <hi>Canara.</hi> The base Condition was accepted, but the execution prevented by several Accidents. <hi>Ruy de Melo,</hi> who commanded at <hi>Goa,</hi> laying hold of this opportunity, possessed himself of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring part of the Continent, with only two hundred and fifty Horse, and eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Canara</hi> Foot.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. About this time <hi>Lope de Brito</hi> had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Iohn de Silveyra</hi> in the Command of the Fort in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and carried with him four hundred Soldiers, and many Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, wherewith he made the Fort so strong, that it raised a Jealousie in the People of <hi>Columbo,</hi> who, at the instigation of the <hi>Moors,</hi> refused to trade with him. <hi>Brito</hi> sent them some Threats, which brought on him twenty thousand Men, who besieged him five months, during which time the besieged suffered great Hardships, till <hi>Anthony de Lemos</hi> arrived with fifty Men, with this small relief they ventured to fall upon that multitude, and putting all to the rout, the place was restored to its former quiet.</p>

7. The season being fit to sail (which in those parts is very uncertain) <hi>Iames Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez</hi> set out from <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and went to meet <hi>George de Albuquerque</hi> at <hi>Calayate,</hi> where he found one Ship arrived from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> of nine that sailed thence together, all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers afterwards came safe. One of these Ships sailing before the Wind beyond <hi>the Cape of Good Hope,</hi> stopped all of a sudden, the Sails, tho full, giving her no motion. The Cause being examined into, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a great Sea-Monster bore the Vessel upon its back, the Tail about the Rudder, and Head up with the Boltsprit, casting up Streams of Water. It was removed by Exorcisms, no human means being thought sufficient. The Sailers said it was the Fish called <hi>Sambrero</hi> or Hat-Fish, because the Head resembles it, and such a one, tho less, had been seen on the Coast of <hi>Portugal,</hi> doing great harm about <hi>Atouguia.</hi> The King ordered the Governor to build Forts in <hi>Maluco, Sumatra, Maldivia, Chaul,</hi> and <hi>Diu. Iames Lopez</hi> resolved to attempt the last first. To that effect he treated with <hi>Melique Az,</hi> but was put off with delays, and he dissembling, sailed for <hi>Cochin,</hi> to provide for his return thither, in order to gain by Force what the <hi>Moor</hi> endeavoured to put off by Art.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. He dispatched the homeward bound trading Ships under the Command of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony de Saldana.</hi> Being eased of this Care he applyed himself to that of the Attempt upon <hi>Diu.</hi> In order thereunto he gathered
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54711:419"/>
the greatest Fleet of ours that had been seen on those Seas, consisting of forty eight Vessels of all sorts and Qualities, and in them three thousand <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and eight hundred <hi>Malabars</hi> and <hi>Canaras.</hi> A great Power lamentably disappointed as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Sequel</p>
                     <p n="9">9. On the ninth of <hi>February, Iames Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez</hi> appeared with all his pomp before <hi>Diu, Melique Az</hi> was then absent, being gone to the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> to prevent him grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leave he persuaded us to ask for building the Fort. And being suspicious this preparation was made against him, had fortified and intrenched the City in wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner. He had left in it against all Accidents his Son <hi>Melique Saca,</hi> and three stout Commanders with a strong Garrison. Our Governor having observed the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, had it debated in Council what was fittest to be done, and all agreeing the City should not be assaulted, they all afterwards accused him because it was not done. And tho they allowed his Prudence in private, yet in publick accused him of Cowardise, but his Valour was well known. Besides they laid several Imputations upon him, so that the innocent <hi>Sequeyra</hi> suffered for their Crime, having acted nothing with that great Power, but only lost much Reputation. A misfortune (if it be lawful to say so) well deserved by Princes, who wink at such Crimes, and do not punish Faults commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through malice. <hi>Iames Lopez</hi> went to winter at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> some of the Captains to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54711:419"/>
several Markets, and <hi>D. Alexius de Meneses,</hi> with the rest of the Fleet, retired to <hi>Cochin,</hi> with power from the Governor to act as should be expedient in those parts.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>D. Alexius,</hi> at his arrival at <hi>Cochin</hi> dispatched the trading Ships for <hi>Portugal,</hi> and others appointed for several places. But their chief Business being Merchandise, their Names are more proper for the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom-House-Books. But because some of them were at <hi>Sumatra,</hi> it will be fit to give some short account of that Island.</p>

the Coast, the inland mountainous, watered by great Rivers, covered with vast Woods so condensed with Fogs, that all the Force the Sun has there cannot pierce them. For this reason it is very unhealthy, yet resorted to for its Riches, and chiefly plenty of Gold. There is in it a Spring of Oil, a burning Mountain like <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> it produces white Sandal, Benjamin, Camphire, Pepper, Ginger, Cinnamon, abundance of Silk, much Fish and Cattle of sundry sorts.

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>George Albuquerque</hi> arriving at the Island, and assisted by the neighbouring King of <hi>Ara,</hi> proposed to the Usurper to quit the Kingdom to the lawful Prince,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54711:420"/>
who had submitted himself to the King of <hi>Portugal. Genial</hi> the Usurper offered the same submission to keep his possession. The Offer was refused, and <hi>Albuquerque</hi> went to attack him in his Fort, which was scaled, and the Gate broke open, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly maintained by thirty Men who were in a Tower over it with the Usurper him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, till <hi>Cid Cerveyra</hi> with a Musket Shot, which went through his Forehead, brought him down, whereupon the thirty Men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed and fled. The Flower of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Moors</hi> (assaulted by three hundred of our Men) courageously defended a large Court or place of Arms, assisted by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants. <hi>Hector de Silveyra</hi> directing his Lance to the Trunk of one, the Beast put it by, and laying hold of his Body threw him into the Air, but so fortunately, that he lived. Two others succeeded better, one killing the Rider, the other wounded the Elephant, so that he flew back, making great havock among his own party. The <hi>Moors</hi> retired to a lesser place, and being close pursued, the King of <hi>Aru</hi> coming on to our assistance in due time, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of the Enemy were slain. Four or five Men of Note were killed on our side, many wounded, <hi>George de Albuquerque</hi> twice in the Face.

had been commanded by his Brother <hi>George,</hi> who with the choice of his Men was killed on the shoar of <hi>Achem,</hi> twenty Leagues distant from <hi>Pacem,</hi> and was sent thither with six Sail, and three hundred Men. Behold an example of Avarice and Ingratitude. <hi>Iohn de Borba,</hi> after suffering Shipwrack, having been tossed nine days on the Waves with nine Companions, and cast upon the shoar of <hi>Achem,</hi> was received and relieved by that King, as if he had been in his native Country. But <hi>George de Brito</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving, he informs him there was great store of Gold in the Tombs of the Kings, and the more to induce him to commit the Robbery, said the King had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Goods of some <hi>Portugueses. Brito,</hi> after some inquiry into the Business, began to pick a quarrel with the King, and seise upon that Gold. He landed with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, and finding a Fort in his way, took it. Two Drunken Men issuing out after the taking were killed by the Enemy, and several succeeding to relieve or revenge them, <hi>George de Brito</hi> was at last obliged to come to their Succour at such time as the King came on with a thousand Men and six Elephants. Here <hi>Brito</hi> and most of his Men were killed, among them fifty of Note. This is the just Reward of Injustice, Ingratitude and Avarice. The sad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder retired to their Ships, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whereof fell to <hi>Antony de Brito,</hi> (Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him slain) who now joined <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> in the Port of <hi>Pacem,</hi> where he left

some Men, and three Ships which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of use against a <hi>Moor</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested that Coast.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>George de Albuquerque</hi> returning to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca,</hi> and taking possession of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, prepared to make War upon the King of <hi>Bintam,</hi> who was forty Leagues distant from <hi>Malaca,</hi> in the Island <hi>Bintam</hi> of forty Leagues circumference. The Island was well fortified, having two strong Castles, and the Rivers staked, so that it seemed almost inaccessible. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> set out from <hi>Malaca</hi> with eighteen Sail, and six hundred Men. Finding it impossible for the Ships to come up, he landed his Men in Boats to attack a Fort, but the Water being up to their middles, and the Enemies shot very thick, they were forced to retire without doing any execution, and having lost twenty Men, and many wounded.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Hence <hi>Antony de Brito</hi> set sail for the <hi>Maluco</hi> Islands, which are in the midst of many others under the Equinoctial, about three hundred Leagues from <hi>Malaca</hi> East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The principal of them are five, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty five Leagues distant from each other. Their Names (tho in general call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Malucos)</hi> are <hi>Ternate, Tidore, Mousell, Maquien, Bacham.</hi> The biggest not above six Leagues in circumference. They are covered with Woods and Fogs, therefore unhealthy. These five produce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Food but no Cloves. In some there are flaming Mountains, chiefly in <hi>Ternate.</hi> Their chief Sustenance is Meal made of the Bark of Trees like to the Palm, from these and others they have Wine and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. There is a sort of Canes that in the hollow have a Liquor delightful to drink. The Inhabitants are not great Lovers of Flesh, though they have plenty; more of Fish, of which there is an infinite quantity. They are not affable, but warlike, and most swift either in running or swimming. Idolaters as to their Religion. Of their Origen there is no account. They were in process of times possessed by <hi>Moors,</hi> since whose first coming to them there was yet living an old Master when <hi>Brito</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. To these Islands, and particularly <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Brito</hi> was sent to build a Fort, which long since <hi>Boylefe</hi> the King thereof had desired. Others had gone before but to no effect, as in the time of <hi>Albuquerque, Antony de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breu,</hi> who lost one of the three Ships he carried, but saved the Men. He arrived in the Island <hi>Banda;</hi> five go under this name, but it is most proper to the chief, which is like an earthly Paradice, one great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it being the Plant which produces the Mace. <hi>Antony de Abreu</hi> returned to <hi>Malaca,</hi> but his other Captain <hi>Francis Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> was drove to <hi>Ternate,</hi> the King where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of seeing him, and some of his Men in Armour, concluded a Prophecy was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, which foretold, that Men of Iron

should come to that Island, who would make it famous. <hi>Anthony de Miranda</hi> went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afterwards, <hi>Francis Serram</hi> staying there to expect an answer from King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> to the Letters of the Kings of <hi>Ternate</hi> and <hi>Tidore</hi> each striving to have the Fort built in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Because the difference increased about the same thing between the two Kings and the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> who desired the same, <hi>Tristan</hi> defferred the work to avoid the danger, and get load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for five Ships he had with him. This was what happened from the taking of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca,</hi> till this time when <hi>Anthony de Brito</hi> undertook the Affairs of <hi>Maluco.</hi>

At this time a Correspondence was held between <hi>Francis Serram</hi> at <hi>Ternate</hi> and <hi>Ferdinando de Magallanes</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> which turned to the advantage of <hi>Spain,</hi> and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Portugal. Magallanes,</hi> or as he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called among us <hi>Magellan,</hi> was a Gentleman of good Note, a Man of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and Knight of <hi>Santiago,</hi> and had ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved well at <hi>Azamor</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> and in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts of <hi>India.</hi> He solicited for a sort of allowance (given usually to Men of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal)</hi> very inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for the value, but of much esteem for the honour of it. With much Justice he might pretend to it, and therefore find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a refusal, proceeding from the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous accusations of some Men, which found more Credit than his Service, he resolved to quit the Kingdom, and go over to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the V. his Service. By his skill in Sea-Affairs, and the Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he held with <hi>Serram</hi> at <hi>Maluco,</hi> he guessed there might be another way to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and this at such time as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had began to taste the Fruit of those Islands, and accordingly he writ to <hi>Serram</hi> that he hoped soon to be his Guest at <hi>Ternate,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither a new way. In order hereunto he went and offered his Service in <hi>Spain,</hi> was admitted, and the command of five Ships given him, with 250 Men, some of them <hi>Portugueses.</hi> He sailed from the Port of St. <hi>Lucar de Barrameda</hi> on the 20th. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 1519. Many at this time took the liberty to rail and cast reproaches upon
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54711:423"/>
him, but he to take off the occasion, had by a solemn act unnaturalized himself. Princes should be cautious of forcing to desperate actions by injustice, such Men as have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served rewards.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. These Ships being past the <hi>Rio de Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyro</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Brasil,</hi> the Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be mutinous, but much more when having passed the River S. <hi>Iulian,</hi> they found not the Streight they looked for, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be pinched with the great cold of that Climat. Hence proceeded some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respectful discourses against <hi>Magellan,</hi> not only reflecting on his Knowledge, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so his Fidelity. He finding it run high, and that of necessity he must give them some satisfaction, suppressing the best he could the anger that began to swell his Breast, called together the Principal Men, to whom he made a large and learned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couse. He spoke of Navigation in general, then of Discoveries, and the Pains and Hardships that great Undertakings are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, he encouraged them by the example of all the great Discoverers that had been before them, he put them in mind that the World would say the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were less daring than the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing many motives of Honour and Glory, concluded with threatning to put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Power of Life and Death the King had given him, and accordingly to punish such as were refractory. This, instead of a Compliance, produced fresh Disputes, more Disagreement and finally a Conspiracy to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54711:424"/>
kill <hi>Magellan,</hi> thinking no other means were left to prevent the prosecution of this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. The Chief Conspirators were three Captains <hi>Cartagene, Quixada,</hi> and <hi>Mendoça.</hi> The Design was discovered, and <hi>Mendoça</hi> immediately stabbed, and after quartered, the other two were taken, and <hi>Quixada</hi> quartered alive, both as Traytors. <hi>Carta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena</hi> with a Priest who had a hand in the Design were set ashoar on that barbarous Coast: most of the Men were in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, but it was necessary to pardon them, least he should want them to prosecute the Voyage. Whilst they wintered there, he sent some Men into the Country, who went up about twenty Leagues, and brought some of the Natives of the stature of Giants, being above three yards high. After suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering much through Cold and Hunger, and continual Labour in the Ships, being almost spent, they reached the Cape they called <hi>De las Virgenes,</hi> or, <hi>Of the Virgins,</hi> because discovered on the Day of the 11000 Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. It lies in 52 Degrees of South La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Below it they discovered the mouth of the Streight they looked for, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a League wide. Being entred, they found within in some places the same bredth, in others somewhat more, and in others much less. The Land high on both sides, part bare and part covered with Woods, many of Cypress, and much Snow which made the tops of the Mountains appear the higher. Having run about 50 Leagues in this Streight they spied another, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellan</hi>

sent one Ship to discover it, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving staid much beyond the limited time for her return and no news of her, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Astrologer <hi>Andrew Martin</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a Figure, and he answered they were gone back to <hi>Spain,</hi> and that the Captain <hi>Alvaro de Mesquita</hi> was carried as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner for opposing that resolution. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so, and they spent eight Months in the Voyage. <hi>Magellan</hi> somewhat troubled at this action, called the Chief Men to Council, and contrary to the Opinions of all resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to proceed. Which he put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and came out into the South Sea with only three Ships of the five, that which <hi>Iohn Serrano</hi> commanded being lost, but the Men though with much difficulty all saved.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. To shun the Cold which tormented them, he sailed towards the <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> steering W. N W. and being 1500 Leagues from the mouth of the Streight, found an Island in 18 Degrees of South Latitude, and 200 Leagues farther another. Having lost his computation for the <hi>Malucos,</hi> he found several Islands in 15 Degrees and a half of North Latitude, and at last came to that called <hi>Subo</hi> in 10 Degrees of North Latitude, being about 12 Leagues in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. He was well received by the King and the Natives, and so good a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition he found among them, that the King, Queen, their Children, and above 800 Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were baptized. This Prince was at War with a Neighbour, and made use of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54711:425"/>
                        <hi>Magellan</hi>'s Assistance against him. After two Victories he was killed in a third Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, together with the Astrologer and some others, on the 27th. of <hi>April</hi> 1521. The King who in Baptism was called <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> seeing that slaughter, agreed with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to kill all the Christians that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoar, and inviting them to Dinner poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned them all. They who were aboard being too few for three Ships, burnt one, and set sail with the other two, one of them the famous <hi>Victory</hi> commanded by <hi>Iohn Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian Cano.</hi> They arrived at the <hi>Malucos,</hi> and were received at <hi>Tidore</hi> by the King, in hatred of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> and <hi>Ternaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> for their late Differences. There they loaded with Spice, and went thence to <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> where they took in more with the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of <hi>Iohn de Lourosa a Portugues.</hi> The second Ship returned to <hi>Ternate,</hi> some of the Men being dead, and the rest spent by a contagious Disease. <hi>Antony de Brito</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them as if they had been his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not intruding Strangers, relieved and sent them to <hi>India,</hi> whence they returned in our Ships to their Country. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Ship the <hi>Victory</hi> returned with triumph to <hi>Spain,</hi> after performing that wonderful Voyagé about the World. Their arrival raised new Contests between the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Charles</hi> the V. and our King <hi>Iohn</hi> the III. because the <hi>Maluco</hi> Islands belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Portugal,</hi> according to the former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.

IT is absolutely necessary something be <note place="margin">1521.</note> said of those Captains who the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going years were sent to several parts, tho' what they did was in relation to Trade, a subject unbecoming a grave History. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan Perez de Andrade</hi> had secured the Trade of <hi>China</hi> in the City <hi>Quantung.</hi> The profit was exceeding great, and all Mens desires were directed thither. His Brother <hi>Simon de Andrade</hi> obtained leave of the Governour to undertake that Voyage with five Ships. They anchored in the Port of the Island <hi>Tamou,</hi> opposite to <hi>Quantung</hi> where the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been. Our Embassadour to the King of <hi>China</hi> was not yet gone thence, but went soon after up a large River with three Vessels richly furnished with <hi>Portugues</hi> Colours, it being a received Custom that none but those of <hi>China</hi> should be seen there, which are <hi>Gules</hi> a Lyon Rampant. In this manner he came to the foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in which are the Springs of the River he sailed. This Mountain is called <hi>Malex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:54711:426"/>
which beginning at the Bay of <hi>Couchin china</hi> in the Province of <hi>Fokien,</hi> divides three Southern Provinces, that is, <hi>Quangsi, Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tung</hi> and <hi>Fokien,</hi> as the <hi>Perineans, Spain</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> In one of the only two Ports there are in this division <hi>Thomas Perez</hi> landed, and travelled Northwards to the Province and City <hi>Nanking,</hi> where the King then was, having spent four Months in the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without staying at any place. So large is that Empire. That Prince designed to give him audience at <hi>Peking,</hi> a City farther distant. The Embassadour followed. But now appear the effects of trading avarice, for whilst he travelled, <hi>Simon de Andrade</hi> behaved himself after such a manner in the Island <hi>Tamou,</hi> that an account of his bad proceedings was sent after <hi>Thomas Perez.</hi> The Embassadour set out, but the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reached the King first, and was fully credited. He and his Companions were condemned to death as Spies. The rigour of the Sentence was mitigated, but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy not received, and they sent back Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to <hi>Quantung,</hi> with order, that in case the <hi>Portugueses</hi> would restore <hi>Malaca</hi> to its King, who was a subject to <hi>China,</hi> they they might be restored and heard, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise these should be punished, and none ever admitted, but treated as Enemies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Simon de Andrade</hi> was proud and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, and thought by high Hand to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize his unjust dealing. To this end, as if he had been King of that Island, he raised a Fort, and set up a Gallows to terrify the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54711:426"/>
People. He committed violence upon the Merchants who resorted thither, contrary to their Privileges, and bought young People of both Sexes without the usual precautions, giving occasion to Thieves to steal them from their Parents. These extravagancies which lost nothing by the carriage, were heard by the King before <hi>Thomas Perez,</hi> and had the effect above related. At this time arrived there <hi>Iames Calva</hi> with one Ship from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and others from <hi>Malaca.</hi> The <hi>Portugueses</hi> agree in acting more insolently, which wholly exasperated the Governours of <hi>Quantung,</hi> who to punish them, secured some, and contrived to take the Ship arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved last. They began to act when <hi>Duarte Coello</hi> arrived with two Vessels from <hi>Malaca,</hi> well manned and provided. The <hi>Itao</hi> or Admiral of that Sea, attacked them with fifty Sail, did some, and received greater damage from our Artillery, was forced to retire, and lying off, kept them besieged. Forty Days he had kept them in, when <hi>Ambrose del Rego</hi> came with two Ships more from <hi>Malaca,</hi> and it was resolved to force their way through <hi>Itaos</hi>'s Fleet, and get out of the Island. The Fight was bloody, but a Storm rising dispersed the Enemies Fleet and left ours in safety. The <hi>Itao</hi> revenged this Disaster upon some of our People that arrived there, and upon the Embassadour, <hi>Thomas Perez</hi> and his Companions who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to <hi>Quantung</hi> were all slain and robbed of the Present sent to that King, and what <hi>Perez</hi> had gained. We will not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54711:427"/>
pass it in silence to show how great was the return of this Trade, for this Man being of base Parentage, and by Trade an <hi>Apothecary</hi> (though chosen for Embassadour for his good Parts) yet at this time there was found with him 2000 weight of <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> 1600 pieces of Damask, 400 of other Silks, above 100 ounces of Gold, and 2000 of Silver, three quarters of a hundred of loose Musk, and above 3000 Purses of it, at first called <hi>Papos,</hi> and much other Merchandise.</p>

He had already sent a considerable Force with some Assistance of <hi>Portugueses</hi> to reduce him, but to no effect. He now resolved to do it effectually, and treated about it with <hi>Iames Lopez de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queyra,</hi> who to secure our tribute, consented to assist him against his Enemy. The King of <hi>Ormuz</hi> set out 200 Vessels with 3000 <hi>Arabs</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> The <hi>Portugues</hi> party consisted of seven Ships and 400 Men, commanded by <hi>Anthony Corea.</hi> All our Ships arrived at <hi>Baharem, Raez Xaraso</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Ormuzians,</hi> some whereof came not up. <hi>Mocrin</hi> was well prepared to receive them with 300 <hi>Arabian</hi> Horse, 400 <hi>Persian</hi> Archers, 20 <hi>Turkish</hi> Musquetiers besides Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and above 11000 armed with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Weapons, strong Intrenchments and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Works, the Wall well furnished with

the Fight was hot, the King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging his Men at the Head of them, till Weariness and Heat obliged both parties to take breadth. Being recovered, they return to the Attack, and the King being shot through the Thigh, whereof six days after he died, his Men fainted, and great numbers being killed, and wounded, they left us a complete Victory. <hi>Raez Xarafo</hi> from his Vessel looked on all the time. But after knowing the dead Body of the King was carried over to be buried at <hi>Lasah,</hi> he obtained leave to go take it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving performed it, cut off the Head which was carried to <hi>Ormuz.</hi> We had many wounded, seven killed, and the Island in two hours was restored to our Homager. For this reason <hi>Antony Correa</hi> had the Title of <hi>Baharem</hi> added to his Name, and the Head of a King to his Arms, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in his posterity.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whilst our Arms were exercised at <hi>Baharem,</hi> they were not idle in <hi>India.</hi> They assisted the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Cochin</hi> against him of <hi>Calicut,</hi> who braved it with two hundred thousand Men, the other having but forty thousand. The <hi>Portugues</hi> Aid being but forty Men, thirty of them Musquetiers yet so terrified the Enemy, that they retired, <hi>Iames Fernandez de Beja,</hi> who was left by the Governor before <hi>Diu,</hi> now came to him to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> ill treated by the Vessels of <hi>Melique Az,</hi> whose double dealing was now visible. <hi>Iames Lopez</hi> thought to mitigate the Grief of this Accident, by another more

grateful, and brought new Trouble upon himself at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> thinking to prevent the Frauds of that Custom-House. To this effect he placed <hi>Portugues</hi> Officers in it, which so exasperated the Natives, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that thev endeavoured to shake off our Yoke, as shall appear in its proper place.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Now <hi>Iames Lopez</hi> designed to reassume the Business against <hi>Diu,</hi> and therefore sent before <hi>Iames Fernandez de Beja,</hi> with four Galeons, to hinder any Ships entring that Port, he executed it effectually, and took some. But <hi>Melique Az</hi> his Vessels coming out with much Cannon and better Fortune, they sunk one of our Ships, and did much damage in the others, till the Wind, which had failed, favouring, they were obliged to retire. With like Fortune <hi>Iames Lopez</hi> drew near for having taken a Ship by the way, and divided the <hi>Moors</hi> were in her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his, those who were allotted to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony Correa,</hi> set fire to the Powder, which blew the Poop into the Air, and sunk the Vessel, so miserably ended that brave Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain who had triumphed over King <hi>Mocrin.</hi> These Misfortunes obliged <hi>Iames Lopez</hi> to desist from the Enterprise, and go over to <hi>Chaul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Here he found <hi>Ferdinando Camelo,</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came from the Court of <hi>Nizamaluco,</hi> with leave for us to build a Fort there, for his own ends, and chiefly for the importation of Horses, which at that time was the Trade of <hi>Goa</hi> only. The Work was begun,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54711:429"/>
and <hi>Melique Az</hi> fearing it would lessen the Trade of <hi>Diu,</hi> and encrease our Power, resolved to obstruct it. He appeared in the Sea of <hi>Chaul,</hi> with above fifty Vessels of his own and Confederates, and presently sunk a great Ship in which <hi>Peter de Silva de Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was newly come from <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and for for the space of twenty days did much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in the Ships and Gallies, wherewith <hi>D.

                     <p n="9">9. But it being necessary for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to repair to <hi>Cochin,</hi> because his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor was arrived, and he must prepare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, he set out of <hi>Dabul,</hi> rushing through the Dangers that surrounded the Work. He left his Nephew <hi>Henry de Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> to command the Fort, and <hi>Antony Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> at Sea.</p>

To secure the Entrance of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there was raised opposite to the Work a Bulwark, which was committed to the Care of <hi>Peter vaz Permeo,</hi> with upwards of thirty Men, <hi>Mahamud</hi> sent three hundred by night to surprize this Bulwark, whilst he on the other side gave a Diversion.

This Success daunted our Enemies, and among them <hi>Xeih Mamud</hi> a great Man in the City, who feigning himself our Friend, sought our Ruin, and now sent a Present, and to congratulate for this good Fortune with <hi>Antony Correa.

D. <hi>Duarte de Meneses,.</hi> now Governor of <hi>India,</hi> tho sent the year before <note place="margin">1522.</note> by King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> entered not upon the Government till the twenty second of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> of this year, King <hi>Iohn</hi> III. being on the Throne, whose Father died the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>December</hi> foregoing. He brought with him twelve Ships. Having taken the Government, and sent the Commanders to their Posts, he began to feel the effects of his Predecessors, putting <hi>Portugues</hi> Officers into the Custom-House of <hi>Ormuz.</hi> He received advice the <hi>Moors</hi> had taken Arms, killed some Men, and besieged the Fort. <hi>D.

2. The Cause of <hi>D. Luis</hi> his going to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz</hi> was the Insurrection which was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by the avarice of the <hi>Portugues</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers there. <hi>Iames Lopez</hi> had placed them there against his Will in Obedience to the King's Commands, and at the persuasion of Men who loved Novelties, and said the reason the Tribute of <hi>Ormuz</hi> was not well paid, was, that the Officers cheated the King, to prevent which it was convenient to place <hi>Portugueses</hi> in their stead, To the avarice u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the <hi>Portugueses</hi> was added, the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they offered to the persons and honor of those people, forcing their Daughters, and Wives from them. <hi>D. Garcia Coutino</hi> then commanded that Fort, with whom that King conferred about sending a Present and Embassy to our King to obviate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences that Innovation produced. This Means was prevented, and so it broke out to the great loss of the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> For sudddenly by night they were attacked by Sea and Land with Fire and Sword at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz, Baharem, Mascate, Curiate</hi> and <hi>Soar,</hi> by private Order from the King, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one hundred and twenty of them killed <hi>Ruy Boto</hi> was put to great Torments by the <hi>Moors</hi> in defence of the Faith. At morning some of our Men died, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to relieve others. All things being disposed the best the time would permit, and the Ships secured under the shelter of the Fort, <hi>D. Garcia</hi> sent advice to the Governor. Mean while he was besieged, had two Vessels burnt, and feared Hunger and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54711:431"/>
Thirst. <hi>Tristan Vaz de Vega,</hi> and <hi>Manuel de Sousa</hi> received advice hereof at <hi>Mascate,</hi> and prepared to carry Relief. <hi>Tristan Vaz</hi> arrived first, and made his way to the Fort through one hundred and sixty Sail that lay before it. Two days after appeared <hi>Manuel de Sousa</hi>'s Ship at an anchor two Leagues off. It was dangerous for the Fort to relieve him, and dangerous for all if he was not relieved. <hi>Tristan Vaz</hi> with his Ship ventured to his Aid through the hundred and sixty Sail of Enemies; eighty of them pursued him, making way with full Sails, and <hi>Manuel de Sousa</hi> thinking him an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did some harm, till undeceived. he was taken into the Ship. The King of <hi>Ormuz</hi> in a rage lays a heap of Gold on one side, and a heap of Womens Attire on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one for such as should take <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi> and <hi>Emanuel</hi> Prisoners, the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Some being covetous of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and others fearful of the Disgrace, they manned one hundred and thirty Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and set upon that one, which through Showers of Bullets and Arrows made its way to the Fort, and brought new Life to the besieged with the Relief it had on Board.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The King of <hi>Ormuz</hi> began to despair of shaking off the <hi>Portugues</hi> Yoke, and fearing the punishment of his Revolt, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted one more grievous upon himself than he could have received from those he had offended. He resolved to quit the City, and

go over to the Island <hi>Queixome,</hi> which lies fifteen Leagues in length, close to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Privately he commanded all the Inhabitants to follow him, and then barbarously set fire to that beautiful City, which was four Days and Nights burning. And yet some Gentlemen from our Fort held intelligence with the King, advising how he should behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the next Governour to be restored, and this they did in hopes to be inriched by him. Our Men, tho astonished at this bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Action were delivered from the danger of the Siege, and going out to see if any thing were left in the City, only found Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Cisterns, and Fire in all the Houses.

of twenty thousand Xeraphins, and the Arrears due, that the <hi>Portugues</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders should not meddle with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his City, and to conclude all that King sent <hi>D. Luis</hi> a Present of Pearls, Gold, Jewels and Silks for our King, and another for himself, which he accepted not but to be sent with the other, as was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly done. Then <hi>D. Luis</hi> dispatched three Ships for <hi>Goa,</hi> which were to take lading there for <hi>Portugal.</hi> One of them perished in a violent storm on the Coast of <hi>Mascate. D.

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6.

In the middle was a Chappel entire, of indifferent Structure, on the inside and outside whereof were carved many Crosses, like to the antient ones of the military Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Alcantara,</hi> which is Fleury Fitched.

Going deeper they found a Hollow in which it was reported the Saint lay. Here they found between two Stones a Body and the two ends of a Lance, the But and Spear. These were believed to be the Bones of the Apostle, because those of the King and Disciple also found were not so white. They were put into a <hi>China</hi> Chest, and the others into another, and hid in the Altar. Inquiry being made, it appeared by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Records of the Kingdom, that it was above fifteen hundred years since the Saint came to that City called <hi>Meliapor,</hi> then in a flourishing Condition, in and about which there was a Tradition there had been three thousand three hundred stately Churches, that it was then twelve Leagues from the Sea, the Ruins being now upon the very Shore. That the Saint had said, When the Sea should reach thither, a People would come from the West, and preach the same Faith he did. That he converted the King and all his Family, dragging out of the Sea a vast piece of Timber, which all the Force of Elephants, and Art of Men could not
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54711:434"/>
move, the King coveting it for his Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the Apostle for the Church. That a <hi>Bramen</hi> chief Priest to the King, envious of his Miracles, had killed his own Son, and accused the Saint of the Murder, but he restoring the Child to life caused him to say who was the Murderer. An <hi>Armenian</hi> Bishop who had spent twenty years in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting the Christians of the inland of <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi> swore he found what follows in their Writings, That the twelve Apostles being dispersed through the World, <hi>Thomas, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew,</hi> and <hi>Iudas Thaddeus</hi> came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Babilon,</hi> and there parted. That the last preached in <hi>Arabia,</hi> since possessed by the <hi>Moors,</hi> the other in <hi>Persia,</hi> and was buried in a Convent of <hi>Armenian,</hi> religious Men near the City <hi>Tabris;</hi> and the first em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barquing at <hi>Baçora,</hi> on the Banks of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> crossed the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulph, preached at <hi>Zocotora,</hi> came to <hi>Meliapor,</hi> passed to <hi>China,</hi> where he built Churches, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Meliapor,</hi> where having done what is said, he at last suffered Martyrdom through the malice of the <hi>Bramens,</hi> who, to execute their Design, counterfeited a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel whilst he was preaching, to find an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of stoning him, and was at last by one of them run through with a Lance, and buryed by his Disciples in that Church of his own Building. Another Learned Man, a Native of <hi>Coulam</hi> affirmed, That there and at <hi>Cranganor</hi> were two Houses built by the Disciples of <hi>Thomas,</hi> who were buried in them, and that in that of <hi>Coulam</hi>
                        <pb n="272" facs="tcp:54711:435"/>
was the burying place of <hi>Sibila, Indica,</hi> by whose advice King <hi>Perimal</hi> of <hi>Ceylon</hi> went to the Coast of <hi>Mascate,</hi> to meet the other two Kings that were going to adore Christ, newly born at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> That the same King at the Intreaty of the Sibil, brought her the Picture of the Blessed Virgin which was kept in the same Tomb. This was the Invention of the Relicts of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Messenger in <hi>India.</hi> And gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to build the City, at this time called S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> a <hi>Portugues</hi> Colony in the Port of <hi>Paleacate,</hi> seven Leagues from the Ruins of the most ancient <hi>Meliapor.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>ANtony de Miranda de Azevedo</hi> was this year Commander of the Fort of <hi>Pacem,</hi> in the Island <hi>Sumatra.</hi> On the Western Coast of this Island are six <hi>Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Kingdoms. The chief was that of <hi>Pedir,</hi> to which were subject those of <hi>Achem</hi> and <hi>Daga.</hi> But falling to War, that of <hi>Achem</hi> gained the Superiority. He of <hi>Pedir</hi> took the protection of our Fort against his ill

Fortune. <hi>D. Andres Enriquez</hi> then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, sent to that Post from <hi>Portugal</hi> with <hi>D. Duarte de Meneses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Tyrant of <hi>Achem</hi> scoured the Sea and Land with a great Power, till coming to the City <hi>Pedir,</hi> he endeavoured to draw to his snare the King who had taken the <hi>Portugues</hi> Protection. To compass his Design, he prevailed with the Men of that City to write a Letter to the King, telling him he might safely come thither, his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being already expelled, and that he might easily destroy him with the assistance of the <hi>Portuguses.</hi> He gave credit to the letter, desired the assistance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, who gave him eighty <hi>Portugueses</hi> and two hundred <hi>Moors,</hi> commanded by his Brother <hi>D. Emanuel</hi> in small Vessels of Oars. The King marched along the Shore with above a thousand armed Elephants. He was received at <hi>Pedir</hi> with feigned Joy, and a Design to take him Prisoner that night, which was deferred to secure the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> The King being informed of the danger, next day fled with two Elephants and some Men. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> were left on the Shore exposed to the Enemies Darts and Arrows. <hi>D. Emanuel</hi> and thirty five of them were killed, the rest fled. With this loss <hi>D. Andres</hi> lost also the hopes of maintaining the Fort. He asked Provisions of <hi>Raphael Perestello,</hi> who was at <hi>Charigam,</hi> the chief Port of <hi>Bengala. Dominick Seixas</hi> was immediately sent with a Ship, who was stopped by thirty <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who were turned Pirates in that
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54711:436"/>
Sea, commanded by <hi>Games Iago. Seixas</hi> landed at <hi>Tenacari</hi> to get Provisions, and one <hi>Brito</hi> making himself Captain of the Pyrats <hi>(Gago</hi> being dead) and flying with a Vessel that was laden in the Port, left <hi>Seixas</hi> and seventeen <hi>Portugueses</hi> ashore, who were afterwards Slaves in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> Such is the Fate of those who trust them that have violated all human and divine Laws.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>D. Andres</hi> advertised the Governor of the Condition he was in, desiring a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor to command the Fort, <hi>Lope de Azeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> was sent, to whom he would not deliver the Post through Covetousness of acquiring more, having already gained much there <hi>Azevedo</hi> returned to <hi>India.</hi> The King of <hi>Achem</hi> over-runs all that Country with Fire and Sword, enters the City <hi>Pacem</hi> with fifteen thousand Men, and summons <hi>D. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres</hi> to quit the Fort. He after sustaining three Assaults to save the Riches he had there, withdraws, leaving the Command to his Brother-in law <hi>Ayres Coello,</hi> who cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously took upon him this danger he saw the other shun. But the Sea forced back <hi>D. Andres</hi> to the danger he avoided.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>D. Andres</hi> sailing for <hi>India,</hi> met <hi>Sebastian de Sousa,</hi> and <hi>Martin Correa,</hi> with two Ships bound for the Island <hi>Banda</hi> to load Spices. <hi>Sousa</hi> came from <hi>Madagascar,</hi> whither he was sent by King <hi>Emanuel</hi> to build a Fort in Port <hi>Matatane,</hi> which was not executed, because the Ship wherein were the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for the Work was cast away. These
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54711:436"/>
two Captains hearing by <hi>D. Andres</hi> the Condition of <hi>Pacem,</hi> went directly to that Port. <hi>Ayres Coello</hi> had then stood a furious Assault with loss of a Post. The Enemy seeing this Relief, abated of their heat; and <hi>D. Andres</hi> after eight days resisting was forced back by the Weather. Above eight thousand Enemies one night encompassed the Fort, in which were three hundred and fifty <hi>Portugueses,</hi> some sick, some wounded, and all spent with labour and watching. With great silence they applied above seven hundred scaling Ladders, and mounted with great Shouts. The Dispute was hotly maintained on both sides, till some Ships being fired, gave light to each other, and to level our Cannon, which killed many of the Enemy and two Elephants. The morning discovered two thousand Men slain about the Fort, on our side only one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man killed by an Arrow in her Chamber. The remaining six thousand retired, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half their scaling Ladders and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works. Nevertheless the Difficulties of maintaining the place considered, it was resolved in counsel to abandon the Fort, shipping all the Men and Goods, and then giving fire to the rest. The great Cannon were left full of Powder, that when the Fire reached them they might burst. Most of the Fort was destroyed, but the Enemy coming in saved some Cannon, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards did us great harm. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> lost some Goods in shipping, and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued up to the Necks in Water with the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54711:437"/>
Fright, losing more Reputation by this Action than they had gained by the former. This they were more sensible of when they met at Sea a more powerful Relief sent by our Friend the King of <hi>Aru,</hi> who marched by Land with four thousand Men; and <hi>Lope de Azevedo,</hi> from whom <hi>D. Andres</hi> ill deserved it, embarqued at <hi>Malaca</hi> with Ammunition to come to his Succour. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian Sousa</hi> prosecuted his Voyage to <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and the Tyrant <hi>Achem</hi> followed the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which had raised him above his own Hopes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. At this time <hi>Martin Alfonso de Melo Coutino</hi> was gone for <hi>China,</hi> not knowing what had been done by the <hi>Portugueses</hi> at <hi>Quantung.</hi> He had four Ships, and two joined them by the way. They sent ashore for fresh Water, and returned with Blood, the <hi>Chineses</hi> being in Arms to receive them. This drew them to a Battel, in which most of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> perished, some drowned, some torn by the Cannon, and some taken, part whereof died miserably in the Prison at <hi>Quantung,</hi> and twenty three were cut in peices as Spies and Robbers, the last part of the Accusation being the truest. <hi>Martin Alphonso</hi> and <hi>Duarte Coello</hi> returned to <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. All things cannot be exactly related in order as they happened. <hi>Malaca</hi> was streightned by the King of <hi>Bintam,</hi> who sent a greater power against it, and <hi>George de Albuquerque</hi> what he could against him under the Command of <hi>D. Sancho Enriquez,</hi> whilst they prepared for a Sea-Fight there
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54711:437"/>
arose a violent storm which destroyed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty <hi>Portugueses,</hi> the whole being two hundred, the Remainder escaped. Let us see how Misfortunes when once they break out overflow.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Till now the King of <hi>Pam</hi> had been a Friend to our good Fortune, but at present seeing she favoured him he turned against us. <hi>George de Albuquerque</hi> (ignorant of this change) sent three Ships to his Port for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, where two of the Captains and his thirty Men were killed, the third flying this danger met it at <hi>Iava,</hi> he and all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany perishing there. <hi>Simon de Abreu</hi> and Crew were killed in another Action, and in another <hi>D. Garcia Enriquez</hi> sent to hinder Provisions coming to <hi>Bintam,</hi> lost two Vessels.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. At <hi>Surubaya</hi> in <hi>Iava</hi> ten or twelve <hi>Portugueses</hi> were killed. <hi>Sebastian Sousa</hi> and <hi>Martin Correa</hi> found <hi>Alfonso de Melo Iusarte</hi> in great danger at <hi>Banda,</hi> having offended the Inhabitants of <hi>Cantor</hi> through Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Such was the posture of Affairs at the <hi>Malucos,</hi> whilst these thing happened. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony de Brito</hi> had put the Fort into a very good Condition, when two Bastard Sons of the late King of <hi>Ternate</hi> disagreeing, and the King of <hi>Tidore</hi> seeking revenge because the <hi>Portugueses</hi> had not built in his Island; he agrees with his Daughter the Queen Dowager of <hi>Ternate</hi> to carry on his Design, at the same time that she had consented to make war upon him. But all the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance was discovered, the young King and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54711:438"/>
his Brothers brought to the Fort, and the Queen fled to the mountain. The War began, and <hi>Tidore</hi> was besieged. There <hi>George Pinto</hi> was killed with six <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and forty Seamen.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Siege continuing, some places were assaulted. At <hi>Mariaco</hi> was a Fort on a high Ground well ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other places being taken, the King of <hi>Tidore</hi> begged peace, which was not granted him. But because there now comes a Successor to <hi>D.

                     <p n="1">1. NOW the manner of receiving and delivering up the Government seems to be settled, it will not be amiss with our usual Brevity to give some account of it. At first the Wisdom and Experience of the person to be chose, were considered as well as his Birth. Afterwards the Birth was thought a sufficient Qualification. Gentility among <hi>Portugueses</hi> being of more account than Virtue and Merit, which has been the ruin of our first acquired Reputation The Viceroy or Governor (for the Office is the same, tho the Title differ) solemnly swears, That he made no Interest to procure that Employ (how needless the Question, and false the Oath) that he will do Justice and follow his Instructions, that in bestowing Employments he will not have more regard to his Kindred and Servants, than to the Kings and such as deserve, that he will take no Bribes.

The Viceroy, tho sick, had great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Designs in hand, but Death drawing on, he named <hi>Lope Vaz de Sampayo</hi> his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, till such time as <hi>D.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54711:440"/>
and hasty in execution of Justice. In fine, fit for all that was intrusted him, as Captain, as discoverer, and as Viceroy. He was the sixth in the number of Governors, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Viceroys.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Lope Vaz de Sampayo,</hi> sent <hi>Francis de Sa</hi> to carry the News of his access to the Government to <hi>D.

They met thirty eight Vessels laden with Spice, under the Command of <hi>Cutiale,</hi> took four, and forced the rest ashore.

At <hi>Cananor</hi> he hanged a <hi>Moor</hi> of Quality, which occasioned many of his Relations for shame to leave the City, and go live upon robbing along the the River. By the King's Consent <hi>D. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique</hi> sent <hi>Hector de Silveyra</hi> against them with two Gallies and a Brigantine; in two days he burnt four Towns with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,

and took their Cannon. <hi>Christopher de Brito</hi> set out with fourteen Gallies, and about one hundred Men. They scoured the Sea, destroyed some <hi>Moors,</hi> and at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bul</hi> came out to them two Galiots, and seven other Vessels with above three hundred Men. At the first shock they killed our Commander, <hi>Christopher de Brito;</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge whom, our Men falling on furiously, in four hours time killed most of them, and took the rest and their Captain in Chief, who afterwards died of his Wounds at <hi>Goa,</hi> being first converted to the Faith. The Commander of <hi>Calicut</hi> being streightened by a great number of <hi>Nayres</hi> and other people that frequented that City, forced them to retire with only fifty <hi>Portugueses. D.

Luis de Meneses</hi> were there, and dissatisfied with what <hi>D Vasco de Gama</hi> had done in their Business, and he had no mind to undo what the Viceroy had done to oblige his Cousins. He sent a Message before, that they should not receive him with any publick Joy, in respect to the death of <hi>Gama;</hi> this being the only Successor till then that shewed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to his Predecessor. Another part of his Message was, that they should not give him the style of Lordship, because good Men had rather deserve Honor, than make use of its Titles.

Soon after he set out from <hi>Cochin</hi> with fifty Sail, besides some belonging to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Town, and <hi>Arel de Porca,</hi> a Subject to our King with twenty seven, making fifty more, and two thousand fighting Men, thus he arrived at <hi>Panane.</hi> This is one of the principal Towns subject to <hi>Calicut,</hi> seated on the Banks of the same River. It was well fortified and stored with Cannon, commanded by a <hi>Portugues</hi> Renegado. In the River were many Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels in order of Battel. The Fight began fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously by Sea and Land, the Fortifications were entred, the Cannon taken, and the Enemy fled to the Woods. The Town and Vessels in the Port were burnt, many kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of our Men nine. Next day twelve Ships were burnt in the Port of <hi>Calicut,</hi> and <hi>D. Iohn de Lima</hi> did the same in the Skirts of the City. Hence they went to <hi>Coulete,</hi> where was the same Fortification, number of Ships, and Artillery as at <hi>Panane,</hi> and twenty thousand Men in Garrison.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A Council of War being held, it was generally voted to desist from so dangerous an Enterprize, but <hi>D. Enrique</hi> prevailed for going on. <hi>D. Simon de Meneses</hi> was to command one Attack with 300 Men, <hi>D. Enrique</hi> another with one hundred and fifty, and the Fleet to engage one hundred and fifty Ships that were there. Great Valour was shewn on both sides; at last many of the Enemy being slain, the rest fled; of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> fifty four were killed, and many wounded. The Booty contained
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54711:441"/>
three hundred and sixty pieces of Cannon, a vast number of Musquets, fifty three Ships, most of them loaden with Spice; the rest being shattered were burnt, as was the Town. <hi>D. Enrique</hi> returned to <hi>Cochin,</hi> leaving <hi>D. Simon</hi> with twenty Sail, and five hundred Men to cruise upon that Coast.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. During the time that <hi>Lope Vaz de Sampayo</hi> held the Government by reason of the Viceroys Death, and Absence of <hi>D. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi> he sent <hi>Antony de Miranda</hi> with four Vessels, and three hundred and fifty Men to the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> He was come now to Cape <hi>Guardafu,</hi> where arrived before him <hi>Antony de Macedo,</hi> with a Galeon, and two Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, tho sent later. They had taken the Vessel of those mutinous <hi>Portugueses</hi> who had killed their Captain, and now practised Pyracy by this Crime to shun the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the former. One <hi>N. de Aguiar</hi> commanded them who was beheaded at <hi>Cochin,</hi> and the rest impaled or banished ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they were found guilty. The two <hi>Antonies</hi> agreed to spread themselves cross the Mouth of that Sea, that so no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy-Ship might escape them. This Mouth reaching from Cape <hi>Guardafu</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> to Cape <hi>Fartaque</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> is fifty Leagues over. Here they took ten <hi>Zambucos</hi> and three Ships. Thence they went to the City <hi>Xael,</hi> and burnt many <hi>Moors</hi> in seven Ships, and took five. Mean while <hi>D. Simon de Meneses,</hi> assisted by <hi>Fernan Gomez,</hi> burnt the Town of <hi>Mangalor,</hi> and ten Ships in the Harbour. They scoured the Coast, had some Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54711:442"/>
one with seventy <hi>Paraos,</hi> whereof they took twenty, the rest being shattered and dispersed. Another time the <hi>Moors</hi> killed <hi>Gomez Martinez de Lemos,</hi> who going to assist <hi>Dominick Fernandez,</hi> struck upon a Bank, where died also <hi>Manuel de Lima,</hi> with seven Gentlemen, and all the Boats Crew.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Now the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> resolved to besiege that Fort in which <hi>D. Iohn de Lima</hi> commanded with three hundred Men. Twelve thousand Men broke ground to draw a deep Trench about. <hi>D. Iohn</hi> did all that was possible to hinder the Work, but the multitude prevailed and finished it. Then they planted many pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, some so large the Ball was two spans diameter. The Work being finished, <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mori</hi> came on with nine thousand Men. This Power was enough to terrifie any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution; yet <hi>D. Iohn</hi> was not moved, but ventured to make a Sally, which had like to have cost him his life, so he resolved to stand firm against all their Assaults.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Battery began furiously at break of day on the thirteenth of <hi>Iune.</hi> Our Cannon was more dexterously played, and did great harm, but it appeared not so much in the multitude. Next day advice was sent to the Governor, who immediately sent to their Relief two Caravels, with one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Men, commanded by <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Iusarte</hi> and <hi>Duarte Fonseca.</hi> The former arrived first, and there was a sharp dispute by Sea and Land about their entering the Fort, in which three Gentlemen were
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54711:442"/>
killed. The Enemy immediately applyed scaling Ladders, but were repulsed with great slaughter. <hi>D. Iohn</hi> sent <hi>Duarte de Fonseca</hi> back to <hi>Cochin</hi> to demand more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, five hundred Men were sent him. Whilst they sailed, all the military Arts then in use were practised against the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged, and above fifty of them killed.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. This Relief could not reach <hi>Calicut,</hi> but was forced back to <hi>Cochin.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor joined two Squadrons he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and they both appeared to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Fort, when Rage and Despair act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more in its Defence than Valour or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. <hi>Hector de Silveyra</hi> commanded one of the Squadrons containing seven Ships, and <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> the other of twenty five, and three hundred and thirty Men. They encouraged our Men, and did harm to the Enemy from the Water, because they could not land till the Governour arrived with twenty Sail, and 1500 Men, besides some <hi>Catures</hi> or small Craft; and <hi>Antony de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa</hi> coming at the same time, all the Sea of <hi>Calicut</hi> was covered with Ships. A Council was held about landing, all the Votes were in the negative. <hi>D. Enrique</hi> spent four days in considering what to do, then came to this Resolution.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. One night he put one hundred and fifty Men into the Fort under the valiant <hi>Hector de Silveyra,</hi> and the next as many more under <hi>D. Iames de Lima.</hi> By break of day he landed, clearing the Shore of throngs of Enemies with Sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> Granados,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:54711:443"/>
and all sorts of Weapons. In some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments they burnt two hundred, in others three hundred <hi>Moors.</hi> Many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men particularly signalized themselves upon this Occasion. <hi>Hector de Silveyra</hi> did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>D. George de Meneses</hi> with a two handed Sword made great slaughter, till lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Right Hand, he took a less Sword in the Left, and went on without losing the Cutlace. But who can recount the Actions of this day. In fine, three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of the Enemy were killed, of ours thirty, none of Note. <hi>D. Enrique</hi> remained Master of the Field, and pitched his Tents to give there the necessary Orders. <hi>Zamori</hi> sent to desire peace, the Treaty held four days, and broke up without any effect. The Fort was demolished (as King <hi>Iohn</hi> had commanded) because it was of no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Having shipped all that was in it of Value with great care and privacy, they laid Trains to blow it up, and all drew off to the Ships. The <hi>Moors</hi> finding the Coast clear, and no Body in the Fort, run in Clusters to pillage; but the Powder suddenly taking fire, blew up the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick with great slaughter of them. This shews how much must be ventured rather than hazard Reputation; since all this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Prepararation served only to raze that Fort, because it should not be thought it was rather Fear than Conveniency forced us to quit it.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Concludes the Government of <hi>D. Enrique de Meneses</hi> in the Year 1526, King <hi>John</hi> the Third Reigning.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Fort of <hi>Calicut</hi> being demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> left with his Ships to scour the Coast of <hi>Malabar,</hi> the Governor went to <hi>Cochin,</hi> to dispatch the homeward bound trading Ships, which were five, and whereof two were lost: two also of sour that came this year from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> perished. After this Expedition <hi>D. Enrique</hi> designed to fall upon <hi>Diu.</hi> He sent out <hi>Hector de Silveyra</hi> upon other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> with instructions that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things failing, he should enter the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and take up at <hi>Arquico, D. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigo de Lima,</hi> who by that time was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Embassy to <hi>Prester Iohn.</hi> On the Coast of <hi>Arabia</hi> he assaulted and took the strong City <hi>Dofar,</hi> which he destroyed with the loss of two Men. Then he entered the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and reduced the Islands <hi>Maçua</hi> and <hi>Dalaca,</hi> to pay Tribute. Thence sailed to <hi>Arquico</hi> where the Governor delivered to him <hi>D. Rodrigo de Lima,</hi> who was there waiting for a passage with an Embassador
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:54711:444"/>
sent by <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> to <hi>Portugal.</hi> They went to rest at <hi>Ormuz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Peter Mascarenas,</hi> who the foregoing year went to succeed <hi>George de Albuquerque</hi> in the Command of <hi>Malaca,</hi> found it in some distress, after performing honorable Actions. <hi>Martin Alfonso de Sousa</hi> scouring that Coast with six Ships and two hundred Men had done great execution among the Natives. After returning to <hi>Malaca</hi> he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain went out to meet <hi>Lacxemena,</hi> who ravaged the Neighbourhood with thirteen hundred <hi>Moors,</hi> after a bloody Fight they were defeated, and <hi>Martin</hi> being mortally wounded, died in the City. The King of <hi>Linga</hi> our Ally had asked relief of <hi>George Albuquerque,</hi> against the King of <hi>Bintam,</hi> by whom he was besieged. Eighty Men were sent, who falling upon the Besiegers killed six hundred, the rest fled. This Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory cost but one Man.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Here <hi>Peter Mascarenas</hi> heard of a Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado <hi>Portugues,</hi> who commanding three thousand Men of the King of <hi>Bintam,</hi> had done much harm to the City, in which there were but a hundred, yet obliged him to retire with shame. Two hundred and fifty solemnly vowed to carry the Head of <hi>George de Albuquerque,</hi> or that of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Garcia Chaino,</hi> to the King of <hi>Bintam</hi> (all Vows are easier to make than perform) they lay in ambush in a close Wood, six <hi>Portugueses,</hi> whereof one was <hi>Francis Correa,</hi> fell into it. He seeing no possibility of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaping, encouraged the other five, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54711:444"/>
falling desperately upon the two hundred and fifty killed fourteen, the others fled. One of the six died.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Antony de Brito</hi> at <hi>Maluco,</hi> seeing he was not relieved, desired (the last year) a Successor might be sent him, <hi>D. Garcia Enriquez</hi> who then commanded the Cruisers upon the Coast of <hi>Malaca</hi> went thither.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He arrived at <hi>Ternate,</hi> where some Differences arose between him and <hi>Brito.</hi> They agreed among themselves, and by consent sent a <hi>Portugues</hi> with a small Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to discover the Islands called <hi>Celebes,</hi> where they heard was great plenty of Gold. The Discoverer found the Islands, but not the Gold; and being upon his return, was carried away by a storm to the Eastward, till he lost his Account, and unexpectedly fell into a great and beautiful Island. The Inhabitants most simple, and treated them with great affection. Of Colour more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to white, of Body strong and comly, lank Hair, and long Beards, their Cloaths of very fine Mats; their Food, Roots, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos and Figs. Their Language was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, but they dealt by signs. By tokens they gave to understand that in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there was Gold, whereof they made no use; they had no knowledge of Iron, or any other Metal. They left this Island, which they called of <hi>Iames Lopez de Sequey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> the Name of the Pilot, and returned to <hi>Ternate</hi> after eight months, whence <hi>Antony de Brito</hi> was then departed, leaving <hi>D. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> the Command of the Fort.</p>

                        <pb n="292" facs="tcp:54711:445"/>
6. <hi>Peter Mascarenas</hi> at <hi>Malaca</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much had been done by his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors in defence of that place, and that it was no less insupportable than dangerous, to suffer the King of <hi>Bintam</hi> to lie safe in his Works, and continue his hopes proposed to deprive him of both. He immediately began to put in execution his Designs, tho they proved unsuccessful.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>George de Albuquerque</hi> sailing from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca</hi> towards <hi>Cochin,</hi> with only one Vessel, met <hi>Arel de Porca</hi> with twenty five Barques of <hi>Calicut,</hi> who was seeking Revenge, for that <hi>D. Enrique</hi> had treated him as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for his Cowardliness at the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Assault of <hi>Coulete.</hi> The Case was that <hi>D. Enrique</hi> at that Engagement perceiving him stand only as a Looker on, watching the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of sharing the Plunder, caused a Cannon to be levelled at him so dexterously, that it broke his Leg. Now he sought Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and drew on himself farther pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, for <hi>Albuquerque</hi> not able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the twenty five Barques, to lose no time of playing his Cannon, levelled among them all, they answered with Showers of Ball and Arrows. But our Artillery was so well managed, that <hi>Arel</hi> was forced to retire with considerable loss, having done no other damage to <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> than the killing one of his Slaves.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Governor <hi>D. Enrique</hi> still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his Preparations against <hi>Diu,</hi> giving out they were for <hi>Aden.</hi> In all things he acted the part of a wise Captain.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="293" facs="tcp:54711:445"/>
9. He set out with seventeen Sail of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts all large, with a resolution to clear that Coast of Pyrats, that always abound there. At <hi>Chale</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Calicut</hi> he set ashore <hi>D. George de Meneses</hi> with five hundred Men, who reduced the Town to Ashes. At <hi>Bacanor</hi> he found <hi>D. George Telo</hi> and <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> entering that River<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> in which they shut up above one hundred <hi>Paraos,</hi> bound for <hi>Cambaya,</hi> laden with Spice. He sent to their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <hi>D. George de Meneses,</hi> with four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men in two Ships. The <hi>Moors</hi> by Land and Sea were four thousand strong. <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> was left to keep the Mouth of the River, the other went up to the <hi>Paraos,</hi> and saw the Shore covered with Men and Cannon. At length they engaged, the Fight was bravely maintained, but the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, the disadvantage of the place, and ill Fortune, obliged our Captains to retire, after losing forty Men. Victory cannot be always tied to one side, and it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that in so many Encounters our Party should scarce ever be worsted, never quite defeated.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. This was not the greatest Loss then happened to the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> for at this time <hi>D. Enrique</hi> fell sick of an Inflammation in two Issues he had upon one Leg, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death came on, he gave the necessary Orders, and expired with that Calmness he had practised living. This happened at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanor,</hi> (where he is buried) about the end of <hi>Ianuary</hi> in the thirtieth year of his Age.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54711:446"/>
He was Son to <hi>D. Ferdinand de Meneses,</hi> called the <hi>Red,</hi> of a pleasing Countenance, a large Stature, an awful Presence, of a free Mind, his Actions just, free from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, continent, a true Patron of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Professor of Honor. It may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how free from Avarice in that after his Death all his Treasure was but thirteen Royals and a half, not a Crown in all; not but that he had an Estate before, but spent it during his Government on such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served well. He accepted not one Jewel of all that those Eastern Princes presented him. Let us give one Example of his ready Wit, which will shew the Beauty of his Person. A Gentleman whose person was contemptible, but had served well, and was dissatisfied with the Governor, one day talking with others, lashed out and said, <hi>I am as good a Gentleman as any in</hi> India, <hi>and better than some, as much a Soldier as the best, I have served the King as well as any man; and in fine, I fear no man, nor yield to no man.</hi> The Governor finding all this passion aimed at him, to shew he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it, and was not disturbed, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered very calmly: <hi>Sir, I confess you are a better Gentleman than I, and more a Soldier than I, that you have served better, and better deserve to be Governor; but since I yield so many Points, you cannot but grant me one, and that is that you are not so genteel a man as I.</hi> So the Anger was turned into Laughter, and he doubly shamed. The most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Governors hitherto were <hi>D. Francisco
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54711:446"/>
de Almeyda, Alfonso de Albuquerque,</hi> and <hi>D. Enrique.</hi> His Complexion was white, his Beard Chesnut Colour, his Cap, upper Garment, and Breeches, black, slashed with Crimson Lining, the Doublet Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, over it a Coat of Mail, and upon that the Breast plate. He held the Government a year and a month, and was the seventh Governor.</p>

Nevertheless all obeyed,

and three Vessels were provided with one one hundred Men each to land first. <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> followed with a thousand Men in Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels that rowed. <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> was to fire the Enemies <hi>Paraos.</hi> They all at once couragiously undertook the Charge assigned them, and at the same time mounted the Trenches with great Slaughter on the one side, whilst above seventy <hi>Paraos</hi> were fired on the other.

Next he gave the Command of <hi>Goa</hi> to <hi>Antony de Silveyra de Meneses,</hi> and sent <hi>Francis de Sa</hi> to the Island of <hi>Sunda,</hi> whether he had been designed from <hi>Portugal,</hi> giving him four hundred Men in six Ships. <hi>Antony de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa Azevedo</hi> had fourteen to guard the Coast of <hi>India.

In his Passage he reduced the Towns of <hi>Calayate</hi> and <hi>Mascate,</hi> which had revolted, being exasperated by the avarice of <hi>Iames de Melo;</hi> for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the King and publick suffer for the Interest of private Men, a thing <hi>D. Enrique</hi> was so sensible of, that this <hi>Melo</hi> being then Commander at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> he writ to him to be more moderate, and not provoke thirty years to go from <hi>Goa</hi> to teach sixty at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> for those were the Ages of them both. <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> did nothing at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz,</hi> but compose the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Iames de Melo</hi> and <hi>Raez Xarafo,</hi> which had occasioned the Revolt of those two Towns, receive the Tribute of that King, and <hi>Prester Iohn</hi>'s Embassador, who came with <hi>D.

being weary of the Tyranny of that King. <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> was then at <hi>Chaul,</hi> giving Oders for fortifying several places, fearing the <hi>Rumes</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi> were coming with a great Power, whereof he sent advice to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and sailed for <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. At the same time arrived in <hi>India</hi> two Ships of five that set out this year from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the other three came afterwards. These two brought fresh Orders from the King, relating to the Succession in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, wherein <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> was before <hi>Mascarenas,</hi> the former having been the contrary. The Surveyor of the Revenue <hi>Alfonso de Mexia,</hi> to whom they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, desirous to kindle Broils, caused them to be opened, to the great danger of the publick Peace.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The News hereof met <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> on the way, and arriving at <hi>Goa</hi> he was a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time received as Governor, and went thence to <hi>Cochin.</hi> He dispatched the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ships home, and sent in them <hi>Prester Iohn</hi>'s Embassador, who went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he gave entire submission to the Church of Christ, through the means of the <hi>Portugueses;</hi> and having received several Favours from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh, returned to his Prince. These Ships being gone, <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> designed to go to the <hi>Red Sea</hi> against the <hi>Turks,</hi> who (it was said) fortified the Island <hi>Camaran.</hi> Some loose Tongues said it was a policy to strengthen himself at <hi>Cochin,</hi> in order to resist <hi>Masca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renhas,</hi> who came to take upon him the

Government. Others said he really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to go to deprive <hi>Mascarenas</hi> of all Power, and gain the Affections of the Soldiers by giving them plunder. The certainty is, he studied to secure himself, for to resign a Command voluntarily is a thing not practised since those times.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Raez Solyman</hi> the <hi>Turk,</hi> who killed <hi>Mir Hozem</hi> at <hi>Gidda,</hi> recovered his Princes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by delivering up to him this City he had gained in the Service of the Soldan, and by means of a considerable Present; for Gifts are of force even with Princes, who have no need of them. <hi>Selin,</hi> who was then at <hi>Grand Cayre,</hi> converted his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to Love, because <hi>Solyman</hi> promised him great Advantages in <hi>India,</hi> if he would furnish him with a competent power to act there.

Let us now return to <hi>Peter Mascare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> at <hi>Malaca,</hi> where the News being come of his Succession to the Government, he was immediately proclaimed and obeyed as such.

A storm forced him back to <hi>Malaca,</hi> and he making a Virtue of Necessity complied with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, concluding it was Providence brought him to that City, which he had left in great distress, and taking it as an Omen of the Honor he thought to gain over <hi>Bintam,</hi> whose King entertained no small hopes of recovering <hi>Malaca,</hi> which was wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided <hi>Mascarenhas</hi> disposed the Minds of the few Gentlemen that were there, and prepared to fall upon that King, giving out all was for the Island of <hi>Sunda,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was known <hi>Francis de Sa</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.

                     <p n="10">10. Great Labour was employed in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mouth of the River, when thirty Barques appeared, sent by the King of <hi>Pam</hi> to the Relief of our Enemy. <hi>Duarte Coello</hi> and <hi>Ayres de Cuna</hi> went to meet them, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered some, dispersed others, and took

Being returned to his Post, he considered the City, which was formidable for its Walls and opposite Fort, flanked with Bulwarks, stored with Men and Artillery. He ordered the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Assault, assigning every Man his Post, and diverting the Enemy from the place where he designed the chief Attack.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Our careful and almost rash Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in the dead of night, marched his men through a close Wood and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known way, very difficult for the Roots of Trees that crossed it, and streams of Water that spread the Superficies of the Grounds, yet before day they reached the City. The warlike Instrument sounding on a sudden from all sides, put the <hi>Moors</hi> into a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, at last they resort where they thought was the greatest danger, and that was where <hi>Mascarenas</hi> had posted the <hi>Malayes</hi> to give a diversion, whilst he entered on the other

side. All was full of Confusion, tho the Enemies behaved themselves gallantly. The first that mounted a Bulwark was <hi>Ayres de Cuna.</hi> Then they entred the City, and furiously run through it; <hi>Peter Masca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renas</hi> ran to the King's Palace, where <hi>Laja Raja</hi> who commanded fell upon him, and the Fight was couragiously maintained till they understood the King was not there, for he perceiving the City was entered, mounted on an Elephant, and fled to the Woods and Mountain. This being known, the <hi>Moors</hi> gave way, some were killed, the rest fled. The Garrison consisted of seven thousand, four hundred were slain, two thousand taken. The Town was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the Booty great, and almost three hundred pieces of Cannon, no inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of it. We had not above three killed in this Action, which was one of the most glorious we performed in <hi>Asia,</hi> to the immortal Honor of <hi>Mascarenas,</hi> and Peace of <hi>Malaca.</hi> For the King dying with grief, tho his Son <hi>Alaudin</hi> undertook the same Task, he had no power to annoy us much. The Proprietor of this Island from whom the King had taken it, begged of <hi>Mascarenhas</hi> to be restored to it, which was granted, he owning himself a Subject of <hi>Portugal.</hi> At this instant arrived the King of <hi>Linga,</hi> our All<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54711:451"/>
divided on the South from <hi>Iava</hi> by a very narrow Channel. It produces pale Gold, and abundance of Pepper and Provisions. The Natives are many, unfit for War, but curious in adorning their Arms. They worship Idols, sell their Children to supply any want. The Women are beautiful, those of Quality chaste, contrary to what is usual in most of the other parts of the World. They have Convents into which they enter to preserve their Virginity as in <hi>Spain.</hi> The married Women kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves when their Husbands die; a good Custom to shew their Duty, and to prevent their killing them, were it not against the Law of Nature, and therefore a brutal Error.</p>

Hither came before <hi>Henry Leme</hi> drawn by the Plenty and Goodness of the Pepper it produces, he was well received by the King <hi>Samiam,</hi> who offered a place to build a Fort, and three hundred and fifty one Quintals of Pepper, as a yearly Tribute to purchase the Friendship of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in order to his support against the <hi>Moors</hi> who infested him, and were now much inferior to the <hi>Portugueses</hi> in those parts.

14. Mean while <hi>D. Garcia Enriquez</hi> did something at the <hi>Malucos,</hi> which had been glorious, if just. A War being left on foot by <hi>Antony de Brito</hi> with the King of <hi>Tidore, D. Garcia</hi> made peace with him only to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do what the other had done. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced some difference between <hi>D. Garcia</hi> and <hi>Cachil de Aroez,</hi> who to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self joined now with the King of <hi>Tidore. D. Garcia</hi> fearing this Union might prove dangerous, suddenly fell upon that City, then busied with the Funeral Ceremonies of the dead, and entring it, took away the Cannon, and burnt the rest. Thus the Peace rashly concluded was more rashly broke and the <hi>Portugueses</hi> throughout all those Islands were esteemed Men of no Faith or Reputation, for commonly a whole Nation suffers for the Faults of a few.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Martin Iniguez de Carchisano</hi> arrived at Port <hi>Camafe</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Tidore</hi> with one Ship of six the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. sent the year 1525 to those parts that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to him. The other Ships came before to an Island in three degrees of North Latitude, which they called <hi>S. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> where, on the Trunks of Trees they found Inscriptions denoting it to have been inhabited by <hi>Portugueses</hi> eighty years before. As soon as <hi>D. Garcia</hi> understood the new comers were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to compose the Affair, but to no effect, and perceiving they caused an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the price of Spice, he sent first, then went in person to expel them, but
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54711:452"/>
were all obliged to retire after much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage sustained by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Cannon, yet their Ship, tore by the <hi>Portugues</hi> Shot, afterwards sunk. Our Men had the like success at another Town on the Shore where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were. <hi>D. Garcia</hi> sent <hi>Martin Correa</hi> to <hi>Malaca,</hi> where he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that the Inhabitants of <hi>Lobu,</hi> a Port of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> had slain <hi>Alvaro de Brito</hi> and seventy Men, he carried to revenge the Death of others killed there. As soon as he arrived, <hi>George Cabral</hi> recommended this Business to him, which he performed, reducing the City to Ashes, after putting all the Inhabitants to the Sword, taking all their Cannon, <hi>Brito</hi>'s Galley and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the rest were burnt.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. At this time came to the <hi>Malucos</hi> that renowned Gentleman <hi>D. George de Meneses,</hi> who lost his Hand at the glorious Action of <hi>Calicut,</hi> being the first that went thither by the way of <hi>Borneo,</hi> passing through many Islands, and giving his Name to some of them. The known way being five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leagues, he made it a thousand, and spent eight months in the Voyage, by reason of the Difficulties of that Sea, which is a meer Labyrinth of Islands and Banks of Sand. <hi>D. George</hi> and <hi>D. Garcia</hi> fell present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at variance, because the latter would not return the way the other came, but by <hi>Banda,</hi> which was more easie and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, on the contrary of that by <hi>Borneo.</hi> It seem'd <hi>D. Garcia</hi> sought not the same that <hi>D. George;</hi> and <hi>D. George</hi> in all obeyed
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54711:453"/>
                        <hi>Peter Mascarenas</hi> as Governor of <hi>India.</hi> The Dispute came to words ill becoming such Men, and the words to actions of the same nature. <hi>D. George</hi> puts <hi>D. Garcia</hi> in Irons. And <hi>D. Garcia</hi> being set at liberty, puts <hi>D. George</hi> into them. Being threatened by some he set him loose, and <hi>D. George</hi> being at liberty, sent after him to <hi>Banda,</hi> in case he came thither to make him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and take his Ship. <hi>Vincent de Fonseca</hi> carried the Message. He also sent <hi>Vasco Lorenzo, Iames Cam,</hi> and <hi>Gonzalo Veloso</hi> to <hi>Malaca,</hi> by the way of <hi>Borneo,</hi> and with them a Present for that King. One part of the Present was a Piece of Tapestry with Figures of Men, which the <hi>Barbarian</hi> no sooner beheld, but he cryed out, <hi>They were men inchanted that would kill him in the night.</hi> And no persuasions being of force to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of his Error, ordered the Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry should not remain in his House, nor the Messengers in his Port.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Fonseca</hi> was so diligent, that he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Banda</hi> before <hi>D. Garcia.</hi> They both armed, but <hi>Fonseca</hi> by craft took his Ship, and <hi>D. Garcia</hi> endeavouring to regain it, had two of his Men killed, and was forced to retire. He embarqued in a Vessel laden with Goods for <hi>Malaca,</hi> which was there seized upon, yet restored to him; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at <hi>Cochin</hi> the Vessel sunk, and the Sea swallowed to the value of fifty thousand Crowns he had in her. <hi>D. Garcia</hi> was left ashore with only the Cloaths he wore, and <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> then Governor, imprisoned
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54711:453"/>
and sent him to <hi>Portugal,</hi> to answer what he had done at <hi>Maluco.</hi> This was the end of those violent Courses wherewith he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to enrich himself, and of the rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with which he durst say, <hi>That in spite of Sea and Winds he would reach</hi> Goa.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Whilst <hi>D. Garcia</hi> struggled with his ill Fortune, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Tidore</hi> were at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance who should succeed in the place of their Captain who died. They agreed, and another <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship arrived, commanded by <hi>Alvaro de Saavedra. D. George</hi> modestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them to desist, but to no purpose. <hi>Ferdinando Baldaya</hi> went against them in a Galliot. <hi>Alfonso de los Rios</hi> met him in another Vessel, they fought couragiously, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> remained victorious, having killed our Captain and others. <hi>Saavedra</hi> set sail for <hi>New Spain</hi> to bring assistance to prosecute this Act so well begun, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him some of the Prisoners in the Galliot he had taken. They fled with his Long-boat from certain Islands where he touched, and being afterwards taken at <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> and brought to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they condemned them as Traitors to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror (as if they had owed him any Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance) and hanged <hi>Ferdinando Moreira, Simon de Brito</hi> was dragg'd and beheaded. After this <hi>D. George de Castro</hi> (who acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally came to <hi>Ternate)</hi> by order of <hi>D. George de Meneses</hi> went against the City <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mafo,</hi> and the Inhabitants being fled, burnt it to the ground.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>LOpe Vaz de Sampayo</hi> understanding at <hi>Cochin,</hi> that <hi>Peter de Mascarenas</hi> was <note place="margin">1527.</note> coming from <hi>Malaca</hi> to take upon him the Government, held a Council, where it was resolved not to admit him as Governor. This done, he went away to <hi>Goa,</hi> leaving <hi>Alphonso Mexia</hi> to put in execution what had been resolved. At his departure <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> paid off the Soldiers, who presently concluded, that Action proceeded not from his Bounty, but was to gain their Affections. <hi>Mascarenas</hi> arrived the last day of <hi>February,</hi> and after some difference with <hi>Mexia,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to land unarmed, thinking thereby to disarm the other. On the contrary, as <hi>Mascarenas</hi> landed, he was met by <hi>Mexia,</hi> well armed, and mounted with armed Men, who fell upon <hi>Mascarenas,</hi> run him through the Arm with a Lance, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others of his Company, so that to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void more harm he was forced to return to his Ship.</p>

2. The News of this Exploit being brought to <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> at <hi>Goa,</hi> it so highly pleased him, that as a Reward to the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger he gave him the Command of <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi> taken from <hi>Henry Figuera,</hi> because he had treated <hi>Peter de Mascarenas</hi> with Civility. In this one Action he committed two Crimes, one in rewarding Insolency, the other in depriving Modesty of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Now being informed, that <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carenas</hi> was on the way to <hi>Goa,</hi> he sent out to take and put him in Irons, which was executed by <hi>Antony de Silveyra,</hi> who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him at <hi>Cananor</hi> to <hi>D.

At this time arrived three Ships of five that set out of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and in them <hi>D.

The other two Ships were cast away on the Island <hi>Madagascar. Christopher de Sousa</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <hi>Mascarenas</hi> as Governor, which much enraged <hi>Lope Vaz,</hi> but his anger was not of force to take place.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Antony de Miranda de Azevedo,</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, desiring as well as <hi>Christopher de Sousa</hi> to prevent Distractions, joined with him, the Result of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement was, that <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> was reduced to put the business to arbitration. It was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticled, that the Competiors should stand by the Verdict, that neither should act as Governor in the interim, that all who were imprisoned on this Account should be
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:54711:455"/>
released, that the two who had procured this Accommodation might come freely to <hi>Goa,</hi> without any danger of <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> his anger. He at first opposed this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but liking the Arbitrators, consented, adding some Conditions, the chief about <hi>Alfonso Mexia,</hi> in case <hi>Mascarenas</hi> had the preference.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Christopher de Sousa</hi> perceiving the Judges were all of <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> his Faction, to his great regret, caused one of them to be removed, and five others to be added.

He embarqued in one of the Ships that came this year for <hi>Portugal,</hi> was well received by the King, who gave him the Command of <hi>Azamor</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> on his return from thence he was lost at Sea.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. As soon as <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> was quietly settled in his Government, he dispatched Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders to some Forts, and among them <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> to <hi>Malaca.

Martin Alfonso de Melo Iusarte</hi> went to build a Fort at <hi>Sunda,</hi> with eight large Ships and four hundred Men. He touched at <hi>Columbo</hi> in the Island <hi>Ceylon,</hi> where <hi>Pate Marcar</hi> of <hi>Calicut</hi> oppressed the King of <hi>Cota</hi> our Ally; but hearing of these Ships he fled up the Rivers, and <hi>Madune Pandar</hi> the King's Brother who joined with his Enemy, and pretended to the greatest part of the Kingdom, raised his Siege. <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> went thence rich, having taken some Ships of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and agreed at <hi>Calecare</hi> with the Lord about the price of Pearls, whereof there is a Fishery. Further on he destroyed the Town of <hi>Core,</hi> because the Inhabitants had killed <hi>Iohn de Flores,</hi> who guarded that Fishery.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Going on his Voyage, a sudden and fierce storm drove all his company out of sight, and set him upon a Bank of Sand near the Island <hi>Nagamale,</hi> opposite to the City <hi>Sodoe.</hi> He went into the Long-boat with fifty Men, and with great difficulty came to the City <hi>Chacuria</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala,</hi> the Lord whereof, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of them against his Enemy, made them all Slaves. Hence they were carried to <hi>Sore,</hi> where two of his Captains arriving, thought to have stoln them away by night, but were discovered and disappointed. The <hi>Indians</hi> had made a Vow to sacrifice to their Idols the handsomest <hi>Portuguese</hi> they should take, they judged one <hi>Gonzalo Vaz de Melo</hi> to be such, and accordingly sacrificed him, notwithstanding his Uncle <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi>

The King in a rage caused <hi>Iames de Mesquita</hi> to be put into a Cannon, in order to be blown in pieces, but admiring the resolution with which he entred, was appeased, and spared him. They were all put into Prison, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards released. <hi>Lope de Mesquita,</hi> the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and <hi>Antony de Miranda</hi> met at <hi>Chaul.

                     <p n="12">12. The <hi>Moors</hi> had improved our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to do us much harm, <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be revenged.

But resolving not to slip the opportunity, advanced with thirteen <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raos</hi> against the hundred and thirty.

But the greatest part being slain, the rest fled, and the Town was plundered.

                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19.

George</hi> would deliver him to his Enemy, chose rather to die, by throwing himself out of a Window. All <hi>Ternate</hi> now mutined against <hi>D. George,</hi> and he imagining that
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:54711:461"/>
                        <hi>Cachil Vaideca</hi> had caused to be killed a <hi>China</hi> Sow he much esteemed, having more respect to that foul Beast than that noble person imprisoned, and after set him at liberty, anointing his Face with Bacon, which among that People is the most hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous affront, and had been as highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged upon the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> had not the Prudence and Modesty of <hi>Antony Galvam,</hi> who succeeded in the Government, appeased the rage of the People.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>D. George</hi> not content with this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, sent to rob the Houses of the <hi>Moors</hi> of their Provisions. In fine, this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man became on a sudden most wicked and outragious. The <hi>Moors</hi> stood upon their Defence, and treated some <hi>Portugueses</hi> as they now deserved. In the Town of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona D. George</hi> took the chief Magistrate, and two <hi>Moors</hi> of Note, these two he sent back after cutting off their Hands, upon the other he set two Dogs on the shore, who tore his Flesh till he fled into the Water to shun them, but they pursuing, he defended himself with his Teeth, till the water coming up he was tore to pieces and drowned. This made <hi>D. George</hi> odious to all, and moved <hi>Cachil de Aroez</hi> to stir up the People to rise and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel both <hi>Portugueses</hi> and <hi>Spaniards. D. George</hi> catched him in the Contrivance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed him publickly in <hi>Ternate,</hi> to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of all People, which occasioned the City to be unpeopled, the Inhabitants and even the Queen flying from this storm to other places. <hi>D. George</hi> was imprisoned for these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54711:461"/>
Barbarities, and sent to <hi>India,</hi> and thence to <hi>Portugal,</hi> where he was condemned to Banishment. Any Reward was too small for his former Actions, and this Punishment too slight for the latter. But because <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> now enters upon the Government of <hi>India,</hi> let us conclude this Chapter, and hereafter we shall see <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> return to <hi>Portugal,</hi> and his Punishment there for the Extravagancies committed against <hi>Peter de Mascarenas,</hi> and usurping the Government, which deprived him of the Reward, if not the Glory of those notable Exploits which might have rendered him deserving of it. He was Governor of it three years and ten months, his Complexion fair, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance venerable, his Beard grey, Cap and upper Robe black with Crimson Lining, Breeches and Doublet of the same Colour, over all his Armour. I will reckon <hi>Peter Mascarenas</hi> the eighth Governor, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he executed the Power some time, and because the condemning of <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> confirmed his Right. So <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> will be the Ninth in order.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>The Government of <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> from the Year 1529 to the Year 1538, in the Reign of King <hi>John</hi> the Third.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. IN <hi>May</hi> this same year arrived at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz, Nuno de Cuna,</hi> who came the year before from <hi>Lisbon</hi> with eleven Ships. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause setting out late he had a tedious Voyage, and by the way did considerable things, we will say somewhat of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his arrival in <hi>India.</hi> One of his Ships was lost near <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> the Captain and some Men saved, one hundred and fifty perished. After passing the Line they were dispersed by a storm, some met again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. <hi>Nuno</hi> put into the Port <hi>San Tiago</hi> on the Island <hi>Madagascar,</hi> where he found a naked <hi>Portuguez,</hi> no less wild in appearance than the Blacks, but they were somewhat civilized. By him he understood the loss of two Ships of five that came from <hi>Lisbon</hi> the year 1527, commanded by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel de Lacerda</hi> and <hi>Alexius de Abreu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Man was a Soldier belonging to <hi>Abreu,</hi> they were cast away upon the Sands before that Port. They fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in hopes some Ships passing by would
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54711:462"/>
take them up. After waiting a year one Ship passed but could not come to them, and they no longer able to subsist there, marched up the Country to seek their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in two Bodies, and this Man was left behind sick. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> having adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised the King hereof. <hi>Duarte</hi> and <hi>Iames Fonseca</hi> were sent from <hi>Portugal</hi> to find these Men The first perished in that Island, the other found but four and a <hi>French</hi> Man, and was cast away with them sailing for <hi>India.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Man belonged to one of three Ships that came that year from <hi>France,</hi> and perished in that place. The four said many of their Companions lived in the Inland, but 'twas impossible to find them. From these it is thought sprung those People that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> there found eighty years after. They said, that a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugues</hi> Captain suffering shipwrack there, conquered that place, and became Sovereign, and all his Men marrying Natives had nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Issue, that they erred much in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith. Great were their Errors that could be perceived by the Atheistical <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers!</hi> But doubtless these People could not descend from only that Shipwrack, they might be some of the first Discoverers that were never heard of, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the three that sailed from <hi>Cochin</hi> with <hi>Francis de Albuquerque,</hi> the year 1530.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> being in this Island, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the Affairs of it, his Ship pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in a storm. The Men were saved in the other two, much Goods and Arms lost;
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:54711:463"/>
and thus he reached the Island of <hi>Zanzibar,</hi> where he eased the Ships over-burdened with Men, setting ashore (the King being our Friend) two hundred sick, under the Care of <hi>Alexius de Sousa Chichorro,</hi> with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to go to <hi>Melinde</hi> as soon as recovered.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> went thither, he tried to pass to <hi>India,</hi> but could not. Therefore not to lose time he resolved to take revenge on the King of <hi>Monbaça,</hi> who, in hatred to us, infested those of <hi>Melinde</hi> and <hi>Zanzibar.</hi> If the City was taken he purposed to make <hi>Munho Mahomet,</hi> Son of him that so kindly received <hi>Gama</hi> the first time, King of it. Which he understanding, and returning thanks, said, <hi>That he was incapable of that honor, being begot on a</hi> Cafre <hi>Slave; but since he would gratifie his Father's Kindness to the</hi> Portugueses, <hi>he might do it in the person of his Nephew, who, tho younger, was of the Blood Royal of the Kings of</hi> Quiloa. <hi>Nuno</hi> rightly judged, that none better merited a Crown than he that coveted it not, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served his Answer till he saw the Event of the Enterprize. He set out with eight hundred Men, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> with sixty, and as many with <hi>Cide Bubac</hi> the King's Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, the other had proposed to be King.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As he drew near there met him the Lord of <hi>Otondo,</hi> a neighbouring Town, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to accompany him with a well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished Vessel, being admitted, shewing Silver Chains upon his Legs, he said, <hi>He wore them in remembrance that he had been wrongfully imprisoned by that King, and had
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:54711:463"/>
swore never to take them off till revenged; that all the motive his Enemy had to use him so, was for his affection to the</hi> Portugueses, <hi>tho be never was so happy as to serve them.</hi> The King of <hi>Monbaça</hi> knowing <hi>Cuna</hi>'s Design, prepared, planting Guns on a Bulwark that kept the mouth of the River, and bringing six hundred expert and resolute Archers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City. <hi>Nuno</hi> entred the River through Showers of Bullets that flew from the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, which killed some Men, and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered some Vessels. Yet he anchored the Evening near the City, all the Night the Enemy poured Arrows upon the Fleet, which answered with their Cannon. Day appearing, the Attack began, and <hi>Peter Vaz,</hi> Brother to <hi>Nuno,</hi> driving all before him, was the first who set up the <hi>Portugues</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in the highest place of the City, which being seen far off, the Ships began to celebrate the Victory. Many <hi>Moors</hi> were killed, the rest left the City. <hi>D. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand de Lima</hi> was suddenly clasped by a stout <hi>Moor,</hi> but his own Men coming in the <hi>Moor</hi> was slain, fulfilling a Vow he had made to the King's Neece whom he loved. For this Woman going out with others, said to him: <hi>Are these the brave men of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baça, <hi>who suffer their Wives and Children to lose the City, and go for refuge to the</hi> Cafres? And he answered: <hi>Since you affront me thus, I swear by the Love I bear you, before two days, those who love shall weep for me, and you, if you value me, shall not see me to reward my Love.</hi> He fulfilled his Vow, as did
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54711:464"/>
many more, not one <hi>Portuguese</hi> was lost.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The City was plundered, twenty great pieces of Cannon taken. <hi>D Ferdinand de Lima</hi> going to secure the Bulwark, some <hi>Moors</hi> issued out of a Wood, did harm, for a few of our Men died of their poisoned Arrows. Many of the Enemy were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards slain. Hither came News of some of <hi>Cuna</hi>'s Fleet who had been separated from him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nuno</hi> the better to secure and people the City, which was great, sent to <hi>Melinde,</hi> whence presently came a Nephew of that King with five hundred Men, many of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and he of <hi>Montangue</hi> with two hundred. By this means the Natives were drove out of the Island, tho Hunger afterwards for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced back many. The King of <hi>Monbaça,</hi> sensible of his Ruin, sent a Man of Note to treat of an Accommoda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ion with <hi>Nuno,</hi> offering to become Tributary, and pay a Ransom for the City. They came to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The King presently began the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as soon fell off, finding the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> sickened and died. Two hundred were already dead, among them some Gentlemen, and <hi>Peter Vaz de Cuna.</hi> This and other Misfortunes pressed the disposing of the City. The King of <hi>Melinde</hi>'s Sons durst not undertake to maintain it without a number of <hi>Portugueses,</hi> which could not be afforded after such a loss. <hi>Nuno</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the City to Ashes, and returned to <hi>Melinde,</hi> bringing with him those who
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:54711:464"/>
were left before at <hi>Zanzibar,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who joined him after the City was taken.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. At <hi>Melinde</hi> he left eighty sick Men to be carried to <hi>India</hi> by <hi>Tristan Homem,</hi> who afterwards with them defended that King against him of <hi>Monbaça,</hi> who sought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge there the harm done him by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses.</hi> In <hi>May</hi> the Governor began to visit the neighbouring Places to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> making Proclamation, <hi>That all persons who had any Cause of Complaint against</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses <hi>should appear before him.</hi> Many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with much Cause, and the Offenders were obliged to make restitution, to the great astonishment of the <hi>Moors,,</hi> not used to see such Justice executed. At <hi>Ormuz</hi> he made a solemn Entry, which being unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, was much admired by those People.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. He found that <hi>Raez Xarafo</hi> great <hi>Guazil,</hi> or rather Tyrant over that King, tho restored by <hi>Lope Vaz,</hi> was not clear of those great Crimes he stood accused of. The chief were Rapin and Murder. and the Circumstances such, that King <hi>Iohn</hi> had sent after <hi>Nuno de Cuna, Emanuel de Macedo,</hi> with Orders independent of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to take and bring him to <hi>Portugal.</hi> They both had a Hand in securing him. <hi>Nuno</hi> visited the King, and gave him Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from ours. He qualified the King's Displeasure for imprisoning <hi>Xarafo,</hi> and his fear for his own Offences, received his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and took leave. The King presented him with rich Jewels, Pieces of Cloth of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:54711:465"/>
Gold, Silks and a stately Horse with fine Furniture after the <hi>Persian</hi> manner. <hi>Nuno</hi> refused to accept, but seeing the King was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted at it, received it in his King's Name. The Gentlemen with him received rich Gifts.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Nuno</hi> made some Inquiry into <hi>Xara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo</hi>'s Crimes, and sent him to <hi>Portugal.</hi> The King for the Murder of <hi>Mahomet</hi> was sentenced to pay forty thousand Xeraphins over and above the sixty thousand he paid yearly. It is true, this Crime served only as a pretence to overload him with this Tribute, being the third part of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of <hi>Ormuz. Raez Xarafo,</hi> tho guilty of heinous Offences, carried enough Riches with him to purchase Favour in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and be restored to his Employ.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Whilst the Governor was thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at <hi>Ormuz, Belchior Tavarez de Sousa</hi> came thither, he had been to assist the King of <hi>Baçora</hi> with forty Men against him of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaira.</hi> He was the first <hi>Portuguese</hi> that went up the Rivers <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates. Baçora</hi> is thirty Leagues from the mouth of these Rivers, in thirty degrees: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more of Northern Latitude. It is a new Foundation in memory of the ancient <hi>Baçora,</hi> eight Leagues distant from it, the Ruins whereof are still to be seen, and in the opinion of a person of Judgment who did see them, are twice as big as <hi>Grand Caire.</hi> The Island <hi>Gizaira</hi> is formed by the two Rivers, <hi>Tigris,</hi> whose Springs are in <hi>Curdi,</hi> of the greater <hi>Armenia;</hi> and <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
                        <pb n="333" facs="tcp:54711:465"/>
whose Fountains are in <hi>Turkomania.</hi> The Circuit of it forty Leagues, it contains forty thousand Archers.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The King of <hi>Baçora</hi> had received <hi>Sousa</hi> with State, and Joy in a Court of his Palace, so large, that it contained two thousand Men without any Throng. Next day gave him an account of his Condition, desiring he would either bring the King of <hi>Gizaira</hi> to an honorable Peace, or recover some Forts he had taken from him. The King of <hi>Baçora</hi> set out with two hundred <hi>Dalacas,</hi> or large Barques, in them were five thousand Men, six hundred whereof were Musqueteers, seven Vessels full of <hi>Turks</hi> with good Cannon, his Nephew marched by Land with three thousand Horse. He planted himself on the side of <hi>Arabià,</hi> opposite to where he of <hi>Gizaira</hi> was posted with twelve hundred Men. By order of the King of <hi>Baçora, Sousa</hi> writ to his Enemy, telling him, He was sent by the Commander of <hi>Ormuz</hi> to make peace between them, or to stand to the Event of War, The King of <hi>Gizaira</hi> answered, That being the first Request of the Captain of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and he the first <hi>Portuguese</hi> that had come to those parts, he granted all.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The King of <hi>Gizaira</hi> sent persons with power to treat, and Peac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54711:466"/>
as being our Enemies. <hi>Sousa</hi> embarqued, took one of his great Barques, and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thirty six <hi>Portugueses,</hi> burnt a Town of three hundred Houses. Another, tho not so big, he fired on the <hi>Persian</hi> side. He again appeared before <hi>Baçora,</hi> but wanting Provisions, returned to <hi>Ormuz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> to reward <hi>Sousa,</hi> gave him the Command of that Sea, sending him at the King's Request to the Island <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harem,</hi> to secure <hi>Raez Barbadim,</hi> who was revolted. But he having good intelligence baffled the Contrivance, and obliged <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> to send his Brother <hi>Simon</hi> with eight Vessels, and four hundred Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides some of the Natives in their Barques. They set out.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Mean while <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> prepared to go for <hi>India.</hi> He arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>October,</hi> where were before him four Ships come from <hi>Portugal</hi> the most fortunately that any had done yet; for of above fifteen hundred Men they brought, none died but our Captain, and they came all in perfect health. <hi>Nuno</hi> made a very solemn Entry into the City. There were at this time ready almost one hundred and forty Vessels, provided by the care of <hi>Lope Vaz,</hi> many considerable, as six Gallions, eight Royal Gallies, six Caravels, and fourteen Galliots, all well stored, with Arms and Ammunition. The Forts were also well provided. For tho <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Government, he managed it better than many that were named for it. The
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:54711:466"/>
Governor's presence was required at <hi>Cochin</hi> for the Dispatch of the homeward bound trading Ships and other Affairs.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Whilst he sailed to <hi>Cochin, Simon de Cuna</hi> came to <hi>Baharem</hi> with his Ships, and joining <hi>Belchior de Sousa,</hi> landed. He bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Fort three days, and lost it for want of Powder, for whilst he sent for more to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> his Men so sickened, that above one hundred <hi>Portugueses</hi> died, and many were in danger, and the very <hi>Persians</hi> used to that Clime were in no better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. With this loss he drew off. This seemed an effect of Divine Justice, for <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badim</hi> offered to deliver up the Fort upon condition he might go away in safety, but our Gentlemen would not hearken to him, fearing to lose the Booty.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Simon de Seusa</hi> found no less a Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence had raged among his Seamen. Thus they set sail, but being becalmed not far from <hi>Ormuz,</hi> many of the sick died, and among them some persons of good Note, and <hi>Simon de Cuna</hi> himself. A great Grief to his Brother <hi>Nuno,</hi> who had already lost his other Brother at <hi>Monbaça.</hi>

                        <p>Continues the Government of <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> from the Year 1529, in the Reign of King <hi>John</hi> the Third.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>NUno de Cuna</hi> sailing to <hi>Cochin,</hi> put in at <hi>Cananor,</hi> and the King sent to welcome him. <hi>Cuna</hi> excused himself that he did not go ashore to see him by reason of his haste, and the King for not going aboard the Gallion, because he was indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed. After these Complements came the <hi>Guazil,</hi> a great Friend of the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and to gain the favour of <hi>Cuna,</hi> as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Governors, privately offered him a Collar, which he refused to receive. <hi>Don Iohn de Deca</hi> at that time had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Fort, he visiting the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor aboard, brought him a Message from <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> then there, desiring him to come ashore, and he would there resign the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to him. <hi>Nuno</hi> sent to desire him to come and resign aboard. He came, and the Resignation was performed with the usual Solemnities. As he was in the Vessel ready to return, he was ordered by <hi>Cuna</hi> to bear him company to <hi>Cochin.</hi> Then the Governor made Proclamation, That any
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:54711:467"/>
who had been wronged by <hi>Lope Vaz,</hi> should repair to him, and he would do them Justice. This troubled <hi>Lope Vaz,</hi> and he sent him word, That those were rather Libels than Proclamations; for no Man that had cause of Complaint against him, needed to be stirred up by sound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. At <hi>Cochin, Nuno</hi> ordered <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> to be imprisoned, and an Inventory of all his Goods to be taken, and all deposited in safe Hands to be delivered at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> as the King should direct. <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> said to the Officer that took him, <hi>Tell</hi> Nuno de Cuna, <hi>that I imprisoned, he imprisons me, and one will come who will imprison him. Nuno</hi> being told it, said, <hi>I doubt not but I shall be imprisoned, but the difference between us will be, that</hi> Lope Vaz <hi>deserves it, and I shall not.</hi> Neither was he deceived, for he had been close laid up in <hi>Portugal,</hi> had he not died at Sea: we shall see it at the end of his Government. <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> was less afflicted for his Confinement, than the insolent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the Rabble, that the worst Ship was allotted him to imbarque, only two Servants allowed him, and barely so much of his own as would maintain him the Voyage. An unjust proceeding with a Man of his Worth, whose person ought not to be indecently used whilst his Crimes were inquired into.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> found nothing in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at <hi>Cohin,</hi> of what he ordered from <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde</hi> should be provided to make war upon <hi>Diu,</hi> which was the principal point of his
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:54711:468"/>
Instructions. Perceiving the year was too far gone for that Undertaking, he applyed himself to other Affairs, and fitted a Fleet of thirty Sail to scour the Coast of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Iames de Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyra,</hi> who commanded the four, came last from <hi>Portugal. Antony de Silveyra Meneses</hi> had a Squadron to cruise in the Sea of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya.</hi> And <hi>Hector de Silveyra</hi> another for the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> Whilst these Commanders sailed on the Coasts assigned them, our homeward bound Fleet arrived at the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceras</hi> Islands, where an Officer was waiting to put <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> into Irons. Loaded with them he landed at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and was set upon a Mule, on which he was carried, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the rude Rabble up to the Castle, and put into a Dungeon, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>h Orders, that not even his Wife should be permitted to see him. He was accompanied in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable state by <hi>Raez Xarafo Guazil</hi> of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz,</hi> brought by <hi>Emanuel de Macedo.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two years <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> his Crimes began to be taken into consideration and examined, the King having ordered him to be prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with the utmost rigor. The principal Article against him was his unjust Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with <hi>Peter de Mascarenas.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Braganca</hi> pityng the Misfortunes of this brave Gentleman, prevailed with the King to give him a hearing in Council. Accordingly his Majesty being seated in Council with all his Judges about him, <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> was brought in, venerable for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, his Face covered with a thick and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:54711:468"/>
longe white Beard, and with such tokens of the Miseries he had endured in almost three years imprisonment, reckoning from <hi>India,</hi> that had <hi>Peter Mascarenas</hi> or any of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies seen him, they might think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sufficiently revenged of all the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies he had been guilty of towards them. Being placed at the Bar as a Criminal, after the King's leave obtained, he with an undaunted Constancy made a learned, comprehensive and copious Speech. In which after running over his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers Services to the Crown, he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larized his own from his infancy till that time, reflected upon his Sufferings and Wrong done him since Imprisoned, and in general to several other brave Governors his Predecessors, exposed the Malice of his Accusers, justified his own Proceedings, illustrated by Examples how others guilty of greater Crimes than he was accused of, were pardoned in respect of their Services, then made a parallel between them and his Sufferings, and concluded, throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon either his Majesties Justice, or Mercy, from one of which he hoped such a Discharge, that he might have more cause to return thanks for the future, than he had till then to lament his hard Usage. The King having heared with attention, examined him upon every Article of his Impeachment, and he answered to each. The Articles were in all forty three; the principal, as was said, such as related to <hi>Peter Mascarenas,</hi> the others such as would
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:54711:469"/>
never have been thought of, had not those brought them in to fill up the number. In fine he was carried back to the Castle, whence he sent his Defence, as is usual in such Cases, and in conclusion was sentenced to lose all his Allowance as Governor, and to pay to <hi>Peter Mascarenas</hi> ten thousand Ducats, which confirmed the latter, not him, to have been the real Governor, and justified those who had obeyed them as such. He was also banished into <hi>Africk.</hi> But he resenting this hard Fortune, resolved to change his Country and his Prince, as the famous <hi>Ferdinand Magallanes</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And getting into <hi>Spain,</hi> he unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized himself; and from <hi>Badajoz</hi> writ a Letter to the King, affirming his usage had been highly unjust, and that he was resolved to try whether changing his Country he could change Fortune, and restore his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. This had such effect, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to his Country. <hi>Alfonso Mexia</hi> being likewise brought prisoner to <hi>Portugal,</hi> had the same success; he was also accused of Crimes committed at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of which Fort <hi>Iames de Melo</hi> was under the same Circumstances. Let us now return to <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Iames Silveyra</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi> carried so heavy a Hand upon those People, that their King was obliged to send Embassadors to <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> desiring Peace. He granted upon such Conditions as they deserved who had never kept any. They were willing to accept part, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:54711:469"/>
the rest, so <hi>Silveyra</hi> reduced them to extreme Famine, hindering the Importation of Provisions. They received some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from <hi>Cananor,</hi> and <hi>Simon de Sousa</hi> being forced upon that Shoar, after valiantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsing the <hi>Moors,</hi> his Powder took fire, and blew up the Brigantine.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Melique Saca</hi> being expelled <hi>Diu,</hi> found it convenient for the compassing his Ends with the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> to use those Artifices with <hi>Nuno de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>una</hi> he had done with <hi>Hector de Silveyra,</hi> when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to deliver up that City to him. He writ to <hi>Nuno,</hi> that tho he could not deliver <hi>Diu,</hi> at least he could assist him in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it; to this end it was convenient they should have a meeting, and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he might send him a Pass and Ships for himself and Retinue, commanded by <hi>Gaspar Paez,</hi> whom he had known at <hi>Diu.</hi> The Governor granted all, and he made use of it to be restored to the King of <hi>Cambaya</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, receiving and putting off <hi>Gaspar Paez</hi> with Subleties and Impudence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Pass was not securely worded, and the Ships were too few. <hi>Paez</hi> told him he had by the way with those Vessels taken a great Ship, and put to flight fourteen Barques in the River <hi>Pormeane,</hi> and that he might go with all safety. But no Reason is of force against Craft and Falshood.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Gaspar Paez</hi> would have taken some Revenge, but could only burn nine Barques. The Governor enraged hereat, suddenly began to make such Preparations against
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:54711:470"/>
                        <hi>Diu</hi> as should not easily be disappointed. He had not yet seen the King of <hi>Cochin</hi> who was sick of the Small Pox. <hi>Nuno</hi> being less fearful of the Infection than the King, who sent him word, That he did not desire to see him, for fear he might catch the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, tho he believed his fight would cure him. <hi>Nuno</hi> went to visit him, and it was much he was received, for those Princes suffer not themselves to be seen in any Sickness. The whole Conference contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but Complaints of Injuries done by <hi>Lope Vaz</hi> and <hi>Alfonso Mexia. Nuno</hi> left him well satisfied with his Courtesie, so that he began to look upon himself as a King, having till then been treated as a Slave, and found himself better in health.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It was requisite <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> should <note place="margin">3530.</note> now go to <hi>Goa.</hi> At <hi>Chale</hi> he visited the King, and gave him content. About Mid-<hi>February</hi> he came to <hi>Cananor,</hi> and saw that King, whom he much obliged by conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Ceremonies at the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. This Prince offered him some Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, which he fearing to affront him receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but delivered to the Officers of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue as belonging to the King.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. He ordered <hi>Iames de Silveyra</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish a rich Merchant of <hi>Mangalor,</hi> who did great wrong to the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> He scoured the Rivers along that Coast, with sixteen Ships, and four hundred and fifty Men. Then entered the River <hi>Mangalor,</hi> on whose Banks is the Town of that Name belonging to the King of <hi>Narsinga,</hi> our
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54711:470"/>
Friend, but that Merchant favoured <hi>Calicut,</hi> our Enemy. This Merchant knowing the Design was against him, was well fortified. <hi>Iames Silveyra</hi> chose the lesser Vessels with two hundred and forty Men to go up the River, who were met by a great Squadron, which after some contest was put to flight. The Town was immediately entred, all the Defendants quitting it. <hi>Iames Silveyra</hi> then turned to the Fort, and after some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance took it. The Merchant fled in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, but was overtaken and killed by a Musquet Ball. Those who fled sought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in the River, and our Swords there made it run bloody. Nothing was taken but some Cannon, for Booty being very great, the Captain caused it all to be burnt, lest he might endanger his Ships by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading them. There were also burnt thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Vessels that waited for loading. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter coming on, he thought so great a Force was not requisite, and dismissed half the Fleet. But there had been use for all when he met <hi>Pati Marcar,</hi> a Commander of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licut</hi> sailing for <hi>Mangalor</hi> with sixty <hi>Paraos.</hi> The Weather prevented fighting then, so he waited their Return, and gave Battel at Mount <hi>Delii,</hi> where six <hi>Paraos</hi> were sunk, then went to <hi>Cochin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Antony de Silveyra,</hi> to whom the Coast of <hi>Cambaya</hi> was allotted, had now under his Command fifty one Sail, whereof three were Gallies, and two Galliots, and in them nine hundred <hi>Portugueses.</hi> He went up the River <hi>Taptii,</hi> on whose Banks are two Cities,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54711:471"/>
the chiefest of that Coast. On the one side, <hi>Surat,</hi> containing ten thousand Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, most Handycrafts, and all of no Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, called <hi>Bancanes.</hi> On the other side, <hi>Reyner,</hi> of six thousand Houses, but war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Men, and well fortified. The River being sounded, it was found there was not Water enough for the greater Vessels, which were left at the Barr under <hi>Francis de Vasconcellos.</hi> With the rest <hi>Antony de Silveyra</hi> returning to the Mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and having sailed four Leagues, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>Surat.</hi> Three hundred Horse, and almost ten thousand Foot opposed the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, armed with Bows and Musquets, they spent their-Shot, and fled without expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Answer. The City was entred without any farther resistance, and nothing left in it that had life, or was of Value. Then the City and some Ships that lay in the Arsenal were burnt. A little higher on the other side was the City <hi>Reyner,</hi> inhabited by the <hi>Nayteas Moors,</hi> of more Courage and Policy, who nevertheless scarce essayed our Fire, when they fled, leaving all in the Hands of the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who had all been rich, could they have carried away all the Plunder. They carried what they could, the rest was all burnt, with twenty Ships and many lesser Vessels that were in that Port. <hi>Emanuel de Sousa</hi> was in both Actions the foremost at landing, not without great danger, especially in the latter, the Enemy playing much great Cannon at him.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:54711:471"/>
9. <hi>Antony de Silveyra</hi> returning to the Mouth of the River, found that whilst he burnt those Cities, <hi>Francis de Vasconcellos</hi> had not been idle, but taken six Vessels laden with Provisions bound for <hi>Diu.</hi> Now they sailed together to <hi>Damam,</hi> a Town great and strong, yet terrified by the Disaster of the others, quitted by the Inhabitants, and burnt by our Men. On the contrary the Town of <hi>Agaçaim</hi> fourteen Leagues from <hi>Chaul,</hi> dared the <hi>Portugues</hi> Fury with four hundred Horse, and five thousand Foot. At first shock they killed five <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and the rest began to flie, but being rallied by the Captains, the Town was taken, and in it much Cannon and Riches. Many were killed, above two hundred taken. The Fire of the Town took hold of the Vessels which were three hundred.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Whilst <hi>Antony de Silveyra</hi> was thus employed, <hi>Francis Pereyra de Berredo,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander at <hi>Chaul,</hi> overcome by the Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Inhabitants, oppressed by <hi>Badur,</hi> King of <hi>Cambaya;</hi> who was Master of the Field, marched with fifty Horse, and one hundred and fifty Foot, till he met <hi>Popate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao</hi> with five thousand of the former, and twelve thousand of the latter. The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, weariness and heat so disordered the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> that most of them were slain, <hi>Francis Pereyra</hi> seeing the Fort in danger, called <hi>Antony de Silveyra,</hi> who instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with care relieved it in person, which preserved it from falling into the Hands of King <hi>Badur,</hi> which it must have done, if
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54711:472"/>
assaulted at that time. <hi>Francis Pereyra</hi> was punished for that loss and rashness by being deprived of his Command, and imprisoned by the Governor, who gave that Post to <hi>Antony Silveyra,</hi> whose Diligence had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Hector de Silveyra,</hi> who sailed from <hi>Goa</hi> on the twenty first of <hi>Ianuary</hi> with ten Sail, and six hundred Men, for the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> spread his Ships cross the Mouth of it from Cape <hi>Guardafu</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> to <hi>Xael</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> that no Enemy might escape him. Most of them had some Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, chiefly <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Martin de Castro</hi> who took two great and rich Ships, killing the Defendants who made a brave resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. A Brigantine of twelve Men that accompanied the Ship taken by <hi>Hector</hi> to <hi>Mascate,</hi> made up to a great Barque, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing her a <hi>Portuguese,</hi> and discovered not the mistake till it was not possible to avoid fighting thirty valiant <hi>Turks</hi> that were in her. They fought till both parties tired, were forced to rest, and having recovered Breath all the <hi>Turks</hi> were slain. Of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> three died, the nine carrying off the Barque as a Trophy of this brave Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit. The Fleet being joined, appeared before <hi>Aden,</hi> where <hi>Hector</hi> managed that King with such Dexterity, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to pay a Tribute of twelve thousand Xeraphins yearly to the Crown of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> offering him immediately a Crown of Gold. The Agreement was solemnly sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both sides, and <hi>Antony Botello</hi> left in
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:54711:472"/>
that Port with a Brigantine and thirty Men. In the same manner the King of <hi>Xael</hi> submitted, who not long before had accompanied <hi>Mustapha,</hi> a <hi>Turkish</hi> Captain, with twenty thousand Men to make war upon <hi>Aden.</hi> In the Month of <hi>September</hi> arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> six Ships from <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. Let us look upon the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea now <note place="margin">1531.</note> covered with a Wood of Ships, the product of the Governor's great care, now full of his Design upon <hi>Diu.</hi> This Fleet consisted of above four hundred Sail, many large, more indifferent, and the greatest number small, several of them were only Sutlers, fitted out by the Natives for private Gain. In the Island <hi>Bombaim</hi> was made a general Review of the Fleet, and found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain three thousand six hundred Soldiers, and one thousand four hundred and fifty Seamen, all <hi>Portugueses,</hi> above two thousand <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars</hi> and <hi>Canaras,</hi> eight thousand Slaves fit for Service, and almost five thousand Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The Governor landed at <hi>Damam,</hi> a Fort of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> which was immediately quitted by the <hi>Moors.</hi> Mass was said there and the general absolution given. Then three Rewards were proposed to the three first that should mount the Walls of <hi>Diu</hi> at the scaling of it. Hither came the News, that the <hi>Arabs, Turks</hi> and others, to the number of two thousand fortified themselves in the Island <hi>Beth,</hi> seven Leagues from <hi>Diu.</hi> It was by Nature and Art so begirt with Rocks and Walls, and stored with Cannon, that <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> gave no Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the Relation till he saw it.</p>
                     <p n="13">

13. On the seventh of <hi>February</hi> he came to the Island, and having in person viewed all Difficulties besieged it. He summoned the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to surrender; but they were so resolute, that many of them shaved their Heads, a Token that they fear not death, but are devoted, which they call making themselves <hi>Amoucos.</hi> Their Commander gave them a brutal Example of Resolution, making a great Fire, and throwing into it his Wife, Son, Goods and Family, that if the <hi>Portugueses</hi> overcame, they might find nothing but a heap of Ashes. Others fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Example. <hi>Nuno</hi> ordered the Island to be attacked at once in six several places. At Break of Day each Officer cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously fell on the place appointed him. The Enemy received them with desperate fury. Many were killed, and among them the brave <hi>Hector de Silveyra,</hi> who in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Occasions had notably signalized himself. This to us was a great loss. Our dead in all were twelve. A <hi>Portuguese</hi> ran through an Islander with his Lance, and he pressing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon it, with his Cymiter cut off the <hi>Portuguese</hi> his Leg, and they both fell down dead. One stood upon a Rock with four Women, and seeing our Men comeon, killed two of the Women by their free consent, but a Bullet preventing him from killing the other two, they both leap'd into the Sea to prevent being made Slaves, but to no effect, for they were taken in the Sea. Eighteen hundred of the Enemy were killed, and sixty Cannons taken.</p>

14. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> parting from <hi>Beth,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no less formidable to <hi>Diu,</hi> than that City did to him. The City considered the Sea covered with that Fleet. The Fleet, a City built upon Rocks, and encompassed by them and Water, the Mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver crossed with massy Chains sustained upon Vessels, and eighty filled with Archers and Musqueteers to defend them; within ten thousand armed Men, and an infinite number of great Artillery. The tops of Houses, Walls and Rocks covered with multitudes of People of both Sexes and all Ages, rending the Air with Shouts. Our Governor viewed the danger, consulted the Captains, and ordered the Assault.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. On the sixteenth of <hi>February,</hi> the signal being given, the Sea and Land were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Clouds of Smoak and Dust of the Destruction our Guns made in the City. <hi>Nuno</hi> standing in a Boat cloathed in red, to be the better seen, flew to all parts where there was occasion, and being known, was all the Mark the Enemies Shot was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. Which <hi>Sebastian de Sa,</hi> who, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, was taken out of another Boat into his, perceiving with some concern, said to him, <hi>Alas, Sir, was it for this you brought me hither!</hi> And he pleasantly, as if no danger had been near, replyed to him and others, <hi>Humilitate capita vestra. D. Vasco de Lima</hi> had not lowered his Head, for a Ball took it off his shoulders. Our Cannon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to burst with the continual Fire. <hi>Cuna</hi> perceiving this loss, and that twelve Men
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54711:474"/>
were killed without doing any considerable Execution upon the Enemy, the day being spent, consulted with the principal Men, and it was agreed the Enterprize was not practical. He desisted, leaving <hi>Antony de Saldana</hi> with sixty Vessels in the Bay of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> to do what damage he could to the Enemy. It was agreed on all Hands, that had not the Governor stayed to take <hi>Beth,</hi> he had carried <hi>Diu;</hi> for the <hi>Moor Mustapha</hi> was the only cause of its holding out, who entered but three days before with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Relief. We lost never a Vessel, and that part of the Fleet which went with <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> the fifteenth of <hi>March,</hi> where it stayed till two Ships came in of six that sailed this year from <hi>Lisbon.</hi> Of the other four, one returned to <hi>Portugal,</hi> another perished in a storm at Cape <hi>Comori,</hi> the Captain <hi>Manuel de Macedo</hi> and all the Men being saved ashore, where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themselves against a great number of <hi>Moors,</hi> till relieved from <hi>Cochin.</hi> A third was never heard of. And the fourth came afterwards, but returning home with another, it was never known of what became of both.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Mustapha</hi> as soon as the <hi>Portugues</hi> Fleet was gone, went to offer himself to King <hi>Badur,</hi> carrying great Presents, and was received with Honor, and rewarded. He gave him the Command of <hi>Baroche</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and other considerable Revenues with the Title of <hi>Rume,</hi> because he was a <hi>Grecian;</hi> for the <hi>Indian Moors</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ignorant of the Division of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> called all <hi>Thracia, Greece, Sclavonia,</hi> and the adjacent Countries <hi>Rum,</hi> and the Natives thereof <hi>Rumii,</hi> this Name being proper only to those of <hi>Thracia,</hi> called <hi>Romania.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Rumes</hi> are different Nations, those being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally of <hi>Turchestan,</hi> and these of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> and the <hi>Rumes</hi> esteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more honorable than the <hi>Turks.</hi> He also gave him the Title of <hi>Cham,</hi> a Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among the <hi>Tartars,</hi> like a Duke with us, and among the Eastern People is given to Persons of great Merit. So <hi>Mustapha</hi> from hence forward was called <hi>Rume Cham.</hi>

                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Antony de Saldana,</hi> who was left in the Sea of <hi>Diu</hi> with sixty Sail and fifteen hundred Men, went to the City <hi>Madrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,</hi> five Leagues distant towards the Island <hi>Beth,</hi> and burnt it with small opposition. Then he went to <hi>Goga</hi> twenty four Leagues distant from the last, a place of great Trade, formerly populous and strong. In the Port were fifteen of the best <hi>Paraos</hi> of <hi>Calicut,</hi> laden with Spice, who fled up a Creek, and were followed by <hi>Saldana,</hi> with eight hundred Men in the smaller Vessels. It was found necessary to land, and three hundred Horse and eight hundred Foot coming down to the Relief of the <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars,</hi> there was a sharp Engagement, till above two hundred of the Enemy being killed, they quitted the Field and Vessels which were all burnt, as was the Town and eight Ships in the Port. We lost some Men.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54711:475"/>
The chiefest Booty was much good Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. The same happened to the Towns <hi>Belsa, Tarapor, Maii, Quelme</hi> and <hi>Agacim,</hi> and lastly <hi>Surat,</hi> then rising after the last Fire, and some Vessels in that River. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dana</hi> having thus terrified all that Coast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Goa.</hi> About this time came into <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi>'s power a Brother of the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> who was the rightful Heir of that Crown, and through him our Governor hoped to compass some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable advantage. <hi>D. Antony de Silveyra</hi> who parted from <hi>Chaul</hi> with six Ships arrived at <hi>Aden,</hi> and found that King who not long before submitted to the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> had killed such as had stayed there, for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness of a Ship laden with Spice that came to his Port. <hi>Silveyra</hi> being too weak to revenge this, sailed to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> where he died, <hi>George de Lima</hi> succeeded in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and took two rich Ships in the Bay of <hi>Cambaya.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">18. Our Cruisers had about this time taken twenty seven Ships of the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> richly laden. He being preplexed with these Losses, and fearing greater, proposed an Accommodation. <hi>Iames Pereyra</hi> was sent to treat, and obtained what he desired, which was leave to build a Fort at <hi>Chale. Chale</hi> is an Island in a River that falls into the Sea three Leagues from <hi>Calicut,</hi> navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable in Boats up to the Mountain Gate. <hi>Urinama,</hi> a Heathen, was a King of it, and next to him he of <hi>Tanor,</hi> both Subjects of <hi>Calicut.</hi> Both coveted the Friendship of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:54711:475"/>
the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> as well to cast of that Yoke as in hopes to grow rich with our Trade. As soon as <hi>Nuno</hi> had obtained consent to raise the Fort, he set out from <hi>Goa</hi> with one hundred and fifty Sail, three thousand <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses,</hi> and one thousand <hi>Lascarines</hi> of the Country. Such diligence was used in the Work, (the Gentlemen not sparing their Labour) that in twenty six days it was in a posture of Defence, the Wall being nine Foot broad with Bulwarks, Towers, a Church, a House for the Commander, and Store-houses. The Command of it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Iames Pereyra,</hi> who had forwarded the Work, with two hundred and fifty Men; and to secure it by Sea <hi>Manuel de Sousa</hi> with twenty two Ships. The King of <hi>Calicut</hi> repenting he had given leave for that Work, made War upon the Kings of <hi>Chale, Caramanlii</hi> and <hi>Tanor,</hi> at the same time making Overtures to draw them to break with the <hi>Portugueses:</hi> but to no effect.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. About the end of <hi>February Emanuel de Vasconcellos</hi> set out for the <hi>Red Sea</hi> with two <note place="margin">1532.</note> Galliots, and some Brigantines. At <hi>Xael</hi> with the loss of one Man he took some <hi>Turkish</hi> Vessels laden, and among them a great Ship called <hi>Cufturca,</hi> which was sent <hi>Mascate.</hi> The King of <hi>Xael</hi> fearful of some danger, made his Peace with Submission and Presents. After <hi>Vasconcelos,</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Antony de Saldania</hi> with ten Ships, and the King seeing he would not allow of the submission he made to <hi>Vasconelos,</hi> began to secure himself, sending out of the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54711:476"/>
Town all the Riches, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which were seen from the Ships, crossing the Mountain upon Camels. But the Weather obliged <hi>Saldana</hi> to leave that Sea.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. He sailed to <hi>Mascate,</hi> thence to the Coast of <hi>Diu,</hi> seven or eight Ships of that City came out and engaged him, he took three, and stranded the rest. The same happened to a <hi>Turkish</hi> Gallion that was in Port, and endeavoured to flie. A storm rising there dispersed most of the Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines. <hi>Saldana</hi> had three Gallions with him, and they suffered Hunger and Thirst, when the Sea driving them towards the Bar, twenty seven Ships of the Enemy that watched the opportunity fell upon them, but drew off without any considerable Action. He dispatched two Vessels to view <hi>Pate,</hi> on which he had some Design, they meeting a rich Ship bound for <hi>Diu,</hi> after a very sharp Engagement took her. The Ship had only in Gold Coin above sixty thousand <hi>Venetian</hi> Chequins. Sailing to <hi>Goa</hi> with Prizes worth above two hundred thousand Ducats, he met short of <hi>Chaul, Iames de Silveyra,</hi> to whom he delivered the Vessels the Governor ordered. At this time arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved four Ships that sailed from <hi>Portugal</hi> the beginning of this year, <hi>Antony de Saldana</hi> returned home with them.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. <hi>Iames de Silveyra</hi> sailing to <hi>Patam,</hi> twelve Leagues from <hi>Diu,</hi> plundered and burnt that City with four Ships in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The very same was done to <hi>Pate,</hi> and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:54711:476"/>
                        <hi>Mangalor.</hi> This was no new thing in <hi>Iames Silveyra,</hi> for he had before the same success at <hi>Bandora Tana,</hi> and other Towns, and on the Coast of <hi>Diu</hi> at <hi>Castelete, Tolaja</hi> and <hi>Madrefabat,</hi> by which means he came to <hi>Goa</hi> with above four thousand Slaves, and an infinite Booty, having killed a great number, and spread an universal Terror.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. All this encouraged <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> to streighten <hi>Diu,</hi> and the King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> that he might be obliged to consent to the raising a Fort in that City. And because the Growth of <hi>Bacaim</hi> might be an Obstacle to our Designs, he resolved to destroy it. Thither he went with a Fleet of above one hundred and fifty Sail, three thousand <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and two hundred <hi>Canaras. Melique Tocam</hi> Lord of <hi>Diu</hi> was then forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the City, and hearing of the Power that was preparing against it, put in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of above twelve thousand Men. <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> divided his Men into three parts to give the Attack, the Landing was dangerous, and the Enemy so numerous, it seemed a rashness to go on, but our Men despising all danger, the Enemy fled first to the Fort, and then to the Mountain, six hundred of them being killed, of ours only eight or nine. Here were taken above four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pieces of Cannon, and much Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. The Country about was all rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the Fort razed. After this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Governor sent <hi>Emanuel de Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> with twelve Vessels and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, to destroy the Fort of <hi>Damam;</hi>
                        <pb n="356" facs="tcp:54711:477"/>
but he not able to effect it, burnt all the Towns from <hi>Baçaim</hi> to <hi>Tarapor,</hi> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Tribute <hi>Tana, Bandora, Mais</hi> and <hi>Bombaim,</hi> then retired to <hi>Chaul</hi> with much Riches, and many Vessels taken in those Rivers. <hi>Iames de Silveyra,</hi> who sailed from <hi>Baçaim</hi> with four Gallions and fifteen Brigantines bound for the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> took off Cape <hi>Guardafu</hi> a rich Vessel. <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Perez</hi> about <hi>Zocotora</hi> took a yet richer <hi>Turkish</hi> Ship, most of her Men being slain, and near Cape <hi>Fartaque</hi> another. <hi>Iames Silveyra</hi> afterwards burnt two at <hi>Aden,</hi> and did a very generous Action, which was thus: He discovered a very rich Ship of <hi>Gidda,</hi> which spying him, lay by, and her Captain coming aboard, shewed him a Letter from a <hi>Portuguese,</hi> who was Prisoner in that City, which the <hi>Moor</hi> thought to be a secure Pass, being given him as such, <hi>Silveyra</hi> opened and found in it these Words: <hi>I beseech such of the King of</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal<hi>'s Captains as shall meet this Ship to make prize of her; for she belongs to a very wicked</hi> Moor. <hi>Silveyra</hi> perceiving how the <hi>Moor</hi> was imposed upon, took no notice of the Deceit, but discharged him, chusing rather to lose the Riches of that Ship, than bring into question the Sincerity of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses.</hi> At the latter end of <hi>April</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="23">23. At the same time arrived in <hi>India</hi> six Ships from <hi>Portugal,</hi> a seventh perished by the way. These Ships brought new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that the Commanders of Forts should
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54711:477"/>
be sworn by the Governor-General, by which it appears, they were till then independent of them. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> had always his thought fixed upon <hi>Diu,</hi> when <hi>Melique To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,</hi> Lord of that City, desired him to send a fit person with whom he might treat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Affair of Importance to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Service. He then was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive of his own King. It was therefore thought, he would for his own security de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Town to us. This was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but <hi>Vasco de Cuna,</hi> a Gentleman of parts, being sent, and having done all that could be expected in it, returned without concluding any thing, but not without hopes.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. At the same time <hi>Tristan de Ga</hi> at <hi>Cambaya</hi> pressed that King to consent to the raising a Fort at <hi>Diu.</hi> The Result was, that the King would have a Conference with <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> and his Design was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to kill him, than grant the Fort. <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> went thither with an hundred Sail, in which were two thousand <hi>Portugueses.</hi> The King was already at <hi>Diu</hi> when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor arrived, and delayed the Interview, desiring, he would send him some of his principal Captains, for that he desired to see them. They went richly cloathed, and were splendidly received. Discoursing, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel de Macedo</hi> took the liberty, tho in a respectful manner to tell the King, That he justly admired he would take the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of that City from <hi>Melique Tocam</hi> his Subject, who had served him well, and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:54711:478"/>
was Son of one who had done so before, to give it to <hi>Mustapha,</hi> now called <hi>Rumi Cham,</hi> whose first merit was his Disloyalty to the <hi>Turk,</hi> his natural Prince; that if he denied this, he challenged to fight either single, or as he should think fit. <hi>Rume Cham</hi> was present, and gave no answer, till the King looking angrily upon him for his silence, he said it proceeded from Contempt. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedo</hi> repeated the Challenge, and the <hi>Turk</hi> no longer able to shun it, accepted the Challenge to be fought at Sea. <hi>Macedo,</hi> according to appointment waited for him, but he came not. The Interview took not effect for the differences about the manner of it. <hi>Nuno</hi> taking another Course, joined in League with <hi>Omaum Patxath,</hi> King of the <hi>Moguls.</hi> Then <hi>Nuno</hi> returned to <hi>Goa,</hi> and before and after dispatched several Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, <hi>Antony de Silveyra</hi> went to <hi>Bengala</hi> with nine Vessels, <hi>Vasco Peres de Sampaya</hi> to the <hi>Red Sea</hi> with sixteen, thither also <hi>Iames de Silveyra</hi> with five Gallions, <hi>D. Stephen de Gama</hi> to <hi>Malaca,</hi> the two that were for the <hi>Red Sea</hi> made some Prizes.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. <hi>Cunale Marcar,</hi> a bold Pyrat, about this time scoured the Sea of <hi>Calicut</hi> with eight Vessels well equipped. At Cape <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mori</hi> he found at night a Brigantine with eighteen <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and three Gunners, all so fast asleep, that they were all bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they waked. Having awaked them, he caused their Heads to be bruised to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, saying, <hi>It was to punish them for daring to sleep, knowing he was abroad.</hi> A pleasant
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:54711:478"/>
Cruelty. Thence he went to <hi>Negapatan,</hi> where were forty <hi>Portugueses</hi> who defended themselves, but to no effect, for the <hi>Degar,</hi> or Governor, who they thought their Friend, agreed with <hi>Cunale</hi> to rob them. <hi>Coje Marcar,</hi> tho of kin to <hi>Cunale,</hi> desirous to deliver them from this danger, did it by art, speaking to each of the two apart, and so making them suspicious to each other. Yet <hi>Cunale</hi> took some <hi>Portugues</hi> Vessels in that River, and shot to death eight of the Men. The first died for sleeping, these, I suppose, because they were awake. <hi>Antony de Silva</hi> set out of <hi>Cochin</hi> with two hundred Musqueteers, in fifteen small Vessels. <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale</hi> hearing of it, run up the <hi>Canamera,</hi> a Bay on this Coast, and fortified himself, but <hi>Antony</hi> obliged him to make his escape in the Habit of a Beggar to <hi>Calicut,</hi> leaving his Vessels and Cannon, with which <hi>Silva</hi> returned victorious to <hi>Cochin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="26">26. The King of <hi>Razet</hi> was revolted from him of <hi>Ormuz. Antony de Silveyra</hi> who commanded the Fort at the request of the latter, sent <hi>Francis Govea</hi> with two hundred Men and eight Sail, to reduce him. <hi>Razet</hi> received them with Fraud, designing to kill them. But it succeeded not, for <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vea</hi> was upon his Guard, knowing his ill Designs, and that he had with his own Cymiter killed the Officer he sent to treat with him. Our Captain sailing over to a small Island to water, met a Fleet of this Kings, and took a Vessel wherein was the King's Nephew, for whose Ransom <hi>Razet</hi>
                        <pb n="360" facs="tcp:54711:479"/>
restored the Prisoners he had, and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> ratified the Peace made by him he had killed, and excused what was past.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. King <hi>Iohn</hi> his Care was upon the Affairs of <hi>India.</hi> He had understood the <note place="margin">1534.</note> event of <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi>'s attempt upon <hi>Diu,</hi> and that the common Enemy prepared to disturb our Progress, so he continually sent relief. This year arrived there twelve Ships with fifteen hundred fighting Men, commanded by <hi>D. Pedro de Castillobranco,</hi> who set out from <hi>Lisbon</hi> the last <hi>November.</hi> The latter end of this year came also five Ships more, which set out the beginning of this same year, they were commanded by <hi>Martin Alfonso de Sousa,</hi> who had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to be Admiral of the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea. The Governor immediately put him in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Post, sending him against <hi>Damam.</hi> At <hi>Chaul, Iames Silveyra</hi> delivered him his Squadron, and <hi>Vasco Perez</hi> his. Now <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> had five hundred Men in forty Vessels. He found <hi>Damam</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its own Commander, who was retired to the Fort with five hundred <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Resbutos. Martin Alfonso</hi> attempted to scale it, and received some damage, one of his Ladders breaking, when the Enemy on the other side opening a Gate to fly, our Men stopped them, and entring, found a large Court full of Men, and fifty Horse, most of them were put to the Sword, and the Fort razed. The King of <hi>Cambaya</hi> fearing greater loss, desired Peace, which <hi>Nuno de
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54711:479"/>
Cuna</hi> granted, and 'twas sworn upon the following Conditions. That he should give to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> for ever <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caim,</hi> with its Dependences by Sea and Land. That all Ships bound for the <hi>Red Sea</hi> from that Kingdom should set out from <hi>Bacaim,</hi> and return thither to pay the Duties. That none should go to other places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave from the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> That no Ships of War should be built in any of his Ports. That he should no more give as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to the <hi>Rumes.</hi> There were other Articles in favour of the King to sweeten the harshness of these, which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards moderated when he gave leave to raise the Fort at <hi>Diu.</hi> Now we have some footing in this Province, something may be said of its situation, people and other affairs with our usual Brevity.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Kingdom of <hi>Guazarata</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Cambaya,</hi> from its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of that Name) extends from Cape <hi>Iaquete</hi> in the West to the River <hi>Nagotana</hi>
                        <pb n="362" facs="tcp:54711:480"/>
near <hi>Chaul.</hi> It makes a great Bay of the some Name. The Sea ebbs and flows with such violence in this Bay, that in swiftness it exceeds the fleetest Horse; and if in this fury it meets any Ship, it certainly perishes. To avoid this danger there is always a Man on an eminence, who when he sees that Torrent coming, gives notice with a Horn. The distance between Cape <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quete</hi> and the River <hi>Nagotana</hi> is above two hundred Leagues. On the West it borders upon the <hi>Resbuti,</hi> a mountain people; on the North with the Kingdom of <hi>Chitor,</hi> and the East with that of <hi>Pale,</hi> all the Coast is covered with many Towns and Cities. It is watered by two famous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>Taptii</hi> and <hi>Tapetii,</hi> besides many Creeks that form several Islands. It breeds abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Cattle, and is plentiful of other Provisions. The Country is all plain, so that they generally travel in Waggons after the manner of <hi>Flanders,</hi> but lighter, and easier drawn by Oxen somewhat less than those of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Natives are of four sorts; one called <hi>Baneanes Bagançariis,</hi> that feed after our manner; another called only <hi>Baneanes,</hi> who eat nothing that hath life. Their Priests are called <hi>Vertias,</hi> who cloath themselves in white, and never take those Cloaths off till they fall to pieces. They live upon Charity, and (like the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Desart) can keep nothing for the next day. They place their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hope of Salvation in killing no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they use no light at night lest any
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54711:480"/>
Butterfly should die by it; they always car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Broom wherewith they sweep the Ground they are to tread on, lest they tread any Worm or Insect to death. The other two sorts are the <hi>Resbuti,</hi> who are good Soldiers, formerly the chief of this Kingdom. They acknowledge one God and three persons, and worship the Blessed Virgin, a Doctrine preserved from the time of the Apostles. The last are <hi>Mahometans,</hi> called <hi>Lauteas,</hi> that is, Natives who embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that Sect, and those who came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Countrey. The common people are very ingenious in Mechanicks, in Works of Silk, Gold, Ivory, Mother of Pearl, Tortoise-shell, Crystal, Ebony and other things of Delight. They follow the Rules of <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> killing no Creature, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buy all, tho venemous, from those who take them, and set them loose again. They entertain men whose only Business it is to look about the Towns and Fields for Beasts that are sick, which they cure with great care in Hospitals erected for that purpose. Notwithstanding all this Beastly Charity, they have none that may be called human, for they will not reach their Hand to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist any person in the greatest necessity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the year 1292, and according to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Account 700, the <hi>Pagan Galacama</hi> was in quiet possession of this Kingdom, and disturbed it to deprive his Brother of the Kingdom of <hi>Champanel,</hi> left him by his Father. <hi>Galacarna</hi> employed two Brothers as Generals upon his Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:54711:481"/>
                        <hi>Madana,</hi> one of them had the most beautiful Woman of that Country to Wife. She was of the Race of <hi>Padaminii,</hi> who are affirmed, besides their comely Shape, to have so sweet a Scent in their Skin, that they communicate it to their Cloaths, which makes them esteemed above all o others. With much reason, for it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to find a Woman that has a good smell. Yet not impossible. They say there are scarce any of these Women in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but many in <hi>Orixa.</hi> There is no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief without a Woman, even where they have an ill favour; how much more where one smelt well! The King in love with this Wife of <hi>Madana,</hi> tried all means to gain her; but she being chaste (which was doubtless the sweet Smell) acquainted her Husband and Brother, who joining with <hi>Xiath Nosaradim,</hi> King of <hi>Delhi,</hi> on whom the Covetousness of that Kingdom prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they wasted the Kingdom of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> till <hi>Galacarna</hi> was at last slain in Battel. <hi>Nosaradim</hi> lest <hi>Habedxiath</hi> his General to conquer the Remainder. He rewarded the two Brothers who brought him to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and retured home, having made the Kings of <hi>Mandou</hi> and <hi>Chitor</hi> tributary. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saradim</hi> soon after being killed by his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, Civil Wars ensued, and several Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors revolting, called themselves Kings, as did <hi>Habedxiath,</hi> to whom <hi>Moors</hi> succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The year 1330, <hi>Hamet</hi> the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Tartar,</hi> who lived in the City <hi>Cambaya,</hi>

with the assistance of <hi>Arabs, Persians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Rumes,</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> usurped great part of this Kingdom, then possessed by <hi>Desingue Rao.</hi> What he had tyrannically gained, he prudently maintained. <hi>Ale Cham</hi> succeeded him, and had forty Sons, and three of them were Kings. The first <hi>Peruxiath,</hi> who succeeded him, the second <hi>Azeide Cham,</hi> who by his Wife got the Kingdom of <hi>Mandou,</hi> and the third <hi>Ale Cham,</hi> who with his Wife had the Kingdom of <hi>Agimar,</hi> bordering on that of <hi>Chitor.

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Badur</hi> desiring to take off <hi>Melique Saca,</hi> Commander of <hi>Diu,</hi> sent for him upon pretence of Business, but he excused himself upon other pretences, and so stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

His Friends at <hi>Diu</hi> brought thither from <hi>Madrefahat</hi> his Brothor <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Tocam. Badur,</hi> the other being fled, had like to have killed this, but for some Reasons was obliged to pardon him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but he destroyed many. He set out for <hi>Champanel</hi> the year 1527, where were brought to him sorty <hi>French</hi> Men, and one <hi>Stephen Dias Brigas,</hi> a <hi>Portuguese,</hi> who for some Crimes done in his Country, fled into <hi>France,</hi> and came to <hi>India,</hi> Captain of a Ship of that Nation; at <hi>Diu</hi> they were all taken, and sent to <hi>Badur,</hi> by whom they were all miserably put to death.</p>
                     <p n="7">7.

His Design was disappointed, being forced to turn himself to <hi>Doitabad,</hi> a great Town, taken by <hi>Nizamaluco,</hi> and tho he recovered it, it was with great loss, some by the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as being Winter, and some by a Shower of Stones as big as Oranges. At <hi>Champanel</hi> he found certain Men of the Kingdom of the <hi>Colii,</hi> who said they came to receive Tribute, which he paid by fleying them
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:54711:483"/>
alive. The year 1529 he marched with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty thousand Horse, and two hundred thousand Foot, and did great harm in the Territories of <hi>Nizamaluco.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Mean while <hi>Babor Paxiath,</hi> King of the <hi>Mogols</hi> and <hi>Delhi,</hi> marched upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Answer given to his Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors the year before. The King of <hi>Chitor</hi> denyed him passage, and in a Battel there was such a slaughter, the <hi>Mogol</hi> was forced to go back to raise new Forces to prosecute his first Design. But the King of <hi>Chitor</hi> pursuing and doing him great damage in his own Country, he desisted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Badur</hi> fell upon the King of <hi>Mandou,</hi> whom he treacherously slew. Then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned the Sons, giving the Mother and Daughters to his Favourites. Next he killed some Officers of that Kingdom who had helped to bring him in.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Salabedin,</hi> one pardoned by <hi>Badur,</hi> fearful of his favour, getting away, secured himself in a strong Castle, whence <hi>Badur</hi> drew him by policy, and forced him to turn <hi>Mahometan.</hi> Then he prepared to take the Fort and mountain <hi>Raosinga,</hi> where <hi>Salahedin</hi> left his Son when he was deceived by <hi>Badur</hi>'s promises; and by the way designed to expel the King of <hi>Chitor,</hi> Son to him, who kindly entertained him when he fled for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Father. This young King brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resisted <hi>Badur,</hi> disappointed his Design, and made him return to the other against <hi>Raosinga,</hi> a place almost impregnable by art and nature. Here eight <hi>Portugueses</hi> who

followed him, shewed their usual Valour, <hi>Francis Tarares</hi> being the first who scaled a Bulwark.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Botiparao,</hi> the Son of <hi>Salahedin,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his resistance might occasion his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death, left that City, and went to recover another, the Besieged surrendered. <hi>Badur</hi> perceiving <hi>Salahedin</hi>'s Women came not out, asked the cause of him, and sent in to know it, they answered, <hi>They would not come out unless with him.</hi> He was sent to that effect by the King. His Wives and Slaves (above five hundred in number) as soon as they saw him, exclaimed against his turning <hi>Mahemetan,</hi> and shewing him a heap of Wood, said, <hi>They would sooner burn themselves with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

Yet <hi>Badur</hi> saved almost a million and half of the Remainder of this Destruction.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Salahedin,</hi> and those who died with him, were honorably buried. The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he gave to Sultan <hi>Alamo,</hi> who came to him, forced from that place whither <hi>Botipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao</hi> went from hence. Hearing there was a <hi>Portugues</hi> Fleet at <hi>Diu,</hi> he flew thither with precipitation. But that being no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of danger, he returned to the Conquest of <hi>Chitor,</hi> with one hundred thousand Horse,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:54711:484"/>
innumerable Foot, and six hundred Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noh. He incamped in the higher Grounds about that City, tho it was like <hi>Raasinga,</hi> it was battered the space of two months, and capitulated, and now <hi>Badur</hi> was possessed of three Kingdoms, each of which was considerable.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. This was the time when <hi>Tristan de Ga</hi> was at the Court of <hi>Badur,</hi> by <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi>'s Order, to treat of Peace, which was delayed by sundry Accidents, chiefly the death of the King of the <hi>Mogols,</hi> whom he much feared.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Badur,</hi> through Covetousness, cut off the Pay of many that had served, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned above four thousand of Note to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert to the <hi>Mogol. Mujate Cham,</hi> a prudent and notable Man, represented this to him, and he, to reward his Advice, sent him on some other pretence to <hi>Diu,</hi> with orders to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Tocam</hi> to kill him. But <hi>Melique</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating the wickedness of <hi>Badur,</hi> advised the innocent <hi>Mujate Cham</hi> to fly. <hi>Mujate,</hi> instead of flying to save himself, returned to <hi>Badur,</hi> before whom being prostrate, and delivering his own Cymiter, he said, <hi>If I have deserved death of you, here is the Traitor and the Sword. If you please to kill me, I can have no greater honor than to die by your Hand, tho my Grandfather, Father and self have deserved better.</hi> The King was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, received him with honor, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed new Favours on him.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. But his Rage was turned against <hi>Melique Tocam</hi> for discovering the private
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:54711:484"/>
Order, so he sent <hi>Rume Cham</hi> to kill him. He got into <hi>Diu,</hi> where <hi>Melique</hi> was not at that time, but received advice of it at a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-House where he was diverting himself, and fled. <hi>Badur</hi> came to the City, and with his usual craft brought it under. At the same time arrived there <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> in order to that Interview, which took no effect.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. It took no effect, because <hi>Badur</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made any Proposals but to shift off a danger, which he greatly feared from the <hi>Mogol,</hi> and hoping to agree with him, he was willing to break with the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> But he was deceived, for that Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called his Embassadors, and commenced the War. Let us see who this <hi>Mogol</hi> is.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Continues the Government of <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> from the Year 1534, in the Reign of King <hi>John</hi> the Third.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Mogols</hi> call themselves <hi>Chacatais,</hi> in the same manner as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call themselves <hi>Goths. Chacata</hi> is the Name of the Province they inhabit near <hi>Turque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi> and the Nobles suffer not themselves to be called <hi>Mogols.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi> write
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:54711:485"/>
they are descended from <hi>Mogog,</hi> Grandson to <hi>Noah,</hi> from whom they received the Worship of one only God. This Nation wandring through many Provinces, got the best footing in <hi>Mogalia,</hi> or <hi>Mogostan,</hi> called by <hi>Ptolomey, Paropanisus;</hi> now they stretch farther, and border upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>Horacam,</hi> which that Author calls <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> or <hi>Here,</hi> now the Metropolis thereof. The <hi>Mogols</hi> go from the North to drink the Waters of the River <hi>Geum,</hi> that runs through <hi>Bactria,</hi> so called from its Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis <hi>Bactria,</hi> or <hi>Bohara</hi> (a famous place for Learning, being the Remains of great <hi>Zoroastes,</hi> where <hi>Avicen</hi> got the Learning that made him so famous) neighbouring upon <hi>Sogdiana,</hi> now called <hi>Quiximir,</hi> and mount <hi>Caucasus,</hi> which divides <hi>India</hi> from other Northern Provinces. This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom now reaches to the mountainous <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veti</hi> and <hi>Bagous,</hi> which they call <hi>Angou.</hi> As there are in it great Mountains, so there are most large and fruitful Plains, watered by five Rivers, which compose the famous <hi>Indus.</hi> They are <hi>Bet, Satinague, Chanao, Rave</hi> and <hi>Rea.</hi> The Cities are many, the Men couragious.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Mogols</hi> are <hi>Mohometans,</hi> their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Persian,</hi> they are well shaped, white, and have small Eyes like the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Chineses.</hi> The Nobility wear rich and gay Cloaths, fashioned like the <hi>Persians,</hi> their Beards long. The Women are beautiful. Their military Dress is no less costly, their Arms being gilt and polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:54711:485"/>
they are singular at the Bow. In fight violent, and of good conduct: they use Artillery. Their King is treated with great Majesty, is seldom seen, his Guard two thousand Horse every quarter.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Mogols</hi> and <hi>Patanes</hi> both equally strove to conquer <hi>India.</hi> They were Neighbours. The Event of War and Treachery brought the <hi>Patanes</hi> and <hi>Delhi</hi> under the Subjection of the <hi>Mogol,</hi> at the time when <hi>Babor Paxiath,</hi> great Grandson to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> the Great, reigned among them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Omaum,</hi> Son of <hi>Babor,</hi> now broke with <hi>Badur,</hi> King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> who to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the War sent twenty thousand Horse, and a multitude of Foot upon his Enemies Frontiers. Here it may appear, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude never escapes unpunished. The Queen <hi>Crementii,</hi> who had saved <hi>Badur</hi>'s Life, and in return was by him deprived of her Liberty and Kingdom of <hi>Chitor,</hi> now revenged her self on him, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He by his Embassadors required her to send him her Son with what Men she could to serve against the <hi>Mogol.</hi> The Queen desired he would restore her other Son, whom he kept as an Hostage, that she might not be deprived of both, and that the mean while she would raise the Forces. <hi>Badur</hi> not diving into her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, sent him, and she immediately put her self into the protection of the <hi>Mogol Badur</hi> enraged at this Action, gathered one hundred thousand Horse, four hundred and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:54711:486"/>
fifteen thousand Foot, a thousand Cannon, many of great Bulk, six hundred armed Elephants, and six thousand Carriages. This multitude marched in great order, and was abundantly supplyed with all things.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He besieged the City <hi>Chitor,</hi> and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it furiously; but tho the besieged re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great damage, they did him much more. <hi>Badur</hi> now raging, received the News that the <hi>Mogols</hi> had slain twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of the Men he sent to ravage their Country. He vented his passion upon the City, and at last more by policy than strength became Master of it, having lost fifteen thousand Men, among them four <hi>Portugueses.</hi> The Queen with the choice of her Riches fled. <hi>Badur</hi> used no Cruelty towards the City, but repaired it against future dangers, leaving <hi>Mina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap> Hozem</hi> to command in it with twelve thousand Men. Then he marched towards his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who advanced victorious through the Kingdom of <hi>Mandou,</hi> in order to relieve <hi>Chitor,</hi> and being now informed it was in possession of <hi>Badur,</hi> and that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched about <hi>Doçor, Omaum</hi> marched thither, and encamped.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Badur</hi> found the greatest danger where he sought security; for being incamped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a River and a Lake, and <hi>Omaum</hi> before him, the resort of Provisions was quite cut off, so that in few days they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered extreme Famine, and such as went out to seek Relief, fell into the Hands of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:54711:486"/>
the Enemy, as did <hi>Coraçam Cham</hi> with two thousand Horse.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This so disheartened <hi>Badur,</hi> that he stole away, and his Camp was plundered by the <hi>Mogols,</hi> who found there vast Riches. <hi>Badur</hi> with all speed fled towards <hi>Mandou,</hi> accompanied by <hi>Rume Cham,</hi> and some <hi>Portugueses,</hi> being left by many persons of Note, and particularly <hi>Melique Liaz,</hi> for the murder of his two Brothers. In fine, very little of that mighty Army escaped the Sword or Famine, and what did was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed and disarmed. <hi>Badur</hi> got into <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dou,</hi> having slipped ten thousand <hi>Mogols,</hi> who thought to prevent his reaching that place.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Badur</hi> fortified this City, and gave the chief Command to <hi>Rume Cham</hi> his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. <hi>Omaum</hi> hearing of it, lengthened his Marches to come upon him. <hi>Rume Cham,</hi> now fearful of his Master, deserts to <hi>Omaum, Rume</hi>'s Wife, Daughter and Riches were at <hi>Champanel. Badur</hi> and <hi>Rume</hi> strove who should first secure <hi>Champanel,</hi> the former ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there one (tho the least) of his three Treasures, which only in Copper-Mony was worth thirty Millions, besides Pearls, Precious Stones, and other things of value, with this Treasure he sent <hi>Rume</hi>'s Family and Riches under a strong Guard to <hi>Diu,</hi> whilst he himself hearing the approach of <hi>Omaum,</hi> wasted the Country, and destroyed the Artillery, lest it should fall into the Enemies Hands. The same he did at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap> Rume Cham</hi> seeing his Wife and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:54711:487"/>
Riches were carried away, obtained of his new Master five thousand Horse to follow them. As he entered one Gate of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya, Badur</hi> was going out at another, who seeing himself so close pursued by <hi>Rume,</hi> left his Women and Riches by the way, that they might put a stop to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit. So it fell out, for <hi>Rume Cham</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Champanel,</hi> and <hi>Badur</hi> got to <hi>Diu,</hi> whilst <hi>Omaum</hi> was at <hi>Champanel</hi> dividing his Kingdom, and conquering that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable place with Liberality.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Champanel</hi> was impregnable by Art and Nature, and the <hi>Mogols</hi> not used to spend time even in easie Sieges, but Tyrants have nothing secure, so these Rocks which might have been a secure Retreat to him, turned against <hi>Badur.</hi> This mountain is thirty Leagues from the Sea, and yet visible thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ascent of it being almost five Leagues. Where Nature left any passage, Art supplyed it with strong Walls. The City stands on the side of it, has sightly Buildings, twenty thousand Families, and a great Trade. The City it self is not walled, but there are many places upon the Mountain well fortified, strongly garrisoned and stored with Cannon. Somewhat higher is the Royal Palace, wonderful for Structure and Greatness, and on the top a Fort can terrifie the most daring. Here <hi>Badur</hi> found no security, for Tyrants can meet none in the World, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves between Sheets, when they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the strongest Walls, and when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:54711:487"/>
the finest Sheets they imagine they lie upon Thorns.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. These Misfortunes were the Motives that induced <hi>Badur</hi> to consent to our raising the Fort at <hi>Diu.</hi> Before, to secure our Friendship against the <hi>Mogol,</hi> he had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered <hi>Baçaim</hi> to <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> and now in hopes of our assistance to recover what was lost, he offered <hi>Diu. Badur</hi> sent to dispose <hi>Martin Alphonso de Sousa,</hi> who was at <hi>Chaul,</hi> and he urged the necessity of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Fort, giving advice hereof to <hi>Nuno,</hi> and desiring leave to go treat about this important Affair. <hi>Cuna</hi> refused him leave; jealous that any but himself should compass a matter so much desired by his Prince, and sent his own Secretary Embassador to <hi>Badur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. Still <hi>Badur</hi> struggled with his Pride, and thought to get assistance from the <hi>Turk</hi> to recover his Kingdom. To this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect he sent <hi>Saf Cham</hi> Embassador with a rich Present, but hearing the <hi>Mogol</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Champanel,</hi> utterly despaired. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to fly to <hi>Meca,</hi> and there wait the <hi>Turks</hi> Answer, but his Mother and Friends dissuaded him, advising to grant leave to the <hi>Portugueses</hi> to raise the Fort at <hi>Diu,</hi> and by their assistance his Fortune might be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. Instantly he sent to offer it to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Alphonso</hi> at <hi>Chaul,</hi> whither also came a Message from the <hi>Mogol</hi> with the same Offer.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> having sent advice to the Governor, asked not a second time for

At Sea he met the Secretary <hi>Simon Ferryra,</hi> and both arrived at <hi>Diu</hi> on the twenty first of <hi>September.</hi> They soon came to an agreement upon these Articles, That <hi>Badur</hi> confirmed all that had been done relating to <hi>Baçaim;</hi> that something which concerned Trade should be transferred thence to <hi>Diu,</hi> that there should be a League offensive and defensive between the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> and him, that the Fort should be raised, where and in what manner the Governor should appoint, that a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark upon the Sea should immediately be delivered to him, that they should not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the King's Revenues at <hi>Diu, &amp;c.</hi> Immediately a <hi>Iew</hi> and an <hi>Armenian</hi> were sent to <hi>Portugal</hi> with this News to the King; and to the Governor at <hi>Goa, Iames de Mesquita,</hi> one of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> who ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Badur</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Chitor,</hi> that King desiring that <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> would instantly come to <hi>Diu.</hi>

                     <p n="14">14.

The King was greatly pleased with the News, and <hi>Iames Botello</hi> restored to the Royal Favour, without any other Reward for this prodigious Action.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> began the Work with diligence, and a great number of Hands, being himself the first that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured at the Foundation, which was done, with Sound of Trumpets, Fifes, Drums, Noise of Cannon and Shouts.

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:54711:490"/>
Vaz de Sampayo,</hi> the King of <hi>Achem</hi> had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be killed <hi>Simon de Sousa,</hi> and others, bound for <hi>Maluco,</hi> and taken others prisoners. He feigned to be sorry for that Action, and sent three of the Prisoners to <hi>Peter de Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> then commanding the first time at <hi>Malaca,</hi> offering Peace, and desiring him to send persons fit to treat of it, and he would deliver to them <hi>Sousa</hi> his Galley, and the other Prisoners. This was much for the ease of <hi>Malaca,</hi> and therefore <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> sent presently a Vessel with some <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> who were all killed by that Tyrants Order before they came to him. Six months after <hi>Garcia de Sa</hi> then commanding, the King writ a Letter to him, saying, He wondered no Body was sent to treat of Peace; believing by reason of the Secresie used in murdering the others, it was not known; and at the same time caused the Prisoners he had (whom, to compass his wicked ends, he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kindly) to write to the Commander about it. <hi>Sa</hi> presently sent a Gallion well provided with Men and Cannon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Emanuel Pacheco,</hi> who suffered himself to be circumvented by the King's Barques, and he with most of the Men were slain, the Gallion was carried for the King to see, who then caused the rest of the men, and the prisoners he made much of to be killed. Then he joined with the King of <hi>Aru,</hi> and all this to the intent to gain <hi>Malaca,</hi> having intelligence with <hi>Sinaya Raja,</hi> a considerable <hi>Moor,</hi> who
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:54711:490"/>
lived in that City. The Correspondence being discovered by some drunken <hi>Achemes,</hi> produced the publick safety and death of <hi>Sinaya,</hi> who was thrown headlong from a Tower by <hi>Garcia de Sa</hi> his order.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The year 1530 <hi>Gonçalo Pereyra</hi> set out from <hi>Malaca</hi> for <hi>Maluco,</hi> and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance to the Governor's Order, by the way visited the King of <hi>Borneo,</hi> offering him liberty to trade at <hi>Malaca. Borneo</hi> is an Island fruitful of Provisions, rich in costly Merchandize, and produces the finest Diamonds. The King is powerful, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> so his People. The City of that Name is large, has beautyful Buildings and strong Walls. The Island has four principal Ports, to which resort Merchants from sundry parts. The Offer pleased the King. <hi>Gonçalo Pereyra</hi> arriving at <hi>Ternate, D. George de Meneses</hi> delivered him the Fort, and King <hi>Cachil Daialo,</hi> who was there prisoner. The Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had fled from her City as was before related, hearing of the new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, sent to put him in mind, how kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King her Husband had received the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> how ungrateful the Return had been from them, who caused his Son and Heir to die in a prison, and now kept the other, and obliged her their Mother to fly to the Mountains, having lost the City where she was born, and whereof she was Queen. That she demanded Reparation of <hi>D. George</hi> his Cruelty, and Liberty for her Son. After some Scruples <hi>Gonçalo Pereyra</hi>
                        <pb n="384" facs="tcp:54711:491"/>
solemnly swore he would set him at liberty as soon as opportunity served, whereupon she returned to the City, and they agreed; as did the King of <hi>Tidore,</hi> being eased of a Tribute, imposed by <hi>D. George,</hi> which he was not able to pay. There was also an Accommodation with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Captain <hi>Ferdinand de la Torre.</hi> Thus things were settled as was suitable to the <hi>Portugues</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>Gonçalo Pereyra,</hi> in pursuance of the Governor's Orders made <hi>D. George</hi> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner. He was carried to <hi>Goa,</hi> thence to <hi>Portugal,</hi> whence he was banished to <hi>Brasil,</hi> and killed by the Heathens there in a Battel. After this <hi>Gonçalo Pereyra</hi> examined the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the <hi>Portugues</hi> Officers of the Revenue, and found them guilty of great Frauds. They offended at this Discovery, conspired with the Queen to kill him, which they executed, tho he defended himself with Resolution, yet most of the Murderers were killed by the other <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Fort which was in great danger of being lost, and <hi>Luis de Andrade</hi> kept the Command as Lieutenant.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. <hi>Bras Pereyra,</hi> who commanded by Sea, would have succeeded his Kinsman. But the Conspirators elected <hi>Vincent Fonseca</hi> one of their Companions. He having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the Queen her Sons Liberty, if she would assist him in obtaining that Post, now loaded him with Irons, and secured his Brothers and Family. She withdrawing into the Country, stopped all provisions
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:54711:491"/>
from coming to the Fort, and so obliged him to set her Son free, and all was appeased for the present.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. This Quiet lasted not long; for the King being near of Age to govern, <hi>Pate Sarangue,</hi> who governed for him, finding his power expiring, conspired with <hi>Fonseca,</hi> to set up <hi>Tabarija,</hi> the King's Bastard Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was younger. To this effect they began to lay several scandalous Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon the King, and <hi>Fonseca</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to secure him, which he having notice of fled to the Mountain. <hi>Fonseca</hi> follows, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending he had a Design upon the Fort. The King might have defended himself, but forbore in respect to the <hi>Portugueses</hi> whom he loved. He fled with his Mother to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore.</hi> His Enemies set up <hi>Tabarija,</hi> and following to <hi>Tidore,</hi> oblige both Kings to seek security in the Mountains. <hi>Fonseca</hi> was the more inraged against the King for that at his return a <hi>Moor</hi> had killed his Son, and endeavoured to slay <hi>Tabarija,</hi> who escaped; and because many obeyed not the Usurper, calling him <hi>Fonseca</hi>'s King, whereas they might more properly term <hi>Fonseca, Tabarija</hi>'s King. He sent <hi>Pate Sarangue</hi> with Forces, and subdued all. He by treachery catched the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and gave her as Wife to <hi>Sarangue,</hi> and the deposed King's Wife to the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The distressed King leaving his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Friends had recourse to the King of <hi>Gilolo</hi>'s Courtesie.</p>

23. Now <hi>Fonseca</hi> sends <hi>Blas Pereyra</hi> and others prisoners to <hi>India.</hi> The Governor informed of the Insolences committed at <hi>Ternate,</hi> sent <hi>Tristant de Altaide</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand there, who secured <hi>Fonseca,</hi> and sent him to <hi>Goa.</hi> With him went the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from <hi>Gilolo,</hi> in order to be sent to <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Portugues</hi> Ships. But the King of <hi>Gilolo</hi> refusing to surrender the <hi>Spaniards, Tristan</hi> was obliged to go with a power, in which the Kings of <hi>Ternate, Tidore</hi> and <hi>Bacham</hi> joined, the City was abandoned and burnt, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> set at liberty.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. <hi>Tristan de Ataide,</hi> at the instigation of <hi>Samarao,</hi> put <hi>Tabarija</hi> in prison, and set up his younger Brother <hi>Cachil Aeiro.</hi> The King's Mother and <hi>Sarangue</hi> were also se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and the City became desolate, the Natives of it finding no Comfort in their Neighbours, who upbraided them for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting so wicked a People as the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> who since they had footing in this Island were guilty of the most exorbitant Villanies that could be imagined. In fine, <hi>Ataide</hi> sent those Prisoners to <hi>Goa,</hi> for the Crimes he was guilty of himself, and so <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> judged it, taking care to send them back to their Country.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. Now <hi>Tristan de Ataide</hi> employed his Thoughts on the Profit he designed to make by the Sale of Cloves, and ordered it so, that the King of <hi>Bacham</hi> would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. <hi>Tristan</hi> in a rage sent his Men armed, the King protested he was a faithful Friend to the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> but they sought
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:54711:492"/>
Spice for themselves, not Friendship for their King. So they were convinced by the Sword, many killed, and the rest were shamefully put to flight. <hi>Tristan</hi> in a greater fury joining with the Kings of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> and <hi>Tidore,</hi> forced him of <hi>Bacham</hi> to abandon his City, which was destroyed, and to sue for peace, which was sold him for a Tribute to be paid in Cloves. Yet at the same time this King conspires with those of <hi>Gilolo, Tidore</hi> and the deposed of <hi>Ternate,</hi> and with <hi>Samarao</hi> to kill <hi>Ataide,</hi> and take the Fort. They began their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign by persuading him to send Ships several ways, where he lost many Men, and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chil Daialo,</hi> the deposed King of <hi>Ternate,</hi> laying hold of the opportunity, recovered part of his Kingdom, with the assistance of those of <hi>Gilolo, Tidore, Bacham, Maquiem</hi> and <hi>Moutel,</hi> with whose aid the <hi>Ternates</hi> slew all the <hi>Portugueses</hi> about the Island. <hi>Ataide</hi> prepared to take revenge, when <hi>Simon Sodre</hi> arrived from <hi>Malaca</hi> with a Ship and many Men, that brought new life to the desperate <hi>Ataide,</hi> and put him in a posture to recover some places.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. The <hi>Moors</hi> endeavoured to burn some of our Vessels, bringing to execute this design almost three hundred Sail, they received some damage, but would not desist, nor hearken to <hi>Ataide,</hi> who sued for Peace, being in the Fort, and reduced to eat all sorts of Vermin. <hi>D.

This Success was answered by a Misfortune, for all the Inhabitants fled from <hi>Ternate,</hi> and the <hi>Moors</hi> killed some of his Men, and took a Ship, but now a new Captain comes to the Fort, which stood in need of it. <hi>Tristan de Ataide</hi> was as deformed of Body as his Actions were scandalous.

                     <p n="1">1. WE have already related how the Empire of <hi>Decan</hi> by the death of <hi>Mahomet Xiath,</hi> was divided into seven parts, by as many Governors who set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up as Kings, and warring among themselves were reduced to five. The first and chief of these was <hi>Hidalcam,</hi> whose Territories lie from North to South along the Sea Coast from the River <hi>Domel,</hi> eight Leagues off <hi>Dabul,</hi> to <hi>Cintacola,</hi> eleven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Goa,</hi> and has sixty Leagues in length, and fifty in breadth where largest.

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:54711:493"/>
Melique Verido,</hi> and <hi>Cotamaluco,</hi> which make the five into which that Crown was divided. <hi>Cotamaluco</hi> and <hi>Verido</hi> were at war because the former reflected upon the latter, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal to the dead King, as if either of them were innocent. <hi>Cota</hi> came off with loss.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Hidalcam</hi> upon such like occasion took Arms against <hi>Cotamaluco,</hi> who was then at <hi>Golconda,</hi> a City almost impregnable, being seated upon an inaccessible mountain, well fortified and garrisoned. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> set down before it with one hundred thousand Horse, and four hundred thousand Foot. <hi>Cota,</hi> not without reason, was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of this danger, but reposed great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in twelve <hi>Portugueses</hi> he had with him. The Enemy the first Attacks lost twenty thousand Men, and afterwards an hundred thousand, as well by Famine as Sword, for <hi>Catamaluco</hi> cut off all his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and such parties as went out for them, and of what he took he sent ten thousand to <hi>Hidalcan</hi> without Ears or Noses, bidding him put upon them those of his Men he had served so the last War.

These were <hi>Mulacam,</hi> who was received as Heir, and <hi>Abraham,</hi> who could not brook his being owned as such, and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by <hi>Cotamaluco</hi> and others, disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the common Peace, and was at last himself taken prisoner.</p>

6. The new <hi>Hidalcan</hi> (I mean <hi>Abraham,</hi> for those Princes, when they come to the Crown, all take this Title) was perplexed with the Proceedings of <hi>Açadacam,</hi> and endeavoured to reconcile him. <hi>Açada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam</hi>'s Forces at this time ravaged all the Continent about <hi>Goa,</hi> and <hi>Hidalcan</hi> made fresh Instances to bring him to his Court, but to no effect. Mean while the desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Country was such, that the Natives freely offered it up to <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> he, after conferring about it with <hi>Açada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,</hi> accepted the Offer to deliver that Country from utter Ruin.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Açadacam</hi> was a <hi>Mahometan</hi> as well in his Dealing, as Belief. The more to perplex <hi>Hidalcam,</hi> he goes into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the King of <hi>Bisuagar,</hi> who received him with great honor. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> was not exempted from his Frauds; therefore to carry on his Designs, he persuaded him to send <hi>Christopher de Figueredo,</hi> promising to prevail with the King of <hi>Bisnagar</hi> to resign to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> the Continent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Goa,</hi> to which he had an ancient Title. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> being informed of these Proceedings encamped near him of <hi>Bisnagar</hi> with four hundred thousand Men, and 700 Elephants, the other had a 1000 Elephants more, and some thousands of Men. He sent to let him know, that according to former Agreements, he ought to deliver up to him his Slave <hi>Açadacam.</hi> The King of <hi>Bisnagar</hi> referred it to <hi>Açadacam</hi> himself to give the Answer, and he gave it such as deceived,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:54711:495"/>
and at the same time was approved of.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But the King was soon undeceived; for <hi>Açadacam,</hi> who had done all this only to better his Fortunes, now went over to <hi>Hidalcam,</hi> when least he expected it. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamaluco,</hi> who had joined <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Açadacam,</hi> seeing him received with great honor, goes over to the King of <hi>Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagar,</hi> who was marching to besiege the City <hi>Rachol,</hi> which he had before taken, and had again submitted to <hi>Hidalcam.</hi> At last these Princes came to a Composition, parting the Territory of that City, which fell to the Lot of <hi>Hidalcam. Açadacam,</hi> by order of his Master, marched after <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamaluco</hi> to the City <hi>Naiteguir</hi> taken by him, and recovered it, and obliging him to put himself into <hi>Hidalcam</hi>'s Power, with a Grand daughter he had offered him to Wife. The Wedding reconciled all this Discord.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. King <hi>Badur</hi> pretended by an ancient Custom of <hi>Indostan</hi> to have the power of giving the Title of King. He sent the Royal Ensigns to <hi>Hidalcam,</hi> desiring he should acknowledge him as his Predecessors had done: but <hi>Hidalcam</hi> accepted his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and rejected the Title. <hi>Badur</hi>'s inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to secure <hi>Hidalcam</hi> against the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> to whom he owed the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of his Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Açadacam,</hi> being suspicious of <hi>Hidalcam,</hi> endeavoured to be far from him, and to this end prevailed with <hi>Cotamaluco</hi> to return home and declare war. <hi>Hidalcam</hi> discovered the Author of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:54711:495"/>
this Discord, and would have killed him, but the Design being disclosed, <hi>Azadacam</hi> threw himself at his Feet with two hundred thousand <hi>Pardaos</hi> of Gold, begging pardon, tho he said he had done nothing to ask par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for. Thus he bought his Life, and <hi>Hidalcam</hi> sold his safety. Such is the power of Gifts, even over those who can give greater.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Hidalcam</hi> now bent his thoughts upon recovering the Lands about <hi>Goa. Açadacam,</hi> who had been the cause that <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> took them, now was the promoter of his Master's demanding them. <hi>Nuno</hi> referred the Answer to <hi>Diu,</hi> whither he was going, being sent for by King <hi>Badur,</hi> at his arrival almost despoiled of his Crown. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no answer, but suddenly <hi>Solyman Aga</hi> invaded those Lands with almost six thousand Men. They began to hinder the carrying Provisions to <hi>Goa. D. Iohn Perey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who then commanded, sent to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>Solymam</hi> of the Injustice of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, but he gave no ear to it, and killed some <hi>Portugueses</hi> not without receiving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable damage. He besieged <hi>Christopher de Figueredo</hi> in the Fort of <hi>Mandor,</hi> to whose relief came <hi>Iordan de Freytas,</hi> with some Men, sent by <hi>D. Iohn,</hi> so the <hi>Turk</hi> raised the Siege, and fled as far as <hi>Margam.</hi>
                     </p>

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:54711:496"/>
within an hour and half. <hi>Don Iohn</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Messenger to force the <hi>Turk,</hi> in case he obeyed not, but finding he did, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Solyman</hi> halted at <hi>Ponda,</hi> from whence he made fresh Instances to <hi>D. Iohn</hi> to resign those Lands to <hi>Hidalcan.</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, he acknowledged him not as his Minister, and prepared for War. He built the Fort of <hi>Rachol,</hi> where some Blood was spilt, <hi>Solyman</hi> endeavouring to obstruct it, who lost three thousand Men about <hi>Bailim</hi> and <hi>Singuizar,</hi> slain by the <hi>Gentils,</hi> assisted by two hundred <hi>Portugueses. Iordan de Freytas,</hi> with fifty Men, routed the <hi>Turk Sarnabose,</hi> sent by <hi>Solyman</hi> with five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. <hi>Emanuel Vasconcelos</hi> razed a Bulwark the Enemy was making in the Pass of <hi>Borii,</hi> and burnt some Houses. <hi>Solyman</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as far as <hi>Margam. Pereyra</hi> went to meet him with five hundred <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and seven hundred <hi>Canaras</hi> The Fight began, the <hi>Canaras</hi> and some <hi>Portugueses</hi> gave way, terrified with strange Fire-works made by a Witch, who in Man's Cloaths sought to revenge the Death of her Husband. <hi>Perey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> seeing this Disorder, advanced, crying out, <hi>Let who will follow me, for I hope with the help of God to overcome the Enemy.</hi> All following his Example, <hi>Solyman</hi> quitted the Field, having lost eight hundred Men, on our side not one was killed. The Booty was considerable.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Mean while <hi>Açadacam</hi> attempted to recover these same Lands, but met no great
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:54711:496"/>
success, for <hi>Hidalcam</hi> endeavoured thus to divert him, while he gained his City of <hi>Bilgam,</hi> where his Riches lay. At length they agreed, and <hi>Açadacam</hi> designed again to attempt the Dependences of <hi>Goa.</hi> He proceeded not with Vigor, being conscious, <hi>Nuno</hi> had by his advice possessed himself of them, and because he had lately received a Message from him after his Return from <hi>Diu.</hi> Yet in conclusion he marched as far as <hi>Ponda</hi> with twenty thousand Men.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. From that place he sent a Letter of <hi>Hidalcam</hi> to <hi>Cuna,</hi> demanding those Lands. The Answer was, He held them by consent of <hi>Açadacam,</hi> that if he desired war the <hi>Portugueses</hi> were not backward, and that he could not restore them, or raze the Fort of <hi>Rachol</hi> without his King's Consent. <hi>Aça<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacam</hi> fearing his Master would take his City, acted not much on this side. So there happened no considerable Action.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Now the Answer of <hi>Hidalcam</hi> was brought, containing, That since <hi>Açadacam</hi> was the Cause of his taking those Lands, he would stand by what should be agreed between them. Both cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ing the same thing for themselves, they came to no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. <hi>Cuna</hi> relieved <hi>Vasco Fernandez</hi> who was in some distress, and they put the Enemy to flight. Hearing the Enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared now in greater Numbers, he sent <hi>Don Iohn Pereyra</hi> with one hundred and thirty Horse, six hundred <hi>Portugues</hi> Foot, and one thousand <hi>Canaras,</hi> commanded by <hi>Crisna,</hi> an honest Pagan. They found the Enemy
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:54711:497"/>
at the Foot of a Mountain, and attacked them with such Vigor, they presently fled, their Commander and many more were slain, on our side only four.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Açadacam,</hi> after these Losses, desired a Conference with <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> but it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not, so the Inroads were continued chiefly about <hi>Rachol,</hi> where our Cannon killed some. Winter expiring, <hi>Nuno</hi> began to act more vigorously. He sent <hi>Antony de Silveyra</hi> to the Continent with two hundred <hi>Canara</hi> Horse, and seventeen hundred <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugues</hi> Foot. <hi>Antony</hi> went three Leagues up the Country, making great havock, and killing three hundred <hi>Moors,</hi> and two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Officers, with loss of eight <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses.</hi> Mean while <hi>Gonzalo Vaz Coutinho</hi> destroyed the Coast of <hi>Dabul,</hi> and thence brought to <hi>Goa</hi> many Vessels taken, and three hundred Prisoners, and abundance of Provisions, which encreased the Joy of the other Victories, and relieved the City di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed for want.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The Clamours of that ruined People, and a Letter from <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> coming to <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> he ordered <hi>Açadacam</hi> to desist. He obeyed not, but to justifie his refusal, sent him a Present of a stately Horse and Cymiter, set with Jewels. <hi>Hidalcan</hi> going to take off a piece of Silk, in which the Cymiter was wrapped, was hindered by his Mother, who caused a Page to unfold it, he instantly fell down dead, as did two Men who were ordered to mount the Horse, Such was the Poison the Present
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:54711:497"/>
carried. Then the Queen looking upon her Son, said, <hi>Behold your Father's Murderer.</hi> For it was believed he had been poisoned. The Governor perceiving that <hi>Açadacam</hi> did not desist, sent <hi>Gonzalo Vaz Coutino</hi> with thirty Vessels and three hundred Men, half <hi>Canaras,</hi> who burnt the Town of <hi>Ponda,</hi> and many Ships, and returned with three hundred Prisoners. <hi>Azadacam</hi> in a rage marched towards <hi>Rachol,</hi> and opposite to it began to erect a Fort called <hi>Bori,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct our Sailing up the River of that Name; and notwithstanding our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, put it into such condition, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed formidable. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> sent a fresh Supply to hinder this Work, and they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulting it with more courage than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, four hundred of them were slain, and forty taken, whereof one appearing naked before <hi>Açadacam,</hi> he took off part of his own Garment to cover him, saying, <hi>The</hi> Portugueses <hi>were not to be so used.</hi> This Loss caused the demolishing the Fort of <hi>Rachol,</hi> which the Governor ordered <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> to execute. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence was required at <hi>Diu,</hi> and he fearing to leave <hi>Goa</hi> in danger, concluded a Peace with <hi>Açadacam.</hi> This was rather a Truce than Peace, for neither desisted from his pretensions, unless <hi>Açadacam</hi> did by going away from <hi>Ponda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">18. Whilst these things were in agitation at <hi>Goa,</hi> the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> marched to <hi>Cranganor,</hi> upon pretence of visiting those parts, as their Emperor, but in reality to
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:54711:498"/>
destroy the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> induced thereto by King <hi>Badur.</hi> Thence he designed to pass to <hi>Vaipaim,</hi> which being suspicious, <hi>Peter Vaz</hi> commanding at <hi>Cochin,</hi> endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, striving withall to avoid affronting him, or being faulty in his Duty. Having made provision by Sea and Land, he desired the King to desist from that Design. The King gave no ear to him, but sent many Ships to clear the Passage: but they failed, above a thousand of their Men being slain, and much damage received by <hi>Vincent de Fonseca</hi>'s Artillery, which guarded that Pass, many more flying with precipitation, were drowned. This happened near the Churches of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> and S. <hi>Iames,</hi> which they endeavoured to burn, but could not compass. The Passes were valiantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended all the Winter.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. On the nineteenth of <hi>September, Martin Alfonso de Sousa</hi> set out of <hi>Goa</hi> with one hundred and fifty Men in fifteen Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and passing by <hi>Calamute,</hi> two thousand <hi>Nayres</hi> would have kept him in, whereof he killed many, dispersed the rest, burnt their Town, and took seven Barques. He arrived at <hi>Cochin,</hi> where were five Ships newly come from <hi>Portugal.</hi> The King of <hi>Calicut</hi> understanding <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> was coming to meet him with almost a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men drew off. <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> now bent his Force against the King of <hi>Repelim,</hi> who had offended him of <hi>Cochin. Antony de Brito</hi> who had led the Van, met a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous opposition at this Island, till <hi>Martin</hi>
                        <pb n="399" facs="tcp:54711:498"/>
coming up they fled, who maintained the Outworks. The King retired to his City, in which were six thousand fighting Men. Next day <hi>Sousa</hi> attacked it, after some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance the King and all the Defendants fled. As <hi>Sousa</hi> entered a Mosque, he had like to be killed by a <hi>Moor,</hi> but receiving the Stroke on his Buckler, he run the <hi>Moor</hi> through with a Javelin. This Victory cost us fourteen Men, the City was plundered and reduced to Ashes. The principal part of the Booty that fell to the King of <hi>Cochin,</hi> on whose account this Action was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, was a piece of Marble, by him high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued, because on it were carved the Names of the Kings of <hi>Malabar</hi> for three thousand years past, which was taken from him by the King of <hi>Repelim;</hi> some Brass Plates with Serpents engraved on them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed a great Relick by the conquered King; and his Hat lost in the flight, which among them is the greatest Disgrace to the Conquered, and highest Glory to the Victor.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. The King of <hi>Calicut</hi> returns with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand Men to attempt the Pass of <hi>Cambalam. Martin Alfonso</hi> posts <hi>Francis de Barros de Payra</hi> to keep the Pass of <hi>Cranga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> with three Vessels, which proved of great use; he himself goes to the other, and landing, sees five thousand of the King's Men attempt to pass the Ford. Our Men began to fear, but he encouraging them, boldly falls on, and killing three hundred of the Enemy, made them turn
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:54711:499"/>
their Backs. <hi>Zamori</hi> comes up with the Gross of his Army, attempts the Ford, and is repulsed with equal loss. Now the Prince of <hi>Cochin</hi> joins us with twenty thousand <hi>Nayres. Martin Alfonso</hi> leaves <hi>Antony de Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> with them, and four hundred <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who in the space of twenty days fought six Battels with the King of <hi>Calicut,</hi> wherein he made such havock as obliged him to draw off with great Loss, and greater Shame.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. The Reason why <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> left that Post, was because, like a watchful Commander, he was at once in two places by his Vigilance, here in Body, and in Thought at Sea, where now appeared a powerful Fleet of <hi>Calicut.</hi> He therefore seeing the Valour of <hi>Brito,</hi> and the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of those <hi>Nayres,</hi> left him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand there, and put to Sea with three hundred <hi>Portugueses</hi> in eleven Ships. At <hi>Chale</hi> he met <hi>Iames Reynoso</hi> with five Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, <hi>Cutiale,</hi> Admiral of <hi>Calicut,</hi> had taken one from him, he took <hi>Reynoso</hi> with him. He went in search of <hi>Cutiale,</hi> and found him with twenty five Vessels, and in them fifteen hundred Men, some of our Vessels impatient of delay, advanced before the rest, and forced him to retire to <hi>Tiracole,</hi> whither <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> pursuing, the Fight lasted till night with great slaughter of the Enemy, who fortified themselves, and in the morning appeared six thousand strong, having flocked from all the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Just at this time came an Express
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:54711:499"/>
from the King of <hi>Cochin,</hi> desiring <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> to return with all speed, because the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> knowing he was absent was coming down with a fresh Power This Advice diverted any farther Action He returned, and the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> who came on, because he was absent, retired as soon as he knew he was present. So great is the Force of Conceit.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Mean while <hi>Madune Pandar,</hi> King of <hi>Ceitavaca,</hi> besieged his Brother of <hi>Cota,</hi> with a Fleet by Sea. <hi>Nuno Freyre de Andrade,</hi> in defence of the latter went to <hi>Columbo</hi> to meet the other with only eight <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and six hundred Natives, where he killed many, and took four <hi>Paraos,</hi> with good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery. <hi>Madune</hi> demanded Aid of <hi>Zamori,</hi> he sent him two thousand Men. With this Assistance he besieged the City of <hi>Cota</hi> for the Term of three Months. Knowing then that <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> was coming to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Relief, who had desired it as a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Portugal,</hi> he raised the Siege. When <hi>Martin</hi> came, <hi>Madune</hi> was drawn off, and reconciled to his Brother. There being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> to do here, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving visited the King, who was most thankful for the speedy Succour, he set out in search of the <hi>Malabar</hi> Fleet, which had assisted <hi>Madune,</hi> and met it at <hi>Mangalor,</hi> where after a sharp Encounter it was defeated, and twelve hundred <hi>Moors</hi> slain.</p>

                        <p>Still continues the Government of <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> from the Year 1537, till the Year 1538, in the Reign of King <hi>John</hi> the Third.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE King of <hi>Cambaya, Badur</hi> (who with only the assistance of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> had recovered his Kingdom) now stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died their Ruin, and repenting he had granted leave to raise the Fort, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to take it, and kill the Commander, and all the Garrison. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood his wicked Design, and began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to prevent it.

                        </gap>t it might be thought an invention to get a Reward. <hi>Emanuel</hi> was long in doubt whether to go or stay, at last he resolved to go, and using at other times to have a numerous Retinue well armed, went now with only one Servant, being sent for at the hour he had been before warned. The King seeing him unconcerned, converted his malice for that time into an honorable
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:54711:500"/>
Reception, and <hi>Emanuel</hi> returned to the Fort. The King's Mother endeavoured to dissuade him from this wicked intention, and he thought it was better by often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting the Captain in the Fort to take off all suspicion, and so murder him there, and seize upon it. He was of a violent nature, and so began his first Visit at an unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hour of the night, not regarding the very unseasonableness was enough to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it suspicious. <hi>Sousa</hi> received him upon his Guard, they discoursed of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; the King went away, believing he had ensnared <hi>Sousa,</hi> and he had given him a sufficient caution.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> being advertised by <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel de Sousa</hi> of the posture of Affairs at <hi>Diu,</hi> thought strange, That he had not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the King when in his Power, and his wicked Intentions were known; and that he had given out that Ships were come from <hi>Portugal</hi> with great Supplies. This Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion endangered <hi>Nuno,</hi> for <hi>Badur</hi> resolved to murder him first, that he might not come to the Relief of the Fort when <hi>Sousa</hi> was killed. He writ to him, desiring he would come to <hi>Diu</hi> about important Affairs. <hi>Nuno,</hi> tho he knew his wicked Designs, made no difficulty of going.

The King was somewhat quieter, seeing <hi>Cuna</hi> did not mind the Page, and soon rose, and went away. <hi>Cuna</hi> had thought it strange that <hi>Sousa</hi> did not secure
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:54711:501"/>
the King when he had him in the Fort alone, and now having him aboard the Gallion he did not detain him. <hi>Nuno</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all the Officers to accompany the King first, and then <hi>Emanuel de Sousa</hi> to the Fort, where he proposed to secure the King, when he came to visit him; as the King on the other side had resolved to seize him at a dinner he had a design to invite him to, and send him to the great <hi>Turk</hi> in a Cage.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Emanuel de Sousa</hi> was going to invite the King to the Fort, while <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> got thither. He came up with the King's <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> or Barge, and made the offer by the means of <hi>Rume Cham,</hi> who at the sametime advised the King not to go, because he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected they would secure him. He slighted the Caution, and bid <hi>Sousa</hi> come into his Barge, who stepping over fell into the Sea, but being taken up, the Officers who came with him carried him to the King. At the same time came up another of our Barges and some Gentlemen, who seeing <hi>Emanuel de Sousa</hi> entred hastily into the Kings. He suspecting their hasty coming aboard, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Caution given by <hi>Rume Cham,</hi> ordered his Officers to kill <hi>Emanuel de Sousa. Iames de Mesquita</hi> understanding it, flew at, and wounded the King, whilst they killed that valiant Captain. There was a bloody Fray in which four of our Gentlemen were killed, having slain seven of the Enemy. Other of our Barges coming up received some damage from a Page who shot several

He seeing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger began to fly, but was stopped by a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non shot which killed three of his Men that rowed. The King thought now to escape by swimming, but being in danger of drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cried out, discovering who he was. <hi>Tristan de Payva de Santarem</hi> coming up, reached out to him an Oar to bring him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board his Vessel, when a Soldier struck him cross the Face with a Halberd, and so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, till he was killed.

He was seen to enter the Town unarmed, comforting the Inhabitants, and restraining the Avarice of his Men, so that not the least Disorder was committed. Then he went to the Fort.</p>

All Pensions or Salaries allowed by him were continued. Among many that resorted to reap the Benefit of this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Liberality was a <hi>Moor</hi> of <hi>Bengala,</hi> who by authentick Informations was found to be three hundred and twenty years of Age. He was seen long after, as shall be said, when we speak of his death, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing. He had at this time two Sons, one ninety, the other twelve years old. His Beard and Teeth had fallen and grown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain four or five times. To appearance he seemed about sixty years of Age. Of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

He said, that being one day in his first Century, looking to his Cattle on the Bank of a River, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him a Man cloathed in Grey, girt with a Cord; with Wounds in his Hands and Feet, praying him to carry him over upon his Shoulders. And that having done it, he told him, That as a Reward for that Act of Charity, he should continue in the same disposition of Body, till he saw him again. The <hi>Portugueses,</hi> after this coming into <hi>India,</hi> and he into one of their Churches, and seeing the Image of S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> cryed out with surprize: <hi>This is, this is the Man I carried over the River so many years ago.</hi> This was the cause why <hi>Badur</hi> maintained him, and why now <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> continued his Allowance.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Mir Mahomet Zaman</hi> descended from the Kings of <hi>Delhi,</hi> who had reigned in <hi>Cambaya,</hi> hearing the death of <hi>Badur,</hi> went to visit the Queen Mother at <hi>Novanaguer.</hi> She fearing he came to rob her, would not see him. <hi>Zaman</hi> had no such intention then, but came to offer her his Service, and to revenge the death of the Son. She think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing she was not secure there, resolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and he offended at her Contempt, lay in wait for her with two thousand Horse, and robbed her of all that was of Value, which amounted to above two millions of Gold, and gathering above five thousand Men, was by them proclaimed King of <hi>Guzarate,</hi> and with this Title entered <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanaguer.</hi>

Hence he sent to <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> acquainting him with the posture of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, his Title to the Crown, and desiring his Assistance, in requital for which he offered the <hi>Portugueses</hi> all the Coast from <hi>Mangalor</hi> to <hi>Beth,</hi> the Town of <hi>Damam</hi> as far as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çaim,</hi> the Royal Country-House of <hi>Novana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer,</hi> and other advantageous Conditions. <hi>Nuno</hi> admitted them, and caused him to be proclaimed King in the Mosque of <hi>Diu;</hi> at the same time advising him to raise Forces, and disperse the other Pretenders. <hi>Zaman</hi> fearing the Advice was deceitful, lay still, and found the ill Consequence, for the People set up <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Nephew to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, and prepared to fall upon <hi>Zamam</hi> at <hi>Novanoguer,</hi> but delayed the Execution because <hi>Cuna</hi> was so near.

a Peace, but refusing the Conditions grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Zamam,</hi> broke off. <hi>Cuna</hi> hearing this News, made ready to return to <hi>Diu,</hi> dispatching the homeward bound trading Ships, and sending <hi>Martin Alfonso de Sousa</hi> with forty Ships to guard the Coasts of <hi>Malabar.</hi>

Farther on he took a Ship, and killed all that were in it. Beyond <hi>C.

Pate,</hi> seeing <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso,</hi> gathered seven thousand Men, and <hi>Alfonso</hi> with his four hundred resolved to fight him. He ordered <hi>Gaspar de Lemos</hi> with seven Barges to stay till he gave the signal with a Cannon, and then to come up with all the greatest noise he could to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Enemy on that side, while he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked them on the other. A Piece being fired without order, <hi>Lemos</hi> thinking it was the Signal, came up, and was killed with others, before <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> could relieve him. At last he came and revenged the death of those, killing above seven hundred of the Enemy, and putting the rest to flight, whereby he remained Master of the Sea and Field. Thirty <hi>Portugueses</hi> were lost. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Portugues</hi> Slaves here set at liberty was a Woman, who was Mistress to one of them loaded with Chains, who could not be prevailed upon by Threats nor Promises to renounce her Faith, but with great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy (much to be admired in such a Woman) encouraged the Slaves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue firm in the Faith, in contempt of all Tortures. The chief party of the Booty consisted of twenty three Barques, four hundred Cannon, fifteen hundred Musquets, and many Prisoners. This happened on the fifteenth of <hi>February. Martin de Ayala</hi> was sent to the Governor in a <hi>Catur</hi> or Barge, with fifteen Men, who meeting

near <hi>Chale,</hi> a Galliot with two hundred <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labars,</hi> fought them so long till both sides desisted through weariness. <hi>Ayala</hi> being recovered, found he had but four Men left alive, and with them prosecuted his Voyage.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> sailed over victorious to <hi>Columbo,</hi> the King of which place was besieged by his Brother <hi>Madune Pandar,</hi> who at first thought our Fleet had been that of <hi>Pate,</hi> coming to his assistance. But hearing the Ruin of it, raised the Siege, and made Peace. <hi>Martin</hi> and his Officers honored and presented by the King, sailed to <hi>Cochin,</hi> from whence they again set out to scour the Coast. Off of Mount <hi>Delii</hi> they met six <hi>Paraos,</hi> and took five of them. A little farther they had the like Success with seventeen others. Next day they took six, and a Ship laden with Provisions. Six thousand <hi>Pardaos</hi> were offered <hi>Martin</hi> for the Ransom of one <hi>Moor,</hi> and he chose rather to hang him for an Example. Being ordered by the Governor to <hi>Diu,</hi> because a great Fleet of <hi>Turks</hi> was expected, he forced ashore by the way a great Gallion of theirs, and loaded his small Vessels with the Riches were in it. Thus <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> struck a Terror into all the Enemies, and purchased us great security for some time.</p>

this Action.

One of these among others had robbed the King's own Cousin, and after other Tortures hung him and two other persons of Note by the private Parts, to make them discover their Treasure. <hi>Gonzalo Vaz</hi> committed another Robbery. <hi>Alvaro Madera</hi> being kindly entertained by an honest <hi>Moor,</hi> forced his Wife from him.

They observe no Rule of Inheritance from Father to Son, but even Slaves sometimes obtain it by kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Master, and whoever holds it three days they look upon as established by Divine Providence. Thus it fell out, that in forty years space they had thirteen Kings succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively. At the time when <hi>Martin Alfonso de Melo Iusarte</hi> was prisoner to <hi>Mahomet Xiath,</hi> that King who tyrannically held the Crown kept his Court at <hi>Gouro,</hi> in great apprehension of being deposed, but with such state that only his Women amounted to the number of ten thousand. <hi>Martin</hi> and the others who were Prisoners with him obtained him success against the <hi>Patanas</hi> with whom he was at War.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Martin</hi> and his Fellows obtained their Liberty by the means of <hi>Coje Sabadim,</hi> a rich <hi>Moor,</hi> who promised, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The better to gain the King's good Will, <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> sent him a Present, but he being suspicious, would have killed the Messengers, had not some <hi>Moors,</hi> and a <hi>Gentil</hi> reputed a Saint, and to be two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years of Age, dissuaded him.</p>

At the same time, <hi>Omaum</hi> the <hi>Mogol,</hi> in revenge of what <hi>Xercham</hi> had done at <hi>Delhi,</hi> met and defeated him. But being apparently reconciled, he recovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Xercham</hi> streightened the King, and he advised with <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> how to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him, when <hi>Iames Rabelo</hi> came to <hi>Chatigam,</hi> sent by <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> with three Vessels to procure <hi>Martin</hi>'s Liberty. The King being in distress ordered him to be favourably entertained, and to gain assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> sent him twenty two of the Prisoners. <hi>Nuno</hi> sent nine Vessels. Mean while <hi>Xercham</hi> marched to gain a Pass upon the Fort of <hi>Gorii,</hi> which is where the <hi>Ganges</hi> enters <hi>Bengala.</hi> By ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Martin Alfonso,</hi> the King sent two of his Vessels, commanded by two <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> with eight others to stop his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. They stopped him there, and he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another away, set down before the City <hi>Gouro</hi> with forty thousand Horse, two hundred thousand Foot, and fifteen hundred Elephants. Down the River came three hundred <hi>Almadies,</hi> which sailed to the

place where the King had eight hundred <hi>Paraos</hi> to oppose them. Here eight <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> commanded by <hi>Duarte de Brito,</hi> did wonders in the King's sight, to take an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant that was swimming, and much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted by the King; he was taken with the loss of three of the eight. <hi>Xercham</hi> distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the City, and the King bought a Peace, and was content that he from his Army should do him reverence.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The King being at ease, gave liberty to <hi>Martin Alfonso</hi> and his Men to go for <hi>India,</hi> leaving only five as Hostages for the assistance he expected from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor. Soon after <hi>Xercham</hi> returns and enters <hi>Gouro</hi> by force, obliging the King al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wounded to abandon the City, who died on his way to <hi>Omaum,</hi> the <hi>Mogol,</hi> while <hi>Xercham</hi> plundered the place. It was said <hi>Xercham</hi> drew off with above sixty millions of Gold value, when <hi>Omaum</hi> came on bringing the dead King with him. At this time <hi>Vasco Perez de Sampayo</hi> arrived with the Succour, but acted nothing. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maum</hi> finding the City abandoned, buried the King, and set up in his place his own Brother-in law, <hi>Mir Mahomet Zaman,</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprived of the Kingdom of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and soon after of this; for <hi>Xercham</hi> having secured his Treasure, with diligence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Gouro,</hi> and made him fly thence.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Omaum</hi> again set out to meet <hi>Xercham</hi> with one hundred thousand Horse, and one hundred and fifty thousand Foot, besides the Followers of the Army, which were above

two hundred thousand. They met on the Banks of <hi>Ganges,</hi> near the City <hi>Canose. Xercham</hi> by a stratagem got the day with such a slaughter, that <hi>Omaum</hi> with only twenty five Men never stopped till he came to <hi>Labor,</hi> where his Brother <hi>Camiran Mirza</hi> received him better than he deserved, <hi>Mirza</hi> being then under Cure of the Poison he had given him. <hi>Xercham</hi> treated <hi>Omaum</hi>'s Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, taken in that Battel with great respect, and afterwards restored them, well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his Modesty and Liberality.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Omaum</hi> finding himself too weak for the Enterprize of <hi>Bengala,</hi> bent his Thoughts against <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and demanding Aid of his principal Subjects was by them disappointed. He went into <hi>Persia,</hi> in which King he had great Confidence, on account of the Friendship of their Fathers. Nor was he deceived, for the <hi>Persian</hi> King received him with Magnificence, gave him rich Presents, and lastly, an Army of twelve thousand Horse. And because <hi>Sultan Xiath,</hi> King of <hi>Quereman,</hi> to whom he gave the Command of them, excused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, saying, It was not for his Reputation to engage where the person of his Prince was not. He gave him h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="11">11. Besides these twelve thousand given by <hi>Xiath,</hi> ten thousand Voluntiers offered themselves to <hi>Omaum.</hi> Who joining his own Forces, invested the City <hi>Candar,</hi>
                        <pb n="422" facs="tcp:54711:510"/>
where his Broster <hi>Astarii Mirza</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed himself King of <hi>Mogostam.</hi> The City taken, he gave to the young Prince, who possessed it not long, but died soon of the Fatigue of the Marches. King <hi>Sultan Xiath,</hi> his Governor, went to a City where many of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings lie buried, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Infant, leaving all the Men with <hi>Omaum</hi> for the space of two years, under four General Officers. These soon left him, and returned to <hi>Persia,</hi> where they were disgraced by the King, and made incapable of any Post of Honor, declaring he could not have wished the young Prince a more glorious death than he had in his Nurses Arms, assisting such a Prince as <hi>Omaum. Xercham</hi> raised by Fortune to a formidable pitch, having at command four hundred thousand Horse, and being courted by all the adjacent Princes, aspiring now to greater Undertakings, took the City <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> of the <hi>Resbutos,</hi> with intent to rob the Treasure that was there in a Temple. Pointing a Cannon to kill an Elephant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Temple, he killed himself; for the Piece bursting, tore him and many more to pieces. So that Fire turned all his Glory into Smoke. Such is the end of Pride.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. At <hi>Malaca</hi> there were no less Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles than in these parts. <hi>D. Paulo de Gama</hi> had the Command of this place, he, to found. <hi>Alaudim</hi> King of <hi>Viantana,</hi> Son to him of <hi>Bintam,</hi> destroyed by <hi>Mascarenhas,</hi> sent <hi>Sebastian Vieyra</hi> with five <hi>Pórtugueses</hi> to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:54711:510"/>
settle a Friendly Correspondence. The King, at the instigation of him of <hi>Pacem,</hi> bound and poured boiling Water upon them till they died, and then gave them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by wild Beasts. <hi>D. Paulo</hi> was not then in a condition to take revenge. He sent <hi>Emanuel Godino</hi> to the Kings of <hi>Panda</hi> and <hi>Pate,</hi> who concluded a Peace with them, whereby <hi>Malaca</hi> was relieved with Provisions, which he of <hi>Vjantana</hi> cut off on the other side. The year 1534 <hi>D. Stephen de Gama</hi> came and took possession of that Command, and repaired the Works. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some Vessels of the Enemy were in the River <hi>Muar,</hi> he sent one to discover them, he returned pursued by ten sent by <hi>Lacxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> who came to the assistance of <hi>Vjan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> with seventy sent by his Uncle <hi>Tuam Gaba.</hi> Instantly <hi>D. Paulo</hi> set out with nine Sail. Two <hi>Paraos</hi> were sent after to their assistance but too late, for when they came up a bloody Battel was ended, in which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all our Men were slain, having done wonders, and made such a slaughter of the Enemy, that they durst not take the Ships whose Crew they had killed. Only three Men of Note escaped.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>D. Stephen</hi> now resolved to destroy the City of <hi>Vjantana,</hi> and set out with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty six Sail and two hundred and fifty Men. <hi>Vjantana</hi> is the South East Point of the Coast of <hi>Malaca,</hi> from which forty Leagues distant. On the West of it runs into the Sea the deep River <hi>Tor,</hi> on whose Banks was seated King <hi>Alaudim</hi>'s City, and three

Leagues below it a Fort so well stored with Cannon, it could sink any Vessel should attempt the Entrance. Here <hi>D. Stephen</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with much danger, both Banks being covered with armed Men, but a party of Musqueteers on each side cleared the Shores. The first Attacks of the Fort <hi>D. Stephen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived damage, but afterwards did much more for the space of eight days. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegers began to dismay, but were encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>D. Stephen</hi> and <hi>Peter Barriga.</hi> Now the Enemy having received fresh Succour, drew out into the Field, where such slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them was made, that they fled that day in despair to the Fort, and the next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned it, the King escaping with his Women and Treasure. The City <hi>Tor</hi> was plundered and burnt, much Cannon and some Vessels taken, such as could not be carried, perished in the Flames, and <hi>D. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> returned victorious to <hi>Malaca,</hi> where he was received in triumph, this being one of the notable Victories till then gained in <hi>Asia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. The King began again Acts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility, and <hi>D. Stephen</hi> returns with four hundred Men. He found the Fort he had destroyed repaired, and in it five thousand Men Five hundred of them were killed the first Assault. Many Ships were burnt, and <hi>D. Stephen</hi> marched towards the City, when the King from the Mountain, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had retired, sent to treat of Peace. He was ordered to send Hostages, and sent an Uncle of his own, with his Wives, so

                        <hi>D. Stephen</hi> returned to <hi>Malaca,</hi> whither four Embassadors followed, who concluded the Peace upon these Conditions. That the King should send to <hi>Malaca</hi> all the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non that was in his Country, that he should build no Ships of War, that he should erect no Forts, that he should restore all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners and Goods taken, that he should not hinder bringing Provisions to <hi>Malaca,</hi> that his Subjects should resort thither to buy and sell. This Peace being sworn to, brought great Tranquility to <hi>Malaca.</hi> The year 1537 this Quiet was disturbed by a Commander of <hi>Achem,</hi> who attacked the Bridge with three thousand Men. <hi>D. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> met him with some Gentlemen and two hundred Soldiers, and slew five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred without the loss of one, so the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my drew off with shame. Soon after he returns with five thousand, and retired with the like Disaster.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>D. Stephen</hi> had sent <hi>Francis de Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros</hi> in a Ship with twenty <hi>Portugueses</hi> to the King of <hi>Patane.</hi> In that Port <hi>Tuam Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> Admiral of <hi>Vjantana,</hi> fell upon him with forty Sail. The Fight was desperate, some <hi>Portugueses</hi> and many Enemies fell, and they parted. All advise <hi>Barros</hi> to save himself ashore, most leave him, and he stays aboard with only two, who at last pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and firing the Ship, they get ashore in the Boat, and bring off the Cannon. The King received them kindly. <hi>Henry Mendez de Vasconcelos</hi> was sent to bring them back. Those of <hi>Iava</hi> fall upon them both
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:54711:512"/>
with twenty <hi>Calaluzes</hi> that carried two Rows of Oars, well furnished with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. <hi>Mendez</hi> and <hi>Barros</hi> were in two Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, ten <hi>Calaluzes</hi> attack each, one had sixteen, the other but few more <hi>Portugueses.</hi> The Fight was very hot, some <hi>Portugueses</hi> fall, and <hi>Mendez</hi> was stun'd with a poisoned Arrow. <hi>Barros</hi> was in danger, having but three Men and himself wounded. <hi>Vascon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celos</hi> recovering, comes to his aid, shatters some, takes others of the <hi>Calaluzes,</hi> puts the Remainder to flight, and obtains an entire Victory.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Mean while <hi>Tristan de Ataide,</hi> at <hi>Maluco,</hi> through avarice, caused great Troubles. He took King <hi>Tabarija</hi> and sent him prisoner to <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to remedy these Disorders, by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very orderly Commander. Such was <hi>Antony Galvam,</hi> whose Prudence healed all the Sores made by his Predecessors. Having taken possession of the Command, he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Modesty and Justice, without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or affection. The Fort was unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Cannon and Ammunition, he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished all at his own charge, and because Timber was wanting for the Works, he was always the fitst that went to the Woods, and returned loaded.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. All things being settled here, <hi>Galvam</hi> turns to <hi>Tidore,</hi> where eight Kings with a vast number of Men were allied against the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> He sent to sound them, and they made a Truce, but observed it not, and <hi>Galvam</hi> seeing he had but few Men,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:54711:512"/>
that those decreased by Famine, and 'twas too tedious to expect relief from <hi>India,</hi> he resolved upon an Action that was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rash. He set out in four Ships with on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> hundred and seventy <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and fifty <hi>Moors. Tristan de Ataide</hi> was left in the Fort. <hi>Galvam</hi> was met by 2000 <hi>Moors,</hi> there passed some Blows. Soon after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared three hundred Sail, containing above thirty thousand <hi>Moors,</hi> who thought to have terrified <hi>Galvam,</hi> but in vain; for he held on his course, and they followed him. They anchored at <hi>Tidore,</hi> the Shores were covered with multitudes who rent the Air with Shouts. The Cannon of the Fort played, but the Shot went over the Ships. The Fort appeared impregnable, but by that it was resolved to begin. <hi>Galvam</hi> scales it with one hundred and twenty <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and as many Slaves as made up in all three hundred. The Kings came upon him with fifty thousand Men, but he draws into a close Wood. They thought he fled, and pursue with hideous Shouts. Soon were they turned into Lamentations. King <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chil Daialo,</hi> who led the Enemies Van, came another way to fall upon <hi>Galvam,</hi> endeavouring to amuse him, till the Body of the Army came up, which he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gave the sign to fall on, and after a hot Dispute, the Enemy fled, the King being killed among the first. Some of those that fled disordered them that were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, others run to the Fort. <hi>Galvam</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues the latter, and enters along with them.
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:54711:513"/>
They abandon the Fort, and he set fire to it. Whilst the Fort flamed, the Kings fled to the Mountains with their Treasure, and <hi>Antony</hi> marches to the City. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants abandon, and he burns it down to the Ground, levelling the Works so that scarce any memory of the City was left, but the signs of the Ashes. Many <hi>Moors</hi> were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and many taken. This unparallel'd Victory cost but one Slave.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Those Kings thought to do us some harm with Ambushes at embarquing, and afterwards at Sea, but came off with loss. He of <hi>Tidore</hi> afterwards came to a peace, the Conditions honourable on our side. <hi>Antony,</hi> the more to oblige that King, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rebuild the City, which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately put in hand, with these and other Courtesies he so much obliged him and his Subjects, that they confided in him as an ancient tried Friend.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. <hi>Galvam</hi> found it was easier to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greatest Army of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> than the least <hi>Portugues</hi> Avarice. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to put in execution the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions relating to the Trade of Clove, and the <hi>Portugueses</hi> opposed, because they put a stop to their Frauds and Robberies. Next he would have examined into the Crimes of <hi>Tristan de Ataide,</hi> and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of his own Guilt begged Mercy. Tho undeserving, <hi>Galvam</hi> took pity on and reconciled him with many, that they might not be his Accusers. <hi>Ataide</hi> requited his kindness by provoking most of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi>
                        <pb n="429" facs="tcp:54711:513"/>
to mutiny about the Trade of Clove. <hi>Antony</hi> endeavouring to appease, found them them all in Arms. At length <hi>Tristan</hi> sailed for <hi>India,</hi> having hindered the loading Clove for the King's use, and carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way most of the Mutineers. So the Fort was exposed to eminent danger. If the Commanders were bad, the <hi>Moors</hi> could not live with them, if good, they could not live with the <hi>Portugueses.</hi>

They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Challenge, but the King of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> interposing, came to an agreement. The two Kings so religiously observed this Pacification, that they refused to admit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Ports two <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships forced thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by stress of Weather. They were cast away upon the Coast, and those few that escaped, taken by the Natives, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed by <hi>Galvam,</hi> who treated them cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously. Their Captain was <hi>Ferdinand de Grijalva,</hi> sent out the year 1537 by <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand Cortes.</hi> Now the <hi>Ternatenses</hi> were at variance, refusing to obey <hi>Cachil Aeiro</hi> as King, set up by <hi>Tristan de Ataide,</hi> and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring for <hi>Tabarija,</hi> by him imprisoned and sent to <hi>India.</hi> They offered to make <hi>Galvam</hi> King till they had a lawful one. He refused and endeavoured to make them agree. This Action of his, and the persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:54711:514"/>
of the King of <hi>Tidore,</hi> prevailed with them to admit <hi>Aeiro.</hi> After this all things continued in a wonderful Calm.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. <hi>Galvam</hi> heared a great Fleet was coming upon <hi>Ternate,</hi> he borrowed some small Ships of the King of <hi>Tidore,</hi> into which he put forty <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and gave the Command to the Priest <hi>Ferdinand Vinagre,</hi> who behaved himself so well he beat that Fleet, and killed their Admiral. Then he quieted the Country, sometimes handling the Sword, sometimes putting on the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, he baptized many. <hi>Galvam</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how great Fruit this Priest produced, assisted him to prosecute the Conversion; and he so treated the Converts, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives said, <hi>It must needs be a true God that such a man adored, and his Religion ought to be embraced by all men.</hi> At this time <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam</hi> was informed, a great Fleet was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Iava, Banda, Macaçar</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boina</hi> to load Clove at <hi>Maluco,</hi> by force of Arms. To meet them he sent <hi>Iames Lopez de Azevedo</hi> with forty <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and 400 <hi>Ternatenses</hi> and <hi>Tidores.</hi> The Battel was fought at <hi>Amboina,</hi> that Fleet defeated, Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, Cannon, Arms and Men taken. He scoured the Coast, and baptized three whole Towns, <hi>Ativa, Matelo</hi> and <hi>Nocivel.</hi> Two Brothers, Gentlemen of the Island <hi>Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çar,</hi> came to <hi>Ternate</hi> to take <hi>Galvam,</hi> for their Godfather in Baptism, and took the Names of <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Michael</hi> with his Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name. They afterwards came to visit him with Ships richly laden, and several young
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:54711:514"/>
Gentlemen who were also baptized. They gave an account much might be wrought in their Islands, and those of <hi>Celebes</hi> both in Spirituals and Temporals. <hi>Galvam</hi> sent sent <hi>Francis de Castro</hi> with two Priests, who were drove by bad Weather to discover o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Islands a hundred Leagues North of the <hi>Malucos.</hi> The first they came to was <hi>Sati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gana,</hi> the King and People Pagans. <hi>Castro</hi> made Peace with him, which was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by drinking each the others Blood, to which effect they had a Vein opened. Then the King, Queen, a Son, three Brothers, and many Nobles were baptized. Next they discovered the Island <hi>Mindanao,</hi> where the same happened with the King, Queen, their two Daughters and many People. After them were baptized the Kings of <hi>Butuano, Pimilarano</hi> and <hi>Camisino,</hi> the two first took the Name of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the latter was called <hi>Francis. Francis de Castro</hi> brought to <hi>Ternate</hi> many Sons of the new Converts, for whom <hi>Galvam,</hi> at his own expence, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a Seminary, where they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, which was the first in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. The obstinate <hi>Mahometans</hi> were asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at so many Conversions, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to persuade the Kings to put a stop to their progress; but were quite amazed when they saw an <hi>Arab,</hi> whom they reverenced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as much as <hi>Mahomet,</hi> from whom he was descended, leave him to follow Christ. The term of <hi>Galvam</hi>'s Command expiring, those Kings begged of ours to continue him for life. But wordly Felicities especially in Government are never lasting.</p>

22. <hi>Antony Galvam</hi> seeing all things settled, and that it was unjust the Kings of that Island should always be Prisoners, set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <hi>Cachil Aeiro</hi> persuading him to choose a Queen. This confirmed the great opinion the <hi>Ternatenses</hi> had of him, and they made publick Songs in his Praise, which are the only History or Records they use. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed all Differences between the <hi>Portugueses</hi> and Islanders, and being now at leisure built the Fort and all the Houses after the manner of <hi>Spain.</hi> After his Example the King beautified <hi>Ternate,</hi> with Buildings, and granted Lands to the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who began to make curious Orchards and Gardens and Country Houses, the <hi>Moors</hi> did the same. Now <hi>Antony Galvam</hi> seeing there wanted Water, brought it from three Leagues distance. Being told he consumed his own without making any advantage of the Trade of Clove: he said, He could not meddle with Cloves, because it bore five Nobs, which represents the Wounds of Christ, and are the Arms of <hi>Portugal.</hi> His Command at <hi>Ternate</hi> expiring, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Portugal</hi> full of Debts, thinking (but he thought ill, if he knew his own Country) that he should find some Reward of so much Valour, such Service, so great Parts and Merits. He found Contempt and Misery, which brought him to die in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital. This was the Reward those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served best found in <hi>Portugal,</hi> where Heroick Actions were looked upon as Crimes, and Crimes as Heroick Actions. But his Fame will live for ever.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Which ends the Government of <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> this same Year 1538, in the Reign of King <hi>John</hi> the Third, and concludes the First Tome.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Present sent by the King of <hi>Cambaya</hi> to the great <hi>Turk</hi> to obtain Succour from him, was delivered together with the News of his Death. The great Value of this Present demonstrated to that Prince the vast Riches of <hi>India,</hi> and stirred up in him a desire of becoming Master of it. He thought he might expel the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> in the East, and one of them a Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado, then at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> promoted the Design by making it easie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Turk</hi> ordered a Fleet to be fitted, and gave the Command of it to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch <hi>Solyman Bassa,</hi> Governor of <hi>Caire. Solyman</hi> was a <hi>Greek</hi> Janisary, born in the <hi>Morea,</hi> of stature short, his Face ugly, and Belly so big, he was more like a Beast than Man, his Age eighty years, he could not rise up without the help of four Men. His Purse purschased him this Command, offering the <hi>Turk</hi> to furnish the Shipping at his own Cost. The better to perform this, he put to death many rich Men to seize their Estates. Among others he hanged <hi>Mir Daud,</hi> King of <hi>The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ayda,</hi> after taking
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:54711:516"/>
from him a great Sum of Mony. So it might well be said, this Fleet was rather built by the Dead than by the Living. It contained seventy Sail, most large Gallies, well stored with Cannon, Ammunition and Provisions, seven thousand Land-Men Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries, <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mamalucs,</hi> the Seamen and Slaves of the best, many of the latter taken out of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies then at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which were seized upon, the Peace made by <hi>Bajazet</hi> in the year 1503, being now broke.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Solyman</hi> having set out committed Villanies natural to a Tyrant and Coward as he was. He caused four hundred Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to be put to the Oars, and because they complained, put to death two hundred. He thought to have taken the King at <hi>Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> but he, who well knew him, escaped. At <hi>Zebet</hi> after receiving a rich Present he beheaded the King. In like manner after receiving a Present and Relief from the King of <hi>Aden,</hi> counterfeiting he had many sick Men aboard, they were set ashore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately armed, and seized the City while he murdered the King aboard. About the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>September</hi> he came before <hi>Diu,</hi> having lost six Vessels by the way.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When King <hi>Badur</hi> was killed upon the Sea with some of his Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>inue, one <hi>Coje Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far</hi> swam to shore, and was well received by the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who put all others to the Sword. He upon several occasions shewed himself so grateful, that <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> much favoured and recommended him earnestly
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:54711:516"/>
to <hi>Antony de Silveyra.</hi> At last without any provocation he fled from <hi>Diu</hi> to the new King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> offering his Service, and persuading him to war upon the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and drive them from that Coast, affirming it might be easily done with the assistance of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Fleet, which he knew would soon be there. The King with this Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement forms a Body of five thousand Horse, and ten thousand Foot at <hi>Champanel.</hi> The first that appeared was <hi>Coje Zofar,</hi> with three thousand Horse and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot, maintained by himself, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is suspicious to advise dangerous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, and not have part in them. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony de Silveyra</hi> having notice hereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for a long and dangerous Siege.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> made the first Breach, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Town of the <hi>Rumes</hi> near <hi>Diu,</hi> where he did much harm. <hi>Francis Pacheco</hi> defended himself bravely in a Bulwark with fourteen <hi>Portugueses,</hi> till relieved by <hi>Antony de Silveyra</hi> and <hi>Zofar,</hi> was obliged to draw off, being wounded in the Arm. At the same time appears <hi>Alu Cham,</hi> the King's General with all the Army, and he and <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far</hi> set down before the Passes. <hi>Antony de Silveyra</hi> orders the Officers, commanding them to quit those Posts, the better to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the City and Fort. In the Execution of these Orders they lost some Ships and Guns.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 By reason of this Loss, and because there were many private Enemies, who only waited an opportunity of shewing
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:54711:517"/>
their malice, <hi>Silveyra</hi> could not maintain the City. Some he hanged, and retired to the Fort, always taking the Advice of his Captains. <hi>Alu Cham</hi> and <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently possessed themselves of the City and Island abandoned by us, and began to play their Shot vigorously. <hi>Lope de Sousa,</hi> who guarded the Wood and Water, whereof the Fort stood in need, had several Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and slew many of the Enemy, without losing one Man, but was himself much wounded. <hi>Antony de Silveyra,</hi> hearing of the approach of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Fleet, with speed sent advice thereof to <hi>Nuno de Cuna,</hi> the Answer was the Diligence wherewith he prepared to relieve him in person.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Michael Vaz,</hi> a resolute Man, sent by <hi>Silveyra</hi> to discover, saw the Enemies Fleet, and the better to view it, came up so near, that their Shot reached his Vessel. He got off, and carried the News to the Governor at <hi>Goa.</hi> The Fleet came to an Anchor in the Harbour, and was now formidable, not only to those few <hi>Portugueses,</hi> but even to the <hi>Moors,</hi> who had expected it. Next day <hi>Solyman</hi> landed six hundred Janizaries well accoutred, and armed with Bows and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets to terrifie the Beholders. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the City, and there acted all the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies used among Soldiers. Then drawing near the Fort, they killed six <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses,</hi> but three hundred of our Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers advancing, killed fifty of them, and forced the rest to retire.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <pb n="437" facs="tcp:54711:517"/>
8. A storm obliged <hi>Solyman</hi> to remove to <hi>Madrefavat,</hi> a safer Harbour. There he continued twenty days, in which time <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyra</hi> bettered the Fortifications, planted his Artillery, and assigned every Man his Post. The same was done by the <hi>Turks,</hi> assisted by <hi>Coje Zofar.</hi> Some of their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non played upon a Bulwark, to burn which they built a wooden Castle on a great Barque filled with combustible Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but <hi>Francis de Gove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> who had his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by Sea, went out by night, and with great difficulty got to and burnt it. At this time came some relief sent by <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no de Cuna,</hi> yet the greatest Comfort they brought was the hopes of his coming after in person.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Solyman</hi> returns from <hi>Madrefavat,</hi> and fires his Cannon upon the Bulwark where <hi>Francis de Gouvea</hi> commanded; from whence, and from S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Tower, he was so well answered, that one of his Gallies sunk with most of the Men. The greatest harm the <hi>Portugueses</hi> received, was from their own Cannon, which burst and killed some: for the Enemy only killed two Brothers, whose Mother took them in her Arms, and carried off the Bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shedding a tear. <hi>Zofar</hi> now furiously battered <hi>Francis Pachecho</hi>'s Bulwark, which he rendered not tenable, seven hundred Janizaries assaulted it, and set up their Colours, but some of the scattered <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> advancing, fell on, dislodged them, and killed one hundred and fifty. The
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:54711:518"/>
Dispute lasted all day, and the Enemy drew off with shame, for the weight of this Action lay upon two resolute Gentlemen. Next day <hi>Pacheco</hi> in despair surrendred. The Enemy enters the Bulwark, casts down the Christian Colours, and set up the <hi>Turkish. Iohn Perez,</hi> enraged hereat, throws down the <hi>Turkish,</hi> and again rears the Christian Ensigns, the <hi>Turks</hi> come on, and five <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> more join <hi>Perez,</hi> who all were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the spot, and their Bodies cast into the Sea, which laid them at the Gate of the Fort, where they were honourably bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. <hi>Pacheco</hi> and those with him had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticled for Life and Liberty. The latter was not performed by <hi>Solyman,</hi> the first he granted, cloathing their Bodies with <hi>Turkish</hi> Garments, as they had cloathed their Souls with Infamy, in accepting them. Then he sent one of them to <hi>Silveyra</hi> to summon him to surrender. He made a jest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Solyman</hi> enraged at this Contempt, prepared to batter the Fort. He planted his Artillery in several places under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Coje.</hi> Among the Cannon were nine Pieces of wonderful bigness, carrying Ball of above ninety pounds weight. Thus several other Sizes of Cannon, which in all were above one hundred and thirty, guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by two thousand <hi>Turks.</hi> Upon Monday the fourth of <hi>October,</hi> the Battery began, and continued violently twenty days, doing great harm to the Fort, from whence scarce any could be done, nor they could hardly
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:54711:518"/>
repair the most dangerous Breaches, tho all Art and Diligence was used.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The sixth day after they began to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving <hi>Gaspar de Sousa</hi>'s Bulwark much damaged, thought to carry it, but many of them were killed in the Attempt, with the loss of two of ours. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day there was Action. <hi>Goncalo Falcam</hi> had his Head shot off. <hi>Iohn Fonseca</hi> being wounded in the Right Arm, held his Lance with the Left, as if he had received no hurt. The <hi>Gallego Iohn,</hi> a Youth of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age, of a little Body, but great Heart, pursued a <hi>Moor</hi> till he run into the Sea, thither he followed, till losing ground he was like to drown. The <hi>Moor</hi> perceiving it, laid hold on him to kill him, but he recovering himself without losing Gun or Sword, slew him, and came out all bloody, walking leisurely towards the Fort, while Showers of Bullets flew about him. Many other singular Acts of Valour were performed this Siege.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. But by this time many brave Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had been killed in the Fort, Powder grew short, the Provisions shorter, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Viceroy <hi>D. Garcia de Noronha,</hi> now arrived in <hi>India,</hi> moved slow, the Neighbouring Forts sent no Aid, and all began to be in confusion. Which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by a sickness that hindered most from swallowing the little Provision they had, swelling the Gums, and loosening the Teeth, so that they fell out; this was cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the bad Water. In fine, the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi>
                        <pb n="440" facs="tcp:54711:519"/>
fought and suffered, as if so much Misery could not overcome them. Let the Valour of the Women now take place here. <hi>Donna Isabel de Vega,</hi> a Woman of great Virtue, and some Beauty, was Wife to <hi>Manuel de Vasconcelos,</hi> he fearing the Fort might be lost, and she taken by the <hi>Turks,</hi> earnestly entreated her to go to her Father <hi>Francis Ferram</hi> at <hi>Goa,</hi> but she beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not to be parted from him; which, with much regret at last he granted. Then this Virago considering there were many Men employed in the Work who might fight, and their places be supplied by as many Women, calling together all of that Sex that were in the Fort, she exhorted them to undertake that Labour, to the end so many Men might be added to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Defendants. They all follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, she led and gave the Example, and with her <hi>Anne Fenandez,</hi> with whom she had before communicated her Design. This <hi>Anne</hi> was Wife to a Physician, and so cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, that by night she viewed all the Posts, and appeared at Assaults, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Soldiers. Her Son being killed in her sight, she drew him away, returned where the Service was, and that ended, went to bury him.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Perceiving the <hi>Turks</hi> undermined his Bulwark, <hi>Gaspar de Sousa</hi> sallied with seventy Men to view their Work, which he did with great slaughter of the Enemy. At his Retreat missing two Men, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back upon the Enemy, fought bravely,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:54711:519"/>
and being surrounded, was hamstringed, yet so defended himself on his Knees till op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the multitude. The Mine was countermined; the continual Labour was insupportable, and impossible to repair so many Ruins.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. At this Juncture arrived four Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, sent by the Viceroy <hi>D. Garcia,</hi> which carried only twenty Men of Relief. <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was concerned at this Succour, tho small, and much more that the Fort stood so many Assaults, <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> having assured he would carry it at two. At the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Siege there were six hundred Men in the Fort, many were killed, and some Cannon burst. But the <hi>Turk</hi> placed no confidence herein, and looked toward the Sea, fearful of the <hi>Portugues</hi> Fleet he heared was coming upon him.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. This moved him to press the Siege with more vigour. The Bulwark of the Sea where <hi>Antony de Sousa</hi> commanded, was furiously attacked with fifty Barques, two whereof were sunk by our Cannon. Then they attempted to scale it, and were repulsed with great slaughter. The Assault was repeated, and still the Enemy came off with loss. <hi>Sousa</hi> sent the wounded Men to be dressed, among them <hi>Fernan Penteado,</hi> who waiting, heared the noise of a fresh Attack, and forgetting the Dressing, run thither, and received another Wound, the very same happened to him the third time, and then was dressed of all three. By this time there were left in the Fort but two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:54711:520"/>
and fifity of the six hundred Men, fit to take Arms.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Solyman</hi> now in despair resolved to venture all. First he counterfeited he would raise the Siege, and twelve Gallies put to Sea, that <hi>Silveyra</hi> might be the easier sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, but he provided still to repulse the greatest danger. One night some Noise was heared at the Foot of the Wall by water, it appeared they were applying great numbers of scaling Ladders, they were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, till morning appearing shewed the place beset round, and assaulted by fourteen thousand Men. First the Cannon was played, and then they mounted on all sides, chieflly next the Commandant's House, where it was weakest: but he had placed such Men there as made a great slaughter. Failing there, they attempted a Bulwark, powring in showers of Arrows and Bullets. Great was the Confusion and Havock on both sides. Now come up fourteen Gallies powring in their great shot, but do no Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. <hi>Francis Gouvea</hi> made them draw off, having battered two, and killed some Men with his Cannon. By this time two hundred <hi>Turks</hi> had entered the Bulwark, and planted their Colours. Scarce thirty <hi>Portugueses</hi> were there to oppose them, but they rushing on desperately regain the Work. The Enemy being very thick, none of our shot is lost, they sustain great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and such as were in this Action draw off. Fresh Men succeed, and set up four Colours. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> wounded
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:54711:520"/>
and burnt run for ease, and dipped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Jars of Salt Water, where they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, seeking Refreshment with hellish Torture. <hi>Antony de Silveyra</hi> indefatigably repaired to all places, encouraging all. Here a Soldier wanting Ball pulled out one of his Teeth to load his Musquet. The Enemy had much the better this second Assault, which a few Gentlemen perceiving, furiously rushed upon them. <hi>Iohn Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,</hi> a Man of great Body, and as great Courage, run out with a Barrel of Powder, crying, <hi>Clear the way; for here I carry my own and many a Man's death.</hi> He threw the Barrel among the Enemies, and suddenly above a hundred were carried up into the Air, torn in peices, twenty lay burnt upon the ground. <hi>Iohn</hi> himself came off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurt, and doing other considerable Actions, deserved afterward some of the first Rewards and Honours gained this Siege. Other Fireworks burnt the four En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs who had set up the Colours. Two of our Cannon cleared the place of Enemies, and two Bullets threw down two Ensigns that succeeded the former. The Enemy withdraws, and fresh comes on the third time, and place their Colours. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of these, Son-in-law to <hi>Coje Zofar,</hi> being killed, his Men dismayed, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Backs. These Assaults lasted above four hours, the same small number of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> withstanding still fresh and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies. Our Women in the Fort, and theirs on the Walls of the City, being
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:54711:521"/>
Spectators of the whole Action. The <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> all smeared with Powder, looked more like <hi>Moors</hi> and were known by their Cloaths not Colour, and among themselves by the Voice, every one looking as if he came out of Hell, their black hue wrought with Fire, Blood and Sweat. In fine, the Enemy carried off above a thousand wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and left above five hundred Men killed. Of ours fourteen were killed, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred lay useless for want of Blood. Only forty remained able to bear Arms, and the Arms lay broken to pieces about the Ground, some serving such as could not stand on their Legs for Crutches. No hope was left if the Enemy renewed the Attack. The Walls were all shattered, and no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der left. Nothing but horror appeard. Only the brave <hi>Silveyra</hi>'s Countenance was what encouraged all Men.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Solyman</hi> put an end to all these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities; for not knowing the Condition the Fort was in, and terrified with this ill success, he raised the Siege. <hi>Antony Silvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> seeing them weigh anchor, and hoise sail, thought it was still counterfeit, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to resist as if he had any thing to trust to. He posted the forty Men, and caused some that were wounded to lean against the Walls, to shew a number; those who could not rise ordered themselves to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in their Beds, saying, <hi>It was to die in an honourable place.</hi> Some of the Women also armed themselves, and appeared upon the Works. The Night was spent upon the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:54711:521"/>
watch, but the Morning was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to the afflicted; for <hi>Solyman</hi> was under Sail without any thought of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Tho fear did much, yet a Device of <hi>Coje Zofar</hi> did more towards removing <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman. Coje</hi> was moved to it by two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, one that he was weary of the unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Pride of that <hi>Turk;</hi> another an Order that he had from his King, in case he found the <hi>Turk</hi> would keep that City and Fort (as was feared) he should rather endeavour to leave it to the <hi>Portugueses. Coje</hi>'s Device was, that he framed a Letter which came to <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Hands, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it contained, that the Viceroy of <hi>India</hi> would be there the next day with a vast Fleet, he thought not fit to delay his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and so sailed away on the fifth of <hi>November.</hi> The same night <hi>Coje</hi>'s Men fired the City, and marched away. This was the first Siege of <hi>Diu</hi> which was admired throughout the World, and added new Lustre to the <hi>Portugues</hi> Glory, all due to the invincible Courage of the ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Antony de Silveyra,</hi> and those va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Gentlemen who were with him, and whose Fame will last from Generation to Generation.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Solyman</hi> touched at the Ports on the Coast of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and took up some <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> he found there. He gathered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 140, and cutting off their Heads, then the Ears and Noses, salted and sent them to the great <hi>Turk</hi> to shew what he had done. Among these was <hi>Francis Pacheco,</hi>
                        <pb n="446" facs="tcp:54711:522"/>
who had not the Courage to die like a Gentleman in his Bulwark. <hi>Solyman</hi> being come to the great <hi>Turk,</hi> and not well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with one who aspired to his Post, was reduced to kill himself. Such is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the end of Tyrants.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. This famous Siege was far advanced when the Viceroy <hi>D. Garcia de Noronha</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in <hi>India,</hi> to whom <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately resigned the Government. His arrival with so considerable Relief as he brought might well have bettered the Affairs of <hi>Diu;</hi> yet on the contrary it much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged them. For had he not come, <hi>Nuno</hi> had relieved <hi>Diu</hi> with eighty Sail he had in a readiness for that purpose, and prevented so many Miseries and the death of so many brave Men. Still fresh Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was brought of the danger the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged were in, and still <hi>D. Garcia</hi> wasted the time in considering of means to relieve them, without chusing any, or taking the advise of <hi>Cuna.</hi> Thus the Siege was raised before he found the method of relieving, having gathered one hundred and sixty Sail for that purpose.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>D. Garcia</hi> wanted not Courage, having given good demonstrations of it under <hi>Alfonso de Albuquerque.</hi> But he chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to commit an Error through his own wilfulness, than act rightly by the advice of <hi>Nuno de Cuna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="21">21. It soon appeared <hi>Noronha</hi> was not at all disposed to take advice of <hi>Cuna,</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in such manner at <hi>Goa</hi> as obliged
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:54711:522"/>
him to go to <hi>Cochin,</hi> to order his Affairs in order to return to <hi>Portugal.</hi> At <hi>Cochin</hi> he refused him a convenient Ship, contrary to an Order he had from the King to act as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and chuse such Vessel as he liked. He was forced to set out in a Merchant-Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, hired for himself and Family. Tho the Viceroy treated him ill there, no less ill usage was designed him here; and doubtless the knowledge <hi>D. Garcia</hi> had of the ill will the Ministers of State here bore him was the cause of his hard usage there.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. <hi>Nuno de Cuna</hi> by the way fell sick and died. He protested at his death, that he had nothing belonging to the King but five Pieces of Coin, or Medals of Gold, found among the dead King <hi>Badur</hi>'s Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which for their Beauty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And he answered, <hi>Since God is pleased I should die at Sea, let the Sea be my Grave. Since the Land would not have me, I will not give it my Bones.</hi> He died like a good Christian. Ordered a sufficient Weight should be tied to his Feet to carry him to the bottom. Thus ended an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Governor of <hi>India.</hi> His Age fifty two years. He was Son of <hi>Tristan de Cuna</hi> and <hi>Donna Antonia de Albuquerque.</hi> Of stature large and well proportioned. He want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one Eye.

Justice, free from Avarice, prudent in Counsel, affable in Discourse. His Picture represents his Complexion fair, his Beard black, all the Cloaths black, only the Cap blew. He governed ten years wanting two months, and died the beginning of the year 1539. He was the tenth Governor, and first of the Name.</p>

                  <p>SINCE our <hi>Asia</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a new Prince, let us begin another Tome with a different Style. As the other Prefaces were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Instructions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments of pure Zeal; so shall this with the delightful Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of a curious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion. For when Fortune makes it her Sport to heap Burdens of Care, there is none so resolved or unmoved but requires Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Ease. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Portugal</hi> parted from

Ferdinand Tellez de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> was the last Governour of <hi>India</hi> sent by our Natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and his Picture was the last the Hall in the Palace of <hi>Goa,</hi> appointed to hang up the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures of the Viceroys and Governors, could contain. The Name of the first Viceroy of <hi>India</hi> was <hi>Francis,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his is the first of those Pictures; and now we see the Name of the first Viceroy sent

If there be still any obstinate Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, who hold, That all Worldly Things are the meer Effect of Chance, let them contemn the Consideration of these Parallels on such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Occasions; but let not those despise it, who allowing the most inconsiderable Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs to be the Work of Providence, cannot but be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured the Great are much more its Care. Let not those, I say, undervalue it, who know the Immortal Providence can be discovered but by Shadows. The Divine Power has always taken this course to manifest it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

to Man. What Wonder then it should take that Method in the Revolution of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, more peculiarly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ himself? Thus then, these wonderful Presages first concurring, (not to spea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Who would not
<pb facs="tcp:54711:528"/>
believe, that the <hi>Portugueses</hi> would lose their Valour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost their Natural Prince, since it is certain the Presence of Princes is the chief Strength of it? We shall see them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this Glory, but not of that Virtue. Our Hero's of this Age did not degenerate from those of the other, so soon as naturally might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Such was their Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, such their Courage, they seem to have exceeded the Bounds of their Fortune, and even of Nature.</p>

Affair of the Custom-House was settled. He dispatched the Ships for <hi>Lisbon,</hi> one whereof was never heard of. The Vice-Roy <hi>D. Francis</hi> returned in one of them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Vice-Roy being at <hi>Goa</hi> treated with the Ambassador of <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> about the manner of chastising the <hi>Nayque</hi> of <hi>Sanguicer,</hi> for the Death of <hi>D.

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Hierome</hi> entring the River, sent up 13 Vessels that rowed, and at break of Day couragiously landed, attacked some Works, killed many of their Defendants, and took their Cannon. Then they marched to the Town, and the Inhabitants flying up the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, fell into the Hands of <hi>Rostican,</hi> who, according to agreement, was upon his March destroying all before him. Next day <hi>D. Hierome</hi> landed, and he marching on the one side, and <hi>Rostican</hi> on the other, they laid all the Country in Ashes.

                        <hi>Mousel.</hi> The King of <hi>Ternate,</hi> whose the Island was, resolving to be revenged on three of the Barques that went for Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to <hi>Baçham,</hi> sent his Brother <hi>Cachil Tulo</hi> with 24 Galliots to take them. They being abroad on this Design, met two Vessels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Philipine</hi> Islands that had also brought Relief to <hi>Tidore,</hi> commanded by <hi>N. de Duenas.</hi> He not able to avoid them, attacked the Admiral Galliot and sunk her, but all the others falling upon the 2 Vessels, in which were but 12 Spaniards, they were all slain, having fought to admiration, and killed and wounded many of the Enemy. <hi>Tulo</hi> proud of this Success, met those he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looked for, after a desperate fight night parted them, 200 of the <hi>Ternatenses</hi> and 8 <hi>Spaniards</hi> being killed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Then arrived at <hi>Tidore Duarte Pereyra</hi> with one Galleon, he went to succeed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zambuja,</hi> who instead of resigning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, assaulted <hi>Pereyra</hi> in a House where he was with his Wife and Family, and all was in great danger, had not the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed. At the same time arrived 400 <hi>Spaniards</hi> from <hi>Manila</hi> to assist <hi>Azambuja</hi> to recover the Fort of <hi>Ternate,</hi> but he sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pereyra</hi> in his absence would take Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Command, resolved to let slip this opportunity. <hi>Pereyra</hi> understanding it, and being of another mind, said, <q>Such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affairs ought not to be lost upon such Motives; that if the other would go, he would bear him Company.</q> At length <hi>Azembuja</hi> set out, accompanied by the Kings
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54711:545"/>
of <hi>Tidore, Bacham</hi> and <hi>Celebes.</hi> They land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though opposed by the Natives, batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fort without effect, lost some Men, and retired to <hi>Tidore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. The City <hi>Tauris,</hi> on the Borders of the greater <hi>Armenia,</hi> at the Foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Orote,</hi> was once the Court of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> and is now one of the most famous Places of Trade in the East, rich and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. The Great <hi>Turk</hi> desiring to raise a Fort there, sent <hi>Osman Bassa</hi> with a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Army, who encamped before it on the Banks of a River. The <hi>Persian</hi> Emperor was ready to receive him with 70000 Horse, and sent out a Party to engage him, while his Son <hi>Mirazen Mirsa</hi> lay in Ambush with 10000 to break out in the heat of the Fight. The Youth was brave, and performed his Part so well, that at one onset he killed 7000 <hi>Turks,</hi> and retired with Honour and Booty. 7000 pursue him, and he facing them cut off one half of them. Next day the <hi>Turks</hi> assault the City, but the <hi>Persians</hi> sallying, killed 3000 at that time, and again at Night 4000 more. But the Governor after this abandons the City, yet the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants stood upon their defence, and at first made a great slaughter, till over-powered by the multitude many of them were put to the Sword, their Wives and Daughters abused, and all plundered.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Osman</hi> being now in Possession, in a Months time raised a wonderful Fort for greatness and strength in the Royal Gardens as the most convenient place. Some of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54711:546"/>
                        <hi>Turks</hi> frequenting the Baths in the City, fell out with some of the Inhabitants, and being worsted by them, stirred up the whole Army to revenge. They left no sort of Villany unessayed, but Murdered, Ravished, Robbed, and marched out with an unspeakble Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The Prince of <hi>Persia</hi> in a Rage ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of his Father 20000 Horse, and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> at one time killed 8000, and soon after 20000. They decamped and began to march, and the Prince desiring to recover the Treasure they had taken at <hi>Tauris,</hi> was so successful, that killing 20000 more he retired with 18000 Camels loaded with Riches, and an infinite quantity of Arms and Ammunition. He pursues them again, but Fortune changing, he did less harm than he received, and was forced to retire with loss of 3000 <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. Fifteen Years before this time there came upon the Country of <hi>Moçambique,</hi> such an Inundation of <hi>Cafres,</hi> that they could not be numbred. They came from that Part of <hi>Monomotapa</hi> where is the great Lake, out of which spring those great Rivers whose source was formerly unknown, to these were joined the <hi>Cafres, Macabires</hi> and <hi>Ambei,</hi> and other Borderers upon <hi>Abissinia.</hi> With them came their Wives and Families as those that sought new Countries to inhabit, their own not being able to contain them. Their choice Food human Flesh, and for want of it that of Beasts. They left no other signs of the Towns they passed by, but the heaps of Ruins and Bones of the Inhabitants. For
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54711:546"/>
want of them they eat their own, beginning by the Sick and Aged, so that doubtless Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers became Food to their Children. The Women deformed and hardy, carry their Goods on their Backs, and in fight use the Bow as dexterously as the Men, these march in Armour, and where-ever they halt fortifie themselves.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Hierome de Andrade,</hi> from the Castle of <hi>Tete,</hi> sent out a Party of Musqueteers, who firing among that Multitude killed some to their great astonishment, having never before seen that sort of Arms, that they fled without looking back; in two Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters above 5000 were slain. They stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not till they came to the Country of <hi>Moçambique,</hi> having destroyed all in their way like a fiery Inundation. This Place was approved of by <hi>Mambea,</hi> Commander of about 6000, and he began to build a Fort and Towns two Leagues from <hi>Moçam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique.</hi> The Fort of <hi>Cuama</hi> where <hi>Nunno Vello Pereyra</hi> commanded, was much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded by them, he therefore sent out <hi>Antony Rodrigues Pimentel,</hi> or <hi>Pinto,</hi> with 400 Men, four of them <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who unexpectedly falling on the Barbarians, slew a vast number and burnt the Fort, but retiring in disorder, they fell upon and killed him and all his Men, except three <hi>Portugueses</hi> and very few Blacks. All the dead were eaten by the victorious <hi>Cafres,</hi> except their Heads, Hands and Feet.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Since this Relation has brought us to <hi>Moçambique,</hi> it will not be amiss to give
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54711:547"/>
some Account of that Country. It is full of Orchards and Fruit-trees, especially Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, Limon and Orange-trees, has all sorts of tame and wild Beasts, as in <hi>Europe,</hi> an infinite number of Elephants. The People feed on Indian-Wheat, the Woods are of Ebony, a high Tree, bearing a Leaf like that of our Apple-trees, the Fruit like Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars but not eatable; from the Ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it is so covered with Thorns, it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to come to it; where one is cut down, another never grows; the Bark of it is as susceptible of Fire as tinder. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of a yellowish Colour that is of value. The best Manna is produced here. Among the Fish of that River, there is one as devouring as Crododils; no Man in reach escapes them, but they touch not Women, so great is the Privilege of that Sex. One of these of a prodigious bigness was taken that had Gold Rings in the Ears. It was supposed to be some piece of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft of the <hi>Cafres,</hi> to clear the River of those dangerous Monsters. To confirm this Opinion, <hi>Metude</hi> a learned <hi>Arabian</hi> relates in an account of Modern Prodigies, That about the Year 863, in the Foundation of an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Temple there was found a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Crocodile with certain Characters, which being broke to pieces the Crocodils of <hi>Nile</hi> began to devour Men; whence it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that was a Charm upon the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Hatred conceived against the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of <hi>Nizamaluco</hi> in <hi>Canara,</hi> brought the

                        <hi>Mogols</hi> upon the Kingdom of <hi>Verara,</hi> who after much Plunder and Desolation possessed themselves of many Towns and Cities. The occasion was, that the King being ill of a contagious Distemper, his Favourite <hi>Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decan</hi> first, and after him <hi>Calabatecan,</hi> kept him up without suffering any Body to see him. The Prince and People <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="13">13. Five Ships sailed this Year from <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> for <hi>India,</hi> one of them was lost beyond the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope,</hi> at the Place called <hi>Bajos de la India,</hi> a Promontory that rises with many Points, which at a distance look like Trees; it is oval and three Leagues in length, and abounds in Coral, which being naturally soft and white, grows hard and turns green, grey, black and red, but being pounded to Dust, resumes its whiteness.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Captain with a few Men got into a Boat, and after six Days landed at <hi>Quilimane.</hi> About sixty got into another Boat, others put to Sea on Planks, above two hundred were upon the Rocks expecting to be swallowed by the Sea, or else scorched by the Sun, or starved to Death.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Those in the second Vessel chose <hi>Duarte de Melo de Baçaim</hi> to command them, and being over-loaded, were forced the first

time to throw Seventeen into the Sea to save the rest, and, not being light enough, afterwards some others, among which the Lot fell upon one of two Brothers, the youngest whereof freely leaped overboard, but having swam three Leagues after the Boat, was again taken up.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. A Boat built by the Pilot <hi>Roderick Migueys</hi> contained 40 Men, as they were under Sail a great Storm arose at Night, and is said to have ceased, by casting into the Water a piece of the Holy Cross one of them carried.

THE Vice-Roy governed <hi>India,</hi> and his Unkle <hi>Ruy Gonçalez de Camara</hi> him, who desiring to engross all that was honourable, endangered what was necessary. It was requisite at the same time to send a Squadron into the Red Sea, and another to build a Fort at <hi>Panane</hi> in <hi>Malabar,</hi> and he would command the one and build the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Work ought to be solid and of Stone, yet the Vice-Roy agreed it should be slight and of Wood, that being soon finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Camara</hi> might be free to take the other Command.</p>

2. <hi>Camara</hi> being come to <hi>Panane,</hi> adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>Zamori</hi> of his Design, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, desired him to wait his coming, for he would be present at the chusing the Ground. He delayed coming, because his Bramenes could not find a lucky day for him to set out; and <hi>Camara</hi> being in haste, sent Presents to those Fortune-tellers, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon presently found a fortunate hour.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Zamori</hi> being come, the Fort was made of Wood, and the Command of it given to <hi>Ruy Gomez de Gram,</hi> who pulled it all down, and built it after another manner, and of considerable strength. So that <hi>Gram</hi> built the Fort, and <hi>Camara</hi> had the Credit of it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As soon as <hi>Camara</hi> had, as he thought, finished what <hi>Gram</hi> believed not begun, he went aboard his Squadron, which having been ill undertaken came to a worse end. Too much haste in going to <hi>Panane,</hi> made him too slow in going to the Red Sea; and now this slowness in going to Sea was as prejudicial as the haste in building the Fort. His Squadron consisted of four Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, two Galleons, and twenty other Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</p>

Scarce were they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when the Enemy rising from an Ambush fell on them with such fury, that breaking those who were drawn up, and hindering the others from forming themselves, they slew 250, forcing the rest to swim to their Vessels, many whereof were drowned. This was one of the greatest and most shameful Losses we sustained in <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. The pretence for sending this Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> was to fight the <hi>Turkish</hi> Galleys that were to set out from <hi>Moca,</hi> whereas in truth there were no such Galleys, and the real design was only to employ <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara,</hi> and strengthen his Pretensions; and whereas he ought to have entred <hi>Goa</hi> in mourning after such a Loss, he entred
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54711:549"/>
that place with all demonstrations of Joy as if Triumphant, and had great favour shewn him. So fortunate is undeserving Impudence.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Nevertheless the pretence of sending out this Squadron was made good by two rotten Galleys that afterwards put to Sea from <hi>Moca.</hi> One of them so rotten, she sunk as soon as out of the Port; the other did as much as might have been expected from a sound Squadron. Of such efficacy is the Valour or Fortune of one single Man. Such was the More <hi>Mir Alibet,</hi> who now confirmed the great Opinion before concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his Abilities, for coming before the City <hi>Magadano,</hi> he brought it under the subjection of the Great <hi>Turk</hi> only by telling the Inhabitants, he was but the Forerunner of a great Fleet that came to conquer all the Coast of <hi>Melinde.</hi> At the City <hi>Lufiva</hi> he took from <hi>Rocque de Brito</hi> a rich little Ship that had there put itself under the Protection of the King of <hi>Lamo,</hi> who basely betrayed it to the <hi>More</hi> upon Promise from him of being spared himself, which Promise the <hi>More</hi> after broke. The <hi>Portugues</hi> defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself bravely, but was at last put to the Oar, and died at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>

                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Iohn Cayado de Gamboa</hi> being abroad with some Ships against the Pirats of the North, found that <hi>Caliche Mahomet</hi> had a Ship at <hi>Surat</hi> which he designed to put out without the <hi>Portugueses</hi> Leave. <hi>Gambo</hi> lay to keep him in, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> sent him 3000 Ducats underhand to remove, which he took, and therewith in the Town bought Provisions, whereof he stood in need to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue there. This done, he returned the Money, letting the <hi>More</hi> know, He was not a Man that would sell his Honour, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Thanks for supplying him with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions whereof he stood in need, to lay wait for his Ship.

                     <p n="11">11. Some time since, <hi>Raju</hi> Son of the Tyrant <hi>Madune</hi> of <hi>Ceylon</hi> had besieged our Fort of <hi>Columbo,</hi> commanded by <hi>Emanuel de Sousa Coutinno,</hi> who defended it with Valour.

But percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that his Father, Brothers, and some principal Subjects, were a hindrance to his wicked Designs, he murdered them all.

                     <p n="12">12. The Tyrant began to turn his Fury upon the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and they, though but few, engaged a Body of 4000 of his Men, killed 800 of them, and their Commander <hi>Pali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Message was full of Kindness, but the young Man well understood the smiles of Tyrants are fatal, and that the hour he went to him would be the last of his Life. He therefore with a pleasing Countenance entertained the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers (who had orders to carry him by force if he refused) and preparing a Dose of most strong Poison, went with it where his Wives, Children and Family were.

                     <p n="8">8. This Success made D. <hi>Antony de No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronna</hi> believe it was easie to take the City, if he assaulted it in the Morning. Ambitious of gaining this Honour, and contrary to the Opinion of the Captains, he Assaults the City with only 200 Men, knowing there were 12000 within, and the Walls at every step planted with Cannon. Nevertheless he entred it, but had lost his Life, had not D. <hi>Paul de Lima</hi>'s Captains snatched him out of the Enemies Hands, being penned up between Palisades with only Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Souldiers, and gained him time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to his Ships.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The City <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54711:556"/>
strong, being composed of vast Beams well knit together; at small distances are Bastions all well stored with Artillery, and defended by great numbers of Malays, Manancabo's, and Islanders of <hi>Iava</hi> and other Warlike Places, some of them commanded by their Kings, as those of <hi>Tringale, Dragut, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par,</hi> and others. The River adds much to this strength, embracing the City with two Arms.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. D. <hi>Paul</hi> being come, consulted the manner of attempting the place, and began a Battery with good success. The Enemies Fleet endeavoured a Diversion, but in vain. The Battery was continued till the day of the Assumption of our B. Lady, to which D. <hi>Paul</hi> had a peculiar Devotion.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The morning of that day he landed 600 <hi>Portugueses</hi> in three Bodies. D. <hi>Antony de Noronna,</hi> who led one, had a hot Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about landing with a Number of the Enemies Musketiers, who being repulsed, still rallied; but at length our Men made their way to attempt the Town, where some of them were killed, endeavouring to force a passage where there was none.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. In the mean while D. <hi>Paul</hi> cutting through 2000 of the Enemy in a Wood, joyned D. <hi>Antony,</hi> and both together broke into the City. The Enemy no longer able to sustain our Fury, gave way, and was pursued by those two Bodies into the City. The third of our Battalions had the same success in getting in, and with equal danger, being charged by one of the Kings upon an
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54711:556"/>
Elephant with a strong and resolute Party. But the Beast being shot by D. <hi>Nunno Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez Pereyra</hi> so disordered them, that our Men had the opportunity to advance.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Fight was very desperate in the Streets, many Arrows and Darts flying from the Windows; yet our Men advanced till they came to the place where the King was with his Allies, and there the Battle was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed. D. <hi>Paul</hi> encouraged his Men, not only with Words, but with his Example, leading them on with Sword in hand.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. After 6 hours Combat, the fortune of the Day still seemed dubious, till <hi>Matias Pereyra,</hi> who had only 15 Men left with him of 150, attacked and entred the Fort <hi>Bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bato,</hi> which gave new Life to our Men almost spent with continual Labour.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Luis Martines Pereyra,</hi> who was left to command the Fleet, ceased not battering the Town, hearing only the noise of the Fight, and seeing the Enemies Colours upon the Walls, but seeing the Christian set up on the Fort <hi>Cotabato,</hi> he desisted. The Kings also discovering them, and other signs of their Ruin, mounted on Elephants with their Wives, and fled up the Inland.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. After the Victory the City was fired, which being great, and of combustible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, raised a terrible Flame. Many People were burnt, chiefly Women and Children, who in the Confusion could not escape. The Booty was very great, the Prisoners many, and the number of Slain by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> amounted to 4000, besides near
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54711:557"/>
3000 killed by those that came to assist <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jale</hi> when they saw he was defeated; on our side 80 were lost. Almost 1000 Pieces of Cannon were found, some very large, 1500 Muskets, and 2200 Vessels. D. <hi>Paul</hi> of all the Booty took to himself only an Image of our B. Lady, found by a Soldier in the Wood where he was first ingaged.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The City <hi>Malaca</hi> resolved to receive D. <hi>Paul</hi> in Triumph; D. <hi>Antony de Noronna,</hi> for the share he had in this Victory, desired he would let him go by his Side, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Gloriam mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="2">2. The People was astonished at this fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity between their Prince and Idols, and he pretending Obedience to the Divine Commands, caused 500 Children to be snatched from their Mothers Arms, which were all slaughtered, and the Idols sprinkled with their Blood.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thus prepared, he marched and sate down before the Town, choosing the Ground he best liked, there being no body to hinder

him. Our Commander <hi>Iohn de Brito</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Storm was like to fall upon him, had made the best provision he could. He had but 300 <hi>Portugueses,</hi> the third part of them useless, being old Men or Children, and 700 Natives and Slaves, which he posted to the best advantage about that Wall, the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference whereof is very great, reserving 50 to be ready with himself wherever the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Danger called. <hi>Raju</hi> spent a month in dreining a Lake that on one side secured the Town, about this Work, and securing some Boats, we had upon that Water, there were many Skirmishes, in which the Enemy came off with great loss.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Fort was much weakened by the want of that Water, which was the chief Defence on that side. Our Commander gave Advice of the Danger he was in to the Neighbouring Places. The first that sent Relief was <hi>Iohn de Melo</hi> Commander of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar,</hi> it consisted of 40 Men under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Nephew <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was posted on the side of the Lake. Whilst <hi>Raju</hi> prepared for the Attack, there was a Skirmish between the Besiegers and Besieged, in which the former lost many Men, and had some of their Works levelled.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. On the 4th of <hi>August,</hi> before day, <hi>Raju</hi> advanced to give the first Assault, with such silence he could not be heard, and the Darkness was such he could not have been seen, but the Musketiers lighted Matches discovered them. They laid their Ladders,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54711:558"/>
and mounted the Bastions St. <hi>Michael,</hi> St. <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calo,</hi> and St. <hi>Francis,</hi> 2000 Pioniers at the same time working below to undermine the Wall, many of the former were cast down upon these last, and abundance of them in the Field torn in pieces by our Cannon.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. All within and without was full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion with the Cries of Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Groans of Wounded Men, and Noise of Cannon and Elephants. These, forced to the Walls by their Governors, were again put back with many Wounds, and did great execution among their own Men. The multitude of the Enemy was such, no Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seemed to lessen them, fresh Men still succeeding in the place of the Dead.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Our Commander was in all places where the greatest Danger called, and after a most tedious Dispute, that vast number of Enemies gave way, leaving 400 Men dead or dying under the Walls. Some few <hi>Chinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s, who were retired to the Fort for fear of the Tyrant, fought as if they had been <hi>Portugueses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Twice after this was the Assault re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and the Enemy as often repulsed. The King enraged fortifies himself anew, and provides for another Attack. <hi>Iames Fernandez Pessoa</hi> coming from <hi>Negapatan</hi> with a Ship of his own was stopped by a Storm, but came afterwards. <hi>Antony de Aguiar &amp; Vasconcelos</hi> arrived with a Ship, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the Besieged. The Modeliar of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> D. <hi>Iohn de Austria,</hi> and the Arache D. <hi>Alfonso,</hi> did great execution among the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54711:559"/>
                        <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and a Soldier called <hi>Ioseph Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez</hi> of great strength, threw several of them behind him for those that followed to kill them, he having before broke his Spear.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The City <hi>Cochim</hi> understanding the danger of <hi>Columbo,</hi> fitted out 6 Ships with Men and Ammunition, under the Command of <hi>Nuno Alvarez de Atouguia,</hi> to relieve that place. But <hi>Raju</hi> resolving to prevent all Relief, on the 20th of <hi>August,</hi> at night, gave another general Assault both by Sea and Land, so that Religious Men were forced to play the parts of Officers and Soldiers; and the Enemy after a great Slaughter was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed in both places.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Then came <hi>Atouguia</hi> with the Relief sent from <hi>Cochim;</hi> and from St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and other places, arrived of their own free will <hi>Ferdinand de Lima, Emanuel de Amaral,</hi> and <hi>Roderick de Alvarez.

Such was the Hatred they had towards him, as obliged them to commit this brutal Action. In <hi>September</hi> arrived a Galley and 6 Ships, under the Command of <hi>Bernardin de Carvallo,</hi> sent to their Assistance by the City of <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. Before these Ships departed thence, four were come in from <hi>Lisbon;</hi> five set out, but one was forced back. These Ships car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54711:559"/>
new Instructions about Trade, the King having agreed with Merchants about setting out the <hi>India</hi> Squadron. These Instructions were so prejudicial to the Inhabitants of <hi>Goa,</hi> that the Viceroy had need of all his Authority, and that of Religious Men to appease them. All this was the Project of insatiable Ministers of State, who, for their own interest, will hazard the Ruin of an Empire, on pretence of Zeal to the Prince.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Relief being come to <hi>Columbo, Raju</hi> despairing of carrying the Place by Assault, resolved to undermine it, and had effected it, but that <hi>Thomas de Sousa</hi> found out a way to destroy the Miners in the Work. The Tyrant next applied himself to Treachery, and agreed with some of his Wizards, that counterfeiting Discontent they should desert to the Town, poison their Water, and bewitch our Men. These were suspected, put to the Rack, confessed the Design, and were drowned. While one of these was on the Rack, he uttered some Words which deprived the Executioners of their Senses, and left them struggling with Convulsions for 24 hours. <hi>Raju</hi> afterwards sent others, and they were punished as the former.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Treachery failing, he turns again to Force, and causes his Fleet to attack ours commanded by <hi>Thomas de Sousa,</hi> who sunk two of his Ships, and took two, killing most of the Men, and hanging the rest at the Yard. Arms. Of the Enemy 300 were slain, of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54711:560"/>
ours only two private Men. <hi>Raju</hi> in a rage beheaded the Captains of his Fleet, because they had not overcome ours. Now arrived <hi>Philip Carneyro</hi> with a Ship laden with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition sent by the Viceroy, and <hi>Antony de Brito,</hi> and <hi>Emanuel de Macedo,</hi> Voluntiers. The Enemy gave another Assault by Night with the same Success as the former.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. At the same time came <hi>Iohn Cayado de Gamboa,</hi> sent by the Viceroy with a Galleon and 150 Men, many of them of Note. Our Commander finding himself strong, sent out <hi>Peter Alfonso</hi> with a Squadron to destroy all he could along the Coast. He did so in the Towns of <hi>Belicote, Berberii,</hi> and <hi>Beligao,</hi> where, for haste to take off the Women's Bracelets and Pendants, they cut off their Hands and Ears, and having made great Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock in many other places, they returned with much Booty and Prisoners.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. But now Sickness threatned to do what <hi>Raju</hi> with all his Power could not effect. This Disease began to rage in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Towns, and being brought into the City, the Physitians found no Cure for it. This Year was drier than any had been known that Age, and that was thought to cause this Malady. The Doctors opening some that died of it, found their Entrails im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postumated, which they said proceeded from Heat occasioned by that Drought. They then applied cold and dry Medicines, and the Disease decreased.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Year ended, but not the Siege. In the beginning of <hi>Ianuary Raju</hi> gave two
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54711:560"/>
Assaults, in the last of which the Bastions of St. <hi>Sebastian,</hi> St. <hi>Conçalo,</hi> and <hi>Santiago,</hi> were in great danger; but by the bravery of the Defendants the Enemy was at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed, having lost many Men, and three Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Mean while our Fleet, again sent out under the Command of <hi>Thomas de Sousa,</hi> ruined all along the Coast of <hi>Ceylon.</hi> He destroyed the Villages of <hi>Coscore, Madania, Guindurem, Galé, Beligao, Maturé,</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navar,</hi> where the Idolaters were now unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, who believed, our Arms could never reach that place by reason of a Pagod that is there. The Pagod is seated on a Hill not far from the Town, and at Sea locks like a City. The circumference of it was above a League; it is richly Vaulted, and the Arches covered with gilded Copper Plates; the Idols in it were above 1000 on the side Chapels, and large Cloisters. All round were Streets full of Shops, because People from all Parts resorted to the Pagod. <hi>Sousa</hi> entring this Temple, cast down all the Idols, demolished the curious Workmanship, carried away all that could be removed on Men's backs, and killed Cows within, which is the greatest Affront can be offered to those Idolaters.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Let us in a few words here perpetuate the Memory of two illustrious Actions; the one the effect of a sincere Love, the other of true Generosity. Among the Prisoners taken at <hi>Coscore,</hi> one was a Bride. As the Ships were ready to weigh Anchor, there ran suddenly into that where the young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54711:561"/>
was a lusty Man, and embracing her, and she him, they said many words not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. By the help of an Interpreter it was known, that that Man was the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, who being abroad when the Bride was taken, came to be a Slave with her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than live without her. <hi>And,</hi> she said, <hi>That since he by that demonstration of Love had made her happier than all the</hi> Chingala <hi>Women,</hi> (for they were of those People) <hi>she esteemed her Slavery rather a Blessing, than a Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Sousa</hi> hearing hereof, resolved not to part such real Lovers, and taking hold of both their hands, said, <hi>God forbid two such Lovers for my private Interest should be made unhappy, Love has sufficiently captivated you, I freely give you your Liberties.</hi> Then he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to be set ashore; but they two seeing his unexpected Bounty, requited it by despising their Liberties, and replied, <hi>They only desired to be his, and die in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> They lived afterwards in <hi>Columbo,</hi> where the Man on sundry occasions faithfully served the <hi>Portugueses.</hi>

                        <p>The Government of <hi>Emanuel de Sousa Coutinno,</hi> from the Year 1588, till 1590.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Viceroy being dead, and Patents of Succession opened, they first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Matthias de Albuquerque,</hi> who was gone for <hi>Portugal;</hi> the second, <hi>Emanuel de Sousa Coutinno,</hi> then present, who took upon him the Government, and was well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for it, as being very brave, and well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the Affairs of <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Soon after arrived 5 Ships from <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> D. <hi>Paul de Lima,</hi> weary of the Toils of War, and much more troubled that he was so ill rewarded, resolved to return to <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Ships that were homeward bound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being dispatched, D. <hi>Paul</hi> imbarked in that called <hi>The St. Thomas,</hi> whereof <hi>Stephen de Vega</hi> was Captain. On the Coast of <hi>Natal</hi> she sprung aleak in the Stern, and a Storm raging she could not be kept above Water, though they threw over board all the Riches that was in her.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Boat being lanched, all strove to perish in it, because they would have it hold all that the Ship contained. Several were killed upon this occasion, and D. <hi>Paul</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the side with his Sword drawn, could
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54711:562"/>
no way prevent it. At length, those that the Boat could not contain returned to the Ship. The Women were let down, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most drowned before they were taken in, because it could not come to the Ship's side. D<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. <hi>Ioanna de Mendoca</hi> going in to it, left behind a Daughter but two Years old, and calling for her afterwards, could not get her, because the Nurse would not let the Child go unless they would take her with it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Boat was not far from the Ship when they saw it swallowed up by the Sea. It was yet worse, that being over-loaded with 120 Persons, and there being no other Remedy left, they were forced to throw some into the Sea, who immediately sunk. The Boat came to the Shore.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Ninety eight Persons, Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, landed, several of them Gentlemen of Note, their Wives, and some Friers, one of which after having confessed, the People in the Ship would have stayed to die with them, that he might be aiding to them in that last hour. They marched in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a Frier going before with a Crucifix on high. The Women put themselves into Men's Habit after the <hi>Indian</hi> manner, that their Coats might not be a hinderance to them in going.</p>

They were sent, and instead of securing him, so dispersed themselves in the Wood, that the Enemy taking the advantage cut them all off. The
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54711:565"/>
second; A <hi>Portugues</hi> Galley meeting some Pirats of <hi>Cangane</hi> pursued them with Scoffs, scorning to take up Arms against them, and they turning upon the Galley entred it, and put all the Men to the Sword.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The third; The Admiral that was so unfortunate in the Red Sea in the Year 1586, having now taken a rich Ship of <hi>Meca</hi> and killed the Captain, order'd the Moors in her (as if it had been one of his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons) to follow the Admiral's Light. They as soon as it was night fled, and he being ashamed to be so deceived, endeavoured to excuse himself by saying, The Jesuits had advised him so to do, as if that were any Justification of his Folly. The fourth; Seven hundred <hi>Portugueses</hi> from <hi>Chatigam,</hi> took a Town, and being in it, a Cannon that was hid accidentally took fire, and they without examining further, fled to their Ships in such a Consternation, that one single Moor durst follow them throwing of Stones.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Two of our Gallies going to <hi>Chaul,</hi> to bring an Ambassador sent by the <hi>Mogol,</hi> were set upon at the River of <hi>Carapatan,</hi> Eighteen Leagues from <hi>Goa,</hi> by a great Squadron of <hi>Malabars,</hi> commanded by the famous Moor <hi>Castamuza.</hi> After a tedious fight, the Enemy left them in such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that only their departure could have saved our Men, who may be said to have had the Victory, because they kept the Field.</p>

The Vice-Roy understanding that the King of <hi>Iafanapatan</hi> assisted him of <hi>Candea</hi> against, and delighted in Persecuting such as imbraced the Christian Religion, calling himself King of Kings, sent against him <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Furtado,</hi> that great Commander, with 20 Sail.</p>

3. Off of <hi>Calicut</hi> he met three Ships of <hi>Meca,</hi> after a hot Engagement he sunk two and took one. Then he sailed in search of the Pirat <hi>Cotimuza,</hi> Nephew and Admiral to <hi>Cunnale,</hi> who with 14 (some say 22) Galleys, was become absolute on the Coast of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> had taken several of our Ships, and designed to take from us the Forts of <hi>Columbo</hi> and <hi>Manar.</hi> At the Mouth of the River <hi>Cardiva, Furtado</hi> met and fought him, and he having behaved himself well escaped by swimming, leaving us pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of his whole Fleet. It is pity we want the Particulars of this fine Action.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Our Admiral after this Victory entring the Port of <hi>Manar,</hi> found there a great Fleet, and made himself Master of it, many of the Men swimming a-shore to join the King's Army. <hi>Furtado</hi> Lands and marches toward the Town, which was well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, manned and provided. He assaults the Works, and drives the Defendants into the Town, whence the King with severe Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage made his Commander return to Charge the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> without hearkning to the Advice he gave him to shift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, because they would soon be in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. The General returned, and was kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all his Men. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, slew the King and his eldest Son, his younger Brother casting himself at <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado</hi>'s Feet begged his Life, which was granted him, and the Government of that Kingdom, till the Vice-Roy should order it otherwise. He was afterwards made King upon reasonable Terms.</p>

5. At this time <hi>Cunnale Marcar,</hi> a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the King of <hi>Calicut,</hi> successfully scoured that Coast with a good Squadron. Against him the Vice-Roy sent D. <hi>Alvaro de Abranchez</hi> with a considerable Fleet. F. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis da Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

D. <hi>Alvaro</hi> sent him to the Vice-Roy, the Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to the content of both Parties, and <hi>Zamori</hi> not only released all the Slaves in his Kingdom, but encouraged the Jesuits to build a Church, himself laying the first Stone.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The beginning of this Year sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> four Ships, two whereof we shall see miserably perish, at the latter end of the Year following.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Let us go to <hi>Moçambique,</hi> where there happened a great loss. Our Commander of <hi>Tete</hi> had some Skirmishes with the Cafres our Enemies. <hi>Tete</hi> is a Fort of that Authority, that all the Neighbours for three Leagues about, divided under eleven Captains, obey the Commander of it, as each does their own, and upon the least signal given resort thither, to the number of 2000 armed Men. With these <hi>Cafres,</hi> and some <hi>Portugueses,</hi> he marched against <hi>Quisura,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Munbo Cafres,</hi> who was at <hi>Chicarongo.</hi> Six hundred of these gave him Battle, and were cut off every Man of them, whereby many Prisoners were released, who were to have
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54711:567"/>
been slaughtered like Cattle for the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, theirs being of human Flesh. The Tyrant <hi>Quisura</hi> was also killed, who used to pave the way to his Habitation with the Sculls of those he had overcome.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Andrew de Santiago,</hi> Commander of the Fort of <hi>Sena,</hi> designing as much against the <hi>Muzimba</hi>'s, found them so well fortified, he was obliged to send to <hi>Peter Fernandes de Chaves,</hi> Commander of <hi>Tete,</hi> for aid. <hi>Chaves</hi> marched with some <hi>Portugues</hi> Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers and the <hi>Cafres</hi> under his Command; but the <hi>Muzimba</hi>'s being informed of it, and fearing the Conjunction of those Forces, fell upon him so unexpectedly, that they slew him and all his <hi>Portugueses,</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced before their <hi>Cafres,</hi> who thereby had time to retire. The Victors quarter'd the dead for Food, and returned with them to their Works. F. <hi>Nicholas</hi> of the Rosary, a Dominican, was reserved from this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral slaughter, and after shot to death with Arrows.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Next day the <hi>Muzimba</hi>'s marched out of their Works after their Leader, who had put on the <hi>Casula,</hi> or Vestment taken from the martyr'd Priest, and holding a Dart in his Right hand, and the Chalice in the Left. The Men carried the Commander of <hi>Tete</hi>'s Head on a Spear, and the Quarters of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> on their Backs. <hi>Andrew de San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiago</hi> astonished at that Sight thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire by Night, but the Enemy falling upon him he was killed with most of his Men; so that in both Actions above 130 of them
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54711:568"/>
were cut in pieces, to be buried in those Barbarians Bellies.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. D. <hi>Peter de Sousa,</hi> Commander of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çambique,</hi> under whose Jurisdiction <hi>Tete</hi> is, set out with 200 <hi>Portugueses</hi> and 1500 <hi>Cafres,</hi> to take Revenge on these <hi>Munzimba</hi>'s. He batter'd their Works, but with no success, and endeavouring to Scale them was repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Being likely to succeed, by raising Gabions as high as their Trenches, he was prevented by some cowardly <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who, to hide their fear, pretended the Fort of <hi>Sena</hi> was in danger. Our Commander draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off to relieve it, was attacked by the <hi>Muzimba</hi>'s, lost many of his Men, the Cannon and other Booty. Yet the Enemy offered a Peace, which was concluded.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Soon after one of these <hi>Muzimba</hi>'s marching Eastward, gather'd 15000 Men, and killing all in his way that had Life, set down before <hi>Quiloa,</hi> which he entred by the Treachery of one of the Inhabitants, and put them all to the Sword.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. This done, he caused the Traytor and all his Family in his presence to be cast into the River, saying, It was not fit such base People, who betrayed their Country, should be spared, nor yet eaten, because they were venomous, therefore he cast them to be Food for the Fish. So odious is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son even among Barbarians. He designed to have done the same at <hi>Melinde,</hi> but that King, assisted by 30 <hi>Portugueses,</hi> withstood him till 3000 of the <hi>Mosseguejo Cafres</hi> coming to the Relief of <hi>Melinde,</hi> the <hi>Muzimba</hi>'s
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54711:568"/>
were so slaughtered, that of all that Army only 100 escaped with the general, after they had ravaged 300 Leagues. Behold the Chalice of this <hi>Muzimba.</hi>

                     <p n="14">14. Let us return to <hi>India. Melique</hi> had a City opposite to <hi>Chaul,</hi> and of the same Name, full of <hi>Moors,</hi> and of great Trade as being a good Port, and famous for wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Silks. The Commander of it was an Eunuch, once a Slave to the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> now to <hi>Melique.</hi> This Man posted himself on that noted Height, called <hi>Morro,</hi> with 4000 Horse and 7000 Foot. <hi>Morro</hi> is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory over the Sea, and this runs down to the Shore of <hi>Chaul</hi> which lies to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, the River running between them.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. They terrified the <hi>Portugueses</hi> of <hi>Chaul,</hi> and destroyed them with 65 large Cannon they played from that Elevation.

16. This Siege was commenced in <hi>April,</hi> when Winter begins, at a time the <hi>Moors</hi> infested the Lands of <hi>Bacaim,</hi> and some Horse, those of <hi>Chaul.</hi> Small Vessels did great harm along the Coast, but much more was sustained in the City from the Cannon. Then came 14 <hi>Mogols</hi> to be present at the taking of the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> which they held as a thing certain, but being assaulted by some of our Men, 9 were killed, 2 taken, and the other 3 fled. The Eunuch <hi>Taladar</hi> escaped being taken, and died of his Wounds, as did a <hi>Turk</hi> that succeeded him in the Command. After him, that Post fell to <hi>Faratecan.</hi>

                     <p n="17">17. He with continual Batteries gave our Men no respite. About 1000 withstood his Power, till D. <hi>Alvaro de Abranches</hi> brought 300 from <hi>Baçaim,</hi> and another 200 from <hi>Salsete.</hi> They now made up 1500 <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and a like number of such faithful Slaves, that they received the Wounds themselves to protect their Masters. Having appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a day to attack the Enemy, they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed themselves, and then went up the River in several Vessels.</p>
                     <p n="18">18, The <hi>Portugueses,</hi> beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made their way to the Plain on the top of the Promontory, and there the Fight was renewed.

THE <hi>Portugueses,</hi> in hopes the Death of <hi>Raju</hi> might contribute towards recovering what they had lost in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> gave Advice thereof to the Viceroy, who sent thither <hi>Peter Lopez de Sousa</hi> with a good number of Men and Ammunition.

above 150 <hi>Portugueses</hi> suffered several sorts of Death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo</hi> succeeded <hi>Peter Lopez</hi> in this Command, and with 400 <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> fought 12000 <hi>Chingala's,</hi> but came off with great loss. These Mutiniers were commanded by <hi>Dominick Correa</hi> a <hi>Chingala,</hi> who was afterwards taken, carried to <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,</hi> and there quartered.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Five Ships arrived now from <hi>Portugal,</hi> and then was first carried into <hi>India</hi> the Bull of the <hi>Croisade,</hi> whereof F. <hi>Francis de Faria</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> was Commissary.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

6. The Annual Ship coming in <hi>April</hi> from <hi>China</hi> vastly rich, and being on the <hi>Malabar</hi> Coast almost in sight of <hi>Goa,</hi> was set upon by 14 Galliots of the Enemy. There were but 14 <hi>Portugueses</hi> in the Ship, <note place="margin">1594.</note> who fought 3 days and 3 nights till they were all killed; then an Islander of <hi>Iava</hi> going into the round Top from thence, with a Barrel of Powder set her a fire, so that the Enemy got little by her. A poor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Viceroy fitted out a Squadron of 18 Sail with 700 Men, and gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it to <hi>Andrew Furtado.</hi> On the first of <hi>August</hi> he met 3 Ships belonging to <hi>Zamori</hi> full of Riches, and People of both Sexes and all Ages, above 2000 of them were killed in Fight, the Ships taken, and the Booty was such, that a Servant happen'd upon 5 Bags of Pagods, a Gold Coin of the bigness of half a Royal Plate, but thicker, and worth a Crown. <hi>Furtado</hi> went on, and found the <hi>Malabar</hi> Fleet he went in search of in the River of <hi>Cardiga,</hi> which shunned not the Ingagement, but was totally defeated, and a great Booty taken.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Then he sailed for <hi>Ceylon,</hi> arrived at <hi>Columbo,</hi> and secured that place, in great danger of utter Ruin by means of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses,</hi> who were at Variance among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and mutinied against their Captain.

                     <p n="10">10. I find not any account of the Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of this Year, only that about the end end of it came 5 Ships from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and in one of them F. <hi>Alexius de Meneses,</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> who went to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed F. <hi>Matthew</hi> in the Archbishoprick of <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. About this time the Religious of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> to secure the Preaching of the Gospel in their District, raised a Fort at <hi>Solor,</hi> which grew so considerable, it was afterwards found convenient to send a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander thither. The first, or among the first, were <hi>Antony de Vellegas,</hi> and <hi>Antony de Andria,</hi> who put to the Sword many of the Natives that had killed some Religious Men. This Punishment, in stead of Amendment, made them worse, for two years after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring together, they agreed to kill the Commander and Friers. They fell furiously upon the Town and Fort, in the Town they did much harm, the Commander withdrew himself out of the Fort, and could not be found. They imagining he had forsaken it,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54711:571"/>
entred, and <hi>Andria</hi> with a few <hi>Portugueses</hi> coming upon them through a private Door they knew not of, killed most of them.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. A Galley and five other Vessels of ours cruizing off Cape <hi>Comori</hi> to secure our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from <hi>Coromandel,</hi> were so surprised by the <hi>Malabars,</hi> that they entred and burnt the Galley. The 5 Sail that were at some distance coming up time enough to have taken the Enemies Vessels, suffered them to go away without molestation.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. On the 5th of <hi>February</hi> happened the Death of the 7 <hi>Franciscan</hi> Martyrs of <hi>Iapan.</hi> They suffered at <hi>Nangataqui</hi> under the cruel <hi>Cambaco,</hi> in revenge <note place="margin">1596.</note> for the Numbers they had converted.

perceiving how convenient a place this was to shelter Pirats that might scour all that Coast, obtained Leave of <hi>Zamori,</hi> whose Subject he was, and the <hi>Peninsula</hi> his, to build a Fort there.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. He went over thither with his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Followers, and began to raise a square Fort on the East Point of it. From hence he began to make War upon us, taking many of our Ships richly laden. He assaulted the Village of <hi>Tana</hi> in the Island <hi>Salsete</hi> near <hi>Baçaim,</hi> and carried away a rich Booty, taking the opportunity of doing it, when those who should defend it were at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions of the Holy Week.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Mahomet Cunnale Marca</hi> succeeded him in the Sovereignty of that Fort, finished and increased it; and foreseeing the <hi>Portugueses</hi> would seek Revenge, he fortified the Town (called also <hi>Cunnale)</hi> by Sea and Land. On the Land side he made a deep Ditch with double Trenches 2 Yards and a half thick from Sea to Sea. At distances he raised Towers that flanked the Work, and on the Towers (by them called <hi>Zarames)</hi> planted small Cannon Between the two Creeks he built a strong Wall which secured the Town, with two Towers, one at each end, and along the Sea-shore stuck Palisadoes, where were also two Bastions, one greater than the other, planted with gross Cannon to secure the entrance of the Harbour, which besides was made very difficult even to small Vessels by Masts strongly chained together.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54711:574"/>
not removed yet, began to appear less ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. By order of the Visitor <hi>Valiniano,</hi> who resided at <hi>Iapan,</hi> there came from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> to <hi>Macao</hi> F. <hi>Matthew Rivius</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> to assist F. <hi>Michael Rogerius.</hi> They founded a Confraternity in that City for such <hi>Iaponeses</hi> and <hi>Chineses</hi> as were converted, calling it, <hi>The Sanctuary of Iesus.</hi> Other Fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted thither, and among them F. <hi>Francis Pasius.</hi>

8. It is remarkable, that when these Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Men were banished this City, they left an Altar-Stone in the custody of <hi>Nicho Chus,</hi> a Youth well inclined to Christianity; at their return they found it decently placed in a Room with Perfumes burning before it, and over it a Board with these Words, TIEN CHU, that is, <hi>To the Lord of Heaven.</hi> Here the Religious, for this strange Accident, said Mass, till their Church was made ready.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Fathers, to be the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, put on the <hi>Chinese</hi> Habit, and named God in their Prayers by that Title they had seen on the Board, which much pleased the Natives. Many of the Gentry and Learned Men began to Reverence the Images of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the blessed Virgin; they began to give ear to Matters of Faith, printed and dispersed among the People the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, highly approving of them, supplied the Church with Lights and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, and gave Alms to the Fathers.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The first baptized was a sick Man of mean condition. The Christian Doctrine was printed after their manner, and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through the whole Province with no small Reputation for the great Titles the Viceroy bestowed on the Authors of it.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. F. <hi>Rogerius</hi> now went to <hi>Macao,</hi> to seek some Relief to the great Poverty that place was in. Mean while the <hi>Chineses</hi> changing their humours, began to slander the Fathers, and often threw Stones at their House. F. <hi>Matthew Rivius</hi> was carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the Supream Court, he carried his Sleeves full of the Stones had been thrown at him, and letting them fall at the Judges Feet, so mollified him, that he caused the Accuser to be whipped, and ordered on severe Penalties no Wrong should be offered the Fathers. <hi>Rivius</hi> was skilled in the Mathematicks, and made Maps and Dials, all pleasing and new there, particularly seeing so many Countries in the World to them unknown, as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there was nothing beyond <hi>Asia.</hi> This Novelty attracted People from very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Parts to behold it, and proved a great Motive to incline them to receive the Faith.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. F. Rector <hi>Francis Cabrall,</hi> Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent of this Mission, came from <hi>Macao</hi> to visit this new Colony of the Church. He found more Fruit than was expected, and baptized the first Converts, among which a learned Man of the Province of <hi>Fokien,</hi> whom he called <hi>Paul,</hi> and another <hi>Iohn,</hi> which was he that with such Reverence kept the Altar-stone aforemention.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Visitor <hi>Valiniano,</hi> for joy of this Success, made this Mission Independent of <hi>Macao,</hi> subjecting it immediately to himself, and the Provincial of <hi>Iapan.</hi> D. <hi>Duarte de Meneses,</hi> then Viceroy, settled an Allowance out of the Custom-House of <hi>Malaca</hi> upon the Fathers.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. F. <hi>Almeyda</hi> and <hi>Rogerius,</hi> having obtained leave, went to erect another House in the Province of <hi>Chekiang,</hi> where they immediately baptized an ancient Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54711:575"/>
Father to the Governor of <hi>Xanquim,</hi> and soon after others. This was in the City <hi>Xanchin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. But this lasted not long, for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were soon expelled. Those of <hi>Xanking</hi> were in danger, but got off, and their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers were punished. These religious Men considering, this Prosperity could not be lasting without the King's Authority, sent F. <hi>Rogerius</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> to obtain a Letter and Present from the Pope for the King; but the Pope dying the Business was delayed, and F. <hi>Rogerius</hi> ended his days at <hi>Salerno,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> Mean while the Fathers at <hi>Xanking</hi> were not without Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but still protected by the Viceroy; converted many People, till a new Viceroy coming they were banished, and all they had taken from them.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. On their way to <hi>Macao</hi> they were overtaken by fresh Orders from the Viceroy; whereupon they returned to <hi>Xanking,</hi> and had a Place assigned them to settle at <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheu.</hi> Not far from that City is a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Plain along the side of a River, and in it a vast Temple and Monastery of 1000 Bonzos, called <hi>Manhoa,</hi> and yet the number of Idols exceeds that of the Bonzos, for only in one of 12 Apartments, into which it is divided, there were seen 500. These, as they call them, religious Men live there with their Wives and Children, and when they think fit, go out to rob. To this place were the Fathers led, that if they liked they might settle there, and were well received
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54711:576"/>
by the Bonzos, but the design of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious was to live in the City.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The Fathers were admitted into the City with the general good liking of all People. They soon suffered by the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Air, which infects the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives with a Disease like an Ague, yet esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the danger. From <hi>Macao</hi> two young <hi>Chinese</hi> Converts were sent to be their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who were afterwards the first of that Nation admitted into the Society.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. They laboured with no small Fruit, some Persons of Note being converted. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest, <hi>Cuytaiso,</hi> the Son of a great Man, having lost or spent his Fortune, came to F. <hi>Rivius,</hi> thinking he was a Chimist, and might teach him the way to make Gold, and being by him instructed, found the true Treasure of the Faith. The same happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an ancient Gentlemen of almost eighty Years of Age.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. A Persecution was now raised at <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheu,</hi> and the Governor examining into it, decreed to punish the Causers of it, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them at the Intercession of F. <hi>Rivius.</hi> In the Year 1591 was converted a Rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who long had consulted the Idols and their Ministers about the way to Salvation, and at length found it among the Jesuits. F. <hi>Rivius</hi> went with his Disciple <hi>Cuytaiso,</hi> and by his Perswasion to <hi>Nanking</hi> where he had innumerable Auditors, baptized six, left many many more in good Disposition. He had done much more here, but that he

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. ABout the middle of the Year 1595, F. <hi>Matthew Rivius</hi> set out for the City <hi>Nanking</hi> in Company of a Great Man. The Way was up great Rivers, in one of which the Vessels were sunk, and F. <hi>Rivius</hi> forced to swim for his Life, having lost his Companion <hi>Iohn Barradas.</hi> His Design was to settle a Residence in that Court, where he found many Opposers, and among them a powerful Man who had pretended much Friendship.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He went to <hi>Nancham,</hi> the Metropolis of the Province <hi>Kiangsi,</hi> between <hi>Nanking</hi> and <hi>Quantung.</hi> Being there in despair of any Success, he obtained a Lodging, where
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54711:577"/>
he said Mass on the Day of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and afterwards leave to fix a Residence, whither resorted F. <hi>Iohn Soeyro</hi> from <hi>Macao,</hi> and the Brothers <hi>Francis Martinez</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian Rodriguez</hi> from <hi>Hancheu;</hi> with much trouble they founded a Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Visitor <hi>Valiniano</hi> seeing how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient it was the Affairs of <hi>China</hi> should have any dependance abroad, granted F. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Rivius</hi> the full superintendence of them. He resolved again to attempt settling a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence at <hi>Nanking.</hi> From hence he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to send advice of his coming to that King, with a Present of Things very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in <hi>Europe,</hi> though there much esteemed for their Rarity. These were Clocks much admired of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> for that they move of themselves. Triangular Glasses, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present variety of Colours. A Harpsical. But what was more surprizing than all the rest, was the Learning of F. <hi>Rivius,</hi> his Art of Memory, his Maps of the World, his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Wit and Judgment.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There being no way to send the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, it was agreed the Fathers should carry it themselves, going in Company of a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that Travelled thither. In the way to <hi>Peking</hi> they saw many Cities and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Villages along the Banks of the Rivers up which they went. Being come to <hi>Peking,</hi> they spent a Month soliciting an Audience of the King, but without success.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Rivius</hi> with great trouble returned to <hi>Sucheu,</hi> being sent for by his Disciple <hi>Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayso.</hi> This is doubtless the most glorious
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54711:577"/>
City in those Parts. It is built in a River, as <hi>Venice</hi> in the Sea, and is of great strength to prevent all Accidents. The occasion of sending for F. <hi>Rivius,</hi> was to fix a Residence there. The Viceroy of <hi>Nanking</hi>'s leave was requisite for this undertaking: Both Master and Disciple take a Journey thither, and and the Viceroy grants leave to settle in both Places. Here F. <hi>Rivius</hi> disputed with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Bonzo, and overcame him even in the Judgment of his Adversaries.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Court of Publick Works propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Fathers to buy a House that had long stood empty because haunted by Devils, they did, and all the People was astonished to see that after their entrance the Fiends had forsaken it. They could not undertake any thing than at <hi>Sucheu</hi> for want of more Fathers.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Still F. <hi>Rivius</hi> his Thoughts were bent upon <hi>Peking,</hi> to obtain the King's consent to proceed. Whilst he prepared for this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the Faith considerably spread at <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi> The first Baptized was a discreet old Man 70 Years of Age, of a Noble Family, who had an hereditary Military Command, his Sirname was <hi>Chin,</hi> and he was Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Name of <hi>Paul.</hi> His Son, a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, followed the good Example, and was named <hi>Iohn,</hi> then all their Family, and some Kindred.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. On the 16th of <hi>May</hi> 1600, F. <hi>Rivius</hi> Embarqued the second time upon the River for <hi>Peking,</hi> with him went F. <hi>Iames Pantoja</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> called by a learned Man Golden
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54711:578"/>
Hands, for the delicate Works he wrought, and the two Brothers <hi>Sebastian</hi> and <hi>Emanuel.</hi> At <hi>Nanking</hi> remained F. <hi>Lazarus de Catania</hi> and B. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. Whilst they went up the River, the Viceroy of the Province of <hi>Xangsi</hi>'s Wife dream'd she saw a Sovereign Deity with two Children. She concluded her Dream was expounded, when her Husband relating the Things contained in the Present, for the King mentioned a Picture of our Blessed Lady, with our Saviour and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist. The Lady desiring such a Picture, and there being no Painter to Copy it, F. <hi>Rivius</hi> gave her a Copy he had. The Viceroy receiving it with respect, assured him he and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily would always Reverence the Mother and Son.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. At the City <hi>Linchin</hi> a covetous Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, who was Receiver-General of the Revenue, called <hi>Mathan,</hi> imprisoned them in the Fort of <hi>Tiensim,</hi> seizing upon the Present they carried for the King, and all they had. After six Months confinement, an Order came from the King (without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who had procured it) that the Fathers should be sent to him. All things were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored them, and they arrived at <hi>Peking</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of the Year 1601. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent was publickly carried to Court, and the King as soon as he saw the Picture of Christ admiring it, said; This is the living God. Yet afterwards caused it to be removed out of his sight. The same happened with his Mother; nevertheless it was set in a decent
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54711:578"/>
place, and honoured with Perfumes, and is said to be preserved in that Palace to this Day. A striking Clock was much admired; so several other things.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Afterwards they were sent for; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Eunuch spoke to them in the King's Name; they gave him an account who they were, whence they came, and what they desired. He acquainted the King with it, and they were lodged in the Palace, in the Apartment of the Mathematicians, and nobly entertained. There they instructed some Men appointed by the King in the Motion of the Clocks, and how to keep them, and then removed to a hired House. The King saw them not, because he scarce used to see his own People, but to have some sort of sight of them, sent Painters to draw their Pictures. Having seen the Pictures he took them for <hi>Moors. Pantoja</hi> was again introduced into the Palace, to teach some Musicians to play upon the Harpsical.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Thus far were our hopes advanced, when the Fathers were imprisoned by the Court of Ceremonies, for presuming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side there, without presenting themselves before their Tribunal. This confinement lasted but three days, because the King sent for them. Though he sent for them they saw him not, yet performed all the usual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Ceremonies to his Throne as if he had been there. The Supream President of that Court more particularly examined F. <hi>Rivius</hi> who he was, whence he came, and what he and his Companions pretended at
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54711:579"/>
Court; and he being the most expert in the <hi>Chinese</hi> Language, in most lofty terms answer'd to all those Particulars, to the great admiration of the President and all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The King being informed hereof, granted the Fathers leave to live at that Court, and all the Courtiers favoured them, especially the Ministers of State and Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins. F. <hi>Rivius</hi> so far gained the favour of a Calao, the Supream Dignity in that Empire, that he treated him as his equal (a thing never used in that great Place) seated him at his Table, and gave singular attention to all he said, particularly in Matters relating to Religion. One of the things that most pleased him was, that Christianity allowed not of more Wives than one. Thus <hi>Rivius</hi> contracted Friendship with the President of the Supream Council, and soon after most of the Principal Men.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Thus with Divine and Royal Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance the Faith was propagated at <hi>Peking, Hancheu, Nanking</hi> and <hi>Nancham.</hi> There were converted Mandarins, Lawyers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Persons of Note; some with their whole Families; and the Society of Jesus, after 20 Years labour, in the Year 1601 was posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of four Residences in <hi>China,</hi> one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at Court, which was to support all the rest.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. F. <hi>Nicholas Longobardo,</hi> a <hi>Sicilian,</hi> who was Rector at <hi>Hancheu,</hi> suffered very much, but some Men of Note, especially one <hi>Tauli,</hi> pleading for the Fathers, the Storm was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54711:579"/>
somewhat appeased. But it broke out more furious at the Instigation of a Witch, who, there being a great Dearth, said, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess <hi>Quonhin</hi> would not give Rain whilst the Fathers were there, and F. <hi>Nicholas</hi> was threatned with Death, who desirous to suffer Martyrdom, ran to the Place where they were threatning him. He finding those Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple disputing about the Rain, told them how vain it was to expect it from any but the God he preached; and immediately there fell such abundance as refreshed the Fields, and quenched their Thirst after his Blood; so that House for that time was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to its former quiet. Let this for the present suffice touching the Conversion of <hi>China,</hi> till we have occasion to speak of it again.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the Viceroy D. <hi>Francis de Gama,</hi> Count <hi>de Vidigueyra,</hi> from the Year 1597 till 1600.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>DON <hi>Francis de Gama</hi> Count <hi>de Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digueyra</hi> arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving set out from <hi>Lisbon</hi> the Year before with five Sail, whereof only his Ship Winter'd at <hi>Mombaçá.</hi> He carried himself from the beginning with such State, that he gained the general ill Will of all Men, notwithstanding in other things he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to oblige.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He disposed of all Places in the gift of the Viceroys to his own Creatures, who sold them to underserving Persons, whereby those
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54711:581"/>
who had merited them by their Service were put by their Right. Yet afterwards hearing the just Complaints made against this unjust Proceeding, he caused the Buyers to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded, and gave those Places to Men of more worth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Manasinza,</hi> the great <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, marched to subdue the <hi>Patanes</hi> who were in Rebellion, because <hi>Catula</hi> King of <hi>Orixa</hi> having plunder'd and profaned a famous Pagod, they unexpectedly fell upon him, and killed his Son with 2000 Men. <hi>Manafinza</hi> had with him 35000 Horse, 80000 Foot, many Elephants with Castles and great quantity of all other warlike En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines. At the City <hi>Iassalor</hi> all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, to the number 6000 fell furiously upon the Enemy, resolving to die, and ordering as soon as they were cut off, their Goods, Wives and Children should be burnt, that the Enemy might not possess their Riches or dishonour their Families. They did great Execution at the first onset, but were all cut to pieces, and there being no time to put in execution their design, <hi>Manasinza</hi> entred <hi>Iassalor</hi> plundering the Riches, and ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Women; which struck such a Terror into the rest of the <hi>Patanes</hi> they all submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves. Then marching towards the King of <hi>Orixa,</hi> and he not daring to stand a Battel freely offered Subjection.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In <hi>Ceylon,</hi> the Tyrant D. <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>Candea,</hi> taking the advantage of time when our General D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo</hi> had dispersed his Men to refresh them, caus'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54711:581"/>
the King of <hi>Uva</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Dina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaca</hi> to join, and take the Field with 4000 Men, many Musketeers, and armed Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. With this force they marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Fort of <hi>Corvite</hi> (six Leagues from <hi>Ceitavaca)</hi> where <hi>Salvador Pereyra de Silva</hi> commanded with 100 Men. <hi>Silva</hi> by the General's order chose some of his Men, and marched one Night with such a secrecy four Leagues to the Place where the Enemy was Encamped, that they sooner felt than heard him, killing many of their Men before they could handle their Arms. The Confusion was such they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> presently fled, he pursued them, slew above 1000, and carried away some Prisoners, Elephants and other Booty.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the Summer D. <hi>Iohn,</hi> takes the Field again with the King of <hi>Uva</hi> and <hi>Simon Correa,</hi> who being in Rebellion called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self King of <hi>Ceitavaca.</hi> He thought to draw our General D. <hi>Hierome</hi> out of his Works, by attacking our Quarters at <hi>Mature,</hi> where D. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Modeliar commanded. D. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> understanding the Enemy was near, thought to have performed such another fortunate piece of Service as <hi>Salvador Pereyra</hi> had done, but his Companion <hi>Simon Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham</hi> prevented him, and after a desperate Fight, in which he was almost lost, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Victory equal to that of <hi>Pereyra,</hi> and falling upon the Rebels in their Works killed most of them, so that the Flower of <hi>Candea</hi> fell this Day.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. At the end of <hi>May</hi> died at <hi>Columbo</hi> the lawful King of the whole Island of <hi>Ceylon,</hi>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:54711:582"/>
D. <hi>Iohn Parea Pandar,</hi> a Catholick and without Heirs. King <hi>Philip</hi> was with the usual Solemnity immediately Proclaimed King of the whole Island, and the Oath of Fidelity to him taken by all the Principal Men, as being appointed Heir by the last Will of the Deceased.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. About this time came first into <hi>India</hi> the Scourge of the <hi>Portugues</hi> Pride and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness; for in the Month of <hi>September</hi> News was brought to <hi>Goa,</hi> that the two first <hi>Holland</hi> Ships which durst cut those Seas, had been in the Port of <hi>Titangone,</hi> and were bound for the Island <hi>Sunda.</hi> The Viceroy having held a Council about this Affair, it was resolved to fit out a Squadron of two Galleons, three Gallies, and nine other Vessels, and the Command of it was given to <hi>Laurence de Brito,</hi> an ancient and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Captain deserving of greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Three Ships arrived now from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi> That which had brought the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy was ready at <hi>Cochim</hi> to return thither with them, and accidentally taking fire was burnt with all the Riches in her, amounting to a Million and half.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Not only Custom but Necessity now required the sending out the two usual Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons for the Coast of <hi>Malabar</hi> and the North; the design of the Northern Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron shall follow; that of <hi>Malabar</hi> was to give a Check to <hi>Zamori,</hi> who not only wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at but went shares with the Pyrates of the Fort <hi>Cunnale.</hi> Among other Losses that of

Two Ships returned to <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> erected a Factory, and loading Spice, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in <hi>Holland</hi> on the 20th of <hi>April,</hi> 1600.

                     <p n="5">5. D. <hi>Alexius de Meneses</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Goa</hi> was gone to visit the Christians, called of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who live dispersed about the Mountains of <hi>Malabar</hi> in <hi>Malia, Turubuli, Maota, Batimena, Diamper, Pimienta, Tete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute, Porca, Paru,</hi> and <hi>Cartuti.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Those Christians continued firm in the Faith till about the Year 750, though with some mixture of Errors. About the Year 810, came thither the second <hi>Thomas,</hi> (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at the end of the second <hi>Tome,)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the Temples erected by the first, and restored the Doctrine. Thus it continued almost 100 Years, till about the Year 900 it was over-run with the <hi>Nestorian</hi> Heresie.

Thus the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Seat was divided into two, the one Orthodox at <hi>Mussal,</hi> the Heretical at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.

                     <p n="9">9. This Prelate found, that amidst their other Errors they denied the Virginity of our Blessed Lady, rejected the Use of Images, believed the Souls of the Just enjoyed not God till the General Judgment; allowed but three Sacraments, Baptism, Order, and the Eucharist; used, in stead of Confession, a Perfuming in the Churches; that their Consecration Wine was of Cocos; that their Host was a Cake with Oyl and Salt; that Priests were Ordained at 17 Years of Age, and Married after Ordination; that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Sons, and Grandsons, administred Sacraments in the same Church; that their Wives (called <hi>Catotiaras,</hi> or <hi>Cassaueras,</hi> that is, Priests Wives,) wore a particular Mark to be known by; that in Matrimony they used no other Formalities but the consent of Parties, and the uniting the Couple by getting a Child; that Women observed the time of the Old Law to be Churched; that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54711:590"/>
no Sacraments were administred <hi>gratis;</hi> that Holy Water was made with Dust of Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incense, and some of the Earth where they believed St. <hi>Thomas</hi> had trod; that they used Sorcery and Witchcraft; and in fine, that all was Error and Confusion.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. D. F. <hi>Alexius</hi> with great Labour and Toil convinced them of their Errors, and reduced them to receive the true Doctrine. Whole Towns were baptized, and submited to the <hi>Roman</hi> See.</p>

13. Towards the End of this Year arriv'd in <hi>India</hi> eight Ships from <hi>Portugal,</hi> which brought the News of the Death of King <hi>Philip;</hi> five of them being ready to Sail the Year before, were detained because the Earl of <hi>Cumberland</hi> lay before the Mouth of <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> River with an <hi>English</hi> Squadron, till the Season was spent. One was lost on the <hi>Parcell de Zofala;</hi> another at her return fought two <hi>Holland</hi> Ships near the Island St. <hi>Helena</hi> and worsted them.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Viceroy having dispatched the Homeward bound Ships and usual Squadrons, began to think of carrying on the War against <hi>Cunnale.</hi> There were Men enough, but they wanted a Commander; neither was such a one wanting, but that the Envy of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> endeavoured to rob <hi>Andrew Furtado</hi> of that Glory, or rather their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of that Advantage.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. At length they were forced to comply and employ him to recover our lost Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for <hi>Cunnale Marcar</hi> proud of his late Success, had added to his former as vain Titles, calling himself, <hi>Defender of Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanism, and Expeller of the</hi> Portugueses. Many Princes began to have an Eye upon his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; nevertheless D. <hi>Antony de Noronna,</hi> who lay before the Port all Winter, had perplexed him, taking several Vessels laden with Provisions, and killing above 100 of his Men that opposed him taking fresh Water.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Fleet <hi>Andrew Furtado</hi> was to Command, consisted of 3 Gallies and 54
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54711:591"/>
other Vessels. By the way he diswaded the King of <hi>Banguel</hi> and Queen of <hi>Olala,</hi> who designed to assist our Enemy, from their Purpose, and cut off the Relief five Ships of <hi>Meca</hi> were bringing to him.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Our Commander being come to an Anchor in the Port of <hi>Cunnale,</hi> set forward to treat with <hi>Zamori,</hi> and he advanced to meet him on the Shore. The King was naked from the Wast upwards; about his middle a piece of Cloath of Gold that reached several times about him, and hung down to his Knees, fastned with a Girdle of the breadth of a Hand, of an inestimable value; his Arms cover'd to the Wrists with Gold Bracelets set with rich Stones, the weight of this Treasure was so great that two Men supported his Arms; about his Neck was an extraordinary rich Chain; in his Ears hung so many Diamonds and Rubies, as stretched them down with the weight; his Age was about 30 Years, his Presence very Majestick. A little from his side came the Prince with his Sword naked held up, behind him the Nobility, and somewhat nearer F. <hi>Francis Rodriguez.</hi> The King and <hi>Furtado</hi> embraced kindly, and all the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Fleet was fired. Being come to the King's Tent, they were seated, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed about the Affair in hand. <hi>Furtado</hi> at taking his leave, put a rich Collar about the King's Neck over the other, and they parted very amicably.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Zamori</hi> sent the Prince of <hi>Tanor</hi> and other great Men aboard the Admiral with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54711:591"/>
full power to treat and conclude all things that were for the common Interest of both Parties. This done there arrived from <hi>Goa</hi> and other Places one Galleon, one Galley, eleven Ships and twenty-one other Vessels, with Ammunition, and 790 Men. <hi>Furtado</hi> went himself to view the Enemies Works, raised others, Planted his Cannon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came absolute Master of the River. He caused some Outworks to be attacked, the <hi>Moors</hi> fled, but <hi>Cunnale</hi> coming in Person to second them, they made our Men give ground till <hi>Furtado</hi> landing came up with Sword in hand and renewed the Fight, here he was in great danger, but at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Victorious, killing 600 <hi>Moors.</hi> On our side were slain two Captains and nine Soldiers.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Fort <hi>Blanco,</hi> or the White Fort, was next assaulted with greater Bravery than Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. Here Captain <hi>Andrew Rodriguez Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lota</hi> loosing nine Teeth by a Musket Shot, jesting said, <hi>Doubtless the Moor knew I had no need of them:</hi> Which he said in respect he was always so poor he wanted sustenance. <hi>Cunnale</hi> being in distress, bribed <hi>Zamori</hi> with great Presents to accept the Surrender upon Security of the Mens Lives. <hi>Zamori</hi> was yielding, and <hi>Furtado</hi> understanding it furiously assaults the Works; the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, falls on on the other side with 6000 <hi>Nayres.</hi> The Works were entred, and the lower Town plundred and burnt. Batteries were raised against the upper Town
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54711:592"/>
and Fort, and doing great Execution redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Defendants to despair.</p>
                     <p n="20">20 In fine, <hi>Cunnale</hi> Surrendred upon no Condition but Life, and marched out with a black Veil on his Head, carrying his Sword with the point down, which he delivered to <hi>Zamori,</hi> and he to our General. <hi>Cunnale</hi> was about 50 Years of Age, of a low Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but well shaped and strong. He and his Nephew <hi>Cinale</hi> and 40 <hi>Moors</hi> of Note, were sent Prisoners aboard the Fleet and well treated. <hi>Furtado</hi> dealt generously with <hi>Zamori,</hi> for it being one of the Articles of Agreement, that the spoil should be equally divided, he said it was to be understood only in relation to Artillery, and appeased the Soldiers, who expected that Reward of their Labour. The Fort and all other Works being levelled with the Ground, <hi>Furtado</hi> returned to <hi>Goa.</hi>

How can they who are guilty of such Inhumanities call the much more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Indians</hi> Barbarians. <hi>Cunnale</hi> and his Nephew <hi>Cinale</hi> were both publickly behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without any regard that they had arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled for Life. So did that Government and Rabble go hand in hand in Murder and breach of Faith.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The remarkable Revolutions of <hi>Pegu,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Government of D. <hi>Francis de Gama,</hi> Count <hi>de Vidigueyra.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Kingdom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> before not very considerable, was raised to be one of the greatest Empires in <hi>Asia,</hi> by the King of <hi>Uva</hi> and <hi>Brama,</hi> assisted by 1000 <hi>Portugueses</hi> under the Command of <hi>Antony Ferreyra de Braganca,</hi> who served him as his natural Prince. The Kingdom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> properly so called, borders on that of <hi>Arracam,</hi> the Countries of the <hi>Brama's</hi> and <hi>Iungoma's;</hi> on the West is bounded by they Sea of <hi>Bengala,</hi> from the City <hi>Rei</hi> to that of <hi>Sidoa,</hi> distant 90 Leagues from each other; the breadth of the Kingdom is about the same, and its true Name is <hi>Bagou.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is about 1000 Years since this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was first erected by a Seaman, who was the first King; then his Son, who lived 80 Years; next the Grandson, called <hi>Tam;</hi> these and all their Successors added to their Name the Title of <hi>Banna, Caél Uca, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanna, Inda, Darar, Mampla. Ximindo,</hi> the last, who died the Year 1640 (as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related) when <hi>Branginoco</hi> so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged it by his Conquests, that it extended to <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Tartary,</hi> and was Sovereign of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54711:593"/>
Twenty-four great Kingdoms, beside Eighty Princes not inferior to Kings. Thus it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the powerfullest Monarchy in <hi>Asia,</hi> except that of <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. This King for the Conquest of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavam,</hi> thirty Leagues distant from <hi>Pegu,</hi> gathered 700000, Men and 1700 Ships. The Siege lasted six Months, in which died 160000 Men. The City being taken and the King killed, 140000 Houses were burnt, besides 1600 Temples, in which were taken 60000 Idols, most of Gold and precious Stones; there were also taken 3000 Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, 6000 Cannon, and innumerable Prisoners. The King's share of the Spoil was above 100 Millions of Gold.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For the Conquest of <hi>Siam</hi> he led a greater Force, possessed himself of the Kingdom, and took the King and his two Sons, called, by reason of their different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, one the Black, the other the White. He was content to leave that King in Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Crown as his Vassal, having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self been till then his Subject, carrying away his two Sons as Hostages.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Branginoco</hi> returning Victorious to <hi>Pegu,</hi> entred the City in Triumph, many Waggons going before loaded with Idols and inestimable Booty. He came at last in a Chariot with the conquered Queens loaden with Jewels at his Feet, and drawn by the Captive Princes and Lords; before him marched Two thousand Elephants rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adorned, and after him his victorious
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54711:593"/>
Troops. He built a Palace as big as an ordinary City. The least part of its Beauty was rich Painting and Gilding; for the Roofs of some Apartments were covered with Plates of solid Gold. Some Rooms were set with Statues of Kings and Queens of massy Gold, set with rich Stones as big as the Life. He was carried on a Litter of Gold upon many Mens Shoulders, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence paid him was more like a God than a Prince.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. After some time the two Brothers ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leave of the King to go visit their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he granted, and afterwards sending to demand the usual Tribute, the black Prince refused to pay it. The King in a Rage sends his great Favourite <hi>Banna</hi> with a powerful Army against him. <hi>Banna</hi> ravaged the Country of <hi>Siam,</hi> and Besieges the Prince in <hi>Hudixa,</hi> who defended it so bravely, that <hi>Banna</hi> being forced to draw off, he fell upon and totally defeated him. The King sends his Brother-in-Law with a greater Power, and he receives a greater overthrow, 200000 of his Men were cut in pieces, with a great number of Elephants and Horses, many more of both taken. The black Prince remained Victorious, his Men were enriched, and all encouraged to follow their good Fortune.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The King of <hi>Pegu</hi> raises another Army of 1700000 Men, 1500 Elephants, 80000 Horse and all Necessaries proportionable; the Command of it he gave to <hi>Mapa Raja</hi> his Son, with the Title of King of <hi>Siam,</hi>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:54711:594"/>
not doubting of the Victory. At the News of this Power all <hi>Siam</hi> trembled, except the valiant Black, now King, who met his Enemy, and gave him Battel. The two Kings encountring on their Elephants fought, and he of <hi>Pegu</hi> was cast dead off his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, at which sight his Men fled, and the <hi>Siamites</hi> pursued them a Month, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the greatest part of that vast Army.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The King of <hi>Pegu</hi> in a Rage for the Death of his Son, turned his Fury against the People, and some days burnt above Ten Thousand, throwing so many into thè River <hi>Ganga,</hi> as stopped the Passage even of Boats. He forbid them sowing, which caused such a a Famine, that they not only eat one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to which purpose there was a publick Butchery of Man's Flesh, but devoured part of their own Bodies. For want of Fuel they made fire of human Bones, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first taken off the Flesh to eat. It is wonderful all this Tyranny never obliged that People to rebel. A good Example given by Heathens, to those more barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Christians, who dare fly in the Face of just Princes, without the least shadow of Oppression.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. This was followed by a Pestilence that depopulated all the Kingdom. The neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes taking this advantage, fell upon the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> covetous of his Treasures. Among them was the Black of <hi>Siam,</hi> who retired with the loss 100000 Men. The King of <hi>Tangu</hi> was he that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed himself of all, he promised Life, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

After them followed a Bastard Son of the King, whose Head was cut off by Order of the King of <hi>Pegu</hi>'s Sister, Wife to him of <hi>Tangu,</hi> saying, That he who was false to his Father could not be true to her.

He in despair delivers himself up to the King of <hi>Tangu,</hi> who being possessed of the City and Palace found such Treasure, that he made no account of Silver, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Metals and Riches. It is avouched for truth, that he could not remove all the Jewels and Gold in twelve Caravans, each consisting of Seven hundred Elephants and Horses. The News of this Treasure drew thither the King of <hi>Arracam,</hi> who content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself with what he of <hi>Tangu</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, gathered above Three Millions, and a great Train of large Cannon. The King of <hi>Tangu</hi> presented him of <hi>Pegu</hi> to his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; and she who (having killed his Son for betraying him) it was thought would comfort, used him Reproachfully, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards seeing the King her Husband inclined to Mercy, caused him to be beaten to Death.</p>

The Statue of the Great D. <hi>Vasco de Gama,</hi> Grandfather to the Count, of a large Proportion cut in Marble, stood over the principal Gate of the City, fastned to the Wall by a strong Iron Bar. The <hi>French</hi> Ingenier <hi>Sebastian Tibao,</hi> at the Instigation of those Gentlemen, the Count's Enemies, in the Night applied to the Iron that Herb that has the quality of eating it, by which means the next Night it was pulled down, broke, and the Quarters hung up in publick Places.</p>

The Day the Count was to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque, Forty Men well armed got aboard before him, and hanged up at the Yard Arm his Effigies made exactly like him in Face and Habit. He was going aboard as they returned, and seeing that sight asked what it was; they answered, <hi>It is your Lordship, and those are the Men that did it.</hi> He only replied, <hi>No more, no more</hi> India. He caused the Statute to be dropt into the Sea, set sail, and within two Days came again into the Port, to take in Fowl for the Voyage, because all he had before were poisoned. This is a common Practice in <hi>India,</hi> especially among the great Ones.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. But as was said, the Elements loved the Count better than the Men, for he was the first that ever came from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Lisbon</hi> without furling Sail.

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. AS soon as <hi>Ayres de Saldanna</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon him the Government, he dispatched the homeward bound Ships, which were six, under the command of D. <hi>Hierome Continno.</hi> That called the <hi>St. Simon,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Iames de Sousa</hi> of <hi>Viana,</hi> came first to the Island St. <hi>Helena,</hi> where there were two great <hi>Holland</hi> Ships, with each two tire of Guns. <q>They presently sent aboard our Ship to tell the Captain, He must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly yield, and go aboard them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he would soon be sent to the other World.</q> 
                        <hi>Sousa</hi> considering that Message required a loud Answer, sent it from the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54711:596"/>
mouth of a Cannon, and they understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, replied with 8; the Terror whereof made our Men drop from the Yards who were furling the Sails, but they soon recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Enemies Cannon playing, killed at first two of our Men, and tore the Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and Masts; at which our People were so frighted, they sought to abandon the Ship. <hi>Sousa</hi> with much Valour encouraged them, and began to play his Guns with good success. The Fight lasted without ceasing that afternoon, all night, and the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wherein the <hi>Hollanders</hi> receiving great Damage, made away, leaving ashore the Cask they had sent for Water. Our 5 Ships came up afterwards, and continued their Voyage together.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Viceroy found at <hi>Cochim</hi> great Complaints against the King of <hi>Iafanapatan,</hi> for that, contrary to the Treaty of Peace, he gave Passage to the King of <hi>Candea</hi> through his Country. The Commander of <hi>Manar, Manuel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="4">4. This Year 4 Ships set out of <hi>Lisbon</hi> for <hi>India,</hi> and were all drove back. Five Galleons also sailed, and two of them were
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54711:597"/>
forced in again, one lost on the Coast of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotora.</hi> Another returning next Year from <hi>India</hi> richly laden, met at the Island St. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len 3 Holland</hi> Ships of 30 Guns each, ours had but 27 small ones, yet could not avoid fighting.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Fight lasted some days, till the Galleon was beaten to pieces, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my got nothing by the Victory. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and most of the Men were taken, and basely treated by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who put them ashore in the Island of <hi>Ferdinand de Noronna,</hi> whence they passed to <hi>Pernambuco,</hi> and were there nobly entertained by <hi>Iames Botello,</hi> provided with all Necessaries, and sent home.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Ships that were forced back the last Year, and two more, arrived in <hi>India,</hi> and brought the News, That on the 24th of <hi>November,</hi> 1602. there appeared over <hi>Italaca</hi> a Blue Cross, seeming to the Eye about four Fathoms in length, and two in breadth, of a curious form, with Green Boughs over it. It continued two hours about day-break, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time it was seen by above forty Christians of <hi>Suneputat,</hi> who were going to Mass to their Parish of St. <hi>Lazarus.</hi> The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Year 5 Ships went from <hi>Portugal.</hi> We have no farther account of the Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of these Years, and therefore must be content with what follows, which happened about that time.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Andrew Furtado</hi> went over to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luco</hi> Islands, in hope to recover them. He drove the <hi>Hollanders</hi> out of <hi>Amboina</hi> and

                        <hi>Sunda,</hi> restored the <hi>Rosatelos</hi> to our subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, gained many strong Places from those of <hi>Ito, Nao,</hi> and <hi>Veranula,</hi> and then appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before <hi>Ternate;</hi> from which by bad Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and other Accidents, he was drove, after having spent 5 Years in continual la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Let us leave him at <hi>Amboina</hi> while we treat of the Conquest of <hi>Pegu,</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about the same time.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Xilimixa</hi> King of <hi>Arracam,</hi> who had possessed himself of the Crown of <hi>Pegu,</hi> to express his Gratitude to the <hi>Portugueses</hi> that served him, gave them the Port of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> at the mouth of the River of the same Name, that runs within a League of <hi>Bagou,</hi> the Court of the Kings of <hi>Pegu.</hi> This Grant was obtained of the King for the <hi>Portugueses</hi> by <hi>Philip de Brito &amp; Nicote,</hi> who most ingratefully proved false to that Prince, that had raised him from a vile Collier to his Favour and Esteem. The manner was thus:</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Xilimixa</hi> confiding in <hi>Nicote,</hi> was by him perswaded to erect a Custom-house at the mouth of that River for the encrease of his Revenue, and his design was to seize upon it, and build a Fort there to give footing to the <hi>Portugueses</hi> for the Conquest of that Kingdom. The King, who suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted not the Design, having finished the Work, put it into the Hands of one <hi>Banna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dala,</hi> who fortified himself, and suffered no <hi>Portugues</hi> to enter there, except F. <hi>Belchior de la Luz</hi> a Dominican. <hi>Nicote</hi> seeing that Design fail, resolved to carry it on by other
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54711:598"/>
means before the Works were too far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. He had with him three <hi>Portugues</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, <hi>viz. Iohn de Oliva, Paul del Rego,</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vador Ribeyro,</hi> with 50 Men; these he order'd to surprise the Fort, and turn out <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadala,</hi> not doubting but his great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with <hi>Xilimixa</hi> would bear him out in it.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The three Captains so well performed <hi>Nicote</hi>'s Orders, that they gained the Name of <hi>Founders of the</hi> Portugues <hi>Dominion in that Kingdom;</hi> and <hi>Ribeyro</hi> was like to carry the whole Fame of this Action, some affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was the real Author of it.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Bannadala,</hi> who foresaw the Designs of the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> contrived to expel them thence at the same time that <hi>Riberio</hi> thought to surprise him. <hi>Banadala</hi> provided many flaming Carts guarded by 600 Men, which advancing by night took such effect, that the <hi>Portugueses</hi> were obliged to quit their Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but flying thence, attacked <hi>Bannadala</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ort with such fury, that having left many Men, he was glad to retire to an Island not far distant, where he fortified himself, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering 1000 Men, and securing the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Pagod of <hi>Digan</hi> to maintain them. The King being informed hereof was much offended, and resolved to relieve <hi>Banadala,</hi> but was dissuaded by the false <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote,</hi> who put him in mind he favoured a Sacrilegious Robber, and offered to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Matters with the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> He went thither, and ordered Things to his own

mind, so that the Work still advanced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Portugueses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Nicote</hi> seeing the Fort in a good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, went to <hi>Coa</hi> in order to deliver it up to the Viceroy, and thence facilitate the Conquest of his Master's Kingdom; perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him at the same time, his Journey was to bring Succours wherewith he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Emperour of all <hi>Bengala.</hi> He perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded every one of the Neighbouring Princes. If he would joyn with the Viceroy, he might easily be King of <hi>Pegu.</hi> Some of them sent Embassadors to this effect along with him. Scarce was <hi>Nicote</hi> gone when the King, being sensible of his oversight, sent down the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Fleet with 6000 Men under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Banadala.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. Coming down towards the Fort, they were met by 3 Vessels with only 30 <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> commanded by <hi>Salvador Ribeyro,</hi> who in a little time, without losing one Man, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many, took 40 Ships, and put the rest to flight. The King joyning him of <hi>Pram,</hi> beset the place with 1200 Sail by Water, and 40000 Men by Land. <hi>Ribeyro</hi> understanding they observed no Order, boldly fell upon them with his handful of Men, and killing the General, put that whole Army to the rout.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Bannadala</hi> gathering 8000 Foot of this scattered Army, sate down the third time before the Fort, lodging his Men in good order, and furiously battering the Place, till in the dead of night he ventured to give a fierce Assault. Our Men bravely
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54711:599"/>
opposing, killed above 1000, which were seen the next morning to fill up the Ditch.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Enemy continued the Siege eight months. Some of our Men deserted, yet <hi>Ribeyro</hi> was no way dismayed, but encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged those that had stayed with him, and to take from them all hope of Escape, burnt the Vessels that were in the Port. The Viceroy <hi>Ayres de Saldanna</hi> hearing of these Proceedings, sent considerable Succours, and many, covetous of Honour or Profit, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily resorted thither; so that the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der finding himself 800 strong, resolved to attack the Enemy in his Works. He put this Design in execution with much Conduct and Bravery, and was received with no less, till at length <hi>Banadala</hi> was forced to fly 3 Leagues without looking back, and then stood to see all the Works he had raised in a Year burnt. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> thinking this Success had secured their Affairs in <hi>Pegu,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed every Man to make his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, so that there remained with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains only 200 that had been sent by the Viceroy.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The Enemy returns the fourth time with many moving Castles, and several sorts of Fireworks. The Fort was reduced to a dangerous condition, when a fiery Meteor so frighted the Besiegers, that they fled, leaving their Castles behind, which were soon fired by our Men. Lastly, the Victory we obtained over King <hi>Massinga</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Camelan,</hi> killing him, and doing great harm both by Sea and Land, produced
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54711:599"/>
the Security we so much sought after. For those People finding us not only Victorious, but Courteous, followed us so, that in few days we had above 20000 of them. These Men considering the Success of <hi>Philip de Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to &amp; Nicote,</hi> and his natural good Temper, (which occasioned their calling him <hi>Changa,</hi> that is, Good Man,) proclaimed him King of <hi>Pegu. Salvador Ribeyro</hi> accepted of the Crown in his Name, he being then absent, and this, perhaps, might be the cause it was thought in <hi>Spain,</hi> it was he that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Nicote</hi> afterwards received the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Name of his Prince as a Loyal Subject, and was the first of our Men that rose to that pitch of Fortune in <hi>Asia. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Alvarez de Sequeyra</hi> succeeded him in the Command of the Fort, who bravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it till it accidentally took fire, and only the bare Walls of it were left stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Mean while <hi>Nicote</hi> sollicited for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to carry thither, which were not hard to be obtained; for the Viceroy seeing his great Riches, and the prospect he had of more, married him to a Niece he had born in <hi>Goa</hi> of a <hi>Iava-</hi>Woman, and for her sake could deny him nothing. He gave him the Title of <hi>Commander</hi> of <hi>Siriam,</hi> and <hi>General</hi> of the Conquest of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and Succours in 6 Ships. Being come to <hi>Siriam</hi> he repaired the Fort, built a Church, and sent a rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the King of <hi>Arracam,</hi> who had sent to compliment him upon his arrival.</p>

20. He ordered the Affairs of the Custom-house according to the Viceroy's Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, obliging all Vessels that traded on the Coast of <hi>Pegu</hi> to make their Entries there. Some of the Coast of <hi>Coromandel</hi> refused to obey; against them he sent D. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de Moura</hi> with 6 Sail, who discharged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self well, and took on the Coast of <hi>Tanaza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> 2 Ships of <hi>Achem</hi> richly laden. The King of <hi>Arracam,</hi> to the intent to possess himself of that Custom-house, resolved to joyn with the King of <hi>Tangu,</hi> and sent an Embassador to him with 20 <hi>Ialias,</hi> or small Ships. <hi>Nicote</hi> understanding it, caused <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew Ferreyra,</hi> Captain of our small Craft, to fall upon them, who put them to flight, so that they were sorced to make their escape to the King of <hi>Iangona</hi>'s Country. The Enemy thus exasperated, gathered 700 small Vessels with 4000 Men under the command of the Prince his Son, with whom were <hi>Ximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colia,</hi> and <hi>Marquetam,</hi> Sons to the then Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Pegu.</hi>

The Prince thinking to save himself by running up a River, got into a small Creek, where <hi>Pinnero</hi> took all the rest of his Vessels, obliging him to escape by Land, having

The <hi>Pegues</hi> seeing their Prince carried away to Captivity, would all have gone with him, striving to get into our Vessels. Such as could not, remained on the Shore, cursing their hard Fortune, that would not permit them to follow him a Prisoner, as they had done in Liberty. Christians may here learn the Duty they owe to their Princes.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. <hi>Nicote</hi> may also be a President to all Men; how to use their Victories; for he not forgetting he had been a Slave to the Prince now his Prisoner, served him with the same respect now, as he had done then. He watched him sleeping, holding his Buskins in his Hands with Arms across, a Ceremony used by the meanest with their Kings in those Parts, and himself attended him upon all Occasions. This generosity may well
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54711:601"/>
equal him with great Men, and purchased him together with other the like Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Name of <hi>Changa,</hi> which, as was before said, signifies <hi>Good Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. But now ends the Government of <hi>Ayres de Saldanna,</hi> by the arrival at <hi>Goa</hi> of <hi>Martin Alfonso de Castro,</hi> who came to succeed him with the same Title of Viceroy. He set out from <hi>Lisbon</hi> with five Ships, whereof one was forced in again. About the end of the same Year there sailed thence two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravels.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. <hi>Ayres de Saldanna</hi> seems to have had more natural Goodness than Inclination to War; for in his time nothing of this sort was set on Foot. He was one of those few Viceroys and Governors who are believed not to have wronged the King. On his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>return home he died in the Latitude of the Islands, and the Ship that brought him was lost at the mouth of <hi>Lisbon</hi> River. He was tall and somewhat corpulent, of a tawny Complexion; of Viceroys the 18th, of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors the 36th, and First of the Name and Sirname.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. I have purposely reserved for the end of this Government the Discovery of <hi>Grand Cathay,</hi> for which we are beholding to F. <hi>Nicholas Pimenta,</hi> Visitor-General of the Jesuits in <hi>Asia.</hi> He chose for this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy B. <hi>Benedict Goes,</hi> a Man well versed in several Languages, and particularly the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> which was the most important for that Design. B. <hi>Goes</hi> cloathed himself in the Habit of an <hi>Armenian</hi> Christian Merchant,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54711:601"/>
and after their manner took the Name of <hi>Abdula Isai,</hi> which signifies, <hi>Christian Lord.</hi> He set out from the Mogol's Court with that Prince's Favour and Merchandize. In his Company went two <hi>Greeks</hi> well skilled in the manner of Travelling, and were <hi>Leo Grimanus</hi> a Priest, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant. These had four Mahometan Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (who were afterwards Christians) which they left at <hi>Laor</hi> (one of the Mogol's Courts) as useless, and took in their stead <hi>Isaac</hi> an <hi>Armenian,</hi> who had a Wife and Children there, and was there faithful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. From <hi>Laor</hi> they set out on the 6th of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1603.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. With great Labour and Hardships they passed through the Cities <hi>Abec, Passaur, Caferstan, Guideli</hi> and <hi>Cabuo.</hi> Here they were forced to stay 8 Months, and meeting a Sister of <hi>Hamet Can</hi> King of <hi>Cascar,</hi> that was going a Pilgrimage to <hi>Meca,</hi> and was taking up Money at Interest. B. <hi>Benedict</hi> considering it would oblige that Princess and her Brother, through whose Dominions he was to pass, lent her 600 Ducats without Interest, which afterwards stood him in good stead. The Priest <hi>Grimanus</hi> spent with Labour, turned back from <hi>Cabul.</hi> The Caravan set forward, and passed the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Mogol's, in sight of the Cities <hi>Characar</hi> and <hi>Parvam.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Government of the Viceroy D. <hi>Martin Alfonso de Castro,</hi> from the Year 1604 till 1607.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. DON <hi>Martin Alfonso de Castro</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon the Government, gave some signs of being ambitious of Glory, but Fortune was not favourable to him, or, as some say, his own Humour was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment. Therefore let us proceed with the Affairs of the Conquest of <hi>Pegu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Ximilica</hi> King of <hi>Arracam</hi> considering his Son was Prisoner, thought good to treat with <hi>Nicote,</hi> and he, to come to an agreement the better to make his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Profits of the Custom-House, sent Advice of all to <hi>Goa,</hi> and received Orders thence to return the Prince without any Ransom. But Interest being his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est aim, neither Obedience to the Viceroy, nor the Respect he owed that King, whose Creature he was, could prevail to hinder him from selling that Prince for 50000 Crowns, pretending it was for the Charge of the Fleet the King had obliged him to fit out.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The King of <hi>Arracam</hi> justly offended hereat, set out a small Fleet against <hi>Siriam,</hi> which was easily defeated, but gave him oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54711:603"/>
to enslave 100000 Christians, and treat them with great rigour; which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless moved not many of them, though but new Converts. Afterwards he combines with the King of <hi>Tangu,</hi> who Besieges the Town with a great Army by Land, while he shuts it up by Sea with 800 Sail, in which he had 10000 Men. <hi>Paul del Rego,</hi> met him with 80 Ships, and failing of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess he had formerly, setting Fire to the Powder, blew up himself and all that were with him, rather than fall into the Hands of the Enemy. The Siege continued so long, till the besieged were ready to surrender, when on a sudden upon some suspicion the King of <hi>Tangu</hi> quits the Field by night, and he of <hi>Arracam</hi> found it to no purpose to lie longer upon the Sea.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Some of the neighbouring Princes startled at this success of <hi>Nicote</hi> sought his Friendship, and an Alliance with the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The first that effected it was the King of <hi>Tangu. Nicote</hi> marries his Son <hi>Simon</hi> to a Daughter of the King of <hi>Martavam,</hi> thereby to strengthen himself, and have the opportunity of gathering more Riches. And being now desirous to rob the King of <hi>Tangu,</hi> tho actually then in Peace with him, to colour his wicked Design he pretends that King was overcome by him of <hi>Ova,</hi> (as indeed he was and made Tributary) since the Treaty, as if that could absolve him for breach of Faith. In fine, with the King of <hi>Martavam</hi>'s assistance, he fell upon, took, and robbed him of <hi>Tangu,</hi> and returned with him and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54711:604"/>
above a Million of Gold, without hearkning to the Protestations he made of his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a faithful Vassal to the Crown of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Let us keep in mind these his unjust Proceedings, and in its place we shall see them rewarded as they deserve; for all these Particulars happened not at this time, but it is anticipated, to prevent too much dismembring the Relation of them. Indeed it is to be admired, a Christian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should support such Unchristian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It will be fit to return to the Affairs of the <hi>Moluco</hi> Islands. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> were now strong in those Seas, and well backed by the Islanders, who tired out with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable Avarice, joined with those Rebels to expel us.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> about this time having forced us thence, had possessed themselves of <hi>Amboina. Gaspar de Melo</hi> commanded there, whom absolute Necessity obliged to quit it, yet being unjustly accused and in danger of suffering with Disgrace, his Wife poisoned him. A strange Government, where notorious Criminals were not punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and an innocent Person was so Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, that she who loved him took away his Life, least they should take away his Honour, who had none of their own. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> who were at <hi>Tidore</hi> since the loosing of <hi>Ternate,</hi> seeing the King did not deliver them up to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, and had nine Ships in the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54711:604"/>
Harbour, but that he was resolved to stand by them, took such Courage, that they withstood the continual Batteries of 120 Cannons, which played on them without intermission.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The King of <hi>Ternate</hi> sends a Fleet to assist the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and Landing batters the Fort on the other side. All we had to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this Power, was 10 or 12 pieces of Cannon, and but a small number of Men able to bear Arms. After four days Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery the Enemy gives the Assault, our Men encouraged by their Captain <hi>Peter Alvarez de Abreu,</hi> with Sword in Hand bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse them. In the midst of their hopes that this defeat would oblige the Enemy to desist, the Powder by some accident taking fire, blew up the greatest part of the Fort and most of the Men; so that the Enemy entred it when they least expected, and our Men were forced to accept of some Vessels to go where they thought fit.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. About Four hundred Persons of all sorts were shipped, and got to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine Islands,</hi> where D <hi>Peter de Cunna</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Neither was their Voyage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, the enraged Sea being ready to swallow them; but the Mercy of God brought them safe ashore, by virtue of certain Reliques thrown into the Water by a Jesuit, which laid the Storm, and after their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were brought and laid upon the Sand by a Fish.</p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:54711:605"/>
10. In <hi>February Cunna</hi> sailed from the <hi>Philippine</hi> Islands towards <hi>Ternate</hi> with One thousand <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Four hundred of the Natives. He Besieged the Fort, in which was the King himself, and had above One hundred Cannons. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natenses</hi> thinking to surprize the Besiegers, made a Sally, and were so received by <hi>Iohn Rodriguez Camelo,</hi> who commanded a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Portugueses,</hi> that he not only beat them back, but entred the Fort along with them. So that when the <hi>Spanish</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der came up, fearing some mischance might be occasioned by that heat, <hi>Camelo</hi> met him at the Gate with the Keys of the Fort, and <hi>Cunna</hi> to honour him for that Action, put about his Neck a Gold Chain he had upon his own.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The <hi>Ternatenses</hi> in the fright aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the City as they had done the Fort. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Commander losing no time, drove the <hi>Hollanders</hi> out of <hi>Tidore,</hi> and cut off their hopes of ever settling in those Islands, which from that time forward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained subject to <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. Though the <hi>Hollanders</hi> lost <hi>Tidore,</hi> yet they aspired to greater Conquests. To this purpose they made a League with seven of the Neighbouring Kings about <hi>Malaca,</hi> thinking to gain that Place. They gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Fleet of One hundred and fifty Sail, in which were 16000 Men. There were but few above One hundred <hi>Portugueses</hi> in a condition to oppose this Power, but they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54711:605"/>
were Commanded by the Great <hi>Andrew Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado de Mendoça.</hi> He sent out several Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to discover the Enemy's Designs. The first was but of four Soldiers with <hi>Gaspar de Fonseca;</hi> the Enemy thinking they Desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, gave them free Passage, but were unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, receiving considerable damage from only those five Men. Next Captain <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand de Costa de Andria</hi> with Forty Men, some of them <hi>Iaponeses,</hi> cut off a good Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them, and retired without any loss.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Enemy having taken their Ground, began to batter the City; and those within to feel the Miseries of a Siege, being in want of all Necessaries. To this was added, that the Master-Gunner was a <hi>Hollander,</hi> who designedly burst many pieces of Cannon, having under-hand Intelligence with the Enemy. A <hi>Moor</hi> who commanded some Men acted no less treacherously, but being discovered, they were both hanged over the Wall. Many of our Men signalized themselves by brave Actions, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Iohn Rodriguez Camelo,</hi> who with great danger brought a number of Men and did good Service with them. The Enemy lost so many Men during four Months the Siege lasted, in which time they spent above Fifty thousand Cannon Balls; that despairing of success they raised the Siege; the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to their Ships.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The News that D. <hi>Martin Alfonso de Castro,</hi> our Viceroy, was coming with twelve Galleons, four Galleys, and seventy
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54711:606"/>
other Vessels, caused the Siege to be sooner raised. He set out of <hi>Goa</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> on St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Day in <hi>Iune</hi> came to Anchor at <hi>Achem,</hi> where he took three of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Ships loaden with Provisions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to take Revenge on that King for receiving the <hi>Hollanders</hi> into his Ports, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a former Agreement. On the 29th the Men landed, the Enemy's opposed them in great numbers with many Elephants, but after a brave resistance were forced to their Works. Our Men mounted and planted their Colours, and had they followed their Victory, the City had been that day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. Yet the fight lasted all that and next day; when the Viceroy perceiving no Benefit accrued, shipped his Men, much affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that he had slipped such an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. After suffering much for want of Water, and loosing some Vessels by bad Weather, the Fleet came before <hi>Malaca,</hi> where <hi>Andrew Furtado</hi> acquainted the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy the Siege was carried on by Sea and Land, on the Sea were eleven Ships and seven Galliots of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and Three hundred small Vessels of the Natives; by Land, eleven neighbouring Kings in their Persons with 14000 Men. Both of them, during those four Months the Siege lasted, had destroyed many Buildings, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great Outrages against Images and other holy Things. On the 17th of <hi>August</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Ships went out to receive our Fleet, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Cannon furiosly, and were answer'd
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54711:606"/>
in like manner with equal loss, till Night parted them.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Morning appearing the Fight was renewed with great Fury, but the Damage was greater on our side, because the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Ships exceeded us in strength, swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, number of Cannons, and goodness of Gunners. <hi>Sebastian Suarez</hi> boarded one and burnt it, after having killed many <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Alvaro de Carvallo</hi> would have done the like to another, and <hi>Duarte de Guerra</hi> coming up to second him, they all three were consumed by fire, and none of the Men saved.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. D. <hi>Henry de Noronna</hi> boarded the Admiral <hi>Cornelius Madclif,</hi> and being both in danger of being burnt, they parted by consent, promising if they met again they would not encounter. Whereupon <hi>Noronna</hi> quitted his Command, telling the Viceroy, He had rather serve as a private Man, than be obliged to perform the Promise he had made to the Enemy. D. <hi>Peter Mascarennas</hi> succeeded him in the Command, who did Wonders; for the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral coming up to salute him, supposing it had been <hi>Noronna,</hi> they engaged furiously; and after the fight, Four hundred Cannon shot were found in the Galleon, which had done no other harm than the killing one <hi>Caf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>e.</hi> The Fleets were engaged eight Days, and our Vessels very much disabled. On the 24th of <hi>August</hi> the Viceroy again offered the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Battel, but they all fled.</p>
                     <p n="18">
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:54711:607"/>
18. The Viceroy entred <hi>Malaca,</hi> which had been ruined during the Siege. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Furtado</hi> was of Opinion, the Fleet should be kept together, lest the Enemy might destroy it, being separated: Others advised it should divide; the worst Advice was followed. D. <hi>Alvaro de Meneses</hi> had a Squadron of seven Galleons, to go meet the Ships that were expected from <hi>Portugal</hi> at the Islands of <hi>Nicobar. Nunno Alvarez Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyra;</hi> another of five, to secure the Ships of <hi>Iava,</hi> that brought Provisions to <hi>Malaca,</hi> through the Streight of <hi>Singapura,</hi> but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving met the Enemy, he returned into the Port.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> having refitted, and hearing our Fleet was divided, came again before <hi>Malaca,</hi> and finding there the five Galleons, they began a desperate fight on the twenty-second of <hi>October.</hi> Many Men of Note of our side were killed; one of our Vessels blew up, and only seven Men were saved: In fine, the whole Squadron was destroyed. Of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> about Five hundred were killed. The Viceroy soon after died at <hi>Malaca,</hi> it was believed that of Grief for this Loss.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> met not with the like Success in the Bay of <hi>Polobutum,</hi> where D. <hi>Alvaro de Meneses</hi> was with his Squadron of seven Galleons; for after a bloody Fight, they were forced to give way, having lost three Ships. But since the Viceroy is dead, and we must enter upon a new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will be fit to mention what Ships
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54711:607"/>
sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> for <hi>India</hi> during his Life. In the Year 1605, 7 Ships.

In the Year 1606, 3 Ships were to have gone, but were prevented by a <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron that lay at the mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till the Season was past.

Of Stature somewhat tall, of Complexion sallow, a good Christian, a good Gentleman, well beloved in <hi>India,</hi> and Zealous of the Kings's Service, a Thing now rare in the World.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Government of the Archbishop D. F. <hi>Alexius de Meneses,</hi> who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the Year 1607, till 1609.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. DOn <hi>Martin Alfonso de Castra</hi> the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy being dead, D. F. <hi>Alexius de Meneses</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Goa</hi> succeeded him in the Government, but not in the Title. About the beginning of his Government failed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> the three Ships, which were to have set out the Year before. After them followed two Galleons, and two small Ships, the two former were to remain in <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> now aimed at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the Island of <hi>Moçambique.</hi> Our Fort there was commanded by D. <hi>Stephen de Ataide,</hi> who not long before had obtained of the Emperor of <hi>Monomotapa</hi> a Grant of all the Silver Mines in his Dominions, which are much richer than those of <hi>Asia,</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Motive of this Donation was, that we might assist him to subdue his Rebellious Subjects, which D. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> performed, securing him in his Throne, and to us that great Gift, if we had known how to make use of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. About the end of <hi>May, Paul Vercaden</hi> the Dutch Admiral anchored in the great
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54711:608"/>
Port of <hi>Moçambique</hi> with 8 Ships well sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and carrying 1500 Men. In the Fort there were but 80 Men, a few and but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Pieces of Cannon, and that scarce fit for Service. Nevertheless D. <hi>Stephen</hi> lost no Courage, but posted his Men, whilst the Enemy invested the Place.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Enemies Cannon-Balls flying very thick, kept the Walls bare of Men, so that a Colonel of theirs boldly rode about view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Works, till he was struck down dead with a Bullet. The Enemy carrying on their Approaches under the shelter of their Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that continually played, our Men were forced to appear upon the Walls to oppose that Danger, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> being tired, offered a Truce, which was accepted. While it lasted, they reproached the <hi>Portugu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ses</hi> that they had degenerated from their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Valour, who, to convince them of the contrary, offered to fight 50 of them with only 25; which they refusing, it gave new Courage to the Besieged.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Truce expiring, the Cannon on both sides began to play. The Enemy thought to take off the use of ours, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the Walls great Wooden Towers equal with our Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>apets. It was a dark stormy night when they began to advance, but our watchful Centinels perceiving it, so many Fireworks were heaped on them, they were forced to retire with some loss. Next night, notwithstanding all opposition, they were laid close to the Walls. Twenty five
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54711:609"/>
                        <hi>Portugueses</hi> sallied with a Resolution to burn or break them, but succeeded not.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Being disappointed of that Design, they fall upon the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who increased to 500, and killing many, those 25 retired without losing one, only some were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This Action seemed to have astonished the Enemy, for the next day they stirred not; nor after that for a whole week, thô they saw their Castles burnt. At last the Admiral sent <hi>Ataide</hi> a Letter, threatning to spoil all the Country about, unless he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed it from Ruin with a Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Our Commander refused, and the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> burnt down all that the Fire could lay hold of, so the Town and other Buildings pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished. Next they cut down all the Woods, and then raised the Siege which had lasted two months; during which time, 13 of our Men were killed, and of theirs above 300. As they went over the Bar, one of their Ships was sunk by our Cannon. Scarce were they gone in the beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> when three of our Ships from <hi>Portugal,</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of D. <hi>Hierome Coutino,</hi> entred the Port. Not long after came in <hi>Peter Blens,</hi> about the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> with 3 <hi>Holland</hi> Ships, and 2000 Men, which might have been our Ruin had they come sooner.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. D. <hi>Hierome,</hi> having the best he could relieved the Place, was under Sail for <hi>India,</hi> when <hi>Blens</hi> came in, imagining <hi>Vercaden</hi> was by that time possess'd of the Fort. The
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54711:609"/>
                        <hi>Portugueses</hi> undeceived him with some Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Shot, to which he answered by landing his Men, and besieging the Fort as the other had done. The first day the Batteries played they spent above 300 great Shot, which laid one side open; and they might have entred, had they been as resolute to Assaul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Next morning 25 Men sallying killed 30, and returned without losing one, bringing in Arms, Drums, and Colours. One of these engaged with three of the Enemy well Armed, killed two, and put the other to flight.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. A <hi>Frenchman</hi> and 4 <hi>Hollanders</hi> came to the Wall, begging to be protected as being Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

One hundred and fifty more were in the same danger, who were taken out of a Galleon, which coming from <hi>Portugal,</hi> and knowing nothing of what had happened there, run into the midst of the Enemies Ships, and was burnt by them. D. <hi>Stephen</hi> chose rather to expose those Men to danger, than break Faith with those five he had taken into Protection.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Viceroy D. <hi>John Pereyra Frojas</hi> Count <hi>de Feyra,</hi> in the Year 1608.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. AT the beginning of this Year sailed from the Port of <hi>Lisbon</hi> for <hi>India</hi> D. <hi>Iohn Pereyra Frojas</hi> Count <hi>de Feyra</hi> with the Title of <hi>Viceroy.</hi> He raised in all Men great expectation, as well for his Personal Merit, as the greatness of his Quality, and the Preparations for his Voyage were suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being the greatest that till then had been. His Squadron consisted of 6 Ships, and 8 Galleons.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Viceroy set out on the 29th of <hi>March,</hi> died on the 15th of <hi>May;</hi> his Body was sent back, and brought to <hi>Lisbon</hi> the 24th of <hi>Iuly.</hi> The Admiral <hi>Noronna</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Command of the Fleet. The Count was the second that died by the way going to govern <hi>India,</hi> and may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 3d of the Name, 20th Viceroy, and 39th Governour; for the Patent, not the Possession, make a Man so.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But since this Viceroy has not afforded Matter for a Chapter, let us make it up with one of the greatest Prodigies of the <hi>Portugues</hi> Fortune that <hi>Asia</hi> produced. Three Years she was big with this Monster, from 1605, till 1608. We shall see another
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54711:611"/>
                        <hi>Iames Suarez de Melo,</hi> and another <hi>Philip de Brito &amp; Nicate,</hi> famous for their incredible Rise and Insolence. This was <hi>Sebastian Gonzalez Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bao,</hi> a Man of obscure Extraction, as born in the Village of St. <hi>Antony del Tojal,</hi> near <hi>Lisbon,</hi> a Place never yet produced any worth Note, either for Parentage, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Actions. In the Year 1605 he imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued for <hi>India,</hi> went over to <hi>Bengala,</hi> listed himself a Soldier, and then fell to dealing in Salt, which is a great Merchandise there. By this Trade he soon gained as much as purchased a <hi>Ialia,</hi> that is, a sort of small Vessel. In this Vessel he went with Salt to <hi>Dianga,</hi> a great Port of the King of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,</hi> at such time as that King slew 600 <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> who resided there, and suspected nothing less, living quietly as good Subjects under his Protection. The Motive of this Cruelty was, That <hi>Philip de Brito &amp; Nicote</hi> being possessed of <hi>Siriam,</hi> thought it would be for his Advantage to gain <hi>Dianga.</hi> He fitted out some Vessels, and sent in them his Son as Embassador to beg that Port of the King. Some <hi>Portugueses</hi> perswaded the King, <hi>Nicote</hi>'s design in getting that Port, was to deprive him of his Kingdom. He orders the Son with his Officers to come to Court, and there murders them; the same was done in their Vessels; and afterwards that Fury fell upon all the Inhabitants of <hi>Dianga.</hi> This was in the beginning of the Year 1607. Some few escaped into the Woods, and 9 or 10 Vessels got to Sea, whereof one was that of <hi>Sebastian Gonzales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:54711:611"/>
4. <hi>Emanuel de Mattos</hi> Commander of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> of <hi>Dianga,</hi> who died not long before, had been Lord of <hi>Sundiva,</hi> an Island 70 Leagues in compass. <hi>Fatecan</hi> a resolute Moor, whom he had intrusted with the Island in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, hearing of his Death, makes himself Master of it, and the more to secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, murders all the <hi>Portugueses</hi> that were in it, with their Wives and Children, and such of the Natives as were Christians. Then he gathered <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Patans</hi> to his assistance, fitted out a Fleet of 40 Sail, and plentifully maintained this Charge with the Revenue of the Island, which is great. <hi>Sebastian Gonzalez</hi> and his Companions, with those 9 or 10 Vessels that escaped at <hi>Dianga,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Head to govern them, lived by rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing in the Country of <hi>Arracam,</hi> carrying their Booty to the King of <hi>Bacala</hi>'s Ports, who was our Friend. <hi>Fatecan</hi> understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they plyed thereabouts, went out to seek them with such assurance of Success, that he had this Inscription upon his Colours; <hi>Fatecan, by the Grace of GOD Lord of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diva, shedder of Christian Blood, and destroyer of the Portugues Nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. One evening he thought to surprize them, and had effected it, but that they quarrelling about dividing some Spoil they had taken; this falling out, proved their Preservation: For <hi>Sebastian Pinto</hi> upon that account leaving them in a River of the Island <hi>Xavaspur,</hi> met <hi>Fatecan</hi>'s Fleet and gave them notice. They ingaged and fought despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately all night, the morning discovered
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54711:612"/>
80 <hi>Portugueses</hi> victorious over 600 <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Patanes,</hi> and 10 Vessels over 40. Not one Sail got off, nor a Man escaped being killed or taken; among the Dead was <hi>Fatecan.</hi> Had they been under a Commander that knew how to make use of the Victory, the Island must then have been their own. This obliged them to choose a Head, and they pitched upon <hi>Stephen Palmeyro,</hi> a Man of Years, Experience, and Discretion. He gave Proof hereof, by refusing (notwithstanding their repeated Instances) to Command such wicked People. However they desired him to appoint one, and they would punctually obey him. He named <hi>Sebastian Gonzales Tibao.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. As soon as the Commander was named, they resolved to gain <hi>Sundiva.</hi> More <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> were gathered from <hi>Bengala,</hi> and other Neighbouring Ports. <hi>Tibao</hi> articled with the King of <hi>Bacala,</hi> 
                        <q>That he would give him half the Revenue of the Island, if he assisted him to conquer it.</q> The King sent some Ships, and 200 Horse. In <hi>March,</hi> 1609, he had above 40 Sail, and 400 <hi>Portugueses.</hi> The Island having had time to provide for its Defence, was full of Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Men. A great number of <hi>Moors,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>tecan</hi>'s Brother, received them at Landing, but were forced to retire into a Fort. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> besiege it, and lying long before it, were in danger of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, not being able to come at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and Ammunition that were aboard their Vessels, <hi>Gaspar de Pina,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:54711:612"/>
delivered them from this Danger, for he coming with his Ship to that Port, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to assist them, landed 50 Men he was Captain of, and marching by night with many Lights, and great Noise, made the Enemy believe he brought great Succour. As soon as he came up the Fort was assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, entred, and all within that had life put to the Sword. The Natives of the Island, who before had been subject to the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> presently submitted themselves to <hi>Sebastian Gonzales.</hi> He received them upon condition they should deliver up to him all the Strangers that were in the Island. They brought him above 1000 <hi>Moors,</hi> and as they came he cut off their Heads; about as many more were killed in the Fort. Thus <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Gonzales</hi> became absolute Master of the Island, and was obeyed by the Natives and <hi>Portugueses</hi> as an absolute Lord independent of any Prince, and his Orders had the force of Laws.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. To recompence the chief <hi>Portugueses</hi> who had served him, he gave them Lands in the Island, and then repenting, took them away. In stead of giving the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala</hi> half the Revenue of the Island, as had been agreed, he made War upon him. As he grew Great, so he grew Insolent and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, and had now at Command 1000 <hi>Portugueses,</hi> 2000 Natives well Armed, 200 Horse, and above 80 Sail with good Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Many Merchants traded thither, and he erected a Custom-house. The Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Kings surprized at his prodigious
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54711:613"/>
Success, sought his Friendship. From the King of <hi>Batecala,</hi> to whom he owed so great Favours, he took the Islands of <hi>Xava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pur</hi> and <hi>Patelabauga,</hi> and other Lands from others, so that on a sudden he was possessed of vast Riches, equal with many Princes, and sovereign of many brave Men. But these Monsters are like Comets that last little, and threaten lasting Ruin. They are like Lightning, that no sooner gives the flash but it is gone. Let us proceed, and we shall see this verified.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Such was the fortune of <hi>Sebastian Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zales</hi> in <hi>Sundiva,</hi> when there happened a Difference between the Prince of <hi>Arracam</hi> and his Brother <hi>Anaporam;</hi> the Occasion was, that the latter refused to give the other an Elephant, to which all other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants of that Country were said to allow a sort of Superiority, and durst not appear before him. The Prince seeing he could not prevail by Intreaties nor Threats, raises a great Army, and deprives his Brother both of his Kingdom, and that so much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted Beast. <hi>Anaporam</hi> fled to <hi>Sebastian Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zales</hi> for Succour, who demanded his Sister as a Hostage. Then he sets out to fight the Conqueror, but to no purpose, for he had too great a Power, to wit, 80000 Men, and 700 fighting Elephants. King <hi>Anaporam</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with <hi>Sebastian Gonzales</hi> to <hi>Sundiva,</hi> bringing over his Wife, Family, Treasure, and Elephants. Thus he remained as a Subject to <hi>Sebastian Gonzales,</hi> who Baptizing his Sister, married her, and though so vile a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54711:613"/>
Wretch, pretended he did that Prince a great favour. Soon after the Prince dies, not without suspition of Poison, for <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Gonzales</hi> seized upon all his Treasure, Elephants, and Goods, without any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Wife and Son. To stop the mouths of the People, he would have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Queen to his Brother <hi>Antony Tiba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Sebastian</hi> waged War upon the King of <hi>Arracam</hi> with good success. An Instance hereof may be, that his Brother <hi>Antony</hi> with only 5 Sail took 100 of that King's. This moved the King to conclude a Peace with him, and thereby recovered his Sister-in-Law and Brother's Widow, whom he married to the King of <hi>Chatigam.</hi> At this time the <hi>Mogol</hi> undertook the Conquest of the Kingdom of <hi>Balua,</hi> and <hi>Sebastian</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it might prove of dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that Kingdom lying opposite to him, he makes a League with the King of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam</hi> for the defence of that Country. The League concluded, the King takes the Field with 80000 Men, most of them Musketiers, 10000 <hi>Pegues</hi> that fought with Sword and Buckler, and 700 Elephants loaded with Castles and Armed Men. He put to Sea above 200 Sail, carrying 4000 Men, which were to joyn <hi>Sebastian Gonzales</hi> his Fleet, and to be under his Command. The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, That <hi>Sebastian</hi> should hinder the <hi>Mogol</hi> from passing to the Kingdom of <hi>Balua,</hi>
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:54711:614"/>
till the King of <hi>Arracam</hi> could march thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Army; and that the <hi>Mogol</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expelled, half the Kingdom of <hi>Balua</hi> should be given to <hi>Sebastian,</hi> who gave the King, as Hostages for his Fleet, a Nephew of his own, and the Sons of some <hi>Portugueses</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Sundiva.</hi>

                     <p n="10">10. The King of <hi>Arracam</hi> entring the Kingdom of <hi>Balua</hi> with his Army, expelled the <hi>Mogols.</hi> It was thought, that <hi>Sebastian</hi> overcome with Bribes had given them free passage, which, according to the Agreement with the King of <hi>Arracam,</hi> he was to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct.

He enters a Creek of the Island <hi>Desierta</hi> with his Fleet, and calling all the King of <hi>Arracam</hi>'s Captains aboard his Ship, murders them, then falling upon the Ships, killed or made Slaves of all the Men. Having committed this infamous Action, and secured that Fleet, he returned to <hi>Sundiva.</hi> Mean while the <hi>Mogols</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down again with a greater Power, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Kingdom of <hi>Balua,</hi> and reduced the King of <hi>Arracam</hi> to such distress, that with much difficulty he escaped by the help of an Elephant, and came almost alone to the Fort of <hi>Chatigam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Sebastian Gonzales</hi> understanding the Slaughter the <hi>Mogols</hi> had made of the <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam</hi> Army, and that they were possess'd of

the Kingdom of <hi>Balua,</hi> he sets out with his Fleet, plundering and destroying with Fire and Sword all the Forts of <hi>Arracam</hi> that lie along the Coast, and were then unprovided, and confiding in the Peace that was between them. He had the Impudence to go up to <hi>Arracam,</hi> where as the Matter was more, so was the Destruction, there were burnt many Merchant Ships of several Nations. The King was highly concerned at these Losses, though not so much at those occasioned by the <hi>Mogol,</hi> as those he sustained by this <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses,</hi> as being all the effects of Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but above all, he resented the loss of a Ship which he kept in that Port for to take his Pleasure. It was of a vast Bigness, and wonderful Workmanship, with several Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments like a Palace, all covered with Gold and Ivory, and yet the curiosity of the Work surpassed all the rest.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The King seeing the Insolence and Falshood of <hi>Sebastian Gonzales,</hi> and that he did not, or would not, remember his Nephew was in his Power as a Hostage, he resolved to put him in mind; and causing a Stake to be run through him, made him be set up on a high place below the Port of <hi>Arracam,</hi> that his Uncle as he went out might see him. But he who had no Honour, valued not at whose Cost he advanced his own Interest. Nevertheless the guilt of so many Villanies began to touch his Conscience, and being come to <hi>Sundiva,</hi> he began to apprehend some heavy Punishment would fall upon him, which he had little means to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Governour <hi>Andrew Furtado de Mendoça,</hi> in the Year 1609.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. MOst Men appear fit for publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments before they have them, and afterwards wholly incapable of them; It was not so with <hi>Andrew Furtado,</hi> for every body esteemed him fitter to Govern when he was placed in that Power, than they had done before, and yet there was none before but wished to see him in that Post. The Arts by which he gained this Esteem, were Valour, Generosity, Liberality, and Affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And being now advanced to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he confirmed the good Opinion the World had conceived of him, by being cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to his Inferiors, and not lifting himself above those who had been his Equals.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:54711:615"/>
2. When a private Captain he dressed costly, now being Governor plainer than a private Captain. The Work-houses were his Rooms of State, the Shore his Garden. His thoughts were full of great Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; but considering how small a Bank there was for such Designs, he gathered the Council of <hi>Goa,</hi> the Chief Gentry, and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Men of that City. Being assembled, he made a Speech, representing the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had made in <hi>India,</hi> and exhorting them with their Persons and Purses to be assisting to expel them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They all assured him there should be nothing he could propose, but they would forward to the utmost of their power. This was soon made good, for within two months and a half he had a great Fleet, well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and provided. All Men were in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the Effect of those great Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, when on the first of <hi>September</hi> there appeared at a great distance several Sail that seemed to be of bulk. It was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they were <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Our Governor hearing of it, run down to the Shore, and in a few hours made ready some Ships and Galliots, saying, <hi>Now shall they see how</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Furtado <hi>with these light Vessels boards their three Deck Ships. The time is come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Just as he came out to order Affairs, so without returning to Court was he going aboard, without calling any Body; but this his Resolution being known, there soon flocked to him as many Men as there was occasion for. So it happened to King <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucl</hi>
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:54711:616"/>
(whom he now seemed to imitate) who hearing the danger <hi>Arzila</hi> was in, set out Post, and without beating Drum by that his speed presently raised a great Army. But as the Governor was spreading Sail, advice was brought that they were no Enemies, but Ships from <hi>Portugal,</hi> that brought a new viceroy.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This was <hi>Ruy Lorenço de Tavora,</hi> who sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> at the end of <hi>October</hi> with four Galleons and a Caravel, and had Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Island of <hi>Ibo.</hi> Those who came received a double satisfaction, one in their safe arrival, the other in seeing that Port of <hi>Goa</hi> covered with such a number of Ships, as represented the past more happy times.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Many were sorry <hi>Furtado</hi> was so soon deprived of that Government, for the great hopes they had conceived of his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and Heaven seemed to favour his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, by the Death of the Count <hi>de Feyra,</hi> who was going to that Command.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Even the Viceroy that went to succeed him was troubled; for seeing that Bay full of many so Ships and in such Order, he asked; <hi>Who governed</hi> India? and being told that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Furtado,</hi> he replied, <hi>I thought so, for the greatness of this Work assured me it could have no other Author. I am sorry I came now to</hi> India <hi>to take this Command; because it is a hindrance to the great Actions might be expected from such a Governor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Since this untimely arrival of the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, has cut off what might be expected from <hi>Furtado</hi>'s Government, let us Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54711:616"/>
what he acted under others. At 16 Years of Age he was in <hi>Africk,</hi> when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate King <hi>Sebastian</hi> went over thither. Then passed over into <hi>India,</hi> and having performed some Military Exploits, had the Command of ten Ships, with which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Fort of <hi>Braçalor</hi> besieged by King <hi>Sincarnoboro.</hi> He not only raised the Siege, but reduced the King to become Tributary to <hi>Portugal;</hi> then falling upon those that had combined with him, destroyed their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries with Fire and Sword, and took one of the chiefest with all his Vessels, putting all the Men to the Sword. He took several Ships of <hi>Meca,</hi> defeated the great General <hi>Cotimuza,</hi> destroyed another Fleet at <hi>Manar,</hi> taking many Ships, slew the King of <hi>Iafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napatan</hi> that was in Rebellion, ruined a Fleet of <hi>Malabars</hi> that did us great harm on those Seas; raised the Siege <hi>Raju</hi> had laid to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo,</hi> levelled the Formidable Fort of <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale,</hi> bringing him and his Nephew Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to <hi>Goa;</hi> drove the <hi>Hollanders</hi> from <hi>Amboyna</hi> and <hi>Sunda,</hi> reduced the <hi>Rosatelo's</hi> then in Rebellion, gained many strong holds in the Islands of <hi>Ito, Nao</hi> and <hi>Veranula;</hi> and being Commander of <hi>Malaca</hi> held out a Siege of four Months against the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and 11 neighbouring Kings.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. It was great to overcome so many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but far greater to conquer himself. In the dead of Night a Woman got into his Apartment, offering him her Daughter, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereto by extream want. After a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reprimand, he charges her to marry
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54711:617"/>
the Daughter, and gives her a Purse of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with assurance he would make up the Portion.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. All these great Actions he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the Age of 45, besides many more which in another had been considerable, but not of Note to him. He was as to his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the best of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Having go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned three Months, he Embarqued for <hi>Portugal,</hi> died by the way of the Jaundice, and lies in the Church of our Lady of Grace in <hi>Lisbon.</hi> Of Stature he was somewhat tall, his Complexion tawny, of Body lean, and was the 40th Governor, and 2d of the Sirname.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Government of the Vice-Roy <hi>Ruy Lorenço de Tavora,</hi> from the Year 1609, till 1612.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. SCarce was <hi>Ruy Lorrenço de Tavora</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Government, when there came in 5 Ships from <hi>Portugal,</hi> which with the same number that carried him made 10, and consequently a great number of Men that went in them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. About the beginning of the Year were set out the usual Squadrons, but more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and better manned than usual, by reason of the great Preparations before spoke of, and the Men that came newly. At
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54711:617"/>
the same time came from <hi>Lisbon</hi> 3 Ships for <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The greatest Action at this time was in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> where D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo,</hi> who had that Command, went on with the usual Success that always attended him in that Post. He marched with 700 <hi>Portugueses</hi> and 25000 <hi>Lascarines</hi> (that is <hi>Chingala</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) to assault the City <hi>Candea,</hi> and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the way the Fort of <hi>Balane</hi> abandoned, left <hi>Antony de Costa Monteyro</hi> in it with two Companies. Then advancing to the River of <hi>Candea,</hi> and finding it well fortified, nevertheless he attempted to pass it, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Enemy's Fire, which for some time did no Execution. Yet our Men gave way till F. <hi>Gaspar de la Madalena,</hi> a <hi>Franciscan,</hi> ran into the River holding up a Crucifix and encouraging them, whereupon they charged and drove the Enemy from their Works, who fled to the Mountains abandoning the City, which was burnt, and such as could be overtaken slain.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This Success so thoroughly reconciled the King of <hi>Candea</hi> to us, that he admitted the Conversation of the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> and put his two Sons into their Hands to be bred Christians. Thus the Peace was concluded, and he writ to our King <hi>Philip</hi> to Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him upon his accession to the Crown, testifying the great Affection he bore him, and desiring to be esteemed among the Princes of <hi>Asia,</hi> as one that most desired his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:54711:618"/>
5. The Moor <hi>Abdala Carima, Tanadar</hi> of <hi>Nizamaluco,</hi> who, besides his natural hatred to the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> was malicious on account that he had lost half a hand by them, disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Peace at <hi>Chaul.</hi> His Pretence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his Prince's Revenue, wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with much Insolence; and we on our part bore much, rather than break into open War.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Our Commander, D.<hi>Francis Rolim,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to <hi>Nizamaluco,</hi> who answered with Threats, that he would fit out a Fleet, and that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were already in that Sea. To be as good as his Word, he set out 30 Paraos, which robbed all that came in their way belonging to the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> The <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadar</hi> being thus backed, hearing that <hi>George Henrique</hi> was gone out to a Wood, he kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and took his Wife and two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The People of <hi>Chaul</hi> pressed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to commence the War, he having no Orders from the Viceroy, and but few Men; yet sent out 16 Men with two Officers one Night, they found 30 Moors near the Pagod of <hi>Ramaçeyra,</hi> and killing half of them retired. <hi>Peter Cornejo</hi> with 30 Men fell upon the Village of <hi>Tal,</hi> killed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, burnt the Houses, and sunk two Vessels that were in the Port. Tho' this was a sufficient Revenge against the <hi>Tanadar,</hi> yet knowing some Men value not their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whilst their Persons are untouched, it was thought fit to make him feel some part himself.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:54711:618"/>
8. To this purpose D. <hi>Francis Rolim</hi> marched to <hi>Upper Chaul</hi> with 350 Men in three Bodies, one Commanded by him, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Michael de Abreu,</hi> and the third by <hi>Calleyros. Abreu</hi> entred first into a narrow Street which ended in a broad Place where the Enemy was drawn up, and with their first fire killed our Captain and two Soldiers. <hi>Rolim</hi> coming up, they made way into the broad Place, and revenged the Death of those three, with the slaughter of many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the rest saving themselevs by flight. Thus they came to the <hi>Tanadar</hi>'s House, which being forsaken by him was burnt; the same happened to a whole Street, where the Moors had renewed the Fight, firing out of the Houses. Marching out of the Town victorious, they killed all that had Life in the Fields, so that Town and Country were covered with dead Bodies.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. At the end of this Year arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> three Ships from <hi>Portugal.</hi> In <hi>October</hi> sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> two Caravels, in <hi>November</hi> one Galleon, in which went <hi>Antony Pinto de Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seca</hi> with the Title of Visitor and Prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor of the Forts in <hi>India,</hi> as if no Viceroy had been there; in <hi>December</hi> another Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, in which went a Patent for D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo,</hi> to succeed in that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The War being begun at <hi>Chaul,</hi> both Parties encreased, and several Skirmishes happened, in which the <hi>Portugueses</hi> always had the best, till D. <hi>Francis de Sotomayor</hi> came thither with the Northern Fleet,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54711:619"/>
and left there three Vessels. Being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced, our Men took the Field, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Battel to the Moors, who were also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased. <hi>Antony Furtado de Mendoça</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing too far with only two Men was killed, and the <hi>Portugues</hi> Body coming up worsted; for though they did great Execution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn into an Ambush, <hi>Gonzalo de Abreu</hi> was killed, his Country-House lost, afterwards the War went on with less vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Whilst this happened at <hi>Chaul, Nuno de Cunna</hi> fought the <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Suratt</hi> with more valour and Success. He had four Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons well manned, but ill provided with Gunners, for they were ignorant and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. He found in that Port a great <hi>English</hi> Ship and a Ketch, which had a short fight between the little Island of <hi>Iohn de Nova</hi> and the Bank called <hi>Baxo de la India,</hi> beyond the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> with two Ships of ours, of three that this year sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> for <hi>India,</hi> one whereof commanded by D. <hi>Luis de Gama</hi> making for <hi>Zocotora,</hi> was drove by a violent Storm between the Islands called <hi>Dos Hermanos,</hi> whence he got late to <hi>Goa,</hi> after losing four hundred Men; some by the Fatigue of the Sea, and others through the Miseries they endured in defence of the Ship, and the Cruelty of that barbarous People.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. When the <hi>English,</hi> whose Ships were excellent Sailers, discovered our heavy Vessels, though they had cause to fear their number, they undervalued them by reason
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54711:619"/>
of that fault. They presently ingaged us in the Evening, and fought till dark Night parted them, having killed 30 of our Men. As soon as Day appeared they fell to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and two of our Galleons running to Board the two <hi>English</hi> Vessels, were stuck on the Sands, there being too little Water for the Galleons. The Pink seeing them aground, kept firing its Cannon upon one till the Evening Tide brought it off. The great Ship kept the other two Galleons that were a float in play all that Day. The third day all the Galleons being afloat made up to board the Enemy, but they who relied on their Cannon and swiftness, made away to <hi>Castelese,</hi> a Bay of the Pyrats of <hi>Diu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Luis de Brito</hi> who plied upon that Coast with some small Vessels gave advice to <hi>Cunna,</hi> that the <hi>English</hi> were in that Port. He sailed thither, and they fought two whole Days, in which time our Ships, by reason of their heaviness, could never board them; at length the <hi>English</hi> stood away, having put up black Colours in token their Captain was killed; they lost many Men, and slew many of ours. They made to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratt, Cunna</hi> followed; they left the Port, and <hi>Cunna</hi> returned to <hi>Goa,</hi> where then D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo</hi> had been Governor two Months.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Some time before 5 Galiots set our for <hi>China</hi> and two Merchant Ships for <hi>Iapan,</hi> they all Wintered at <hi>Malaca,</hi> the Season be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfit to Sail. Provisions were very scarce
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54711:620"/>
there, and the more now by the addition of those Men. <hi>Michael de Sousa</hi> sent out some Ships to get Provisions in the Neighbourhood. These met several Sail bound for <hi>Pam</hi> and <hi>Ior,</hi> laden with Spice and other Goods, which they took and brought to <hi>Malaca.</hi> Then sailed to <hi>Pam</hi> where the King of <hi>Ior</hi> was with a Fleet, and tho' at Peace with the <hi>Portugueses</hi> he went out of their way. Not far from <hi>Patane</hi> they took 8 Vessels richly laden, and returning with them to <hi>Malaca,</hi> that City was not only relieved, but enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The Viceroy receiving Advice from <hi>Portugal,</hi> that a considerable Fleet was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out in <hi>Holland,</hi> with a Design against <hi>Malaca,</hi> he sent <hi>Iames de Mendoça Furtado,</hi> with 8 Galliots to relieve it. Being under Sail for <hi>Pulobutum</hi> they were dispersed by a Storm in the Golph of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> but met again in that Port. Four of them sailed out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Admiral and the others, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Ship of <hi>Iava</hi> with seventy Men who traded in the Kingdom of <hi>Quedar,</hi> with which we were at War, attacked it, and were well received, having four Men killed and ten much wounded; but being provoked by this loss, they boarded the Vessel and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all in her.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Admiral <hi>Iames de Mendoça</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his Voyage to <hi>Malaca,</hi> whence he passed not without danger of the Sea to <hi>Pam,</hi> to bring thence some Princes of <hi>Borneo</hi> who were travelling.</p>

16. Leaving those Princes at <hi>Malaca, Mendoça</hi> with <hi>Emannel Mascarennas,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of that City, went over to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Pera,</hi> understanding that three great Ships of <hi>Guzarat</hi>'s richly laden were in that Port, which lessened our Customs. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doça</hi> had Fifteen Ships, he entred the River, which is so narrow, only two Ships can sail abreast. He boardest the first of the three Ships, and tho' the Enemy fought well, entred her, and they set fire to her, so she perished; the second Ship was easily taken; the third escaped thro' our own fault, for being too busie about the Plunder of the other; the Day was spent, and the Enemy stole away by Night. The Ship taken was brought to <hi>Malaca,</hi> it had 32 Guns and rich Lading. <hi>Iames de Mendoça Furtado</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Goa,</hi> where he found D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo</hi> was then Viceroy. <hi>Ruy Lorenço de Tavora</hi> was Viceroy three Years, the 21th of that number, 41th Governor, and second of the Name and Sirname. He had more Inclination to Peace than War, which produced Concord with all the Kings of <hi>India,</hi> of Stature tall, his Complexion fair, aged, and a good Christian, a rare thing among Men of Quality.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THough these Affairs properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Ecclesiastical History, of which I design a particular Volume; yet for the satisfaction of those who desire some Information herein, and having at the end of the First Part said somewhat touching the first entrance of Christianity in <hi>China,</hi> I will here briefly relate its Progress till the Year 1640, though it be anticipating the Time, that the Relation may not be too much dismembred, and because that Order is chiefly observed by me in Martial Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The four Houses or Residences of <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheu, Nancham, Nanking,</hi> and <hi>Peking,</hi> being setled, F. <hi>Emanuel Diaz</hi> was sent as Visitor of the three first, because F. <hi>Matthew Rivius</hi> could not be spared from the other, which was the Soul of them all. The Visitor-General <hi>Valiniano</hi> setled 30 Crowns a Year upon each Residence, finding it sufficient to cloath and maintain the Religious who were to live there, that they might not obstruct the advancement of the Faith by the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of asking any thing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Visitor sent new Fathers to all the Residences. In the Year 1604, <hi>Cuitayso</hi> was
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54711:621"/>
Baptized, till then he only gave ear to it, but was the cause that many were converted, and procured the Foundation at <hi>Nanking.</hi> He was called <hi>Ignatius.</hi> In the Year 1606, died the Visitor <hi>Valiniano</hi> at <hi>Macao; Nicholas Pimenta</hi> succeeded him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. F. <hi>Matthew Rivius</hi> died at <hi>Peking</hi> in the Year 1610; the King appointed his place of Burial, and allotted his Companions a House and Church. The <hi>Mandarins</hi> and others celebrated his Funeral with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of esteem. He was the first buried in that country, for all that died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were carried to <hi>Macao.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Year 1613, the Religious were expelled <hi>Hancheu,</hi> and coming to the City <hi>Nanhiun</hi> built a Church there, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others. In the Year 1616, there were 7 Residences, two at <hi>Peking,</hi> one of them without the Walls, one at <hi>Nanking,</hi> one at <hi>Hancheu,</hi> one at <hi>Nancham,</hi> one at <hi>Caiyeu,</hi> and one at <hi>Nanhiun.</hi> In them all were 22 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Converts amounted to 6000, among them many Nobles, Lawyers and Mandarines, and some Bonzo's.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Year 1617, the Religious were expelled from all their Residences, the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution began at <hi>Nanking.</hi> Some escaped to <hi>Quantung</hi> and <hi>Macao,</hi> 14 remained hid in <hi>China,</hi> who were afterwards called by other Cities to erect new Foundations. One was at <hi>Kiencham,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Kiangsi,</hi> through the means of a Lawyer who was converted, and christned <hi>Stephen.</hi> Another at <hi>Xambay,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Paul</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54711:622"/>
Another at <hi>Quartim,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Nanking,</hi> which City it could serve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Residence there; but the Fathers were restored to it by the assistance of Doctor <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> a great Admirer of them and of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and afterwards one of the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preachers of the Gospel. By degrees the Persecution ceased, and the Fathers were every where restored. Two new Residen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were erected in the Cities of <hi>Xansi</hi> and <hi>Xensi,</hi> and some of those that had been ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished returned from <hi>Macao.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Year 1622, two other Residences were setled in the Province of <hi>Fokien,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Xansi,</hi> another at <hi>Xensi,</hi> another at <hi>Honan.</hi> All things went on successfully, and the Year 1630 the Converts came in by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, afterwards by thousands.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. In the Year 1634, there were in <hi>China 22 European</hi> Fathers and 4 Brothers, greatly esteemed by the Mandarins and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Note. A Prince of the Province of <hi>Xantung</hi> sent for some Fathers to hear their Doctrine, so did other Provinces after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. At <hi>Peking</hi> there were 288 Converts, among them Mandarines, Lawyers, and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, one Eunuch, and one Bonzo, which is considerable, they being a sort of Priests; he converted his Father, and some Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. At <hi>Nanking,</hi> 70 Converts, and a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eunuch of 75 Years of Age. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians here were so zealous, that when the Fathers removed, a Lawyer and his Nephew
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54711:622"/>
carrying the Vestments and other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuff on their backs, and being told by the Father, <hi>The Servants might do it:</hi> 
                        <q>They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, It was not fit any body should car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Things of the Church, but they who were proud to be Porters to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. At <hi>Kiamcheu</hi> and <hi>Pucheu</hi> almost 2000 Converts, at a time when the three greatest Calamities of this World succeeded each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The first was Famine, which raged to that degree they eat one another; two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were shot to Death, being convicted of eating 40 Children. A Father and Mother, rather than see their Child perish in their Arms, cast it into a River, and themselves after it. Others buried a Child alive; a Christian, call'd <hi>Peter,</hi> saved both the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and brought them up. The next Calamity was War; and the third the Plague.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. At <hi>Hancheu,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiang,</hi> the Converts amounted not to 150. At <hi>Xamhay</hi> 400. At <hi>Narcham</hi> only 26. At <hi>Quiencham</hi> 80. In the City <hi>Fokien</hi> 257, and many in the Country. At <hi>Singam</hi> not 100, by reason of the Famine that raged; as at <hi>Quiamcheu</hi> they eat the Dead, ground Stones, and used the Dust in stead of Meal. Some at <hi>Hoacheu</hi> and the Neighbourhood. At <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> but 30. In the Kingdom of <hi>Hannam,</hi> which the <hi>Portugueses</hi> call <hi>Tonking,</hi> almost 100000.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Thomas,</hi> a Native of <hi>Thinhoa,</hi> labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Kingdom of the <hi>Lao'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

People is white, good conditioned, and have no Thieves among them. Those of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> undervalue them for eating of Vermin. They wear narrow Gowns, their Feet bare, the Head commonly uncovered, their Hair round and short like a Lay-Brother, only one Lock on the Temples, which is run through holes made to that purpose in the Ears, they adore an Idol called <hi>Theica,</hi> with the same Ceremonies those of <hi>Hannam</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship their <hi>Tham.</hi> They Trade into this Kingdom their Merchandize, Elephants, <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's</hi> Skins, Benjamin, and Amber.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. At <hi>Dangthan</hi> 2441 Converts, and many at <hi>Thinhoa.</hi> At <hi>Nighihan</hi> 4200, the Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is at <hi>Rumo;</hi> there are 26 Churches, and the Divine Offices are celebrated with much magnificence. In <hi>Bochinh,</hi> a half Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince next <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> 130 were Baptized. In an Orchard here was found a Tree brought from the <hi>Laos,</hi> the Leaves whereof gain him that carries them the Affection of all he meets, and Reconcile them if Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Being examined whether it was not Superstition, it was judged to be a Natural Virtue.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. In the Year 1635, there were not above 3300 Converted among all the Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences. The House at <hi>Chincheo</hi> was then first founded. A Church was erected in the Town of <hi>Yunchum,</hi> and another in the City <hi>Chancheu.</hi> Now there will be a greater Fruit reaped, because the King protects and countenances the Religious, and their Doctrine; and in the Year 1638, gave them
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54711:623"/>
2000 Taes or Crowns to buy a House and Land. He also granted them (what was more than they could have wished) to put over their Door this Inscription, <hi>I the King Approve of and Protect the Science of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. In fine, there are now in <hi>China</hi> this Year 1640. above 100000 Catholicks, and among them many Nobles, Mandarines, some Bonzos and Eunuchs. Of Mandarines and Colao's, the most admirable were 3 or 4 <hi>Pauls,</hi> one <hi>Michael,</hi> one <hi>Ignatius,</hi> one <hi>Leo,</hi> and one <hi>Stephen,</hi> who were not only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but Preached the Faith with great Elegancy, and much Profit. The great Colao <hi>Paul</hi> herein surpassed all others.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The Jesuits at this time in <hi>China</hi> have twelve principal Residences in the chief Provinces and capital Cities; under these above 500 private Oratories, with hundreds of Christians belonging to each. They have also gained good footing about the Neighbouring Countries, as in <hi>Tomking, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinchina, Cambodia, Laos,</hi> and other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. In these last Countries, between 10 and 15000 Souls are converted every Year.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. The King of <hi>China</hi> himself casts down Idols, and orders the Prince his Son to fall down before the Images of <hi>Iesus</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> The Queen in her Apartment gives ear to what the converted Eunuchs say concerning our Religion. Mass is often ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the Palace, and there is great hope of the King, whose Piety and Zeal have inclined him to respect the Divine

                        <p>The Government of the Viceroy D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo,</hi> from the Year 1612, till 1617.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. AT the end of last Year came to <hi>India</hi> the King's Orders for D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo</hi> to succeed <hi>Ruy Lorenço de Tavora</hi> as Viceroy. This Gentleman had purchased a great Name by many Years service, and chiefly by 18 spent in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> a Thing rare for one who had also gathered great Riches. Not that Riches make a Man incapable of a good Name, but because commonly the means of acquiring them contribute much to stain it. The Fame of his Substance contributed as much as that of his Valour t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> his Promotion
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54711:625"/>
to this Employment, it being thought, that he who had so much, would be less guilty of those Crimes that proceed from Avarice; whereas Experience teaches, that those who have most covet most. But D. <hi>Hierome</hi> had offered to accept of that Post without the usual Salary, yet afterwards he received it, making that a Crime by breaking his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which had been none if not offered.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. On <hi>Christmas</hi> Eve <hi>Ruy Lorenço de Tavora</hi> delivered him the Sword; and the first thing he did, was to forbid the payment of Debts contracted by his Predecessor, who resolved not to depart <hi>India</hi> till the payment of them was secured, as well for his own Reputation, as in respect no Viceroy for the future would be able to get any Money advanced upon the urgent Necessities of the State, if that ill Precedent was given, and his Debts were all on the account of the Publick. At length it was concluded, they should be paid as <hi>Tavora</hi> had ordered. The next Action of the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy was to dispatch <hi>Danisbeque Sedesable</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador from <hi>Abas</hi> the <hi>Xa</hi> or King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who falsly courted the Friendship of all those Princes he designed to spoil, promising each great Advantages, and stirring them up one against the other. Thus he Treated with King <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which he found most suitable to his Designs. Thus he had taken the Island <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harem,</hi> and strove to possess himself of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz.</hi>
                     </p>

3. <hi>Danisbeque</hi> was returned from <hi>Spain</hi> with the Answer of his Embassy; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, what the King had given him in return for a Present of Silks he carried, the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy had Orders to add something at his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. He added the value of 12000 Crowns in Spice, which in <hi>Persia</hi> was worth much more; and having nobly entertained him, sent away with him D. F. <hi>Antony de Gouvea</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sirene,</hi> who also came from <hi>Spain,</hi> and went to propogate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, which had but a slender beginning there. The Bishop went no farther than <hi>Ormuz,</hi> for the <hi>Persians</hi> being already ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected towards him, he feared it would be worse when the Embassador had delivered his Answer. So it happened, for the King finding the Embassador brought not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he expected, caused him to be killed, and obliged 6000 <hi>Armenians</hi> to renounce the Faith.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Viceroy as well versed in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> gave the necessary Orders for its preservation, recommending the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in execution to <hi>Antony Vaz Feyre,</hi> Surveyor of the Revenue in that Island. <hi>Antony Pinto de Fonseca,</hi> who had served well in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and was now Visitor of the Forts in <hi>India,</hi> with the Viceroy's Leave went to perform the Duties of his Employ, D. <hi>Henry de Noronna</hi> being confirmed in the Command of the Coast of <hi>Malabar</hi> given him by <hi>Ruy Lorenço,</hi> united the Kings of <hi>Vanguel, Sierra,</hi> and <hi>Carnate,</hi> against <hi>Venta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panaique,</hi> on pretence of their safety; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54711:626"/>
indeed it was to secure our selves against him, in whose Dominions we held <hi>Braçalor</hi> and <hi>Onor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. This done, D. <hi>Henry</hi> steered for the Coast of <hi>Malabar</hi> with 28 Sail. <hi>Andrew Coello</hi> was sent by the late Governour with 3 Ships to relieve <hi>Palicate</hi> and <hi>Siriam,</hi> and being now driven by stress of Weather to <hi>Columbo,</hi> they were beaten to pieces on that Coast, but the Men saved.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When D. <hi>Hierome</hi> came from <hi>Ceylon</hi> to be <hi>Viceroy,</hi> he gave the supream Command there to <hi>Fran. Rojo,</hi> a Man of unknown Birth, but noted Valour, and by his Courage had attained to the greatest Preferments. It was since found, that he was of the Family of <hi>Meneses,</hi> as being Son to D. <hi>Iames</hi> Count <hi>de Ericeyra,</hi> and Grandson to D. <hi>Henry de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses,</hi> who was Governour of <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. This D. <hi>Francis de Meneses Rojo</hi> being General in that Island, and understanding the King of <hi>Candea</hi> lay before the Fort of <hi>Balane,</hi> and the Commander <hi>Emanuel Falcam</hi> was in some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

About the middle of <hi>April, Abascan</hi> General of the Enemy led a great Body of them to revenge the Death of the others on <hi>Caranja.</hi> He could not be prevented entring the Town, but being in disorder killing and plundering, <hi>Simon Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> with 17 <hi>Portugueses</hi> doing great Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, began to put the <hi>Moors</hi> to flight, whilst <hi>Cunna</hi> coming on another way with few Men, they made a great slaughter. This was a warning to the <hi>Naytia's</hi> not to return to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranja.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Cunna,</hi> not satisfied with what he had done, ravaged their Country, and brought away above 3000 Prisoners. He shewed much Generosity, when two <hi>Moors</hi> being brought to him for entring a Place for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them upon pain of Death, he set them at liberty; because being asked, How they durst come thither without a safe Conduct; <q>one of them answered, That they had done it, relying on the Fame of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, to ransom certain Kindred of theirs.</q>

                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Ruy Freyre de Andrade,</hi> who cruized on that Coast with a Squadron of small Ships, understanding that <hi>Nizamaluco,</hi> since the War broke out at <hi>Chaul,</hi> spread it as far as <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sete</hi>
                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:54711:627"/>
and <hi>Agacaim,</hi> he repaired thither. In a Village between <hi>Caranja</hi> and <hi>Tana,</hi> he cut off some Moors that opposed him, and put the rest to flight. Higher they discovered 500 Moors, and an Elephant with a Castle on his Back, in which were two Cannons. Twelve Soldiers landed, a Captain with 80 Horse attacking them was shot dead, our Men seeing the Enemy halt, stood some time, and then <hi>George Marino</hi> sent to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge their Leader, but he not accepting of it they returned aboard.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. From <hi>Tana Freyre</hi> sent some Ships to relieve the Town of <hi>Agaçaim,</hi> which being indanger'd by the Moors, run a greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard through the discord of the Inhabitants. They were but 50 Families, yet all full of Division, and <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> could no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them. Every one said he was able to defend all their Houses, and all together could not defend one; for 2000 Moors soon forced them thence into the Monastery of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> shewing them how great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betwixt saying and doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Animosity and Discretion. <hi>Freyre</hi> carried the Women and Children to <hi>Baçaim,</hi> and then relieved <hi>Manora,</hi> passing through multitudes of Enemies who expected him ashore, and sought resolutely, insomuch that one laid hold of the Colours, on which was the Picture of the Blessed Virgin, carryed by <hi>Emanuel Ambrosio,</hi> the Moor was shot dead. He got into the Fort without losing one Man, having killed and wounded many, and after securing all things there, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54711:627"/>
to the Mouths of the Rivers of <hi>Tana,</hi> where he behaved himself well.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Affairs of <hi>Agaçaim</hi> grew worse, for fresh Troops of <hi>Melique</hi> resorting thither, <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> was obliged to return to their assistance. At his coming he saw the Enemy was firing <hi>Iohn de Caldas</hi> his House, where he had fortified himself, and <hi>Iames Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez Caldera,</hi> a Soldier well known for his Valour, was let down by a Rope to quench it, as he did. <hi>Freyre</hi> with much difficulty brought off those that were left, and carried them to <hi>Baçaim.</hi> There he landed, and joining the Commander of the Fort, and Men of the Northern and <hi>Diu</hi> Fleets, they pursued a Body of Moors, till it was thought fit to retire, for fear of an Ambush. A few Days after, <hi>Freyre</hi> and the Northern Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron being gone to convoy a Fleet that lay at <hi>Damam</hi> for fear of Pirats, <hi>Andrew Pereyra de Sousa</hi> with three Companies was drawn into an Ambush, and not a Man of them escaped.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Moors at the upper <hi>Chaul</hi> were drawn into the like snare by D. <hi>Emanuel de Azevedo,</hi> Commander of that Place, a Man well skilled in Military Affairs, having gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Experience by several Years Service in <hi>Ceylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Necessities of <hi>Damam,</hi> represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the People and their Commander <hi>Nunno Alvarez Pereyra,</hi> obliged <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> to make some stay there. The Case was, that among other Enemies the King of the <hi>Sarcetas,</hi> who lives in intricate Woods which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54711:628"/>
serve him for defence, had sent out Parties of Horse and Foot which destroyed and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away all they found in the neighbouring Villages. <hi>Freyre</hi> gathering about 200 Men from <hi>Damam, Maim</hi> and <hi>Trapor,</hi> fell upon 600 of the Enemy in their Woods and Works before Day when they were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, slew a great number of them, and retired with a considerable Booty, burning all that could not be carried away. Above 700 of the Enemy pursued him, but not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring come too near, he retired in good Order and got into <hi>Damam</hi> with Honour.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. D. <hi>Henry de Noronna</hi> had detached <hi>George de Castilo</hi> with some small Vessels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Cape <hi>Comori</hi> to convoy the Fleet of <hi>Turocori.</hi> There he discovered a Galliot that carried 170 Moors. <hi>Francis de Soufa Pereyra</hi> with his little Ship in which were but 16 Souldiers bore down upon her, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillo</hi> sends two more to second him, and they discovering some Ships of <hi>Bengala,</hi> leave him to follow them. Those of the Galliot see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our small Vessel forsaken, fire their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non upon her, which killed three of the Men that rowed, and the rest leaped into the Sea. The Moors board her, and all our Men were either killed or taken.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. In <hi>May, Nunno de Cunna</hi> sailed from <hi>Goa</hi> for <hi>Baçaim</hi> to succeed <hi>Ruy Dias de Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payo</hi> as Admiral of the North Sea; his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron consisted of 13 Ships, in which were 400 chosen Souldiers, designed to carry on the War against <hi>Melique,</hi> who was grown strong. By the way he had some Encounters
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54711:628"/>
not considerable enough to be related, and at the City <hi>Galiana</hi> after entring the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Works, taking some Cannon, and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many with the loss of one Man, was forced by a Storm to desist from his Design of burning some small Vessels.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Being at <hi>Baçaim</hi> he kept the Enemy in great awe, notwithstanding they had 400 Horse and as many Foot, whereas we had but 30 Horse and 160 Foot. Several were killed in Skirmishes this Winter, the number of theirs not known, on our side 40. On <hi>All Saints</hi> Day the Enemy came on through a Plain, having to distract us made a feint of coming through the Water. Their Horse having made <hi>Antony Pinto de Fonseca</hi> give way, were bogged, and our Men rally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, killed, and took some, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the rest to flight. <hi>Francis Tavares</hi> who carried <hi>Lope Sarmiento</hi>'s Colours, stripped and wrapped them about his Arm, charging the Enemies with the Spear, till being thrown down he lay upon the Colours, so that they could not be taken from him, but the <hi>Portugueses</hi> coming into his assistance he rose, and tho' the Blood run from him, fell in again among the Moors.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. During all this time the Moors shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such respect to the Christian Churches, as may well confound Christians themselves. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> made use of two Churches dedicated to our B. Lady, putting 50 Men into each, and tho' thence they annoyed the Enemy, yet the Moors never made one shot at them, because some of them had there
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54711:629"/>
recovered their Health, making Vows which they punctually paid.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Continues the Government of the Viceroy D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo,</hi> in the Year 1613.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. IT was the fate of the Fort of <hi>Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baça</hi> to have insolent Commanders. <hi>Emanuel de Melo Pereyra</hi> herein exceeded many of his Predecessors treating the King <hi>Sultan Hazen</hi> with unexpressible disrespect. The chief Promoter of the Disagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Melo</hi> and the King was his Unkle <hi>Munganaje,</hi> an old Man, who, pretending much Zeal for our Affairs, aimed at the Crown. He vented his Malice one day by giving out in the Fort, the King designed to kill them all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Melo</hi> resolved to attack the King's House, but he being sensible how fruitless any excuses would be, fled with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Colours to the Town <hi>Quolifi</hi> of the <hi>Cafres</hi> seven Leagues distant. That People pressed him to reinthrone himself by force, but he several times withstood their Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. At length not able to prevail upon him they marched without him, and entred the Town of the Moors, but they were all retir'd into our Fort. The <hi>Cafres</hi> not thinking
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54711:629"/>
good to assault the Fort, were upon their return, when <hi>Emanuel de Melo,</hi> who obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, pursuing and falling suddenly on them, cut off the best Part. A few days after the King returned to his House, and having excused himself to our Commander thought he was satisfied, but he only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled his Malice, as shall appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Our Fortune in <hi>Pegn</hi> now declined with the same swiftness it had rise, and it was just a wicked encrease should have a sudden detriment. The violence committed by <hi>Philip de Brito Nicote</hi> on the King of <hi>Tangn,</hi> provoked the Anger of the King of <hi>Ova,</hi> under whose Protection he was. Scarce had he heard the News, when casting on the Ground his Gown and Veil, he vowed to the Idol <hi>Biay</hi> of <hi>Degu,</hi> he would not enter within his Gates till this Quarrel was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged. He marched with 120000 Men, having put to Sea 400 Vessels of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble strength, in which were above 6000 of those Moors of noted Valour (called <hi>de Caperuça,</hi> or that wear Caps. All that was without the Walls of <hi>Siriam</hi> he burnt, but met with vigorous opposition at that Place, notwithstanding <hi>Nicote</hi> was quite unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, having suffered most of his Men to go for <hi>India,</hi> and being scarce of Powder, as who had fired the vast quantity of it found at <hi>Tangu.</hi> In this distress he sent a Soldier to buy Powder at <hi>Bengala,</hi> and he run away with the Money; and having sent for some to the Town of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> they
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54711:630"/>
sent him none. Besides, those few <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> that were with him committed such Outrages, Robberies and Murders as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hasten his Ruine.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. For want of Powder there was no firing of Cannon, they poured boiling Pitch and Oil upon the Enemy. His number of Men might suffice, having 100 <hi>Portugueses</hi> and 3000 <hi>Pegues. Nicote</hi> sends out three Ships against the Fleet, in one of them all the Men were slain, the two retired with all theirs wounded. The Enemy began to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the Works, and the Besieged la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured much, but to small purpose. After the Siege had lasted 34 Days, <hi>Nicote</hi> sent to beg Mercy, but was not heard. He thought to prevail by the means of the King of <hi>Tangu</hi> whom he had robbed of his Crown, Riches and Liberty, but the King of <hi>Ova</hi> understood, and was resolved to punish him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The King of <hi>Arraçam</hi> whom he had so grievously offended, sent 50 Sail to his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, which were all taken by the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegers. The King of <hi>Ova</hi> gives an assault, and they fought three days without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; the end of it was, that 700 of the Besieged were slain, one <hi>Banna</hi> whom <hi>Nicote</hi> had always honoured having betrayed him. <hi>Nicote</hi> was taken, carried to the King, and by him ordered to be impaled, and set up in an Eminence above the Fort, that he might the better look to it, as the King said. He lived two Days in that misery. His Wife <hi>De Luisa de Saldanna</hi> was kept 3
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54711:630"/>
Days in the River to be cleansed, because the King designed her for himself, but being brought before, and exclaiming against him, he ordered her Leg to be bored, and that she should be sent to <hi>Ova</hi> among the other Slaves.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Francis-Mendez</hi> and a Nephew of his were treated as <hi>Nicote. Banna</hi> demanding a Reward was soon torn to pieces, the King saying, He could never be true to him that betrayed the Man who so much had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him. <hi>Sebastian Rodriguez</hi> was coop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with a Yoke about his Neck. At first the King designed not to spare any of the Inhabitants of that Place, but growing calm, he sent many Slaves to <hi>Ova.</hi> Then passing by <hi>Martavam</hi> he obliged that King to kill his own Daughter's Husband, because he was <hi>Nicote</hi>'s Son, that none of the Race might remain. This was the end of that Man's Avarice, who being naked a few years before, was raised to be worth 3 Millions; he had one when he went to <hi>Goa,</hi> brought another from <hi>Tangu,</hi> and had got at least another since by Prizes and Trade. The Enemy confessed they lost at that Siege 30000 Men.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But that it may appear that seldom any great Calamity happens without the help of a Woman, it is necessary to show how <hi>Nicote</hi>'s Wife was one of the Principal Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of his Ruin. She entertained one of his Captains as her Gallant, and perceiving the <hi>Portugueses</hi> censured their familiarity, they perswaded <hi>Nicote</hi> he had no need of them,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54711:631"/>
which was the reason they were dismissed, and that the cause of his Ruine.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Our Viceroy understanding the danger of <hi>Siriam,</hi> and thinking to relieve it in time, sent thither <hi>Iames de Mendoça Furtado</hi> with 5 Galliots. He had orders to act something by the way, and endeavour to strengthen himself by the addition of some other Ships and Men, which he effected not till he came to <hi>Martavam,</hi> where in the River he found a Fleet of 20 Sail, which after a sharp En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement fled, except 4 that were taken with some Men, from whom he heard what had happened at <hi>Siriam,</hi> so that there was no need to go farther.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Nor long before this set out from <hi>Goa</hi> for <hi>China Iohn Cayado de Gamboa</hi> with 3 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons, and was to join <hi>Michael de Sousa Pimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,</hi> who was there with 4 others to secure our <hi>China</hi> Trade against the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who were this Year very strong in those Seas. One of the 3 Galleons was cast away near <hi>Sancham</hi> 60 Leagues from <hi>Macao,</hi> the Sea then run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning so high that it drowned several Towns. There were above 200 Men in that Vessel, whereof about 60 <hi>Portugueses</hi> and 80 others escaped. They chose <hi>Gonzalo Machado</hi> a noted Souldier to command them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the good Fortune to be well treated, cloathed and fed by the <hi>Chineses,</hi> came to a City where they were so nobly entertained, they had almost forgot the end of their Voyage. Their common Food was three Pullets a day each, they were feasted on the River in stately Boats like Palaces with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54711:631"/>
Apartments, and garnished with Gold. In fine, on their way thence to <hi>Macao</hi> they were attended as if they had been <hi>Chinese Colaos,</hi> or <hi>Mandarines.</hi> At the Inns they were treated with a sort of Food most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and delicious, which afterwards they were informed was made of Toads and Worms. What chiefly they admired after this Journey was the Chastity of the <hi>Chinese</hi> Women; for tho' they are beautiful, and Beauty be inclined to Wantonness, and though our Men were long among them and familiarly entertained, yet they could never by any means prevail with any of them to yield to their Desires. At <hi>Macao</hi> they found the other two Galleons, which had escaped the Storm, having more Sea room.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Near the end of this Year <hi>Luis de Brito &amp; Melo</hi> entred the Port of <hi>Goa</hi> from Cruizing in the Sea of <hi>Diu,</hi> and brought with him a rich Ship of the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s that came from <hi>Meca.</hi> He took her off of <hi>Suratt,</hi> after a vigorous resistance, in which he lost some Men, and was forced to send to <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> for aid. This provoked the <hi>Mogol</hi> to Besiege <hi>Damam,</hi> and destroy the Country about it. The King of <hi>Decan</hi> did the same about <hi>Chaul</hi> and <hi>Bacaim,</hi> at the Instigation of the <hi>Mogol,</hi> who thought to drive us out of <hi>Asia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. A Letter writ by D. <hi>Luis de Gama</hi> from <hi>Ormuz</hi> with more Passion than Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moved the <hi>Persians</hi> on the other side to gather 300 Barques, in order to take the Port of <hi>Bandel,</hi> and stop the Course of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54711:632"/>
Water that goes to <hi>Ormuz. Ferdinand de Silva</hi> Admiral of that Sea went to quell them, and as he ingaged, his Powder taking fire was blown up. D. <hi>Nunno Alvarez Pereyra</hi> succeeded him, who drove them away with such slaughter, that the <hi>Xa</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi> excused himself to the viceroy, saying, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was made only by the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Lara.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Francis Lopez Calleyros</hi> brought into <hi>Malaca</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Pink, that had taken a rich <hi>Portugues</hi> Ship. The News of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> taking that Prize, was the occasion of his setting out in a Ship of his own with 28 Soldiers.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. This Year expired with great dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in <hi>India</hi> (tho' the like had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other times) for the Ships from <hi>Portugal,</hi> which were expected with impatience, the better to oppose the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> were forced back to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> after having been five Months abroad; they were four.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Azevedo</hi> being come to <hi>Diu.</hi> seized on the Goods of his Predecessor <hi>Sebastian de Macedo,</hi> for the Money he was indebted to the King. Next he resolved to fall upon the People of <hi>Por,</hi> for the Damage the Trade of <hi>Diu</hi> sustained by their means; <hi>Gaspar de Melo &amp; Sampayo</hi> was sent with a Squadron to this Expedition, who came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that City (40 Leagues distant) with much difficulty, because our Vessels could go but one at a time up a narrow Creek that leads to it, and the Enemy pour'd in showers of Bullets and Arrows from the Shore, and from the Bastions, killing 18 of our Men. The Walls were scaled on the one side, whilst our Men entred at a Breach on the other, notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of 4000 resolute Enemies, whereof many were slain, the rest fled, some into the Fields, and others to a Fort standing in the middle of the Town.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Those in the Fort offered Forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns, if we would not batter the Place. It was denied; they attacked to no purpose, and our Men forced to depart with double dissatisfaction, for refusing the offer and suffering the repulse. The City was
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54711:633"/>
plundered, 1000 killed, and 300 taken; the Houses then fired being full of Perfumes cast a delightful smell.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Iames de Vasconcelos</hi> from <hi>Diu</hi> sailed with 9 Ships to the mouth of the River of <hi>Agaçaim,</hi> where 16 Paraos of <hi>Malabars</hi> set upon him. Without the Loss of one Man he slew many, took several Prisoners, and all the Paraos. <hi>Vasconcelos</hi> himself took one of them, thinking their Commander <hi>Porcasse</hi> had been in it, but that Honour fell to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Ferran de Castellobranco.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Ruy Freyre de Andrade</hi> went from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam</hi> to <hi>Chaul,</hi> to succeed in that Command to D. <hi>Emanuel de Azevedo,</hi> who was gone to that of <hi>Diu.</hi> He was ordered by the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy only to secure himself within the Walls, and not attempt any thing abroad, because the Country swarmed with Enemies, and there were but few Men in the Fort. But he training many <hi>Camponeses;</hi> raised new Works, and forced the Enemy to withdraw with great loss.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Gaspar de Melo</hi> now commanded the Northern Squadron consisting of 16 Sail, he went to <hi>Bacaim</hi> understanding there was most need of his Assistance. The posture of our Affairs was much mended by this Relief, the Enemy being kept more in awe, till one day fighting from Sun to Sun, our Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out losing one Man overcame a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Fort of <hi>Manora,</hi> four Leagues from the mouth of the River of <hi>Agaçaim,</hi> being besieged by the <hi>Decariis,</hi> and <hi>Bacaim</hi>
                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:54711:634"/>
in a good Posture, <hi>Gaspar de Melo</hi> resolved to relieve it, and <hi>Antony Pinto</hi> to bear him Company; the chief of their Strength was 700 <hi>Portugueses. Gaspar</hi> one night went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to view the Enemies Camp, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it stronger than he had imagined; when he returned perswaded his Men it was much weaker. He prepared them to fall on before day, which was done so successfully, that some fled at first with the surprize, and many being killed, the rest followed. Thus that Siege was raised without the Loss of one Man.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Hence <hi>Gaspar de Melo</hi> went to <hi>Damam</hi> again infested by the King of the <hi>Sarceta</hi>'s, and in sight of the Enemy cut down their Woods and Orchards, they not daring to oppose him. The heat of the Sun was then so violent, that it caused a Soldier imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to run mad, and died soon after; this was all the Loss sustained by us in that Action.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Then <hi>Melo</hi> returned to <hi>Chaul,</hi> where he found <hi>Ruy Freyre de Andrade</hi> successful over his Enemies. They marched to destroy a Wood near Upper <hi>Chaul,</hi> in defence whereof a great multitude of the Enemy met them, and there ensued an obstinate fight. Here <hi>Melo</hi> forgetting the Duty of a Captain, acted more like a private Soldier, which heat of his <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> did endeavour to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, he now gave the advice he would not afterwards take. They returned victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but not without losing some Men.</p>

12. <hi>Freyre</hi> being left alone, gave Orders to fall upon the Enemy, Captain <hi>Peter Gomes Villano</hi> answered, They had no Men. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing still, he again orders them to fall on, and at the same time received a Musket Shot in his Belly. His Men seeing it, began to give way, but he running forward, cryed out, There is no cause to retire, I am very well; yet for some time his Life was in danger. Here it was he wanted the Advice he gave to <hi>Melo,</hi> yet that Resolution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an honourable Victory.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Melo</hi> again joins <hi>Pinto de Fonseca</hi> at <hi>Bacaim</hi> in order to relieve the Fort of <hi>Assa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,</hi> that high Mountain that overtops the flight of Birds, and is counted impregnable. Tho' the Country swarm'd with Enemies, they conducted 200 Waggons to that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and having relieved it returned in safety.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. We had not the like success at <hi>Diu,</hi> for <hi>Francis Sodre</hi> being sent against the <hi>Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butos</hi> at <hi>Coche</hi> with 300 Men in 13 Ships, behaved himself so indiscreetly, that they slew many of his Men, and forced him to retire to his Ships in haste, but not cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, for he still faced them, and did all that could be expected at such a time.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Our Affairs at <hi>Mombaça</hi> were in a very bad posture, for King <hi>Sultan Hazen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persecuted by his Unkle <hi>Munganaje,</hi> who armed at the Crown, and by the Commander <hi>Emanuel de Melo,</hi> who thirsted after his Riches, was accused of Treason, those being really the Traytors who accused him. His

Then he puts the Government into the Hands of the Traytor <hi>Munganaje,</hi> joining with him <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde,</hi> Brother to the deceased. But he who desired no Colleague, laid Crimes to his Charge, as was done to his Brother, and caused him to be beheaded.

                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Luis de Brito</hi> pursued them to the Fort of <hi>Baroche,</hi> and entring the Port, burnt the Town, and all the Vessels that lay there. As he returned Victorious, discovering the City of the <hi>Resbuto's,</hi> called <hi>Barbute,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to attack it. A great number of them met him, and after a Fight which was long dubious, were defeated with the loss of 450. On our side died one Captain, and four others. The City was burnt, and the Heads of most of the Dead cut off, which were cast ashore near <hi>Surat,</hi> to be seen by the <hi>Moors</hi> of that place.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. At <hi>Bacaim</hi> and <hi>Chaul</hi> there were many Skirmishes, which for brevity are omitted; but many Towns were burnt, much Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der taken, and the Enemy on all sides kept under.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. <hi>Emanuel Mascarennas Homem</hi> succeeded D. <hi>Francis de Meneses Rojo</hi> as General of <hi>Ceylon;</hi> he had Orders to curb the Insolence of the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> well known to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy since he Commanded there, and which did us more hurt than the Enemies Sword.

                     <p n="20">20. The viceroy perceiving that <hi>India</hi> was not in a condition to withstand so great Enemies as was the <hi>Mogol,</hi> and <hi>Xarife Melique</hi> Commander of <hi>Ponda,</hi> and suspecting that <hi>Ibrahim Idalxa</hi> underhand supported him, sent <hi>Antony Monteyro Corte Real,</hi> Embassador to the latter, with a Present for the King, and another for his Favourite.

consequence to our Town of the same Name, which he always coveted, having an Eye upon a Pagod where the ancient Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of <hi>Malabar</hi> used to be Crowned.

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE chief Design of this Squadron, which at <hi>Suratte</hi> joyned those three under <hi>Azevedo, Brito,</hi> and <hi>Almeyda,</hi> was to destroy four <hi>English</hi> Ships that lay in that Port. These Preparations seemed too great for such an Enterprize, but the Event proved the contrary. Being come in sight of the <hi>English,</hi> the Viceroy ordered the two Pinks, the Caravel, and other smaller Vessels, to lay aboard one of the Ships which was separated from the others. Having all grappled, and almost entred her, the other three coming up beat them off. The first three of our Vessels having taken fire, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to burn that of the Enemy, perished, and the <hi>English</hi> escaped. All this day was spent without any Success on our side; and the next nothing was done, because the Ships lay in a hole, where only one of our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons could come at them at once, and so might be one by one disabled by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Cannon. Some said, this was only a pretence of those who had no mind to come at them. It was attempted to burn them with Fireships, but without success.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:54711:638"/>
2. The Viceroy perceiving he only lost his Time there, sailed to <hi>Diu</hi> to send thence Relief to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> having received Advice from D. <hi>Luis de Gama</hi> Commander of that Place, that the Fort of <hi>Comoran</hi> was besieged by a <hi>Persian</hi> Captain of <hi>Xirav</hi> with 14000 Men by Sea and Land. This Siege was laid by order of <hi>Abas Xa</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> on account that <hi>Gama</hi> did not pay him certain Duties due to the King of <hi>Lara,</hi> and the <hi>Persian</hi> was now possessed of that Kingdom. He was glad of this pretence of taking Arms, as desiring to possess himself of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which he thought the Fort of <hi>Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> was a good step. Nor did he miss his aim, for no sooner did the ancient Men of <hi>Ormuz</hi> hear that Fort was delivered, but they concluded this lost. D. <hi>Luis</hi> sent some Succour which hastened the Surrender, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one half of it was cut off, and the rest returned. <hi>Andrew de Quadros</hi> commanded at <hi>Comoran,</hi> he had but few Men, and less Cannon, (for always our Aim was at trade,) and was forced to surrender upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the Enemy never observed. This was done when the Relief of 9 Sail, sent by the Viceroy, arrived under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Michael de Sousa Pimentel,</hi> who having nothing to do there, and to shun the Distasts that happened between him and D. <hi>Luis de Gama,</hi> went away to <hi>Mascate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Viceroy returning with his Fleet from <hi>Diu,</hi> discovered the 4 <hi>English</hi> Ships a great way from <hi>Surat</hi> making all the sail they could, and standing to the Southward.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54711:638"/>
He made the best of his way, and in the afternoon came up alone within Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot of one of them, because his Galleon was a better Sailer than the rest of the Fleet. His Gunner offered to sink her with two 40 Pounders; many opposed it, representing the other 3 Ships would come upon him, and the Fleet being out of sight, the Galleon would be lost, which would be a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, besides the Damage at such a time when the Government was so poor. The Viceroy submitted to their Opinions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obliging them to give it under their hands, thinking they would never deny it, which they did when he was accused for not doing what the Gunner proposed. The <hi>English</hi> returned Thanks for this kindness, firing their Cannon without Ball.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Ships that this Year went from <hi>Portugal,</hi> carried Orders to the Viceroy, to sell all Commands and Employments that would yield Money, there being no other means than to supply the Wants of that Government. This was put in execution, and much resented, for three Reasons; one, That it had never been done before; another, Because many were debarred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Right to those Places they had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by long Service; and the third, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by this means those who had Money, though never so undeserving, would get those Posts.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Ships that this Year sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> for <hi>India,</hi> in which the abovesaid Order went, were four<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> D. <hi>Antony Tello</hi>
                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:54711:639"/>
Captain of one of them being ashore when they set sail, and not able to get aboard, though he followed in another Vessel as far as the Island <hi>Madera,</hi> returned to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and taking with him Captain <hi>Emanuel de Prado de Magallanes,</hi> travelled to <hi>India</hi> by Land, found his Ship there, and returned in her to <hi>Portugal. Francis Lopez Carrasco,</hi> Captain of another of those Ships, was left behind through neglect at <hi>Goa</hi> when the Ships came away, and <hi>Francis de Magallanes</hi> came in his Place. <hi>Iohn Pereyra Cortereal,</hi> a third Captain of the same Ships, returned not without Trouble, which he overcame like a good Commander, for some of his Men mutinying, he with his own hand slew one of them, and caused two to be hanged; for which good Service he was rewarded.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This Year also set out from <hi>Goa</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ship commanded by <hi>Francis de Brito,</hi> which was lost off of the Islands of <hi>Querim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> where and at <hi>Moçambique</hi> the Men were saved with the Fatigues usual in those Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecks.

He went from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> thence to <hi>India,</hi> where he was to receive further Instructions, and 20000 Crowns consigned on the Custom-house of <hi>Ormuz</hi> for his expence, besides what he had before received, because his Equipage was very great. Thus far we had an account of this Embassy; hereafter we shall see that <hi>Ormuz</hi> was lost, which was what the <hi>Persian</hi> coveted; so that it seems the Embassy did not divert him from that Thought.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. DON <hi>Iohn de Silva</hi> commanded for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Manila,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Succors of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> to defend the <hi>Moluco</hi> Islands against the Rebellious <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi> The Viceroy sitted out 4 Galleons for this Expedition under the Command of <hi>Francis de Miranda Enriquez.</hi> It was easie to foresee they would be unfortunate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause most of the Souldiers were Outlaws, Men who have Courage to commit Villanies, but in dangers of Honour are meer Cowards, as has always been found by Experience, and was at this time, for many deserted as soon as they had received their Pay at <hi>Goa,</hi> and many at <hi>Malaca,</hi> the Admiral contrary to his Orders, having touched there.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Between the Islands of <hi>Nicobar</hi> they were some time becalm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Not far from those of <hi>Diu</hi> they met two <hi>Holland</hi> Ships coming from <hi>Paliacate,</hi> our Admiral prepared to fight, and they having made show of stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, after some Cannon-shot exchang'd, stood away. Being pursued very close they threw many Goods overboard to be the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; among other things they cast over some Pigeons, the weight whereof could not much
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54711:640"/>
hinder them, but in the Confusion they knew not what they did. Our Galleons could not make up with them, and in the morning they were not to be seen. It was afterwards known they skulked behind the Island of <hi>Pulopinam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Galleons being in the Road of <hi>Malaca,</hi> the Admiral landed D. <hi>Gonçalo de Silva,</hi> Bishop of that City, whom he carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this intent, and thought to hold on his Voyage, having already been out above 2 Months, and it being about the middle of <hi>Iuly.</hi> Going out of the streight there arose a storm, and the Vice-Admiral springing a Leak, they were forced to put into <hi>Malaca;</hi> where they all stayed, resolving to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Voyage the next Year, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ill Fortune that attended them there.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When they came in, <hi>Iames de Mendoça Furtado,</hi> Commander in Chief by Sea and Land, was ready to set out with 6 Galleons and 12 Jalia's, or small Vessels. They were manned by the Garrison of <hi>Malaca,</hi> and went to meet the Ships that were expected from <hi>China,</hi> and at the same time to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover whether any Fleet of <hi>Achem</hi> appear'd as was reported. They discovered it about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Leagues from the streight; it consisted of above 500 Sail, whereof above 100 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys greater than ours, and above 150 less, yet considerable. The King came himself in this Fleet with his Wives, the best of his Treasure, and 60000 Men. He carried no Colours, but Globes of massy Gold, as was
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54711:641"/>
the Throne whereon he sate. He was four Years in fitting out this Fleet.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Iames de Mendoça Furtado</hi> having well viewed that fleet, designed to fight, and in order thereto called all his Captains to Council; it was resolved he should not fight but return to <hi>Malaca,</hi> which was weak for want of those Men they had drawn out. He stood thither, sending Advice to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons to prepare to fight. The Admiral <hi>Fr. de Miranda Enriquez</hi> received the Advice, and with <hi>Furtado</hi>'s Squadron on the 4th day met that vast Fleet, which was standing for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca.</hi> Both Parties drew themselves into order of Battel, and after Noon <hi>Miranda</hi> began to play his Cannon without losing a Shot, the Enemy stood so thick, and they received all his Fire without making any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, as it were in contempt of him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Furtado</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand de Costa</hi> with their two Galliots attack 7 Galleys; one they boarded and burnt, another was blown up by a Ball that fell into their Powder Room. Several of the Enemymade up to the Galliots, our Galleons move to succour them, and then the whole Enemies Fleet comes on. This was towards Evening when a Storm rising so separated our small Vessels, that they could not join the Galleons till next day at Noon. Being joined they made towards the Enemy, who not regarding them stood in for <hi>Malaca.</hi> Our Galleons being ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, because many of the Men were fled to the Woods, it was found expedient to take
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54711:641"/>
those out of the Galliots who were of try'd Valour. Thus they prepared for Battel, which the Enemy accepted, drawn up in the form of a half Moon. This happened on a <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Afternoon about the middle of <hi>November.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Admiral, and D. <hi>Iohn de Silveyra</hi>'s Galleons were boarded, <hi>Ant. Rodrigues de Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boa</hi> with his Galliot came to assist <hi>Silveyra</hi> his Brother-in-Law, but the Galliot taking fire fired the Galleon, and both perished. There were 50 Men in them, 20 of them died, and the other 30 were taken. The Admiral <hi>Miranda</hi> was three times boarded, and, tho' he had but few Men, still cleared the Decks, killing numbers of the Enemy, and sinking some of their Galleys. Ships were fired on both sides, and the labour to quench them was great especially on our side. The fight lasted till midnight, the flaming Ships and other fires lighted of purpose by the King affording them light.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. In fine, the Admiral's Galleon during this time was attacked by the whole Fleet 14 times, fired 18, and as often quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Men wrapped in wet Blankets rowling themselves in the fire. <hi>Miranda</hi> being struck down by a great Splinter, a Soldier cried out he was killed, but he instantly arose, saying, <hi>I am not dead, here I am alive, fight couragiously my brave Lions, for Heaven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises us a glorious Victory.</hi> The 3 Galleons were in a Line at about a Musket shot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from each other, and for want of Wind the 2 could not come up to succour
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54711:642"/>
the Admiral, against whom the Enemy bent all his Force. Could they have come up, the Enemy had been utterly ruined, for they were so disabled, that they retired towards <hi>Bancales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. Day appearing, and the Enemy gone, our Galleons thought to pursue them but could not. Their Loss was computed to 20000 Men, and 50 Sail of all Sorts. <hi>Iames de Mendoça &amp; Silva</hi> being upon discovery with his small Vessels, found the King had sent out his Boats for Water, he fell in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them and took them all, and 200 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners. The King after this loss asked the Prisoners he had taken, whether an Embassy to treat of their Liberty would be acceptable at <hi>Malaca,</hi> and being by them assured it would, he writ to the Admiral and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Town, affirming our Ships had attacked him without cause, when he was going only to subdue his rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, expressing concern for the loss of our Galleon and Galliot, offering to restore the Prisoners without Ransom, if they sent for them. This King being very subtle and false, it was not fit to give two much Credit to him; yet his Ambassadors were well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and it was answered, that the King's Designs not being known, it could not but he believed he designed against <hi>Malaca.</hi> They sent him all his Subjects taken by <hi>Iames de Mendoça</hi> and a good Present, thanking him for the offer of restoring the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and desiring he would deliver them to him that carried the others. The King being under
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54711:642"/>
sail when our Messenger came to him, said he would answer after he had treated him as became a <hi>Portugues</hi> Ambassador. He had rather have taken his answer there, being suspicious of the King, but was forced to follow. The King being come home, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Embassy friendly, and a Month after dispatched him well satisfied with the Prisoners.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The reason why, as was before hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the 3 Galleons could not pursue the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> Fleet, was because they had advice that 8 Holland Ships were sailing towards <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca. Mendoça</hi> was of opinion to repair to the City for the security thereof, but <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa</hi> was for pursuing the Enemy, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving destroyed them they might retire to <hi>Polubutum</hi> or <hi>Gale;</hi> which would have ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Achem</hi> Fleet, and saved our Galleons which were destroyed afterwards by the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> These drawing near, <hi>Ferdinand de Costa</hi> was for securing the Galleons at <hi>Gale; Miranda</hi> for fighting; and <hi>Furtado</hi> advised to draw the Galleons close to the little Island, so that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> might not pass between them and the Land, so they might do the more Execution, bringing all their Cannon over to one side. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion being approved of, was scarce put in Execution, when the 8 Ships appeared and made at them. Every Ship exceeded each of our Galleons in number of Men and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, able Seamen and Gunners. The order of drawing under the Island was so ill exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> took the Post ours aimed at.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:54711:643"/>
11. The Battel began and continued all that day with equal Loss. Next day one of Galleons, after losing 3 Captains, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torn to pieces even with the superficies of the Water, was quitted by those Men that were left. The 3d day only 10 Men being left in another Galleon, they fired it and got ashore. The Admiral <hi>Miranda</hi> would defend himself, tho' wounded in the Leg, with only 6, but they and a Jesuit by force carried him into the Island, leaving the Galleon on fire. About 200 Men were lost in them all. The loss of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> was considerable, but being Masters of the Sea they sailed to the Mouth of the Streight, to intercept the Ships that were expected from <hi>China,</hi> till understanding that D. <hi>Iohn de Silva,</hi> Governor of <hi>Malina,</hi> was coming that way with his Fleet, they quitted that Sea, which was no small comfort after so great a Loss.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Francis de Miranda Enriquez</hi> went to <hi>Goa,</hi> where he walked upon Crutches, by reason of the hurt received in his Legs when he fought the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> However he was brought to a Tryal, for not sailing directly for <hi>Manila,</hi> according to his Instructions, or not retiring where they might have been secured. In the Conclusion he was cleared, and having behaved himself so bravely, it was but reason he should.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. D. <hi>Iohn de Silva</hi> being informed that the four Galleons could not go to <hi>Manila,</hi> did all that could be expected of a good Commander to join us in order to suppress

the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> He sent Ammunition to our Fleet a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Malaca,</hi> and advice for our Ships to avoid falling into the Enemies hands. But all failed, the advice by the ill Conduct of him that carried it; and the Ammunition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Galleons were lost when it came. Without knowing hereof he put to Sea with 10 strong Galleons, the product of his great Care and Industry. Eight days after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture 6 <hi>Holland</hi> Ships came to the Bay of <hi>Maribeles</hi> and were the first of that Nation that passed the Streights of <hi>Magellan.</hi> Had D. <hi>Iohn</hi> set out 10 days sooner, he had taken the 8 Ships that defeated <hi>Francis de Miranda,</hi> and 10 Days later those other 6. Ships On the Sea of <hi>Pulatinam</hi> he found the Galleon commanded by Captain <hi>Antony Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men de Azevedo</hi> and the Plate Ship coming from <hi>China.</hi> Having passed the Streight of <hi>Singapura,</hi> he left the Galleons with his Vice-Admiral and with two Galleys, he had went himself and convoyed those two Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels to <hi>Malaca.</hi> There he was received un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Canopy with great State, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of Love and Gratitude; there also he soon fell sick in such manner, that the seventh Day were buried with him the great hopes conceived of destroying the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> by his Zeal, Valour and Conduct. The Galleys carrying the Body returned to his Nephew, and the Vice-Admiral and he with them to <hi>Manila.</hi>

The King would not come into our Dominions to swear it, nor would we go into his; those of the King of <hi>Sarceta,</hi> tho' our Enemy, and his Father-in-Law, were agreed upon. <hi>Pinto</hi> came to a Village appointed for this Ceremony with 400 Foot and 50 Horse, and found the King there with 40 of the latter, and 900 of the former. Our Commissioner offer'd his Tent, and the King his, urging his Character. It was accepted to avoid displeasing him. The Quarrel had been about certain Lands the King pretended to, and now quitting his Claim the Peace was solemnly sworn with satisfaction of both Parties. He offered to serve our King with 1000 Foot and 200 Horse, and that his Son should live at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam</hi> to Command a Fleet at Sea.

3. About the middle of <hi>February, Gonzalo Rodriguez de Sonsa</hi> came to the <hi>Moluco</hi> Islands with 6 Galliots of War, and two of Merchants. He was sent by the Viceroy with Succours. D. <hi>Iohn de Silva,</hi> Governor of <hi>Manila,</hi> with his <hi>Spaniards</hi> were then besieged at <hi>Ternate</hi> by 11 <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, <hi>Sousa</hi> in sight of them relieved the Place, and the Besiegers stood away to the Southward. D. <hi>Iohn</hi> ordered two Galleys and a Pink with the Galliots to follow the Enemy, who steered for <hi>Macassa.</hi> These put the Towns of <hi>Arsula Best,</hi> and the greater and lesser <hi>Manciolas</hi> to Fire and Sword. They burnt Ships belonging to the Kings of <hi>Ternate, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quien, Bacham</hi> and <hi>Cacoa,</hi> who favoured the <hi>Holland</hi> Rebels. Landing in the Kingdom of <hi>Corane,</hi> they easily took the chief Fort, the King who was in it flying for shelter to the Woods. Returning aboard, they discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three great Ships in which came the King's Son-in-Law and Grandson to his aid, the latter was taken, the other killed. On the 2d of <hi>April</hi> they arrived at <hi>Macassa,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> such time as the Admiral of the 11 <hi>Hollanders</hi> seen at <hi>Ternate,</hi> was coming into that Port. After half a Day's fight being upon the point of taking her, a sudden Storm parted them. Our Men returned to <hi>Ternate</hi> with Booty, Provisions, and more Ships than they carried out.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In <hi>Ceylon</hi> our Gen. <hi>Em<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mascarennas Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem</hi> marched against <hi>Candea</hi> with 14 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of <hi>Portugueses</hi> of 30 Men each, and the <hi>Dissava's,</hi> or Chiefs of the Natives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Near

the River of <hi>Candea</hi> fell so great a Rain, there was no dry place to lie down, and in the Morning they were all running Blood, being bit by Leeches. It appeared difficult to pass the River being then swelled, but there being 11000 Men there they cut Trees, and laying a Bridge over passed. The <hi>Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galas</hi> began to Skirmish, chiefly at Night, taking the advantage of the Woods. We lost some Men. The like happened at the Entrance into the Kingdom of <hi>Uva.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. They marched to the City <hi>Babule,</hi> Metropolis of that Kingdom, burning all that lay in their way. Three thousand of the Enemy, who lay in Ambush near the City, fell upon <hi>Simon Correa</hi> who led our Van, but 600 Musqueteers charging them, they fled to the Woods, about 40 being killed on both sides. The same happened in the Rear. There being no Plunder in the City it was burnt, and all Fruit-Trees cut down. Our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral spent 3 Months in this Expedition, in <hi>March</hi> returned to <hi>Sofragan,</hi> and thence to <hi>Malvane,</hi> having done the Enemy great harm.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In <hi>August</hi> he sent <hi>Peter Peixoto de Silva,</hi> with 8 Companies to <hi>Tumpane,</hi> another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let into the Kingdom of <hi>Candea</hi> towards the North a League from <hi>Balane.</hi> He spared neither Sex nor Age, for that the <hi>Tumpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenses</hi> had endeavoured to betray us to the Enemy. The Lands of <hi>Archiapato</hi> of <hi>Candea</hi> were burnt; but in a Village they cut off 20 of our Blacks in an Ambush; 25 of them were slain in the same manner on their way
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54711:646"/>
to <hi>Matale.</hi> Near <hi>Matale</hi> 70 more fell of 1500 that came to oppose us, which caused them to quit the Field, and <hi>Peixoto</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Manicravare</hi> with 500 Prisoners, and 2000 Head of Cattle, some of them Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. After this the Dissava <hi>Philip de Oliveyra</hi> had much the same success, making a Road into <hi>Candea</hi> with 10 Companies. The suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, continued as long as <hi>Emanuel Masca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennas Homem</hi> commanded in that Island, which was little above a Year, every one wishing it had been much longer as much in respect of his Valour, as Fortune and Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>

                        <p>Continues the Government of the Viceroy D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo,</hi> in the Year 1615.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. IN the Year 1608 we gave an account of the prodigious rise of <hi>Sebastian Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zales Tibao,</hi> who of a poor seller of Salt in a small Barque the Year 1605, in that of 1608 was become an absolute Sovereign without dependance on any Prince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. It is now time to show the end of such Monsters. This base Man being lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that height, the steps by which he ascended being Treachery and Ingratitude, he now found it was no longer possible to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54711:646"/>
support his Power without some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Succour.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Man, who in his Prosperity forgot to submit himself to the Viceroy, now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the probability of falling, acquaints him with the Danger he is in. He proposes like an absolute Prince, That if the Viceroy will effectually support him, he will become Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to <hi>Portugal,</hi> with the acknowledgment of a Galleon loaden with Rice, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Yearly at <hi>Goa</hi> or <hi>Malaca.</hi> He urged, all had been done by him was to revenge the Murder of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> slaughtered by the King of <hi>Arracam</hi> in <hi>Banguel</hi> of <hi>Dianga;</hi> and (to gain the Viceroy by the hope of Profit) hinted, that the vast Treasure of that King might be taken. This last so blinded the Viceroy, that in stead of abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Villanies of that Wretch, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to assist him, contrary to all Human and Divine Laws.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For this Expedition, the Viceroy fitted out 14 of the largest Galliots, one Flyboat, and a Pink, and gave the Command of them to D. <hi>Francis de Meneses Roxo,</hi> who had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned <hi>Ceylon.</hi> He sailed from <hi>Goa</hi> about the middle of <hi>September</hi> well manned and equipped, but not without much forebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of an unfortunate Event; for as the Viceroy only weighed the prospect of Gain, the People considered the injustice of the Enterprize.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. On the 3d of <hi>October</hi> D. <hi>Franc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54711:647"/>
Galliot with Advice of his coming to <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Gonzales</hi> at <hi>Sundi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>a.</hi> His Instructions being opened before all the Captains, they contained, that he should enter that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without expecting <hi>Sebastian Gonzalez.</hi> It was more reasonable that man should have been expected, as who knew the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and their manner of Fight, besides the Forces he was to bring; but God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the Ruin of that vile Wretch, and of that unjust Succour. On the 15th of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> they discovered coming down the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Fleet so numerous, they could not see the end of it. The foremost was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Pink, and many <hi>Hollanders</hi> commanded other Vessels. All that could be discoverd appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red full of Men, and well equipped, an ill sight for 15 little Ships that expected them; neither were they now 15, for one was gone to <hi>Sundiva;</hi> the Pink was in pursuit of a Ship that fled, and another was gone to fetch the Pink.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Pink fired the first Gun, and then the Fight began furiously, our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liots advancing without any dread of that vast Fleet. Four Galliots got before the others, and in an instant their Captains and many Soldiers were killed, yet the rest were no way dismayed, and the other eight came up, darkening the day with Smoak, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the repeated flashes of Fire. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Enemy were drowned, overset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Vessels through haste to fly from us. The Fight lasted from morning till evening, when the Enemy drew off, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54711:647"/>
some Relief was coming to us, having discovered the Galliot that went to seek the Pink, which they could not find. We lost 25 Men of Note, besides others.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Next morning the Pink came up, aboard him the wounded Men were carried, and such as he had fit for Service taken out. D. <hi>Francis</hi> resolved to lie at the mouth of the River till <hi>Sebastian Gonzalez</hi> came to joyn him, and then again attack the Enemy. At length <hi>Gonzalez</hi> came with 50 Sail well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and equipped, and hearing what was done, railed against the Viceroy for giving such Orders, and against D. <hi>Francis</hi> for obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. About the middle of <hi>November</hi> they sailed up the River, discovered the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vast Fleet riding in a safe Place, and resolved to attack it. D. <hi>Francis</hi> took half <hi>Gonzalez</hi> his Ships, and gave him half those he brought, so they made two equal Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons. They divided themselves and fell on on both sides, firing upon those Vessels they could reach, but none of them advanced. The King from the Shore encouraged his Men, causing the Heads of some that fled to be set upon Spears for a Terror to the rest.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Scarce had our Men time to breath, when a great part of that vast Fleet came down upon them divided into 3 Squadrons. This was at Noon, when the heat of the Sun scorched. <hi>Sebastian Gonzalez</hi> put to flight those that attacked him; our Pink did as much with the <hi>Hollander.</hi> D. <hi>Francis</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and did much harm. The Advantage
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54711:648"/>
was visible on our side, till about Sun-setting our Admiral D. <hi>Francis</hi> was killed by two Musket-Balls, one in the Forehead, the other in the left Eye. A Signal given on Board his Galliot, caused <hi>Sebastian Gonzalez</hi> to cease <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ollowing his good Fortune, and the Tide ebbing, the Fleets parted; but <hi>Gaspar de Abren</hi>'s Galeot being left among the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, all her Men were slain, and the Vessel torn in pieces; yet <hi>Abreu</hi> was brought off by <hi>Antony Carvallo</hi> mortally wounded, and lived some days after.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Our Fleet being come back to the mouth of the River, care was taken of the Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and above 200 Dead were buried in the Sea. The Body of D. <hi>Francis</hi> was embal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. D. <hi>Luis de Azevedo</hi> the Vice-Admiral succeeded in the Command. They all sailed over to <hi>Sundiva,</hi> and D. <hi>Luis</hi> with his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron thence to <hi>Goa,</hi> notwithstanding <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Gonzales</hi> for his own security laboured all he could to keep him there. Not long after the King of <hi>Arracam</hi> falling upon him in his Island, took it, and reduced him to his former miserable condition; so his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty passed like a Shadow, his Pride was humbled, and his Villanies punished. Our Fleet on their return burnt some Ships of the <hi>Moors,</hi> laden with Provisions, upon the Coast of <hi>Paliacate</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> But <hi>Iohn Gomez Paez</hi> fighting with others, had his Galliot blown up, and few Men were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

                        <p>Continues the Government of the Viceroy D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo</hi> this same Year 1615, and that of 1616.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Viceroy fitted out the Squadron for the North, which consisted of 12 Ships, and as many small Vessels, in which were at least 20 Gentlemen of Quality, whom the <hi>Portugueses</hi> call <hi>Fidalgos,</hi> that served as Voluntiers. The Admiral was <hi>Ruy Freyre de Andrade.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Fleet set out about the end of <hi>October. Ruy Freyre</hi> by the way visited the Northern Forts. At <hi>Balcar,</hi> beyond <hi>Surat,</hi> he sent out the Fleet for <hi>Cambaya</hi> under the Convoy of two Ships, giving Advice to the Commander to send away that which was there. As soon as <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> came to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratte, Nababo,</hi> who commanded there for the <hi>Mogol,</hi> sent him two Vessels loaded (as he said) with fresh Provisions, but they were costly Curiosities and Silks. <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> to receive this Message, called all the Captains aboard his Galliot, and before them viewed and commended the Present. That done, he took only one Piece, assuring the Messenger, <q>All must be returned, but that he should be as ready to serve his Master, as if he had
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54711:649"/>
received the whole Present.</q> 
                        <hi>Nababo</hi> much admired this Proceeding, understanding it was <hi>Freyre</hi>'s custom rather to Give than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Piece <hi>Freyre</hi> kept was <hi>Cambolim,</hi> worth about 20 Pardao's. The value of a Pardao is 12 Royals and a half. <hi>Cambolim</hi> is a piece of Stuff the Women wear on their Shoulders like a Veil. The Captain's extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this Action, he said, <q>The <hi>Cambolim</hi> was due to some Lady; that they should agree whose Mistress was handsomest, and it should be given to her.</q> The Price with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dispute was allowed to <hi>

                     <p n="4">4. Whilst the Merchant Fleet stayed at <hi>Cambaya, Freyre</hi> went to visit the Fort of <hi>Diu,</hi> and landed by the way at <hi>Goga,</hi> once a proud City of the <hi>Moors,</hi> but humbled by our Arms the last Year. At the end of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> the Fleet sailed from <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and was the greatest that had been seen in many Years, <hi>Freyre</hi> with his Squadron convoyed it: Near <hi>Damam</hi> there arose such a Storm, that it was a wonder they did not all perish. Two Ships were lost, with all the Men; of another, only one Man was saved; of a fourth, all the Men. What caused most admiration was, that 10 small Boats escaped, which in a calm Sea carried but a span above Water. At length they got into <hi>Bacaim;</hi> 8 Merchant Ships being drove to <hi>Chaul,</hi> met there 4 Parao's of Pirats, who took two of them. <hi>Freyre</hi> caused the Beards of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the other six to be cut off for not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54711:649"/>
following his light. At last he came safe to <hi>Goa</hi> with the Fleet.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. D. <hi>Bernard de Noronna</hi> commanded the Fleet on the Coast of <hi>Malabar. Zamori</hi> had again broke the Peace, and distressed <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganor. Noronna</hi> hasted thither, and cut off all Correspondence between <hi>Zamori</hi> and 3 <hi>Holland</hi> Ships that came into that Sea; and in despight of all the <hi>Nayres</hi> relieved <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganor.</hi> Mean while D. <hi>Henry de Sousa</hi> sent by him with 11 Sail to <hi>Calicut,</hi> burnt there a great Ship belonging to that Emperor, loaded and ready to sail for <hi>Meca.</hi> This done, D. <hi>Bernard</hi> having visited the Forts of <hi>Malabar</hi> and <hi>Canara,</hi> returned to <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. D. <hi>Nunno Alvarez Pereyra</hi> succeeded <hi>Emanuel Mascarennas Homem,</hi> as General of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and made several successful Roads into the Kingdom of <hi>Candea,</hi> bringing thence many Prisoners, and much Cattel. But let us relate a dangerous Commotion that happened in that Island, the Occasion whereof, though it be not new in the World, is one of those that, though often repeated, is still admired, and was thus:</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Some Years before this died <hi>Nicapeti</hi> King of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> who being converted, and having no Issue, made the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> his Heir. At this time there lived in <hi>Ceylon</hi> a poor Fellow called also <hi>Nicapeti:</hi> He ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and gaining admittance to one of the Queens of <hi>Valgameme,</hi> heard somewhat of that Prince called <hi>Nicapeti.</hi> This Fellow being of the same Name, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to represent his Person, and perswade
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54711:650"/>
the People, that he was their Natural Prince come to Life again. He feigns himself a <hi>Iogue,</hi> (that is, the same as an Hermit among us,) and beginning to appear about <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guepore,</hi> gave out, That taking compassion on the Calamities of his Country, he came to free them from the <hi>Portugues</hi> Bondage. He found Credit, and Men flocking to him entred the seven Corla's, when the Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ava <hi>Philip de Oliverae</hi> was absent. At <hi>Matiagama</hi> he slew two Fathers of the Society, in 6 or 7 days was succoured by the King of <hi>Candea</hi> with 2000 Men, and declared King by most of the Country.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. As soon as our General had notice hereof, he sent <hi>Emanuel Cesar</hi> with some Men to quench this Fire before it grew Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterless. <hi>Cesar</hi> meeting him with 6000 Men at <hi>Gandola,</hi> a Village on the River <hi>Laoa,</hi> they ingaged, and <hi>Ferdinand Caldeyra,</hi> who led our Van, going on rashly, was killed, with 10 or 12 Soldiers, and Captain <hi>Gaspar de Antas:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. In the heat of the Battle 1000 <hi>Chinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's,</hi> who served under <hi>Luis Gomez Pinto,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted to the Enemy. At this sight our Men gave themselves for lost, but much more when D. <hi>Constantine</hi> a <hi>Chingala,</hi> but Subject of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and of the Royal Blood, step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping forward, cried aloud, <hi>Whither do you fly, my Friends? If you look for your Natural King, here am I, who by seven several Branches am descended from them.</hi> In a moment they all turned to, and proclaimed him King, and he made use of this opportunity to reduce
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54711:650"/>
them that had revolted from us. After a long Dispute, the Enemy fled over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Next morning our Men passed over, and meeting no Enemy, stayed there for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Intelligence.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. In the mean while <hi>Philip de Oliveyra</hi> returned from <hi>Candea,</hi> having heard of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeti</hi>'s Attempt, but not of our Victory. There was then a considerable number of <hi>Chingala's</hi> who served under him; to incite these to rebel one came, and from the top of a Mountain admonished them to forsake the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and follow their Natural Prince. This caused much disorder among the Men, and next day <hi>Oliveyra</hi> marching on, came to the Field of the late Battle, and finding above 1000 slain, could not discover who had gained that Victory. On a Tree was seen an Inscription, signifying that all <hi>Portugueses</hi> were slain, no body of them left in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and that <hi>Columbo</hi> was surrendred. This startled the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and not a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced the <hi>Lascarines,</hi> (the <hi>Chingala's</hi> that serve among us are so called,) who were 800 in number.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. As <hi>Philip de Oliveyra</hi> continued his march, 300 Men attacked his Rear, but as soon as he faced them, fled. <hi>Nyhe</hi> came upon him near the River <hi>Laoa,</hi> he sent to <hi>Emanuel Cesar</hi> and they joyned, which made the Revolters fly to the Woods. They two agreed to take all the Women and Children of some Villages, hoping by that means to reduce the <hi>Chingala's</hi> that were in Arms. <hi>Oliveyra</hi> took above 400; the same night the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54711:651"/>
800 <hi>Lascarines</hi> deserted with their Arms, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Portugueses</hi> alone, who were not above 200. These marched 5 Leagues to the Pagod called <hi>Atanagale,</hi> near <hi>Maluana,</hi> where the General resided, who sent them 500 Men, 200 whereof were <hi>Portugueses.</hi> He ordered D. <hi>Emanuel de Castro</hi> to take care of Provisions and Ammunition, having made D. <hi>Constantine Dissava</hi> of the <hi>Corlas,</hi> (this was the <hi>Chingala,</hi> who, as was above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, brought back those who fled from us,) in stead of D. <hi>Philip de Oliveyra,</hi> wrongfully punishing him for the desertion of the 800 <hi>Lascarines.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>NIcapeti,</hi> like an absolute King, bestowed Imployments and Lands, having gathered an Army of 24000 Men, with which he marched towards <hi>Columbo;</hi> so vain, that half a League from that Town on the Banks of the River <hi>Nacolega,</hi> he would be proclaimed Emperor of <hi>Ceylon.</hi> He sent to the King of <hi>Candea</hi> to send him one of his two Wives, who answered, <hi>It should be done when the Portugueses were subdued. Nicapeti,</hi> in a Rage at this Answer, threatned to use
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54711:651"/>
that King like the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> Those 2000 Men, sent by him to <hi>Nicapeti</hi>'s assistance, hearing these Threats, deserted him, and returned home. This set those two Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of ours at variance, and was no small help to our Affairs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The two Commanders, <hi>Emanuel Cesar</hi> and D. <hi>Constantine,</hi> being joyned, they marched towards <hi>Nicapeti,</hi> and found the way he was to come very clean, and strewed with Flowers. A <hi>Chingala</hi> carried <hi>Nicapeti</hi> the News of our approach, who caused him to be impaled, saying, <hi>There were no Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses left in Ceylon.</hi> He was soon undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the two Vanguards coming in sight of each other. <hi>Nicapeti</hi> instantly possesses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of a Hill, and intrenches with 7000 Men. Our Van attacks and enters his Works, kill 1000 of his Men, and force him, laying aside the Regal Ornaments, to fly to the Woods. We lost only an Ensign. The other part of the Enemies Army seeing this defeated, fled over the River <hi>Laoa.</hi> Night coming on, our Men rested there, and in the morning found themselves strengthen'd by 500 <hi>Chingala's,</hi> who had deserted from the Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. At this time a <hi>Chingala,</hi> who had been a Christian, and Follower of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> by the Name of <hi>Antony Barreto,</hi> served the King of <hi>Candea.</hi> Though of base Birth, his Valour advanced him to be General of that King's Forces, with the Title of, <hi>Prince and Governour of the Kingdom of</hi> Uva. This Man laying hold of the opportunity of <hi>Nicapeti</hi>'s
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54711:652"/>
Revolt, came with a considerable Power to seize our Fort of <hi>Sofragan. Barreto</hi> counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting Friendship, drew our Men, which were but 60, under two Captains, <hi>Faria</hi> and <hi>Matoso,</hi> to a Conference, and treacherously slew most of them. Those that escaped retired to a Church, where want of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition obliged them to surrender, and they were carried to the King of <hi>Candea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. This misfortune was justly due to those <hi>Portugueses</hi> for murdering an Embassadour sent by that King to Treat of an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, that they might joyntly carry on the War against <hi>Nicapeti.</hi> The King, who might justly have put to death <hi>Faria</hi> and his Men in Revenge for his Ambassadour, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them courteously. He sent two of them to <hi>Balane,</hi> to advise our Garison there to deliver that Place to him, being distressed by <hi>Nicapeti;</hi> they went, and having advised the contrary, returned into Slavery.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The King being informed by these Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, that those of <hi>Balane</hi> would not s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Our Commander <hi>Emanuel Falcam</hi> held out some days, but seeing 6 <hi>Portugueses</hi> had deserted, and there was no hope of Relief, was forced to Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate. The King treated him and his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they deserved He was so desirous of Peace, that he presently sent an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour to Treat thereof with our General D. <hi>Nunno Alvarez Pereyra,</hi> but the Success of that Negotiation belongs to the next Year.</p>

6. An Embassy came to <hi>Goa</hi> from the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> acknowledging the Favours received of the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> The Heads of the Message were, that he had received a Letter from <hi>Iames de Mendoça,</hi> who stayed not for the Answer, that he offered the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> the Port of <hi>Martavam</hi> to build a Fort there; that he would maintain the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison and a small Fleet to Cruize on that Sea against the King of <hi>Dua.</hi> The Ambassadors were splendidly entertained, and F. <hi>Francis</hi> of the Annunciation, a Dominican, sent along with them with the same Character. He set out the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> with a costly Present for the King. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Ambassador with great Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who proposed to him how ambitious the <hi>Portugueses</hi> were of his Friendship, that they should both join their Forces to subdue the King of <hi>Ava,</hi> that there should be a free Trade between <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>Malaca;</hi> that he should not admit the <hi>Hollanders</hi> into his Country.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The King answer'd, That the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> Merchants might freely resort to his Ports and be exempt from all Duties, and his Subjects should Trade to <hi>Malaca;</hi> that the reason they had not done it of late was the ill usage they found there, whereof he gave good Instances; that he had admitted the <hi>English, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Malayes</hi> into his Ports for the great respect they showed him, and the need he had of them; that he had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the <hi>Portugueses</hi> against the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> that he was no way concerned for the harm
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54711:653"/>
those of <hi>Malaca</hi> had done the Queen of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> because she was a Madwoman, but she being now dead he had placed one of more Sense there, and desired there might be free Trade with her as well as with <hi>Siam;</hi> that the Goods of such <hi>Portugueses</hi> as died in his Dominions should go to their Heirs; that he had ordered all <hi>Portugueses</hi> who committed any Crimes, should be tried at his Court, to prevent any wrong being done them by the prejudice of Magistrates. Thus our Ambassador was answered and dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the King sent with him two <hi>Siam</hi> Gentlemen, to go his Ambassadors into <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. There were great Complaints against the Commander of <hi>Moçambique Ruy de Melo &amp; Sampayo,</hi> for that he robbed the Natives, and did not pay the Soldiers, having pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately strangled some of them, which caused a Mutiny. <hi>Francis de Fonseca Pinto</hi> was sent from <hi>Goa</hi> to regulate these Disorders. With him went <hi>Salvador Vaz de Gama</hi> to succeed <hi>Melo,</hi> in case he were found Guilty. <hi>Melo</hi>'s Conscience accusing him, he refused to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Judge, who resolved to return to <hi>Goa,</hi> but hearing that <hi>Melo</hi> had left open a Wicket of the Fort, he rush'd in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing him, gave the Command to <hi>Guerra,</hi> contrary to what the Viceroy had ordered. He was also to Victual the Fort at <hi>Tete,</hi> and furnish it with Cloth, that Fort being main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to continue the discovery of the Mines of <hi>Monomatapa,</hi> which gave great hopes of Profit. But before we relate what
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54711:653"/>
happened at this time, let us refresh the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of what was before.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. In the 10th Chap. of the 3d Part of the 2d Vol. we gave some account of what was acted by some of our Commanders in these Parts. <hi>Chunzo</hi> a powerful King rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Emperor of <hi>Monomotapa,</hi> and was subdued by the assistance of the <hi>Portugueses;</hi> so other Rebels. To gratifie these Favours he for ever gave all his Mines to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> making a resignation of them to <hi>Iames Simoens Madera,</hi> Commander of <hi>Tete,</hi> who was then in his Service. The substance of the Instrument was, That he gave all his Mines of Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Iron, Lead, to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he should support him in his Throne; That the King should admit of him as his Brother; That the next Year he would send his Son with an Ambassador to <hi>Goa;</hi> That he had put two Sons, and would soon two Daughters, into the Custody of <hi>Iames Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moens</hi> to be bred Christians. The Emperor ordered <hi>Simoens</hi> to have an Instrument made hereof; and he asking how he would Sign it, since in his Empire none could write, the Emperor made three Crosses on the Ground, one under the other, and said, he would sign it that way, which accordingly he did.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. This done, <hi>Simoens</hi> with his Men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the Emperor who was marching towards <hi>Ancone</hi> that was in Rebellion. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spar Pereyra Cabral</hi> being left behind wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was carried by <hi>Cafres,</hi> who run away from him. <hi>Simoens</hi> understanding it, went
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54711:654"/>
back with one Slave, and helped to carry him on his own back. An Act worthy of memory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from a Captain to a Souldier. The Rebel being subdued, <hi>Simoens</hi> returned to <hi>Tete</hi> with the Emporor's two Sons. They were baptized by the Names of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iames.</hi> The latter remained there, the other went back to his Father.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Emperor thinking he could now overcome his Enemies without the assistance of <hi>Portugueses,</hi> marched to the Kingdom of <hi>Baroe,</hi> and was there defeated; at <hi>Mongas</hi> he had a Son killed, and <hi>Matuzianne</hi> usurped the whole Empire. <hi>Iames Simoens</hi> restored him, and possessed himself of <hi>Chicova. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuzianne</hi> raising new Forces was defeated and killed by the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> D. <hi>Stephen de Ataide</hi> raised a Fort at <hi>Massapa,</hi> and gave that Command to <hi>Iames Carvallo,</hi> whom he sent to <hi>Monomotapa</hi> with a present to obtain the Delivery of the Mines.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Carvallo</hi> went and told the Emperor he had a great Present, but gave him none; and he seeing the <hi>Portugueses</hi> entred his Lands for Gold without his consent, caused all they had to be taken from them, and many to be killed. <hi>Carvallo</hi> had with him some Forces belonging to the Emperor, with whose assistance he curbed the Robbers of <hi>Quizinga,</hi> and supported himself. He resolved to revenge the spoiling of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> by a horrid Treachery against those that served him, for joining with the <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinga</hi>'s, he one Night fell upon the <hi>Cafres,</hi> and killing many put the rest to flight, who
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54711:654"/>
justly cursed the falseness of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Carvallo</hi> fearful of his own Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, abandoned the Fort of <hi>Massapa</hi> and went to <hi>Tete,</hi> leaving all the Country in Arms against the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> All he acted was by order of D. <hi>Stephen de Ataide,</hi> who, in stead of appeasing the Emperor, threatned him with War. He sent out from <hi>Sena,</hi> and by his order <hi>Carvallo</hi> raised another Fort on the Banks of <hi>Zambeze,</hi> two days Journey from <hi>Tete. Iames Simoens Madera</hi> was left to Command at <hi>Tete,</hi> because <hi>Ataide</hi> returned to <hi>Moçambique,</hi> hearing the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were coming thither. D. <hi>Stephen</hi> perceiving no <hi>Dutch</hi> appeared in 6 months, returned to <hi>Tete.</hi> The Emperor sent to offer him <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cova</hi> if he would send the ordinary Present, which was a Debt, and no Gift. D. <hi>Stephen</hi> would not so much as hear the Embassadors, refusing to give a Present of 5000 Crowns, which might have saved much greater Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for above 30000 were already lost at <hi>Massapa</hi> to no purpose.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. D. <hi>Stephen</hi> set forward with 150 Men, but being better advised, expected News from <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> In <hi>Iuly</hi> he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King's Orders to go to <hi>Goa,</hi> and give the Command of <hi>Tete</hi> to <hi>Iames Simoens,</hi> and that of <hi>Moçambique</hi> to D. <hi>Iohn de Ataide</hi> the Viceroy's Brother. D. <hi>Stephen</hi> obeyed against his Will, leaving <hi>Simoens</hi> 140 Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers without any thing to maintain them in that dangerous Conquest. However <hi>Simoens</hi> made the best on't, and resolved to proceed,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54711:655"/>
beginning with <hi>Chombe</hi> a powerful <hi>Cafre,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of him what he owed as our Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary, and the Restitution of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> he had. Some infamous <hi>Portugueses</hi> advised <hi>Chombe</hi> to take no notice of <hi>Simoens,</hi> because he could do him no harm. This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that King first to slight, and then to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest him in the Vessels wherein he sailed for <hi>Tete. Simoens</hi> landing drove the <hi>Cafres</hi> so, that they troubled him no more.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>JAmes Simoens Madera</hi> raising 6000 <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fres,</hi> marched with them and his <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> against <hi>Chombe</hi> at the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> One night they heard a Voice that said, <hi>Chombe rejoyces at your coming, and desires you will make haste, for he is hungry, and expects to feast upon your Bodies. Simoens</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on, and fortified himself close under the Enemies Works, which were half a League in length, and in breadth propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, furnished with 8000 Men. <hi>Simoens</hi> attacks them twice, but to no effect. Next night a <hi>Cafre</hi> fled to the Enemy, and from them a Christian Black Woman to us with Advice, That <hi>Chombe</hi> would fall upon our
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54711:655"/>
Men before day. <hi>Simoens</hi> expected them with silence, and killing 1000, put the rest to flight.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Enemy proposes a Peace, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is concluded. <hi>Simoens</hi> attempts their Works, but without success; he sends to the Commander of <hi>Senna</hi> for Succour, who sends him 40 <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and 3000 <hi>Cafres.</hi> The Works were again assaulted in vain; soon after some Deserters informed, the Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was weakest on the side of a Lake. Here the Assault was renewed, the Works entred, <hi>Chombe</hi> put to flight, and the Place given to <hi>Quitamho</hi> a <hi>Cafre,</hi> who faithfully served us, on condition to pay what <hi>Chombe</hi> had denied.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Iames Simoens</hi> was now bent upon the Conquest of the Silver Mines in <hi>Chicova.</hi> The Emperor sent to acquaint him, <q>He again resigned those Mines to him, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he should not go thither with an Armed Power.</q> 
                        <hi>Simoens</hi> desired, he would send one to put him in Possession thereof, and to receive Cloth to the value of 4000 Ducats he had to present him. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was satisfied, and <hi>Simoens,</hi> with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of all the <hi>Cafres,</hi> took possession of <hi>Chicova</hi> on the 8th of <hi>May,</hi> 1614. being put into it by <hi>Onanxangue</hi> a great Man, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to the Emperor. The first thing he did was to raise a Fort there; the next, to joyn Friendship with a powerful <hi>Cafre</hi> called <hi>Sapoe,</hi> and his Country <hi>Borore.</hi>
                     </p>

4. The Lord of <hi>Chicova,</hi> now subject to the <hi>Portugueses</hi> by virtue of the Emperor's Resignation, withdrew himself from them; so that Complaint was made thereof to the Emperor, who gave leave to Depose him, and put another in his Place, sending a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre</hi> called <hi>Cherema</hi> to shew the Mines. This Man twice deceived <hi>Simoens,</hi> causing him to dig in Places where he had hid some Ore, for which reason he was confined; and then shewed another place, of which some hope was conceived, he excusing himself what was done had been by the Emperor's Order. Nevertheless <hi>Simoens</hi> sent him a Present; he detained the Messengers, and sent word, <q>He would have Needles, Pins, Knives, Looking-Glasses, Candles, Soap, Zafran, Pepper, and some rich Silks.</q> He repented the giving of <hi>Chicova,</hi> and sought occasion of Disagreement, thinking that <hi>Simoens</hi> could not send what he damanded. But he sending all things, the Emperor seemed satisfied.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That D. <hi>Philip</hi> the Emperor's Son, whom <hi>Iames Simoens</hi> caused to be Baptized, attempted several times to make his escape to the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and was taken; at length he got to the Fort of <hi>Chicova,</hi> and was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received. Hearing there that <hi>Chirema</hi> was fled to avoid discovering the Mines, he sent for him, pretending to be sent Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador by his Father, and having rebuked and secured him, went himself to <hi>Tete.</hi> The Emperor hearing hereof, proffered great Rewards to any would kill his Son. At the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54711:656"/>
same time it fell out, that a Soldier gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some Fruit, the Son of the Owner, who was a powerful Man, forbid him; the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier complains to his Captain <hi>Iames Teyxera Barroso,</hi> who without farther examination shot the young Man. The Father, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of his Son's Death, did the <hi>Portugueses</hi> much harm; and the Emperor declared War, because they entertained his Son against his will.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In <hi>March,</hi> 1615. 10000 <hi>Cafres</hi> assault the Fort, but were forced thence with great loss, <hi>Iames Simoens</hi> coming in time with Succour. The Country being clear, <hi>Simoens</hi> sent some Men with <hi>Cherema</hi> to discover the Mines; after some days digging they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Ore, whereof one half was pure Metal, and some scarce wanted casting. It appeared to be no cheat, some being grown into the Roots of a Tree.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Our Commander being assured there were rich Silver Mines, resolved to send three great clods of Ore for a Proof to <hi>Spain.</hi> The Messengers and Ore were received with great joy at <hi>Madrid. Gaspar Bocarro</hi> was so ambitious of carrying this News, that after the others were gone, he gave 2000 Ducats to purchase the Employ, and offered to go by Land at his own Expence; but he ended his days at <hi>Moçambique.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. The excessive Heat caused a Sickness in the Fort of <hi>Chicova,</hi> whereof the Soldiers died in 3 or 4 days. Next followed a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which gave occasion to the <hi>Cafres,</hi> who served the Fort and dug in the Mines,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:54711:657"/>
to run away, so that there was no Silver to buy Cloth, and consequently no Cloth to purchase Provisions with at <hi>Sape,</hi> it being the only Coin that passed there. <hi>Iames Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moens</hi> had acquainted the Viceroy, That Conquest could not be maintained without Relief. The chief Sustenance of that Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison for some days was a small Fruit, so harsh they could not swallow it, unless rowled in Ashes.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Supplies were sent by the Viceroy to <hi>Moçambique,</hi> but never reached <hi>Chicova,</hi> which thereupon was abandoned. The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Lawyer <hi>Francis de Fonseca Pinto,</hi> to whom the Viceroy had given the whole Charge of the Affair, bore to <hi>Iames Simoens,</hi> was the cause he was not Relieved, and that important Place lost.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. This is that <hi>Francis de Fonseca Pinto,</hi> who (as was said before) took the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Moçambique</hi> from <hi>Ruy de Melo &amp; Sampayo,</hi> and had all Necessaries for <hi>Chico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> as well of Provisions as Tools to work in the Mines. But his hatred to <hi>Simoens</hi> diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him from sending those Succors; besides, he sold all that was to relieve that Place, and converted it to his own use, and seized upon <hi>Ruy de Melo</hi>'s Effects. <hi>Iames Simoens</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him by Letters for Relief, in his last pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing with all his Men, <q>If the Place were lost, the fault would lie upon him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. All the Answer that insolent Fellow returned, was putting <hi>Simoens</hi> his Nephew, sent to conduct him, in Irons. Then he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred his Lands, and destroyed all that was
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54711:657"/>
there, selling his Slaves; he forbid the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants on pain of Death corresponding with, or relieving those of <hi>Chicova,</hi> and sent word to the Emperor, that he might freely kill <hi>Simoens,</hi> for entring his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions without Orders from the Viceroy. Not satisfied to procure his Ruin by those means, he marched towards <hi>Chicova</hi> with intention to murder him. <hi>Simoens</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it withdrew thence, and <hi>Pinto</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, though so near, would not relieve the Fort, not examine the Mines as he had in Orders, but returned hastily to <hi>Tete,</hi> fearing <hi>Iames Simoens</hi> should meet him. But going back to the Fort, caused the Notary to draw an Instrument, containing the Causes why that Fort was abandoned, to which they all signed. This done, they marched with their Women and Children towards <hi>Tete.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. Weakness caused them to march very slow, and two Soldiers fell dead for want. At <hi>Marenga, Simoens</hi> received a Summons from <hi>Pinto,</hi> to appear before him at <hi>Tete</hi> in 9 Days to answer for himself. But knowing now he had quitted the Fort, sent 2000 <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fres</hi> commanded by a <hi>Portugues</hi> to murder him; they, tho' the opportunity was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, would not do it. <hi>Simoens</hi> stayed in the Country of <hi>Inambanzo</hi> which was his own, and all the Company went to <hi>Tete.</hi> There <hi>Pinto</hi> inquired of them, whether there were any Mines at <hi>Chicova,</hi> they all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mousl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> answered there were. But he in hatred to <hi>Simoens</hi> desiring to conceal them, with
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54711:658"/>
Threats and Rewards prevailed with each of them single to swear there were none. Then he gave Sentence against <hi>Simoens</hi> for abandoning the Fort, not considering if there were no Mines there (as he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to made out) it was no Crime, and that if any fault were it was his own, since the other held it longer than could be required.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. This done <hi>Pinto</hi> Promises the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror a considerable Present, if he would fall upon <hi>Simoens</hi> at <hi>Inambanzo.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror not only expelled <hi>Simoens</hi> those Lands, but so distressed <hi>Tete,</hi> that they were forced to make up the Present promised by <hi>Pinto,</hi> to buy his absence, the Emperor positively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it at their hands. <hi>Iames Simoens</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards returned to <hi>Tete,</hi> being utterly ruined by his good Service, and <hi>Pinto</hi> who had ruined all was enriched by his Villanies and Rapine. This is what happened about the Mines of <hi>Monomotapa.</hi> I will only add that the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander there, <hi>Francis Barreto,</hi> was undone by a Divine, and now <hi>Iames Simoens</hi> the last by a Lawyer; and the King, by employing such Gownmen in things they understand not, lost the great Advantages might be expected from those Mines.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Inhabitants of the City <hi>Meliapor,</hi> commonly called St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> were all divided, killing one another without any regard of Human or Divine Laws, or any Shame, that even the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> abominated their Wickedness. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was what they call Points of Honour. To appease these Disorders, the Viceroy sent <hi>Ruy Diaz de Sampayo</hi> with 7 Sail, and 250 Soldiers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Ruy Diaz</hi> performed all that was given in Charge to him, and having reconciled the Citizens of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> sent 6 of his Ships to scour the Coast of <hi>Carriero</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Peter Gomez de Sousa,</hi> a Man more couragious than discreet.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54711:659"/>
what was done by our Men, had gathered 600 Moors, and lay in Ambush to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Peter Gomez</hi> would suffer himself to be deceived by this Messenger.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Peter Gomez,</hi> though warned that all this was Treachery, gave Credit to the Moor, followed him a League, and there fell into the Ambush, where he and all his Captains, save one that was left at St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> with 130 <hi>Portugueses</hi> were all slain, 25 taken, and only 30 escaped by flight: 186 <hi>Indians</hi> were killed in the Action.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Ioseph Pereyra de Sampayo,</hi> who was left Prisoner by <hi>Peter Gomez,</hi> carried the remainder of the Men and Ships to S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> The <hi>Moors</hi> sent the <hi>Portugueses</hi> they had taken to the King of <hi>Goloconda,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to F. <hi>Bartholomew Dias,</hi> sent to him by the Bishop of <hi>Meliapor,</hi> that the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> should enter his Country in hostil man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at the same time they treated amicably with him. The King admitted the weak excuse, that it was not done by order of the Government, and delivered the Prisoners upon condition those of <hi>Montepoli</hi> should be restored.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. D <hi>Emanuel de Meneses</hi> sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> with 3 Ships for <hi>India,</hi> one of them springing a Leake was forced to put into the Port again; another arrived safe at <hi>Goa,</hi> after being parted from D <hi>Emanuel</hi> by a Storm on the Coast of <hi>Guinea.</hi> D. <hi>Emanuel</hi> near the Island of <hi>Madagascar</hi> met 4 <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Ships, the Commander of them sent to order our Captain aboard, who refused,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54711:659"/>
but sent an Understanding Man to view their Strength, and he returning said publickly, that the Enemy's Admiral alone was too strong for our Ship. D. <hi>Emanuel</hi> taking him aside, blamed his Indiscretion for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartning the Men; then he sent word to the <hi>English,</hi> that since their Kings were at Peace, there was no reason the Subjects should break it; that they should bear off, and not come a head of him. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the least of the 4 did, he fired at her, and then all the 4 at him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Night came on, our Ship held her Course, and in the Morning found her self among some Islands near the Head of that called <hi>Mannoto.</hi> The Enemy coming on, and the Wind calming, we were forced to engage, our Vessel was soon unmasted, and made the best it could for the Island <hi>Anga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giza.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> sent to tell D. <hi>Emanuel</hi> he was running to his Ruine; that if he would surrender himself, all the Men should be landed at <hi>Suratte,</hi> whence they might travel by Land to <hi>Goa;</hi> he answered, if any more such Message were sent him, he would hang him that carried it. The Ship driving towards the Shore with the Tide, stuck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Rocks, which proved the saving of all the Men, who got ashore leaping a narrow Gut, into which many fell for haste.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. As soon as landed, the <hi>Cafres</hi> received them with showers of Stones. They were appeased with some Gifts, and the help of some Musket Balls let fly among them by <hi>Ioseph Alvarez Torres,</hi> who (though it was
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54711:660"/>
plain their Safety consisted in their Arms) advised they should be cast into the Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Cafres</hi> would not furnish them with Provisions as long as they were armed. D. <hi>Emanuel</hi> consented, and scarce were they seen next day unarmed, when the <hi>Cafres</hi> stripped them even of their Shirts. Some travelled up the Country, and others along the Shore; the latter in two Days found no Water to drink, were consumed with the heat of the Sun, and some died for want.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The 3d Day they met other <hi>Cafres,</hi> who seeing nothing to take from them, gave them Milk and Water with Signs of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion. <hi>Sebastian Prestes,</hi> the Pilot of the Ship, attempted to save himself with a few Men in the Boat, and coasting along the Island, met <hi>Chande</hi> a Noble Moor of <hi>Pate,</hi> who was sailing for the Island <hi>Madagascar</hi> with two <hi>Pangayos.</hi> He told the Pilot that King was his Friend, and for his sake would use them all well. The Pilot sent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint D. <hi>Emanuel,</hi> and it appeared those <hi>Cafres</hi> with whom he was, were that King's Subjects. They all came to the Port, and the Moor gave each of them a Cloath to cover his Nakedness. Here it appeared how little the <hi>Cafres</hi> esteem what we most value, they gave many Pieces of Eight for a Rag scarce worth a Farthing, and fetching Bags full of Money out of the Ship, scattered it about the Rocks, and putting their Heads into the Bags were very well pleased.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. It may well be doubted whether a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugues</hi> would have done with 600 Moors, as
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54711:660"/>
this Moor did with 600 <hi>Portugueses</hi> in that miserable Condition. He maintained them, gave them Cloaths, which sold to the <hi>Cafres</hi> had been worth much Money; justly resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them Jewels of great value wherewith they entrusted him, and gave them his two Pangayos to go over to <hi>Mombaça.</hi> They arrived thither on the 4th of <hi>September,</hi> and were maintained and clothed by the Charity of that little Town. On the 10th of that Month they Embarqued, and arrived safe at <hi>Goa.</hi> The Viceroy sent Presents to D. <hi>Emanuel de Meneses,</hi> and comforted him for his Loss. D. <hi>Hierome Manuel,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the homeward bound Ships about the Islands of <hi>Flores</hi> fought with 4 Pirats, and put into the Island <hi>Tercera,</hi> whence he came to <hi>Portugal</hi> with the Ship that was put back the Year before.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Trade of the Port of <hi>Soar</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia</hi> much lessened the Customs of <hi>Ormuz</hi> and <hi>Mascate.</hi> To remedy this the Viceroy sent D. <hi>Francis Rolim</hi> with a Galley and five other Vessels, who joined D. <hi>Vasco de Gama</hi> Admiral of that Sea with five Sail more at <hi>Mascate. Amer,</hi> Head of a Hord of <hi>Arabs,</hi> to revenge himself upon <hi>Mahomet</hi> King of <hi>Soar,</hi> took part with us, and marched by Land with 1200 Men. Our Men landed, and possessed themselves of some Mosques to secure themselves till the Cannon was set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. A Fort on a Hill was first attacked, but so well defended it could not be entred that Day, tho' <hi>Mahomet</hi> who commanded it
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54711:661"/>
was killed with a Musket-Ball. We lost a Captain and 6 Men. In the Morning the Trenches were entred, then a Mosque, and lastly a Town, where many Women and Children were made Prisoners, and much Booty found. In this Action we lost 6 Men more. The Fort not able to hold out for want of Men surrendred; and the King's Brother being taken, was put to Death Our Men violated the Articles they had made, killing and plundering many of them that marched out. And having agreed with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> that there should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>e no Prisoners made, yet they took several Girls on pretence of Breeding them Christians, as if that were an excuse for Breach for Faith. <hi>Iohn de Sousa</hi> was left to Command that Fort, and <hi>Antony Pimenta</hi> joined with him, as skilled in the Affairs of that Country.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. At <hi>Cananor</hi> happened an accident sad enough, and yet ridiculous. The <hi>Nayres</hi> show no Mercy to a Thief, tho' the thing stolen be of no value. They impale the Criminal, and leave him to be eaten by the Birds. An <hi>Indian</hi> that was turned Christian stole a Knife, the <hi>Nayres</hi> apprehended him, and sent to acquaint the Judge of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> at <hi>Cananor.</hi> He returned answer, they should kill him. They instantly cut off his Head, thinking it was a piece of Civility, being he was a Christian, to kill him our way. Our Commander, <hi>Nicholas Soveral,</hi> sent some Soldiers to fetch the Body, and revenge his Death on the <hi>Nayres,</hi> as if they had not obtained leave for what they did.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54711:661"/>
The Soldiers killed a <hi>Nayre,</hi> which provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them in great numbers to besiege the Fort with great Threats, if Satisfaction was not given them. Our Cammanders made show of hanging one of <hi>Soveral</hi>'s Servants to appease the <hi>Nayres;</hi> and being cut down put him into a Coffin, as if he were really dead. The <hi>Nayres</hi> were satisfied, and our Men as well pleased that this Fiction had passed upon them, as if the Condescention had not been equal, whether the Act was faigned or real.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The King of <hi>Ova,</hi> or <hi>Avaa</hi> (for both Names are given him) fearing the Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>Arracam,</hi> his Enemies should come to an accommodation with the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> sent Ambassadors to settle a Peace with us, excusing the killing of <hi>Philip de Brito Nicote,</hi> offering to restore the Prisoners he had taken, and to assist us against the King of <hi>Arracam,</hi> of whose great Treasure he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired nothing for himself, but the white Elephant. The Viceroy accepted of the Ambassadors Proposals, and sent back with them <hi>Martin de Costa Falcam</hi> to ratifie the Agreement. He spent many Days in sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an hour's Audience, at length it was appointed at Midnight, and he was led in the dark to a Place where they ordered him to speak, for the King heared; he spoke and saw no King, nor heard no answer. He signified the desire he had of seeing the King, and was ordered to wait his going abroad. He went out one Day upon an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and knowing <hi>Falcam</hi> waited in the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54711:662"/>
Street to see him, never so much as turned his Eyes that way. Such was the account he made of our Embassy, so the Ambassador returned to <hi>Goa</hi> without concluding any thing.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Let us conclude this Year with an account of a Monster. In <hi>September</hi> was born at <hi>Chaul</hi> this Monster, whose Head and Face were as round as a Ball, the Mouth of excessive bigness, the Nose quite flat, the Eyes very little, the Ears vastly big like those of an Elephant, the Neck extream thick, in other respects like a Pig. It died the hour it was born.</p>

                        <p>Continues the Government of the Viceroy D. <hi>Hierome de Azevedo,</hi> in the Year 1617.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Affairs of <hi>Ceylon</hi> were in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Condition, for we had three powerful Enemies, but few Men to oppose them, and lost the Forts of <hi>Sofragam</hi> and <hi>Balane.</hi> Our Enemies were the King, the <hi>Chingala Antony de Barreto</hi> and <hi>Nicapeti,</hi> who though overcome still was strong. Our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, D. <hi>Nunno Alvares Pereyra,</hi> divided his Men, who with much hazard put all to the Fire and Sword, sparing neither Sex nor Age; for neither Mercy obliged the <hi>Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala's,</hi>
                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:54711:662"/>
nor did Cruelty terrifie them. The Particulars are not worth relating, let us see what happened with <hi>Nicapeti.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Our Forces marched after <hi>Nicapeti</hi> from <hi>Pelandu</hi> to <hi>Catugambala, Devamede</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagal,</hi> taking some Forts by the way, kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, and carrying away 600 Prisoners. The Tyrant retired to <hi>Talampeti</hi> his usual Refuge, our Men advanced to <hi>Polpeti</hi> in sight of the Enemies Camp, and forcing their Works passed to <hi>Balapane</hi> of <hi>Religiam,</hi> whence they sent away the Prisoners and wounded Men. It was debated in Counsel what was best to be done, and the worst advice prevailed, so D. <hi>Constantine</hi> marched with a Party towards <hi>Alicur</hi> after <hi>Barreto,</hi> and heard he was fortified with 6000 Men at <hi>Iatipara,</hi> having secured all the Women of the <hi>Araches</hi> and <hi>Lascarines,</hi> and that <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeti</hi> was at <hi>Moratena.</hi> Our Men being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided did little, and had performed much more, if the best advice, which was to keep together, had been followed. The <hi>Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala's</hi> when the <hi>Portugueses</hi> prevailed offer'd submission, but upon any ill success of ours recanted. At last our Forces quite harassed, went into Quarters at <hi>Botale.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. At this time <hi>Laurence Perez de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallo</hi> sailed from <hi>Goa</hi> for <hi>Ceylon</hi> with Men and Ammunition in a Pink, all at his own proper Charge. A Counsel being held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our General D. <hi>Nunno Alvarez</hi> at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo,</hi> the result was, That he marched in Person with a considerable force to drive <hi>Barreto</hi> from <hi>Sofragam</hi> and <hi>Mature; Luis
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54711:663"/>
Gomez Pinto</hi> was left with his Regiment to secure <hi>Alicur,</hi> and oppose <hi>Nicapeti,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel Cesar</hi> stayed at <hi>Botale</hi> with 100 Men. It was about the End of <hi>March,</hi> when those who were for <hi>Sofragam</hi> set out, carrying <hi>Laurence Lopez Carvallo</hi> with them. Our Parties were successful on all sides, driving the Enemy from their Works, and slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the Woods.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In <hi>May</hi> our Army advanced towards <hi>Nicapeti,</hi> who was well fortified at <hi>Moratena,</hi> yet fled towards <hi>Candea</hi> with such speed, that our Army could not keep with him. <hi>Luis Gomez Pinto</hi> with his Men and two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies more was detatched to pursue him, who was so intent upon overtaking <hi>Nicapeti,</hi> that he passed by several rich Booties that offered by the way. At length he overtook him in the Deserts of <hi>Anorojapure,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectly fell in with him. <hi>Nicapeti</hi> having killed one of our <hi>Lascarines</hi> with an Arrow, fled to the Woods, his Men made a small stand till 60 were slain, and then took the same shelter of the Woods. <hi>Nicapeti</hi>'s Wives called Queens, and a Grandson of <hi>Raju,</hi> and Nephew of <hi>Madune,</hi> who used to be at <hi>Uva</hi> with <hi>Barreto,</hi> were taken. The Fame of this Victory brought the Inhabitants of the <hi>Corlas</hi> loaded with Rice to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to our General at <hi>Malvana,</hi> which had been much distressed, but for this unexpected Victory that happened about <hi>Iuly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The News hereof also moved <hi>Anaras Pandar,</hi> King of <hi>Pandar,</hi> to send his Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors with 32 <hi>Portugueses</hi> he had Prisoners
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54711:663"/>
to treat of Peace. Our General sent his Letters to <hi>Goa,</hi> and the Viceroy read them in Council. The Contents were, That a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Peace should be settled; That he would become Tributary to <hi>Portugal</hi> with the yearly acknowledgment of 4 Elephants, and a quantity of Cinnamon; That he would repair and restore the Fort of <hi>Balane;</hi> That he would consent to the raising another in <hi>Candea;</hi> That his Kingdom should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed upon him, and his three Sons. All the Conditions were admitted, only in what related to setling the Kingdom on him and his Heirs, care should be had that nothing of the Claim the <hi>Portugueses</hi> have to it were diminished. Yet afterwards finding us less formidable, he recanted of part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and the Peace was concluded only with the yearly Tribute of two Elephants.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had a Title to the Kingdom of <hi>Iafanapatan,</hi> that King dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and leaving his Son a Child under the Tuition of his Brother <hi>Chingali,</hi> a fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity was offered of seizing that Crown, but other Affairs diverting our Forces, the Viceroy ordered <hi>Chingalij</hi> should continue his Possession with the Title of Governor.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Cities of <hi>Baçaim</hi> and <hi>Chaul,</hi> and Lands of <hi>Trapor</hi> and <hi>Tana,</hi> were consumed by Discord among the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and some of them were daily killed. <hi>Bacaim</hi> chiefly was full of Broils, occasioned by <hi>Ferdinand de Miranda</hi> and <hi>Andrew de Abreu.</hi> To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press these Disorders, the Council sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dominick Cardoso de Melo</hi> Judge of the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54711:664"/>
Criminal Court, and with him D. <hi>Peter de Azevedo</hi> Commander of the North. We shall hereafter see God's Judgments on that City and the other Places, to convince those Men they could not escape his Justice, tho' they did that of Men.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Ruy de Melo,</hi> who was deprived of his Command of <hi>Moçambique</hi> by the Judge <hi>Fr. de Fonseca Pinto,</hi> went to <hi>Goa,</hi> and being tryed was cleared of all the Crimes laid to his Charge, and ordered to be restored to his Post; <hi>Iames de Cunna &amp; Castellobranco</hi> Judge of the Criminal Court, was sent to restore him. The Viceroy charged <hi>Melo</hi> to forget past Grudges, to take care of the Peace and Preservation of that Place, and not to offend <hi>Guerra</hi> or <hi>Pinto;</hi> and the more to secure the latter, continued his former Commission during his stay in those Parts. The same Charge he gave to the Judge <hi>Cunna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Melo</hi> and <hi>Cunna</hi> sailed from <hi>Goa</hi> in two Vessels, and <hi>Cunna</hi> arrived first at <hi>Moçam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique</hi> in <hi>May.</hi> As soon as he came he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to reconcile him to <hi>Melo,</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn desired him to secure <hi>Pinto,</hi> contrary to the Viceroy's Orders, which made their Power equal. <hi>Pinto</hi> coming with above 100000 Crowns he had gathered by Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was put into Irons. Being a Prisoner in the Fort he made use of his Rhetorick, telling <hi>Guerra</hi> how much he was beholden to him, and offering, if he would release him and secure <hi>Cunna,</hi> to give him sufficient Certificates to save his Reputation, and clear
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54711:664"/>
him of all Crimes at <hi>Goa.</hi> This he said, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Guerra</hi>'s guilt was no less than his own.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Guerra</hi> overcome with these Promises, releases <hi>Pinto,</hi> and sending for <hi>Cunna</hi> on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Business detains him Prisoner. He seeing himself in the Power of his two great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Enemies, whose design was to stay him at <hi>Moçambique,</hi> giving 18000 Ducats secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, got loose and escaped to <hi>Mombaça,</hi> where <hi>Ruy de Melo</hi> was detained. They two with <hi>Simon de Melo Pereyra,</hi> Commander of that Fort, and <hi>Emanuel Freyre de Andrade</hi> gave Sentence of Death against <hi>Guerra,</hi> as a Rebel. <hi>Melo</hi> and <hi>Cunna</hi> Embarque for <hi>Moçambique;</hi> mean while <hi>Pinto</hi> to secure his Gold was sailing for <hi>Goa. Guerra</hi> was advised not to stay the coming of his Enemies, yet he did, and receiving <hi>Melo</hi> at the Gate deliver'd him the Keys. <hi>Melo,</hi> or his Son (for in this particular Relations vary) embracing <hi>Guerra</hi> stabbed him, then spurning and reviling, caused him to be apprehended. A few Days after he was condemned to be hanged, and tho' he offered to fit out a compleat Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon for the King's Service to purchase Life, was executed.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The <hi>Chineses</hi> provoked by the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> at <hi>Macao,</hi> were drawing together Forces to expel them. The <hi>Mandarines</hi> of the Province of <hi>Quantung,</hi> sent to them first to reproach them of their Crimes, ordering that either they should for the future resolve to live honestly, or immediately withdraw from thence with their Wives and Children.

pleaded innocence, excused their Faults, and promised for the time to come to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their Laws.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. D. <hi>Garcia de Silva</hi> (of whom mention was made before) was still at <hi>Goa,</hi> in order to go Ambassador to <hi>Persia.</hi> The Reason of his stay was because that King continued to commit Hostilities, having taken from us <hi>Bandel</hi> of <hi>Comoram</hi> in <hi>Arabia.</hi> Yet now he resolved to send an Ambassador to <hi>Spain,</hi> and chose for this Employ <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> an Englishman.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The <hi>Persian</hi> sending an Ambassador to <hi>Spain,</hi> it was thought the <hi>Spaniard</hi> might safely go to him. D. <hi>Garcia</hi> began to make ready, but his long stay at <hi>Goa</hi> having been chargeable, he demanded 30000 Ducats of the Viceroy, who was forced to give him the best part of that Sum; but this being in the dead of Winter, his Voyage was put off till Spring, and I cannot find any farther account what became of him or his Embassy.</p>
                     <p n="14">14.

The <hi>Portugueses</hi> sailing from <hi>Malaca</hi> to <hi>Manila,</hi> found there was a Days diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between those two Places; that is, they who go from <hi>Malaca</hi> think they arrive at <hi>Manila</hi> on a Sunday, and it is Monday; and the contrary from <hi>Manila</hi> to <hi>Malaca.</hi> The reason is, that those who sail to the Eastward at every 15 Degrees have the Sun rising an hour sooner, and they who to the Westward an hour later. From <hi>Portugal</hi> to <hi>India</hi> 7 hours are gained, the rest from <hi>Goa</hi> to <hi>Manila,</hi> which added to those lost between <hi>Manila</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> make up the difference of a whole Day.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Our Viceroy earnestly desired to hear of the many <hi>Portugueses</hi> were said to be cast away on the Island of <hi>Madagascar</hi> since the Discovery of <hi>India,</hi> as also to plant the Christian Faith there, and settle a friendly Correspondence with the Kings thereof, to the Exclusion of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> out of those Ports. To this effect he sent thither several Vessels during his Government. I have thought fit not to divide the Relation of those Expeditions, and therefore place them together in the following Chapters.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THE Viceroy, in pursuance of the King's Orders for discovery of the Affairs of the Island <hi>Madagascar,</hi> or St. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> fitted out a Caravel for that Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the Command of <hi>Paul Rodriguez de Costa,</hi> with Soldiers, two Jesuits, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters.</p>

They set sail from <hi>Goa</hi> at the end of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and reached that Island about the middle of <hi>April.</hi> The circumference of it is about 600 leagues, the length 260, and lies North-North-East, and South-South-West; the breadth, where most, is not above 80 leagues on the South part, and less North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for there it ends in a Point which bears the Name of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and is about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

3. I will not name the Kingdoms it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, because they are too many, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. It is very Populous, the Inhabitants living in Cities and Town of different extent and grandeur, well watered, and diversified with Mountains, Valleys, Bays, and Ports. The Names of <hi>Madagascar</hi> and St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> are given it by Strangers, the Natives ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no general Name thereof. There is no certainty of the first Planting of it. The generality of the Natives, called <hi>Buques,</hi> have no Religion, and consequently no Priests, or Churches. Any body circumcises the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren between 5 and 7 Years of Age.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They are not all of a Colour, some quite Black, with curled Hair; some not so dark, with lank Hair; some like <hi>Mulato's;</hi> and some up the Inlands whiter, yet of both sorts of Hair. Of Stature large, well made and strong, of a clear judgment, and apt to learn. Every Man has as many Wives as he can or will, and turns them off at pleasure, and they find other Husbands. The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band gives the Portion, saying, <hi>It is a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for their Fathers by whom they were bred for them.</hi> Their Funeral Obsequies consist in Feasting the Guests. The Mourning, in laying aside all marks of Joy, cutting the Hair, or covering the Face and Body with Clay.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Their Government is Monarchical, the Kings are called <hi>Andias, Anrias,</hi> and <hi>Dias,</hi> without any dependance on another. They are continually in War, the end whereof is rather Plunder than Slaughter. No Arms
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54711:667"/>
were found among them, but some Guns gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which they do not use, and are fearful of them in their own hands. Their Merchandize is excellent Amber, white Sandal, Tortoises, Ebony, other sweet Woods, and abundance of Slaves. There is plenty of all sorts of Cattle. Their Goat is as sweet as our Mutton, They have abundance of Sea-Cows, Sea-Horses, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys, some say Tigers, and Snakes not very very venomous. No Elephants, Horses, Asses, Lions, Bears, Deer, Foxes, nor Hares.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This is the Island of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> where our Discoverers now were in a large Bay near <hi>Masialage,</hi> in which is an Island half a league round, which contains a City of 8000 Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, most of them Weavers of excellent Stuffs made of the Palm-Tree, in the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 16 degrees. Here the <hi>Moors</hi> used to buy Boys, whom they carried to <hi>Arabia</hi> to serve their Lust. The King of this Place was called <hi>Samamo,</hi> with whom Friendship was established, and he granted Leave to Preach the Gospel. They coasted almost 40 leagues Westward, discovering the mouth of the great River <hi>Balue</hi> in the Latitude of somewhat more than 16 degrees. Turning Cape St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> they saw the River and Kingdom of <hi>Casame</hi> in 17 degrees of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, where they found little Water, and had much Trouble. Here also Amity was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished with the King, called <hi>Sampilla,</hi> a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet old Man, but in all this way heard no News of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> sought after.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54711:667"/>
said on Shore, and two Crosses set up, which that King seemed to be pleased at, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to restore them if at any time they fell.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In the Holy-days they discovered a small Island in 18 degrees of Latitude, which they call <hi>Espiritu Santo;</hi> half a degree far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Banks of Sand 9 leagues in length, where they were in some danger. On <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity-Sunday</hi> they landed further on, were again in danger of Sands, anchored at the 7 Islands of <hi>Cuerpo de Dios</hi> in 19 degrees of Latitude, near the River and Kingdom <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> to which they came on the 19th of <hi>Iune,</hi> and found scarce Water enough for Caravels. The Kingdom is large, the City on the Banks of the River has about 10000 Inhabitants, great plenty of Flesh, <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat, Tar, Tortoises, Sandal, Ebony, and sweet Woods, the People black, simple, but good natured, and have no Trade. The King's Name was <hi>Capitape,</hi> an ancient Man, much respected, and very sincere. He esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Peace, and gave his Son to guide our Men, and assist them along that Coast. All along this Coast from <hi>Massalaje</hi> to <hi>Sadia,</hi> which are 130 leagues, is used the Language of the <hi>Cafres.</hi> All the rest of the Island uses the Language called <hi>Buqua,</hi> which is the Native.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Turning towards the South they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Country of the <hi>Buques,</hi> a very wicked and poor People, feeding upon the Spawn of Fish. The Inland Kings, who are more powerful, oppress them. They passed
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54711:668"/>
by the River <hi>Mane;</hi> that of <hi>Saume</hi> in 20 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 15 minutes of South Latitude; <hi>Mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puta</hi> in 20 degrees 30 minutes, (here they heard of <hi>Portugueses;) Isango</hi> in 21 degrees; <hi>Terrir</hi> 21 degrees 30 minutes; the 7 Islands of St. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in 22 degrees. On the 11th of <hi>Iuly</hi> they came into the Port of St. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> in 22 degrees, and heard somewhat of <hi>Portugueses</hi> from <hi>Dissamuto</hi> the King.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Our Men offering a Silver Chain here for some Provisions, the Natives gave it to an old Woman to try whether it was right, she said, That 3 days Journey down a River there was an Island inhabited long since by a white Warlike People, habited like our Men, that wore Crosses about their Necks, and lived upon Rapine, that they easily took what they would, being Armed with Spears and Guns. Our Men were pleased at this Information, and here whilst they were at Mass, the Prince of <hi>Loquexa</hi> with a Black ran away. Three <hi>Portugueses</hi> catched him, and he begged they would kill him; being brought back and better treated, he wholly submitted to their will.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Passing by the Bay of St. <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the mouth of the River <hi>Massiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> they entred the Port <hi>Santa Clara,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Diamassuto</hi> came to them, concluded a Peace, and on his knees worshipped the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix. They were told, that white People resorted to the Neighbouring Port, which were supposed to be <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Going on they found Banks of Sand not set down in the Charts, and entred the Port in 24 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54711:668"/>
of Latitude. The People were affable, their King's Name <hi>Diacomena;</hi> they said, That on the opposite Coast there were <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> who had been cast away, and fed Cattle; that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had been there three times, and left them four Musketiers, with whose help they made War on their Enemies. Friendship was established here, upon condition they should not again admit the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Some Inscriptions were found carved on Trees, one of them had these words, <hi>Christophorus Neoportus Anglus Cap.</hi> And another, <hi>Dominus Robertus Schurleius Comes, Legatus Regis Persarum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. In the Latitude of 25 degrees, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring a Port they called it of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> the Name of the Kingdom is <hi>Vavalinta,</hi> the King's <hi>Diamacrinali</hi> a Buque, who no sooner saw the <hi>Portugueses</hi> but he said, <hi>Are these some of the Men of the other Coast?</hi> This confirmed what had been heard of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> before; and the King, being asked, said, <hi>They were 6 days sail thence.</hi> In <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> our Men saw Cape St. <hi>Mary,</hi> where they spent 40 days in stormy weather, and on St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s day entred the Port of the same Name in the Kingdom of <hi>Enseroe.</hi> The Natives said, That half a day's Journey off there were white People with Crosses, who had a great Town. <hi>Randumana</hi> the King came to the Caravel, and sent one of his Subjects with a <hi>Portugues</hi> to shew him where he said those White Men were, but the Black left our Man half way.</p>

12. Among others, there came thither to Trade with our Men a King with above 500 fighting Men, his Sons almost white, their Hair long, wearing Gowns and Breeches of Cotton of several colours, with Silver But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, Bracelets, and other Jewels of Gold, Pearl, and Coral. This King's Name was <hi>Bruto Chembanga;</hi> his Kingdom, called <hi>Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassi,</hi> borders upon <hi>Enseroe</hi> on the West. He shewed <hi>Arabick</hi> Books. He said, The <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> were all dead, who not far from thence had built a Town of Stone, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped a Cross, on the foot whereof were unknown Characters. He drew all on the Sand, repeated <hi>Portugues</hi> Sirnames, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded much Gold for telling his knowledge herein. Some of his Men wore Crosses, and informed our People, there were two <hi>Holland</hi> Ships in Port St. <hi>Lucy</hi> or <hi>Mangascafe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. In a small Island here was found a square Stone Fort, and at the foot of it carved on a piece of Marble the Arms of <hi>Portugal,</hi> with this Inscription, <hi>REX PORTUGALENSIS ☉ S.</hi> Many Judgments were made of that Circle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two last S's, but nothing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty can be concluded.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The King <hi>Chambanga</hi> desired a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> might be sent to his Court to treat about important Affairs, leaving a Nephew Hostage for his safe return. The Master <hi>Antony Gonçalez,</hi> and F. <hi>Peter Freyre,</hi> were sent, who at 12 leagues distance found his Court, called <hi>Fansaria,</hi> very populous and magnificent. He Treated them well at first,

then coldly; but they making him a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Present, they were good Friends, and he delivered them his eldest Son to be carried to <hi>Goa,</hi> desiring as Hostages for him the two Jesuits, and four other <hi>Portugueses,</hi> to whom he gave the Island of St. <hi>Cruz</hi> to live in.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THE same King told the <hi>Portugueses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> That in his Father's time a Ship of theirs was cast away on that Coast; that about 100 of the Men came ashore, some brought their Wives, others married there, and left a numerous Offspring. He repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted several of their Names, and shewed a Book writ in <hi>Portugues</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and some Maps, and concluded, saying, There were more <hi>Portugueses</hi> on that Coast 7 days Journey Northward.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Inquiring further, our Men found an old Man 90 Years of Age, who had known
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54711:670"/>
the <hi>Portugueses</hi> that were cast away there, and could remember still some odd Words of our Language. The Ships that were lost, and never known where since the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>India,</hi> were as follows. In the Year 1504, three Ships; one in the Year 1505; in 1527, two were cast away on the Island <hi>Madagascar,</hi> and the Men remained there for want of Vessels to transport them; four were lost the Year 1534, not known where; one more in the Year 1538. The <hi>Portugueses,</hi> those People spoke of, must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to some of these Ships.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Our Men all set their hands to work, and built a small Chapel and House for the four <hi>Portugueses</hi> and two Religious Men, who were to remain there. The Work done, Mass was said, and many of the Natives came to learn to make the sign of the Cross. The King seeing some Men labour under a Cross that was to be set upon a Rock run half naked and bare footed, and carried it alone to the Place appointed. The <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> might say, they had found another Emperor <hi>Heraclius,</hi> for after this pious Action he became wicked, in this manner.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Our Captain being ready to sail, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that Son the King had promised to send with him; and he not only refused to perform, but denied he had made any such Promise, and offered a Slave. The Captain seeing this change, sent the Master and Pilot with some Men to demand Hostages, that a <hi>Portugues</hi> might go to Port St. <hi>Lucy</hi> to sound it, and see an Inscription the Natives said was
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54711:670"/>
in that place. If the King granted this, they were to require no more; if not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring away by force one of his Sons.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Peace thus broke, and some At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of getting one of the King's Sons failing, some <hi>Portugueses</hi> marched with their Muskets. The King dreaded them, but kept his Men in readiness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Fray ensuing, they catched one of his Sons 11 Years of Age, who was his Darling. The King endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to rescue him, but was repulsed by our Shot. The Subjects of another King came to offer any thing for the Boy's Ransom; but being told, it was the Viceroy's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the King's Promise, and that they should lose their Heads if they did not carry him, they went away satisfied. Thus ended the Year 1613. The Child came to <hi>Goa</hi> about the middle of the Year 1614, the Viceroy caused him to be well instructed in the Faith by the Jesuits, and was his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father in Baptism, giving him the Name of <hi>Andrew</hi> because it was on that Apostle's day, and the Sirname of <hi>Azevedo</hi> as his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Viceroy treated him with all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Magnificence, hoping to gain him, that when he succeeded his Father, he might forward the Propagation of the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and believing he was sufficiently grounded, sent him away with four J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="7">7. In this Island there are two Mountains that overtop the Clouds. The Wreck of two <hi>Holland</hi> Ships was found there.

He was every where till he came to the Court, received with demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of Joy, which to us seem ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as those used by us would appear to them. This done, the King made the same Agreement with our Captain that had been with the former, which was, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious should inhabit the Island of <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> and thence have the liberty to go out and Preach the Gospel; that there should be a League Offensive and Defensive between the King and <hi>Portugueses.</hi> So the Fathers, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meyda</hi> and <hi>Costa,</hi> went to the Fort of <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> and D. <hi>Andrew</hi> the King's Son sent them Workmen and Provisions.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Captain <hi>Peter de Almeyda</hi> had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to carry the King to <hi>Goa;</hi> or if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, another Son, which, if not consented to, should be taken by force. A Son being

They set out in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and being forced to water at the Island <hi>Del Cisne,</hi> or <hi>The Swan,</hi> they saw three Ships sunk at the mouth of a River.

                     <p n="13">13.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Government of the Viceroy D. <hi>John Coutinno</hi> Count <hi>de Rodendo,</hi> from the Year 1617 till 1619.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THis Year sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> D. <hi>Iohn Coutinno</hi> Count <hi>de Rodondo</hi> with sour Ships, one whereof was forced back from the Line. During his Government, which lasted not two Years compleat, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened wonderful Prodigies, Storms, Dearths, and other Judgments. I will give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the most remarkable, dividing that from what relates to his Government, which shall be first spoke of.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The War continued at <hi>Mangalor,</hi> where <hi>Salvador Ribeyro Marinno</hi> commanded, who
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54711:673"/>
being assisted by D. <hi>Iames Coutinno,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief of <hi>Malabar,</hi> took the Field against 11000 Natives, and destroyed many with the loss of 6 Men. The little King of that <hi>Banguel,</hi> or District, who was our Friend, not able to maintain it against his Enemy <hi>Bentacanayque,</hi> made it over to us to defend it. <hi>Antony de Saldanna</hi> was left to command there afterwards. D. <hi>Francis de Meneses de Bacaim</hi> was sent to his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with an allowance of 4000 Crowns; for now the Wages were grown grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Employments. The Men landing in disorder, the Moors, who lost no advantage, slew some; but the others forming themselves put them to flight. For some time they were kept under by 300 <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> and 1000 <hi>Indians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Soon after another Skirmish happening with the <hi>Canara</hi>'s, the Plain was covered with the dead Bodies. In <hi>August</hi> the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy sent thither <hi>Francis de Miranda Enriquez</hi> with 8 sail, and by the end of the same Month 4000 of the Enemy were slain, with the loss of 800 <hi>Portugueses. Miranda</hi> having taken a rich Ship of the Queen of <hi>Olala</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from <hi>Meca,</hi> gave her occasion to assist our Enemy with a good Body of Men, they besieged our Fort of <hi>Banguel,</hi> burnt the Town, and hereupon followed so sharp an Engagement, that though many of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were slaughtered, it was with such loss on our side we had no cause to rejoice. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa</hi> thought to have taken the Fort of <hi>Olala</hi> by Storm, but was repulsed. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54711:674"/>
of the next Year was more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; for <hi>Bentacanayque</hi> with 12000 <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nara's</hi> falling upon <hi>Luis de Brito &amp; Melo,</hi> who carried Succors, and D. <hi>Francis de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa,</hi> killed them both with 180 <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> and above 60 Slaves. The day after the News of this Disaster came to <hi>Goa,</hi> there was found a Lampoon upon the Viceroy, the Secretary, the Surveyor of the Revenue, and the Chancellor, laying that and other Misfortunes to their Charge.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It has been related how <hi>Ruy de Melo,</hi> and <hi>Sampayo,</hi> and <hi>Iames de Cunna</hi> executed <hi>Salvador Vaz de Guerra</hi> at <hi>Moçambique.</hi> The News of that impudent Action brought to <hi>Goa</hi> so terrified the Judge <hi>Francis de Fonseca Pinto,</hi> then a Prisoner, that he made his Escape by Bribes, and died in the Country of the <hi>Moors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Viceroy sent an Ambassador to the <hi>Mogol,</hi> to desire he would not admit our Enemies the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> into his Ports; F. <hi>Emanuel Pineyro,</hi> a Jesuit, went on this Errand. The result was, that the King took off the Embargo that was upon 200 Sail of ours in his Ports, and forbore making War upon <hi>Damam</hi> and <hi>Diu,</hi> for which purpose he had already detatched 30000 Horse from the Army, that was ready to march against the <hi>Persians</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded his Territories. His Army consisted of 300000 Horse, the Foot innumerable, many Thousand Camels, 12000 Elephants, 6000 Yoke of Oxen drawing as many Carts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides such as carry on their backs like
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54711:674"/>
Mules; 70000 poor People followed this multitude.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This multitude being to pass a rapid River that falls from a Mountain, he laid over it a wooden Bridge for the Men, and broke the Fury of its Course with a Dam for the Beasts to swim over safely. A whole Month was spent in passing. The Camp was 8 Leagues in compass so regular, so beautified with rich Tents, and so well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with all Necessaries, that it looked like a well govern'd City.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This Year sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> for <hi>India</hi> 3 Ships, and 2 Flyboats, under the Command of D. <hi>Christopher de Noronna.</hi> Six <hi>English</hi> Ships lay then about the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> which taking one of the Flyboats, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the others were coming, and lay in wait for them. They meeting, the <hi>English</hi> Admiral said, <hi>He had Orders from his King to seize Effects of the Portugueses to the value of 70000 Crowns for the Damage done by the Viceroy D.</hi> Hierome de Azevedo <hi>to the 4 Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Ships in the Bay of</hi> Surat. This Sum was immediately paid him, and 20000 Ducats more to divide among his Men. Our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral no sooner arrived at <hi>Goa,</hi> but he was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the Viceroy, and sent Prisoner to <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. The King of <hi>Iorcon</hi> came into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Malaca</hi> with 80 Sail in a miserable condition, as who was expelled his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions by the King of <hi>Achem.</hi> Our Officers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54711:675"/>
against that Enemy, which was denied him; and yet afterwards they desired the same of the King, to oppose the Power of <hi>Achem</hi> which threatned that Place, and was more formidable than it had been till that time.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. A small Squadron was sent from <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Lope de Sousa,</hi> to plunder the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Factory at <hi>Ia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They lost the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of taking a great Sum of Money that was kept there, and in stead of plundering that Enemy, gained another, by destroying some Towns along the Coast.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The <hi>Tartars</hi> having ruined part of the famous Wall of <hi>China,</hi> entred like a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with above a million of Men, bearing down Cities, and whole Provinces, till they drew near the Court of <hi>Peking</hi> in so terrible a manner, that the King was about withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Nanking.</hi> But the <hi>Chineses</hi> recovering of the first Fright, fell upon the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and made such a slaughter as obliged them to quit that Province. The Jesuits here gained much Esteem, having been very serviceable with their Intelligence. For an Example to posterity, I will relate the Particulars of this Invasion of the <hi>Tartars</hi> till the Year 1640.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:54711:675"/>
11. When <hi>Humvu,</hi> the first of the Family, now reigning in <hi>China,</hi> expelled the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who for 90 Years had been possessed of that Crown, he not only recovered what had been lost, but conquered the Frontiers of <hi>Tartary,</hi> dividing them into several Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. These in time grew to such a height, that they raised themselves into 3 Kingdoms, one on the East, the other towards the West, and the third on the North. The two last immediately cast off the <hi>Chinese</hi> Yoke, the other continued in Obedience till the <hi>Chine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> seeing it grow powerful, without any other occasion resolved to weaken it. But the <hi>Tartars</hi> oppressed taking courage, reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themselves, running to Arms, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a strong Hold in the Province of <hi>Leao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tung,</hi> by which and other Actions they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Masters of the Field. The other two Kingdoms moved by the hope of Gain, joyned with the former, and in the Year 1618, (which was 300 after <hi>Humvn,)</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a most formidable Army, which coming to Battel with that of <hi>China,</hi> no less nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, gave it a total overthrow, rather to be attributed to the ill Conduct of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses,</hi> than Valour of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> The King of <hi>China</hi> so much neglected his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he seemed to be in a perfect Lethargy; and all the Industry used by his Ministers to awake him, was of no effect.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. In fine, the <hi>Tartars</hi> continued the War with such Success, that they conquered the Northern Province of <hi>Leaotung,</hi> and forced the Kingdom of <hi>Corea</hi> to pay them Tribute,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54711:676"/>
as they did till then to <hi>China.</hi> After the <hi>Tartars</hi> were beaten from <hi>Peking,</hi> a <hi>Chinese</hi> Woman headed some Troops against them, and gained great Fame, defeating them in several places.</p>

2. The noise of the Waves overcame that of the Ruins, notwithstanding the tops of Churches were blown off, and vast Stones flew a great distance. Two thousand were killed in the Town and adjacent Parts. The Fish died in the Ponds, and corrupted the Waters. Most of the Churches were laid even with the ground, as if God had shewed there was no need of them among such wicked People. A Lamp remained burning before the Blessed Sacrament in the Church of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> when the Wind overthrew Buildings.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Many Vessels were lost in the Port. Some Cattle was seen to fly, and the Birds to fall. The Woods were torn up by the Roots. Men fled to the Mountains for shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the wild Beasts to the Town. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seemed reversed, the People rent the Skies with Cries for Mercy, which at last obtained, the Storm ceased.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There were strange Prodigies before and during this Storm, as Giants seen in the Air throwing great Globes of Fire one at the other. A confusion of Human Voices was heard there, trampling of Horses, and the sound of Warlike Instruments. A Troop of furious Horsemen was seen to attack the City, and a Man cloathed in Skins to oppose them; those were concluded to be Devils, and he St. <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. At <hi>Bombaim</hi> the Sea swallowed above 60 Sail, some Men, and much Riches. At <hi>Agacaim</hi> a Boat flew out of the Sea into a House, where it killed a Woman and her
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54711:681"/>
Child. At <hi>Tana,</hi> a Beast taken up by the Wind fell upon a Tree that was torn up by the Roots, and a Branch struck through the Body of it. A Woman seeing a Giant-like Man carrying a Pan of burning Coals, asked him for one, and he blowing it, burnt her Face. Much of this nature happened at <hi>Salsete,</hi> and other Places.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. D. <hi>Luis de Gama</hi> coming from <hi>Ormuz,</hi> where he had Commanded for <hi>Goa,</hi> in a Ship full of Riches, was cast away on the Coast of <hi>Bombaim.</hi> A new married Couple being upon a Plank, the Bridegroom fell off, and the Bride for grief cast her self after him; he came up again and was saved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wife or Goods. A Maid that went to be a Nun escaping, was ravished by the <hi>Moors,</hi> and then killed. Thus several Ships belonging to Captains who came from their Commands perished, perhaps a Judgment for their unjust heaping of Wealth.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The City <hi>Goa</hi> seeing this destruction, had recourse to Heaven. All the Religious Orders made Processions, and performed great Acts of Mortification. The Women rent the Clouds with Cries of Mercy. All lay down in the Churches to be trampled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This lasted some days and nights; the Churches were continually open, the Streets full, yet in all the Concourse the least noise was not heard.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. This Example was followed at <hi>Cochim.</hi> The Bishop of this City had excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any that should buy Timber of the Queen of <hi>Coulam.</hi> A <hi>Portugues</hi> presumed to build
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54711:681"/>
a Ship there, when it should be Launched, no Force or Art could move it. The <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> confesses his Crime with Repentance, and returning to the Ship, it was Launched without the least difficulty.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. There reigned through all <hi>India</hi> a new Distemper, which caused great Pains over all the Body, and contraction of Sinews, so that some lost the use of their Limbs. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with Anguish ran mad; whole Families sickned at once. The only Remedy was found to be Bleeding. A Chirurgeon being no way able to stanch the Blood of a sick Man, laid upon it a Cross he had, in which was believed to be a piece of that of our Saviour, and it stopped immediately.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. A <hi>Cafre</hi> fled from a Widow, whose Slave he was, to a <hi>Fidalgo</hi> or Nobleman's House, and afterwards returned to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress. The <hi>Fidalgo</hi> sent to demand the Slave of her, as if he had been his own. She refusing, he sent some Soldiers to take him by force; but she received them with Granadoes in her hands, and they returned with shame.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>N. Barreto</hi> a <hi>Fidalgo,</hi> 16 Years of Age, killed his Father, for which his Head was cut off; so Justice was done where there never was any. The Mercers of <hi>Goa,</hi> esteemed more Honorable than the Goldsmiths, would not allow them to use a sort of Umbrello, with an Ornament on the top and middle of it. A Goldsmith went abroad with such an Umbrello, the Mercers broke it and beat him. The other Goldsmiths coming to assist
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54711:682"/>
their Brother, there ensued a Fray, in which much Blood was spilt, and much Plunder got, though no victory, for the <hi>Algna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="12">12. On the 11th of <hi>November</hi> appeared a Comet in the East, and another on the 24th. They were seen at four in the morning, both under the Sign <hi>Scorpio.</hi> The first extended towards the South in the form of a Palm, the other toward the North, and was like a Flower-pot. The latter lasted till the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> the other till the 20th of <hi>December.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. The first time the King of <hi>Arracam</hi> went to the City <hi>Chatigam</hi> after the <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> inhabited there, they presented him a Bough thick set with Figs; he offered it to his white Elephant (so coveted by all the Eastern Princes) to eat, but he would not, though the King prayed him to take it for the King of <hi>Ova,</hi> the <hi>Mogol,</hi> and his own sake. But scarce did he desire him to eat it for the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> when the Elephant joyfully snatched it in his Trunk. The King in a Passion caused him to be deprived of all his Ornaments, as a Golden Dish on which he fed, Gold Chain by which they led him, and the like. The Beast for Grief would not eat, and the King, for fear it should die, was forced to restore its Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. At this time died at <hi>Bengala</hi> that <hi>Moor</hi> so famous for his Age, being above 300 Years old when <hi>Nunno de Cunna</hi> took <hi>Diu,</hi> which
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54711:682"/>
was 60 Years before this time, and he seemed now but 60 Years of Age. It was reported, there were others 200 Years old thereabouts, but upon enquiry none appeared. Only one Woman was found about 100 Years of Age, and had married that same Year, having before buried seven Husbands. Thus much for the Year 1618, now for that of 1619, which is no less wonderful.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Upon one of the three Hills that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look <hi>Goa</hi> stood a large wooden Cross, on which very many of the Inhabitants of that City, the 23th Day of <hi>February,</hi> saw the perfect Figure of a Man Crucified. The Archbishop having examined the Truth of it, took it down, and of it made a small one two spans in length, with a Crucifix of Ivory upon, and a Glory of Gold round. The remaining Pieces were distributed to the Churches and Persons of Quality. Ten Days after the Cross was taken down, Water gushed from the hole where it had been fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which Cloaths being dipped wrought many miraculous Cures. On the Place where the Cross stood was built a Church.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. It was debated in an Assembly of the principal Clergy, whether the Threads the <hi>Bramenes</hi> hang across their Shoulders were a Heathenish Superstition, or only a mark of Nobility; after some time it was concluded in favour of the latter, as only a distinction of Honour. The reason of examining this Point was, because many of the <hi>Bramenes</hi> refused to embrace the Faith, only for that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54711:683"/>
they were obliged as soon as Christians to leave off those Threads.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. D. F. <hi>Christopher,</hi> the Archbishop, said the first Mass in his Cathedral at <hi>Goa,</hi> which was finished this Year, and is not inferior in Grandure to many of the <hi>European</hi> Churches of Fame. It was dedicated to St. <hi>Catherine,</hi> on whose Day that City was taken.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. There happened a great Dearth and Famine, which destroyed many People. In only the little Island of <hi>Bardes</hi> almost 400 died. There was a wonderful Eclipse of the Sun most visible at <hi>Moçambique,</hi> soon after noon, the day becoming quite dark the space of two hours. This caused great Admiration, as did another of the Moon at <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. In the Province of <hi>Peking</hi> in <hi>China</hi> it rained not for a whole Year. In that of <hi>Xantung</hi> the Famin was such, Men eat one another. Two Women were executed for eating eleven Children. In that of <hi>Nanking</hi> was a Plague of Mice. Two Parts in five of the King's Palace were burnt; and five Towers were blown down in the City. Two Suns were seen together, the one eclipsing the other. A Man entred the Palace to kill the Prince. In the Province of <hi>Xangsi</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a Man cloathed in yellow with a green Cap and Fan of Feathers, who said. <hi>Vambie</hi> (that was the King's Name) <hi>does not govern; he has reigned long; is always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep; the Kingdom going to Ruine, the People starves, the Captains are slain.</hi> This said he
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54711:683"/>
vanished, and, though all means were used to find him, he could never be heard of.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. That there might be somewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in the Viceroy, he died on the 10th of <hi>November</hi> of a swelling upon his Back as big as the Crown of a Hat, so black and monstrous, it frighted not only the ignorant, but the ablest Physicians.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. The Viceroy was buried in the Church of the King's, a League down the River, the usual Burial Place of those who die in that Command, as his Father did who is there interred. He was not of a very piercing Judgment, but positive; of Stature tall, well shaped, neither white nor swarthy. Of Viceroys he was the 23th; of Governors 43th; the 4th of the Name, and 3d of the Sirname.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Governour <hi>Ferdinand de Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque,</hi> from the Year 1619, till 1622.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE first Patent of Succession being opened, there was found named <hi>Ferdinand de Albuquerque,</hi> a Gentleman 70 Years of Age, 40 whereof he had been married, and an Inhabitant of <hi>Goa,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently well versed in the Affairs of <hi>India.</hi> But having lived long at ease, was become
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54711:684"/>
slow in Business, which suited not with the pressing Occasions of that time.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The King of <hi>Porca</hi> always ill affected to the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> this Year embraced our Friendship with great Demonstrations of Sincerity and Affection.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Arache D. <hi>Luis,</hi> who became a Christian only to gain the better Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of raising new Troubles, now disturbed the Peace of <hi>Iafanapatan.</hi> He stirred up the People to Enthrone a Prince at <hi>Remancor,</hi> and marched with 30000 Men towards our Men, who were fortified in a Pagod. <hi>Philip de Oliveyra</hi> had but 30 Men, having sent the rest to <hi>Ceylon</hi> as fearing no Insurrection. With those 30 he withstood all that number of Enemies, who first attacked the Church of our Lady, in which were 30 other <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses,</hi> and then the Pagod where <hi>Oliveyra</hi> was, and were at both Places repulsed with Loss. <hi>Oliveyra</hi> held it out a Month, till Relief came from <hi>Ceylon. Andrew Coello</hi> brought Succors by Water, and <hi>Luis Teyxeyra</hi> 1600 Men by Land. The latter entring the Kingdom, did many Actions barbarous and inhuman. He clove Men with Axes like Trees, opened the Wombs of Women and put in their Children snatched from their Arms. These are impieties unworthy a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, yet sometimes excused in War.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Oliveyra</hi> finding himself thus strong took the Field, slew a multitude of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and gave them a total overthrow. Scarce had they breathed after this Victory, when the Prince of <hi>Remancor</hi> appeared with
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54711:684"/>
his Army, but <hi>Teyxera</hi> suddenly falling upon him made such havock, he was glad to cast himself at <hi>Teyxeyra</hi>'s feet, who received him with great Courtesie. They returned to give Thanks for this Victory in Our Lady's Church, where the Religious at the Door, offering <hi>Oliveyra</hi> a Palm, he said it was due to <hi>Teyxeyra,</hi> and caused it to be given to him. Both deserved, but he doubly who refused, once for conquering his Enemies, another for overcoming himself in not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting it. A wonderful Victory in our Age.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Arache D. <hi>Luis</hi> escaped, his Wife and Children were taken, she in despair slew her self, whilst he perswaded the Nayque of <hi>Tanjaor</hi> he might make himself King of <hi>Iafanapatan.</hi> He raised 2000 <hi>Badagaes,</hi> and gave the Command of them to <hi>Chem Nayque,</hi> that King of the <hi>Carcas</hi> who not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore assisted <hi>Chingali. Oliveyra</hi> was strong in Our Lady's Church, but in <hi>November</hi> met the Enemy. The fight being desperate with some loss on our side; he advanced to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Men, the Enemy knowing him, seven of them attack him, and one of them struck a Spear through his Mouth out at his Throat, yet he recovering killed two of them, the others fled.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Enemy retired to their Trenches, <hi>Oliveyra</hi> being reinforced by 1000 Men from <hi>Ceylon</hi> assaults them, kills many, and took many more; yet after all he ransomed 1500 taken by the <hi>Chingalaes,</hi> and set them at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. The Nayque still coveting that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54711:685"/>
Crown raised more <hi>Badagaes, Oliveyra</hi> sent three Captains with their Companies to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press him; they slew so many without losing one Man, that being weary of killing they returned with 1000 Heads.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Prince, Son to the late King of <hi>Iafanapatan,</hi> who had escaped the Tyranny of <hi>Chingali,</hi> being in the Hands of the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans,</hi> was baptized together with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and many Nobles and Commoners, and at last making over his Claim to that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> took the Habit of that Order, by the Name of F. <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> of Christ.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Chingali,</hi> who was taken some time before, was sent to <hi>Goa</hi> with his Wife, there condemned to Death; and being first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Faith made a most happy end. His Wife following the Example given by him was baptized by the Name of <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Austria;</hi> and retiring to the House of the Converts in that City, led a Life that may be an Example to all ancient Christians.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. I think I have not specified the cause of these Troubles, which was thus. <hi>Para Raja Cheygra Pandara,</hi> made Governor and King of <hi>Iafanapatan</hi> when <hi>Andrew Furtado</hi> slew the former King, wore that Crown 28 Years, and hoping the Viceroy would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Choice, named a Son of the deceased to succeed him, who being but 7 Years of Age, he ordered his Brother <hi>Areaquerari Pandara</hi> should govern till he was of Age, him <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gali Cumara</hi> murdered to usurp the Crown. After that he slew many others, whereupon
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54711:685"/>
the People mutinying reduced him to great Streights, till being succoured by a number of <hi>Badagaes,</hi> raised by the Nayque of <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaor,</hi> and commanded by the King of the <hi>Carcas;</hi> they came to a Battel, wherein <hi>Changali</hi> being victorious, secured the Crown for some time. This Tyrant not content that the <hi>Portugueses</hi> winked at his bad Title, refused to pay them the usual Tribute, which was the Cause why <hi>Oliveyra</hi> fell upon and took him as has been related.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Abas Xa</hi> King of <hi>Persia</hi> being bent upon possessing himself of the Island and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ormus, Camberbeque</hi> Cam of <hi>Lara</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to undertake it, on pretence an ancient Tribute was not paid him, which he never had since <hi>Alfonso de Albuquerque</hi> entred that Place He hindred the Trade, and secured several <hi>Portugues</hi> Merchants; and seeing we did not agree with him about the Trade of his Silks, he settled it with <hi>Iames</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> concluding a League with him for the taking of <hi>Ormuz. Ray Freyre de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drade</hi> who came the Year before from <hi>Lisbon</hi> with 5 Galleons to cruize on that Sea, sent to <hi>Goa</hi> for Succour but could not obtain it, tho' he only desired 4 small Vessels.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Nevertheless <hi>Freyre</hi> fights the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> and worsts them, The <hi>Arabs</hi> joining with the <hi>Persians</hi> had taken <hi>Iulfar</hi> and <hi>Dola,</hi> which caused great scarcity of Water at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> where there is none but what is brought from abroad. <hi>Freyre</hi> went over to forward the building a new Fort at <hi>Queixome,</hi> and by his Absence
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54711:686"/>
the Fleet before weak, was much impaired. Then came two Galleons from <hi>Goa</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by D. <hi>Emanuel de Azevedo</hi> and D. <hi>Iohn de Silveyra,</hi> an Enemy to <hi>Freyre;</hi> they were ill manned, and scarce of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and brought Instructions that curbed the Power of the Admiral.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Being now strong at <hi>Quixome</hi> he scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Coast, where were burnt 400 Sail, and the Towns of <hi>Boami, Camir, Cong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>, Astan,</hi> and <hi>Doçar,</hi> at <hi>Niquilay</hi> he took and destroyed four Ships, and above 80 great Barques. The <hi>Persians</hi> assisted by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> furiously batter'd the Fort at <hi>Queixome,</hi> yet <hi>Freyre</hi> carried on his Work, and assisted the <hi>Arabs</hi> that continued firm to us. When <hi>Freyre</hi> was somewhat streightned, the two Captains that came with the Galleons to his assistance from <hi>Goa</hi> left him.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. This Year sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> for <hi>India</hi> 4 Ships under the Command of <hi>Nunno Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez Botello.</hi> There came also two Pinks, one for <hi>Malaca,</hi> the other for <hi>Moçambiqus;</hi> and two Ships more under <hi>Iacome de Morales Sarmiento,</hi> who was to be General at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çambique</hi> during the War about the Mines of <hi>Monomotapa,</hi> as if he were like to last as long as the War.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Ships that came from <hi>Portugal</hi> under the Command of <hi>Botello,</hi> returned the next Year, and with them two more built at <hi>Goa,</hi> with the Men and Loadings of two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, one left in <hi>India</hi> as unfit for the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the other lost at <hi>Mombaça.</hi> In one of these two Ships called the <hi>Conception,</hi> was a
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54711:686"/>
Hermit, who whilst they Winter'd at St. <hi>Helena</hi> stole away, and being asked why he left the Company, said, <hi>He had rather stay in that desert Island, than to go see the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that Ship would soon fall into.</hi> Being come to the Island <hi>Tercera,</hi> they found Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders there to make the Lat. of 39 Deg. where they would find D. <hi>Antony de Ataide,</hi> Admiral of <hi>Portugal.</hi> They obeyed, but missing of him, one Morning at the Mouth of <hi>Tagus</hi> they met 15 or 16 Sail of <hi>Turks.</hi> Our Ship was ill manned, had but few Guns, and her Steeridge full of Bails.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The <hi>Turks</hi> having powred in their broad-sides boarded the Ship, killing 20 <hi>Portugueses</hi> of 140 that were in her, most of them sick, yet the Enemy receiving great damage entred with 400 Men, who were all slain save 8 or 9 that got off. This done our Ship cast Anchor in an advantageous Place, but next day received Orders to put to Sea where she would find the Fleet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her. She was no sooner out but the <hi>Turks</hi> attack her, yet after a desperate fight again left her. But the third Day the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my coming on again burnt her, few of the Men escaping Death, and those remaining in Captivity.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Ship called St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> another of the two built in <hi>India,</hi> had no better For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, for springing a leak she was with much labour of Pumping brought as far as the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> where three <hi>Holland</hi> Ships pursued her 20 Days, whereof 8 were spent in fight. Our Ship being totally disabled,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:54711:687"/>
offered to surrender upon Conditions, but whilst they treated a Storm parted them, and she was drove aground full of Water two Leagues from the Shore in the Bay of <hi>Lagoa,</hi> which is in the Lat. of 32 Deg. The Captain was forced with his own hand to kill a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom Pilot, who to save himself and 30 more would expose all the rest to perish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The Captain landed the Ammunition and Provisions with the loss of 9 Men, and marched with 260 towards <hi>Zofala,</hi> having burnt the Ship, and saved the Diamonds, Pearls, Amber and Musk. They marched in sight of the Sea, carrying the Women on their Shoulders. Having set forward the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> about the end of <hi>November,</hi> being weary of carrying those things of value, they cast into a River all the Musk.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Those who carried the Women could no longer hold out, tho' many thousand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats were promised them. A Maid not able to go a foot was left to the Mercy of <hi>Cafres,</hi> or Fury of wild Beasts. A young Man her Brother would have stayed with her, but was not permitted, and he soon after died for Grief.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Some Men died with Fatigue, and the strongest conspired to take all the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and march faster. The Captain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of it, slew him he thought to be the Ringleader of that Contrivance. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of <hi>December,</hi> those who carried four Women would do it no longer,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54711:687"/>
10000 Ducats were offered to any to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, but none accepted the offer. Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen were left behind with their Slaves who murdered them, and afterwards overtaking the Company, and being examined were hanged. Hunger forced them to eat these and others that died. The Captain <hi>Morales</hi> died, and <hi>Francis Vaz de Almada</hi> succeeded him. There were but 150 Men left, and half of them not able to fight when the King of <hi>Mocaranga</hi> assails them with 1000 <hi>Cafres</hi> and robs them, killing some. Those that escaped came to <hi>Moçambique,</hi> having travelled 500 Leagues with unspeakable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. At this time <hi>Ruy Freyre de Andrade,</hi> who had but Three hundred <hi>Portugueses</hi> in the Fort of <hi>Queixome</hi> with some of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Arabs that came afterwards, was besieged by the Sultan of <hi>Xiras</hi> with 20000 Men, and the Fort began to be undermined. <hi>Freyre</hi> defended himself with much valour; but the News being brought that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Succours were at hand, the Defendants dismayed.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>FReyre</hi> being besieged by Sea and Land, the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> being joined; <hi>Simon de Melo</hi> came from <hi>Goa</hi> with 13 Sail, rather to affront than relieve them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Commander of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what comforted <hi>Freyre</hi> in these Troubles died, and <hi>Simon de Melo</hi> by the Governor's Order succeeded him; which was another wrong done to <hi>Freyre,</hi> because according to the ancient Custom he being Admiral of that Sea ought to have succeeded. This was the Ruin of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> for had he been there it had not been lost. <hi>Freyre</hi> nevertheless de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted not from sending advice to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> which <hi>Melo</hi> slighted, relying on the Strength of the Place, though it was in no posture of Defence, the Commanders of it for many Years having only taken care to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so that there was but little Cannon, and that lay on the Ground without Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and stopped up with Earth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>English</hi> offered <hi>Freyre</hi> honourable Conditions if he would surrender, but he refused, thinking Ships would have come that Night from <hi>Ormuz,</hi> to carry him off and dismantle the Fort. D. <hi>Gonzalo de Silveyra</hi> came with only one Barque carrying some
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54711:688"/>
Ammunition, a small Relief in that Distress. <hi>Freyre</hi> seeing this, sent fresh Advice to <hi>Melo</hi> how to act in his own defence; and he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it in ill part, writ to the Governor, accusing <hi>Freyre</hi> of Arrogance and Ignorance, for pretending from <hi>Queixome</hi> to instruct and terrifie him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Freyre</hi> no longer able to withstand the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> resolved to burn the Fort, and die honourably in the Field; but his Men crying they would not cast away their Lives to no purpose, designed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him up to the <hi>English;</hi> and some leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Wall into the Sea to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>Freyre</hi> was forced to capitulate to march out on the side of <hi>Arabia</hi> with his Colours, Arms and Ammunition; the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation was not observed, for the <hi>Portugueses</hi> were stripped, the Natives delivered to the <hi>Persians,</hi> who put them to the Sword, <hi>Freyre</hi> and four Captains sent Prisoners to <hi>Surat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Melo</hi> at <hi>Ormuz</hi> thinking the Enemy would be satisfied with the taking of <hi>Quei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xome,</hi> began to treat of Peace with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> but to no effect. Above 12000 <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> came over in their Barques, and the <hi>English</hi> in 6 Ships, besieging the Town and furiously battering it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Luis de Brito</hi> agreeing with others who loved not to expose their Lives, was let down from the Wall by a Rope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Articles of Surrender with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> and returned to the Town to put them in Execution. <hi>Simon de Melo</hi> seemed to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:54711:689" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Surrender, but the Soldiers feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mutiny (for it was supposed to be done by his Direction) the Enemy entred the Town, above 2000 <hi>Portugueses</hi> of both Sexes and all Ages were sent stripped to <hi>Mascate,</hi> leaving a great Treasure, and the Honour of their Country, in the Enemies Hands.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Mean while <hi>Freyre,</hi> who was Prisoner, with the four Captains made his Escape, and having lost one of them with the other three got to <hi>Damam,</hi> thence to <hi>Baçaim,</hi> and at last to <hi>Mascate. Constantine de Sa</hi> was then there with Succours for <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and they were upon going thither when the People that were dispossessed of that Place appeared. <hi>Freyre</hi> insisted to go on, hoping to surprize the Enemy, but could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon <hi>Sa;</hi> so he went away to <hi>Goa,</hi> and Embarqued for <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. At this time the <hi>Mogol</hi> was highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected by all the Eastern Princes, and there resided at his Court several Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, who carried him rich Presents.

                     <p n="10">10. From this Island to another called <hi>Gaoxama,</hi> are 18 Leagues closer in upon the Coast of <hi>China.</hi> The Island being in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses,</hi> who had twice expelled the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> thinking them a more tolerable Evil than those Outlaws, offered them the Island if they could root out that Generation of Thieves. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> undertook and performed it without losing a Man.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Island being cleared, every one began to build where he liked best, there being no Proprietor to sell the Land, which afterwards was sold at a great Rate, the Trade and Fame of this City increasing. This caused the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to have an Eye always upon it, desiring to make themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters thereof.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. It contains about 1000 <hi>Portugues</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, all Rich, and of the best in <hi>India,</hi> because the Portions being there very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, many Persons of Quality resort thither for Wives. There is besides a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable number of Christian <hi>Chineses,</hi> who are cloathed and live after the manner of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and of Heathens, being Artificers, Shopkeepers and Merchants, about 6000. They have a Bishop and a Judge. The Duties of the Ships trading thence to <hi>Iapan</hi> amount to 300000 Xeraphins, at 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:54711:690"/>
A Xeraphin is almost a piece of Eight. The Yearly Expence of the City to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Fortifications and Garrison is above 40000 Ducats. At the Fair of <hi>Quantung</hi> is paid the like Sum for Duties, at six and seven <hi>per Cent.</hi> The Voyage of <hi>Iapan,</hi> with Embassies and Presents for the King and <hi>Tonos,</hi> costs 25000. The House called <hi>La Misericordia</hi> spends 8 or 9000 in Works of Charity. The City maintains two Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, three Parish Churches, five Monasteries, besides the continual Alms it sends to the neighbouring necessitous Christians in <hi>China, Aynam, Iapan, Tunquim, Cochinchina, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodia</hi> and <hi>Siam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. On the 19th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 17 (some say 23) Sail of <hi>Hollanders</hi> came before this City, hoping to take the Fleet that was there ready to sail for <hi>Iapan,</hi> having taken se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Chineses</hi> and <hi>Portugues</hi> Ship about the <hi>Philippine</hi> Islands. They had aboard 2000 fighting Men. Their Admiral <hi>Cornelius Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> intending to gain the City, battered the Fort of St. <hi>Francis</hi> the space of five Days. On Midsummer Day in the Morning he landed Eight hundred Men, and without much opposition made himself Master of an Intrenchment.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Enemy marched towards the City, thinking to meet no resistance, but <hi>Iohn Suarez Vivas,</hi> seeing them advance to gain a considerable Post, prevented them with 160 Men.

leaving 300 dead on the Shore; seven and their Colours were taken, one piece of Cannon, and all their Arms which they threw away when swiming to their Ships. Mean while the Ships battered the Fort, which answered so effectually some of them were sunk and 60 Men killed. This Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cost us 6 <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and some few Slaves. A <hi>Cafre</hi> Woman a Slave had share in it, who fighting in Man's Cloaths with a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard killed 3 <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. The Citizens seeing themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to such Attempts, built a Wall round the Town, with six Bastions. On that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which overtops the City, they planted six large Cannons; on that of the Bar fourteen, some 50 Pounders; eight on that of Our <hi>Lady of Good Deliverance;</hi> five on that of <hi>St. Peter;</hi> eight on that of <hi>St. Francis,</hi> that looks towards the Sea; and three on that of <hi>St. Iohn.</hi> And because the Mountain of Our <hi>Lady of the Guide</hi> overtops the Bastion of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> they fortified it, planting thereon 10 large pieces.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. This Year were computed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in <hi>India</hi> 10000 Souls.

                     <p n="1">1. IN the Year 1597, D. <hi>Alfonso de No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronna</hi> commanded the Ships that went for <hi>India,</hi> and was now chose Viceroy, as well in respect of his good Services, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>s his Birth and Experience. He set out the 29th of <hi>April</hi> with four Ships and six Galleons, of all which only one reached <hi>India,</hi> by being a little a head of the others, which were all put back to <hi>Lisbon.</hi> This makes good that notable Saying of an able Seaman, who being asked when was the best time for the Ships to Sail, answered, <hi>The last Day of</hi> February <hi>is too soon, and the first of</hi> March <hi>too late.</hi>
                     </p>

2. In fine, D. <hi>Alfonso</hi> was put back with all that Relief whereof <hi>India</hi> stood in great want; he, his Ship, and the Captain of her were used to this Misfortune, having been put in the Year before. Some would attribute this to the ill Fate of the Captain or Ship.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This was the last Governor of <hi>India</hi> named by the Pious <hi>Philip</hi> III. (but Second of <hi>Portugal)</hi> and the first that sailing from <hi>Lisbon</hi> with that Command was forced in again. D. <hi>Alfonso de Noronna</hi> was ancient and well qualified for that Post; affable and courteous, moderating the gravity of his Age. As soon as the News was brought to <hi>Lisbon</hi> of the shameful Surrender of the City <hi>Baya</hi> in <hi>Brasil</hi> to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding his Quality, Age and Commands he had bore, he listed himself a private Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel for that Service. A bravery well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving eternal Fame, and an Example that moved many to follow it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As we have hitherto reckoned the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys and Governors who were chosen, tho' they enjoyed not the Command, we will account D. <hi>Alfonso de Noronna</hi> the 24th of the former, and 45th of the latter; the 3d of the Name, and 5th of the Sirname.</p>

                        <p>Of the Propagation of the Faith in <hi>Japan,</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia</hi> about this Time.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. SOme small hints have been already given of the Progress of Christianity in <hi>Iapan,</hi> since their Apostle St. <hi>Francis Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verius</hi> began to Preach there. The Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings there are much like those in <hi>China,</hi> save that the latter has not been so much sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Blood of Martyrs.

                     <p n="5">5. In the Year 1624, another Persecution was raised at the Court by means of a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo, who becoming a Christian in hopes to grow rich, and being disappointed, became an Informer against Christians. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror gave him the Charge of Discovering them. The first apprehended were two Jesuits and a Franciscan, who being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Prison where <hi>Faramandondono</hi> the Emperor's Cousin was, Baptized there forty Persons: Fifty in all were taken out of the Prison and burnt alive. Two Gentlemen who were Christians, but not known, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present, leaped from their Horses and cast themselves into the Fire, crying, They died for the Faith. At Night Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Christians assembled and stole the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of the Martyrs. This gave occasion to a new Search, and almost Five hundred suffered. To prevent the concealing of any Religious Men, all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled <hi>Nangasaqui;</hi> and some married to <hi>Iaponese</hi> Women were parted from them. Many Natives who would not renounce the Faith were banished, and many more, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>Ozaqua,</hi> had a Cross burnt deep on their Foreheads, that they might be

known to be Christians; and they joyfully said, <hi>Now we shall be known to be Slaves of Iesus.</hi> They were turned off with that mark, and almost naked in the dead of Winter, with their Children, and many of them died.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. DON <hi>Francis de Gama</hi> Count <hi>De Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digueyra</hi> having lest the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>India</hi> much hated, and affronted, always endeavoured to obtain that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand again; not to be revenged, as some said, but to satisfie the World he had not deserved that ill Usage. Twenty Years passed before he could obtain his Desire, which was upon the Accession to the Crown of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Third of <hi>Portugal.</hi>

2. He sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> on the 18th of <hi>March</hi> with 4 Ships. Not long before him parted thence <hi>Sancho de Tovar &amp; Silva</hi> with 2 Galleons and 2 Pinks. On the Coast of <hi>Tierra de Natal</hi> a flash of Lightning falling upon the Count's Ship, burnt the Colours, and did some harm, but killed no body. Under the Line two of his Ships left him, and arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> at the end of <hi>August.</hi> The third stayed behind him; it was thought they shunned his Company designedly.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. About this time <hi>6 Dutch</hi> Ships plied near the Islands of <hi>Angoxa,</hi> one of them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in pursuit of a <hi>Portugues.</hi> The Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy standing for <hi>Moçambique,</hi> met the other five on the 22d of <hi>Iune.</hi> His other Ships had now joyned him, and there ensued a terrible Fight, which fell heaviest upon the Vice-Admiral, who was entirely disabled. The Viceroy and D. <hi>Francis Lobo</hi> rescued and brought him off. But the Ship being so much battered sunk, some Men and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney were saved, and some fell into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands. Night coming on, the Viceroy and <hi>Lobo</hi> were drove upon the Sands, and their Ships lost; they saved what Goods, Rigging, Ammunition and Cannon they could, and fired the rest, that the Enemy might make no Advantage os it. The Viceroy shipped all the Goods, and what Men he could, aboard some Galliots, and arrived at <hi>Cochim. Gonzalo de Sequeyra</hi> was gone before with his Galleon to relieve <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz,</hi> but came too late.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="323" facs="tcp:54711:695"/>
4. From <hi>Cochim</hi> he went to <hi>Goa,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there in <hi>September.</hi> His Enemies see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in that Post, were all terrified, fearing he now in Power would revenge the Affronts done to his Person, but he carried himself with more moderation than was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. The Count thought of punishing <hi>Simon de Melo</hi> and <hi>Luis de Brito,</hi> as the most guilty of the shameful loss of <hi>Ormuz. Melo</hi> was fled over to the <hi>Moors,</hi> and <hi>Brito</hi> in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; this was Beheaded, as was the other in Effigies.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Gonçalo de Sequeira,</hi> who was to have relieved <hi>Ormuz,</hi> stayed with his Galleon at <hi>Mascate,</hi> believing his Assistance necessary upon a Report that the <hi>Persians</hi> designed against that Place. Hearing the Enemy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified at <hi>Soar</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> he fitted out 7 Sail, and coming before it, expelled the <hi>Persians</hi> with much slaughter, and not without loss, because they defended it with more Valour than the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> had <hi>Ormuz. Goncalo de Sequeyra</hi> remained there, and again defeated the Enemy endeavouring to gain <hi>Mascate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> who had lain before the Bar of <hi>Goa,</hi> being gone towards <hi>Triquilimale,</hi> the Viceroy sent <hi>Constantine de Sa</hi> and <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> with a Squadron to assist <hi>Sequeyra</hi> in the Sea of <hi>Ormuz.</hi> They chased an <hi>English</hi> Ship, which got away from them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the Sea of <hi>Ormuz</hi> took two Ships of the <hi>Moors,</hi> putting them all to the Sword.</p>

7. Three Galleots of <hi>Cochin</hi> defeated some <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Pegu</hi> Ships at <hi>Paleacate.</hi> D. <hi>Francis Mascarennas,</hi> a Person of known Valour and Prudence, was sent to Command at <hi>Macao</hi> to oppose the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and quiet the Disorders that were among the Citizens. The Divisions among the Laity being made up, there began others among the Clergy about the Government of that Cathedral for want of a Bishop.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Three Ships, three Galleons, and two Pinks, sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> for <hi>India.</hi> One of the Ships returning home, was lost at the mouth of <hi>Lisbon</hi> River, the Men and some Goods saved; another perished at <hi>Moçambique;</hi> the third on the Island St. <hi>Helena,</hi> part of her Loading being taken into the other Ships, the rest fetched away from <hi>Brasil.</hi> Two of the Galleons were also cast away at <hi>Moçam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique;</hi> and a Pink, through the unskilfulness of the Pilot, on the Coast of <hi>Arabia.</hi> In these Vessels were 5000 Men, whereof many died of Sickness, besides what perished by Shipwrack.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Now begins the Year 1624, famous for the Sufferings of <hi>Gativanda</hi> Queen of <hi>Dopoli</hi> at <hi>Xiras</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> and Cruelty of the King <hi>Xa Abas.</hi> But this having relation to the Religious of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> who laboured much in the conversion of <hi>Asia,</hi> I will relate some Particulars of what they did in those Parts. They resided at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> where, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many others, the Heir of that Crown was converted, and took their Habit by the Name of F. <hi>Hierome Iaete,</hi> and afterwards
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54711:696"/>
Preached with much Zeal. With him was Baptized D. <hi>Alfonso Nordim</hi> of the Blood Royal, and his Sister D<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. <hi>Philippa Morada.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Fathers preached also with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess along the Skirts of <hi>Arabia Petrea.</hi> When <hi>Ormuz</hi> was lost, they went over to <hi>Baçora,</hi> a City subject to the <hi>Turk,</hi> below <hi>Babylon,</hi> on the Borders of <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> with Orders from the Archbishop of <hi>Goa</hi> to endeavour chiefly the Reduction of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks called <hi>Christians of St. Iohn,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Bombareca,</hi> where F. <hi>Francis</hi> of the Presentation, and F. <hi>Matthias</hi> an <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who died at <hi>Ormuz</hi> with a general Opinion of Sanctity, had been before, but with no success. After them F. <hi>Nicholas de la Vega,</hi> with the consent of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Bassa, erected there a House and Chapel.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. F. <hi>Iohn de los Santos,</hi> and F. <hi>Ioseph</hi> of the Presentation, built a Church and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and many Schismaticks were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Church. The Bassa gave them Power over all the Christians, Chaldeans, Nestorians, and Jews, and many Chaldeans were Baptized. Many Infidels, Arabs, Turks and Persians, resorted to the Convent, and some were converted. In the City and the Neighbourhood there are about 70000 Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, whereof about 5000 Christians of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> so called, because they have a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, That their Forefathers were Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the River <hi>Iordan</hi> by the Baptist.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The <hi>Portugueses,</hi> after the loss of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz,</hi> setled their Trade in this City, and founded a Seminary for Learning. The
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:54711:697"/>
Bassa very much countenanced the Religious, and seeing a Christian Soldier in love with a <hi>Moorish</hi> Woman, secured and delivered him up to them. They sent him to <hi>Mascate,</hi> she followed, was baptized, and married him. He consented that a Girl should be taken from her Mother, who seeing her go, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and both were reconciled to the Church.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The first time <hi>Vespers</hi> were sung, a Drum going about to gather the Christians, all the <hi>Moors</hi> flocked thither, in so much that the <hi>Cacizes</hi> said, This was some particular Act of Divine Providence, and cried, <q>The World must be at an end.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. These Religious first entred the Court of <hi>Ispahan</hi> in the time of King <hi>Sebastian,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards 5 <hi>Armenian</hi> Bishops, many Priests, and a multitude of People, submitted to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> The King offered the Fathers 2000 Ducats a Year, which they refused, lest it should be thought they went to enrich themselves, not to plant Religion. They were afterwards Imprisoned by the <hi>Moors,</hi> ill Treated, and sent to <hi>Xiras,</hi> 100 Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. The Governour of that Place sent them to the Convent with Fetters on their Feet, and Yoaks on their Necks. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour pretended the cause of their Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment was, That <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> had secured three <hi>Moors</hi> at <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and said, They should be set at liberty if those were restored. Brother <hi>Peter</hi> carried Advice hereof to <hi>Goa,</hi> and the <hi>Moors</hi> were released.</p>

                        <pb n="327" facs="tcp:54711:697"/>
15. The Labours of these Fathers have been very succesful in <hi>Gorgistan</hi> or <hi>Georgia.</hi> The first that undertook that Mission was F. <hi>William</hi> of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> who was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the <hi>Georgians,</hi> but put to Death by the Sultan of <hi>Fabris,</hi> and was buried by the <hi>Armenian</hi> Religious of the Order of St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. The King of <hi>Persia</hi> invading one of the <hi>Georgian</hi> Princes, he sent his Mother cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gativanda</hi> to Treat with him, who, after giving an ambiguous Answer, caused her on the way home to be apprehended, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Prisoner to <hi>Xiras.</hi> This Lady was kept in Prison 11 Years, living always a most godly Life in Fasting and Penance; her greatest Grief was, to hear that some of the Captives of her Country wavered in the Faith.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The Religious coming at that time to <hi>Xiras,</hi> greatly comforted her. The King of <hi>Persia</hi> being solicited to release <hi>Gativanda,</hi> sent to advise her to turn <hi>Mahometan,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise she must expect to endure the cruelest of Tortures. She desiring a little time to recollect herself, spent it in Prayer, and that ended, resolutely told the Officers, They might fulfill their Orders. They taking compassion, endeavoured to perswade, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her, The Torments would be insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and she replied, <q>The Delay was the most grievous Torture.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">18. Her Hands being tied, the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners put on her Head a Copper Vessel made red hot, and tore her Cheeks and Breasts with burning Pinchers. Not a Sigh came
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:54711:698"/>
from her till she was stripped to the Waste to have her Breasts cut off, looking upon it more grievous to be naked, than to endure such unsupportable Pains. Her Feet were torn, and she then fainting, they cast all the Fire upon her. Seeing she neither died nor complained, the Executioners strangled her, after having suffered alone enough to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase many the Glory of Martyrdom.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. <hi>Tamarascan,</hi> the Queen's Son, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Death of his Mother, entred <hi>Persia</hi> in a rage, and obtained several Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in 3 Years slew above 70000 <hi>Persians.</hi> At length a Peace was concluded, and he restored to all he had lost.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Two of the Religious of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> travelled towards <hi>Georgia</hi> suffered great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities in vast Desarts, in some Places near perishing in Snow. At <hi>Emanenga</hi> in <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> they were entertained by the Religious of the Order of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who reside there.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. At <hi>Ervan,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> they were courteously received by the Patriarch in a Convent of 30 Religious of St. <hi>Basil,</hi> whose Office is long, being the whole Psalter every day, and Matins at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. That Prelate was a Man of a very austere Life, gave great Alms, redeemed Captives, repaired Churches, was a great Reformer of Manners, and suppressed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Priests. He was almost Adored by the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and hearkened to the Proposal of submiting to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious found him Preaching in a Church, but
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:54711:698"/>
as soon as he saw them, he took leave of the Auditory, and went to receive them, washed and kissed their Feet, telling the People. Those were the true Apostles of Christ.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. At length our Religious entred <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> were honourably received by the King, who refused to let them kiss his Hand, but made them sit; and knowing they carried the greatest part of his Mother's Body, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself pleased above measure.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. That day they dined with the King, the next with the Queen; she and her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies went to receive the Body, and heard Mass with great attention. The King cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Mother to be buried among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Kings of <hi>Georgia.</hi> Speaking of the Pope, he said, He owned him as chief Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and had always declared him such. Being presented with two Images of our Saviour and Blessed Lady, he said, He wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped them not because they were Idols, and only honoured Pictures. One of the Fathers reprehended him, and was going away, but he held by his Habit, kissed him, and begged Pardon, affirming, He knew not what he said.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. Next day the King and Queen excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves to the Father, praying him not to depart, but to choose any Place in the Kingdom to build a Church and Monastery. He pitched upon the City <hi>Gori,</hi> which is seated in a Plain watered by two great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers well stored with Fish. The Patriarch an ancient and venerable Person, with the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54711:699"/>
Bishops and other Clergy, thought they could never sufficiently encourage the new Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. This happened about the end of the Year 1628.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. To conclude, with these Religious they laboured as much as any in <hi>China, India, Persia,</hi> and <hi>Arabia.</hi> On the 17th of <hi>May,</hi> 1626, after Noon, at <hi>Bassora</hi> was seen a Cloud rising in the East in the form of a Half-Moon, the Horns whereof seemed to inclose that City. It appeared like Smoke and Ashes, and moved with a Noise that seemed to threaten Destruction. All the Country about for the space of half an hour was quite dark, then for two hours followed such a storm of Wind and Thunder, as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified all those People. The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> fled to the Christian Church, believing that the only safe place, and crying aloud, the former, <hi>Codá, Codá;</hi> the latter, <hi>Ala, Ala;</hi> that is, <hi>God, God,</hi> without remembring <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="26">26. In the Year 1627, the Enemy surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed a Ship of ours there, and killed all the Men but three, who being carried before <hi>Hazen</hi> Governour of <hi>Humo,</hi> he offered them their Lives if they would become <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi> They answered, They were ready to die rather than do so. He caused them to be Beheaded on the 21st of <hi>December,</hi> 1628.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. In <hi>Africk</hi> these Religious baptized the Prince of <hi>Melinde,</hi> who afterwards coming to the Crown acknowledged the Pope, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Letter to him in the Year 1627, which
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:54711:699"/>
he signed by the Name of D. <hi>Hierome Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia.</hi> This was the first King that received the Faith in those Parts, which might have spread more, had not the <hi>Portugueses</hi> by their Enormities obliged this Prince to fall off from them and the Faith, as shall be seen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

Some <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships having relieved <hi>Ormuz</hi> distressed by that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Viceroy strengthened by those Ships come from <hi>Portugal,</hi> would not suffer them to depart without being visited. He sent <hi>Nunno Alvarez Botello</hi> Admiral against them with 8 Galleons. They sailed at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Year 1625, and were separated by a Storm; but six meeting <hi>Botello,</hi> appeared
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:54711:700"/>
in the Sea of <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and was received by twelve of those two Nations. The Fight was very terrible, and the Enemy having the Wind, our Admiral could not come to board as he desired. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral and Vice-Admiral being disabled, were forced to draw off. At the same time <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> having heard the noise of the Cannon came up with three Galliots, and the Enemy drew off to the Bay of <hi>Comoram.</hi> We had many Men killed and wounded, among the latter our Admiral <hi>Botello.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. About the middle of <hi>February</hi> they met again. <hi>Nunno</hi> fearing he should not be able to come to board them, sent a Challenge to their Admiral; but he not accepting of it, the Fight began, and was continued with great fury till the Enemy again drew into <hi>Comoran,</hi> having lost many Men, and we 2 Captains and 40 Soldiers. <hi>Botello</hi> went to Water at the Island <hi>Lare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

At last they thinking it time to depart drew out, and being pursued, there ensued another Fight. The Enemy fled, having lost in those three Encounters 1000 Men, and 3 Ships which were sunk; some of them carried 60 Guns.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Our Admiral gave chase, but soon lost sight of them, and went to Winter at <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> whence he set out in <hi>September</hi> with 7 Sail, whereof he lost three in a Storm, the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:54711:700"/>
Men saved. He came to an Anchor with the rest at <hi>Soveral,</hi> where he took a rich Ship of <hi>Meca</hi> that sailed with a <hi>Dutch</hi> Pass. Understanding by the Prisoners some of the Enemies Ships were at <hi>Surat,</hi> he hasted thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and found they were the same that escaped after the Fights of <hi>Ormuz</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moran.</hi> It being impossible to come at them, he provoked them by Signs, and set up a Challenge on the City Gates; but seeing they did not stir, sailed away. Not far from <hi>Damam</hi> he discovers three <hi>English</hi> Ships, and coming up with them found they were strong, and carried two Tire of Guns. They fought three days, at last the Enemy made away.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There were great Tumults at <hi>Macao,</hi> the Inhabitants of that City forcing their Commander D. <hi>Francis Mascarennas</hi> to shut himself up in the Fort, but being defeated, were pardoned by him. The <hi>Chineses</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jealous on account of the Wall built by him, it was found absolutely necessary to throw down part of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Patriarch D. <hi>Alfonso Mendez</hi> now set out from <hi>Diu</hi> for <hi>Ethiopia</hi> with 6 Fathers, and other Retinue in 3 Vessels. He landed at <hi>Bailur,</hi> a Town subject to a little King, and travelled over the Field called of <hi>Salt,</hi> because that is found there which passes in stead of Money being like small Bars. Next is the Mountain, where is another sort of reddish Salt, good against some Diseases. Travelling by night, by reason of the heat of the day, they saw an Exhalation so
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54711:701"/>
bright, it enlightned all the Country about. This was held as a good <hi>Omen.</hi> At <hi>Fremona</hi> they understood the same Light had been seen there. They travelled with greater labour to the Court, and were received with great joy by the Emperor, who soon after acknowledged the Pope's Supremacy; but this Happiness was not lasting, as shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. About this same time was discovered the famous Kingdom of <hi>Tibet,</hi> extending to the Springs of <hi>Ganges.</hi> The Natives are well inclined, and docible, zealous of their Salvation, and value Things of Devotion given them by their Priests called <hi>Lama's,</hi> who profess Poverty and Chastity, and are much given to Prayer. They have strange Customs and Ceremonies, Churches like the most Curious of ours, and some knowledge of the Christian Religion, but mixed with many Errors; they abhor the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> It plainly appears, that in former Ages they had the true Light of the Gospel. They are easie to be converted. The Country produces some Fruit like that of <hi>Europe,</hi> Rice and Wheat, and breeds Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but there is much barren. It is fit to say somewhat of their Religion and <hi>Lama's.</hi> Their Habit is a Red Cassock without Sleeves, for the Arms are naked; it is girt with a piece of Cloth of the same colour, the ends whereof hang down to the Feet; on their Shoulders a striped Cloth, which they say is the Habit of the Son of God; at their Waste hangs a little Bottle of Water.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:54711:701"/>
They keep two Fasts, in the greatest they eat but once a day, and speak not a word; necessary Affairs are expressed by Signs: In the second it is allowed to eat as often as every one pleases, but Flesh only once. They call to Prayers with Trumpets, some made with dead Men's Bones; the Skulls serve to drink out of: Of other Bones Beads are made, which they say is to put them in mind of Death. The Churches are opened only twice a Year, those who resort to them walk round three times, then enter and do Reverence to the Images. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which are some of Angels, called by them <hi>Lat.</hi> The greatest is he that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes before God for the Souls. It being painted Armed, with the Devil under its Feet, make it supposed to be St. <hi>Michael.</hi> It is not unworthy consideration, that <hi>Lamas,</hi> the Name of their Priests, begins with <hi>La,</hi> which signifies an <hi>Angel.</hi> The young <hi>Lama's</hi> go about the Towns dancing regular and modestly with Crowns, Bells and other noisy Instruments. They say, it is in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Angels, as they are painted among us, singing in Choirs. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of every month they make a Procession with black Flags, Figures of Devils, Drums and Musick, and believe this chases the Evil Spirits. Holy Water is made with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prayers, and putting into it Gold, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Rice, and is used against Devils that haunt Houses. The Country People bring to the Towns black Horses, Cows, and Sheep, over which the <hi>Lama's</hi> say many
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:54711:702"/>
Prayers, saying, the Devils endeavour to get into black Cattle. They cure the Sick by blowing on the Part afflicted. Three sorts of Funerals are used, according to the Star rules the time of Death. One is after our manner; and there are Tombs adorned with gilded Pyramids. Another is burning the Body, and of the Ashes mixed with Clay they make Images, by which they swear. Another is casting the Bodies to certain white Birds like Cranes, and this is reckoned the happiest Burial. These three Forms are used with such as are esteemed to have lived well, for others being cut in pieces are thrown to Dogs. They believe the Good dying go directly to Heaven, the Bad to Hell; but such as are indifferent between both, their Souls instantly return into noble or base Creatures, according to their deserts. They advise Fathers to give their Children the Names of filthy Beasts, that the Devil may be loth to meddle with them. They use Divination after a ridiculous manner. In fine, they acknowledge One God in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; that his Son becoming Man died, and is in Heaven; that he is God as well as his Father, and Man at the same time; that his Mother was a Woman, and gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that from the Death of the Son till that time, were about 1600 Years. They know there is a Hell, in the same manner as we do. They burn Lamps, that God may light them in the way of the other World.</p>

8. F. <hi>Anthony de Andrade,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Marquez,</hi> both Jesuits, set out for this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from <hi>Delhi</hi> in the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Country with a Caravan, that conducted Pilgrims to a famous Pagod. They passed the Kingdom of <hi>Laor,</hi> and came to the vast Mountains, whence the <hi>Ganges</hi> falls into the deep Valleys. On the way they saw many stately Temples full of Idols. The great Fatigue lessened the pleasure of seeing the variety of beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Trees, and smelling those odoriferous Flowers, on the scent whereof the Ancients said those People lived. At the Kingdom of <hi>Siranagar</hi> they saw the <hi>Ganges</hi> running over Snow, the whiteness whereof almost blinds such as travel that way.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. At the end of 50 Days they came to the Pagod on the Borders of the Kingdom of <hi>Siranagar,</hi> whither Multitudes resort to wash in a Spring so hot it is scarce tolerable, which they imagine cleanses them from Sin. There Food here is raw Flesh, and are very healthy eating much Snow. The Women there do what is the Work of Men among us, and the contrary; the Women Plow, and the Men Spin. Hence the Fathers came to the Town of <hi>Mana,</hi> and having rested, continued their Journey, almost blind with the continual travelling among Snow, till they saw the Springs of <hi>Ganges,</hi> which runs out of a great Lake. Soon after they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Kingdom of <hi>Tibet,</hi> and were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably received by Officers sent to that purpose from the King's Court at <hi>Chaparague.</hi> The King and Queen heard them with much
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:54711:703"/>
Satisfaction, and admitted their Doctrine without any dispute.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The time being come they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Siranagar,</hi> the King would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to depart till they swore they would return, and then he promised they should have liberty to Preach, and he would build them a Church, being much pleased with a Picture they left him of our Lady with our Saviour sleeping in her Arms. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers returned acccording to promise, and the King in pursuance of his built the Church with great joy, and was afterwards Baptized with the Queen, notwithstanding the Lama's for their private Ends did all they could to oppose it. The Fathers understood by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants who came from <hi>China,</hi> that it was 60 Days Journey distant from that Court, travelling through the Kingdom of <hi>Usangu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE King having ordered the Count <hi>de Vidigueyra</hi> to resign the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to D. <hi>Francis Mascarennas</hi> then gone to <hi>Spain,</hi> he committed it to D. F. <hi>Luis de Brito,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cochim.</hi> There being no account of any thing memorable in this first Year of his Government, we will go on to next. The first that occurs is what happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Ceylon.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2.

Nevertheless the City was destroyed with Fire and Sword.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The King of <hi>Achem</hi> imflamed with the Desire of recovering <hi>Malaca,</hi> contrary to the Laws of Nations, imprisoned our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador then residing at his Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Resolution, for which he lost his Prince's Favour.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Marraja</hi> ambitious by Flattery to gain his Prince's Esteem, promised the King to make him soon Master of that so much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted Town; and hereupon had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Sea given him, as <hi>Laçamane</hi> that of the Land. The King set out with a Fleet of near 250 Sail in which he carried 20000 Men, and a great Train of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. In this number of Vessels were forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seven Galleys of extraordinary Strength, Beauty and Value, all near One hundred Foot in length, and of a proportionable breadth. The King went aboard with his Treasure, Wife and Children; but upon some ill Omen the Fleet sailed without him, and came before <hi>Malaca</hi> at the beginning of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. As they landed they marched towards the Castle that is between the City and <hi>Pangor. Antony Pinto de Fonseca</hi> with 200 Men, charges them, and kills above 300 without losing a Man. <hi>Iohn Suarez Vivas,</hi> who commanded 350 <hi>Portugueses</hi> at <hi>Iller,</hi> after doing great Execution among the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy on several occasions, overpower'd by their numbers was forced to abandon that Post.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Enemy having gained Mount St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> thence battered the Fort furiously, which answered with no less liberality. The <hi>Capuchin</hi> Convent of the Mother of God was of importance to the defence of the Fort, <hi>Iames Lopez de Fonseca</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

it 50 Days, made a Sally with 200 Men defeating 2000 of the Enemy. <hi>Lopez</hi> falling sick, <hi>Francis Carvallo de Maya</hi> took that Post and defended it so well, that the Enemy was provoked to batter it with such Fury, that the Monastery was abandoned, being levelled with the Ground. Out of those Ruins the Enemy raised good Works, where <hi>Laçamane</hi> held his Quarter with 3000 Men. <hi>Maraja</hi> had another large Fort upon Mount St. <hi>Iohn;</hi> there was another towards <hi>Iller;</hi> another at St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> and so in other Places with Lines of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. They provided Boats to run up the River, and straiten the Town on all sides.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Our General <hi>Fonseca</hi> desiring to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb <hi>Laçamane,</hi> sent <hi>Vivas</hi> with 220 <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> to attack his Works. He killing 100 and the rest flying, possessed himself of the Work by Night, and retired with some of the Cannon. The King of <hi>Pam</hi> our Allye understanding the Posture of our Affairs, sent a Fleet with 2000 Men to the assistance of the Town. Next came <hi>Michael Pereyra Borallo</hi> with five Sail from St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> but all was too little to remove so powerful an Enemy, though they had lost above 4000 Men, having killed but 60 of ours. This was the Condition of the Town at the end of <hi>October</hi> when <hi>Nunno Alvarez Botello</hi> arriv'd there.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Bishop then Governor was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of this Design upon <hi>Malaca</hi> in <hi>Iune,</hi> and of the weakness of the Place, which
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54711:707"/>
required a speedy Relief. It was then the dead of Winter, and the Bishop was not very forward; so the business was put off till <hi>September.</hi> The Bishop falling sick mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Recovery of his Health, more than the Town, and was put in mind by the principal Men of <hi>Goa</hi> (moved thereto by <hi>Nunno Alvarez Botello)</hi> of the great danger that Place would be exposed to, if not spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily relieved. They desired him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point some Person who might forward that Business since sickness hindred him. He, after seeming to approve of what they said, could never be prevailed with to name any, fearing perhaps he so named would wrest the Government from him sooner than Death.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. But Death took him away about the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> that those who were Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to relieve <hi>Malaca</hi> might put their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs in Execution. That Bishop governed nineteen or twenty Months, was the Forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seventh Governor, second of the Name, first of the Sirname, and the second Prelate that had that Command.</p>

                        <p>Of the Viceroy D. <hi>Francis Mascarennas</hi> in the Year 1628, with sundry Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences at <hi>Pegu, Martavam, Prom, Siam,</hi> and other Places.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. DON <hi>Francis Mascarennas</hi> had served so well in <hi>India,</hi> that without sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting he was appointed Viceroy there, at the same time he was coming for <hi>Spain.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived here, he was sent back this Year with the same Title, and sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> with three Ships, only one of them reached <hi>India,</hi> the other two with the Viceroy were put back to <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the Viceroy's Ship a Gentleman was taken actually committing an abominable Crime, whom the Viceroy caused to be shot in pieces at the mouth of a Cannon. He He was accused of this Action, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power of Life and Death, being at that time upon his return, yet he was well recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at Court, and sworn of the Council of State of <hi>Portugal.</hi> He may be reckoned the 27th Viceroy, and 48th Governor, the 7th of the Name, and 4th of the Sirname.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Since this Gentleman not passing to <hi>India</hi> has deprived us of the worthy Actions might be expected from him, let that Want be supplied with an account of Exploits of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54711:708"/>
the Black King of <hi>Siam,</hi> in whom appeared a strange mixture of Virtues and Vices. Much has been said of him already, whereof some hints shall be given here, and all that was before omitted added.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the Year 1544, the King of the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi> by Sea and Land besieged the City <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavam,</hi> Metropolis of the great and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Kingdom of that Name, whose Yearly Revenue was 3 Millions of Gold, <hi>Chaubainaa</hi> being then King, and <hi>Nhay Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>otoo</hi> Queen thereof, who from the height of Fortune fell to the depth of Misery. The <hi>Brama</hi> Fleet consisted of 700 Sail, 100 of them great Galleys. In them were 700 <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> commanded by one <hi>Iohn Caeyro,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a Man of Valour and Conduct.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. After a Siege of 7 Months and 5 As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, wherein the <hi>Brama's</hi> lost 12000 Men; <hi>Chaubainaa</hi> found it was impossible to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that Power, Provision being already so scarce, they had eaten 3000 Elephants. He offered to Capitulate, but no Conditions were allowed by the Besieger; and therefore resolved to make use of the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> to whom he had always been very just and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable. But Man never remembers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours received in Prosperity of those he sees in Adversity.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The disconsolate King sent one <hi>Seixas</hi> to <hi>Cayero</hi> to offer, if he would receive him, his Family and Treasure into the four Ships under his Command, he would give half the Treasure to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> become his Vassal, and pay such Tribute as should
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54711:708"/>
be agreed upon, not doubting with the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of 2000 <hi>Portugueses,</hi> who should be maintained at his own Expence, to recover his Kingdom. <hi>Caeyro</hi> consulted the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and in their presence asked of <hi>Seixas</hi> what the Treasure of <hi>Martavans</hi> was; who affirmed, he had not seen all, but that of what he had two of our Ships might be loaded with Jewels and Gold, and 4 or 5 of Silver. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> envious of the great Fortune <hi>Cayero</hi> might make by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Offer, threatned to discover him to the King of <hi>Brama</hi> if he consented.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The King of <hi>Martavam</hi> surprized at this refusal, and seeing <hi>Seixas</hi> took his leave to fly the Danger that threatned the City, gave him a pair of Bracelets, excusing the smallness of the Gift, and they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards sold to the Governour of <hi>Narsinga</hi> for 80000 Ducats. Then he resolved to fire the City and, sallying with those few Men he had left, die honourably among his Enemies. But that night an Officer with 4000 Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserted to the Enemy, and discovered the Design. The King thus betrayed, Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with the Enemy for his own and the Lives of his Wife and Children, and leave to end his Days in Retirement. This and more was granted easily, because the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour designed to perform no part of the Promise.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. From the City Gate to the King of <hi>Brama's</hi> Tent was a league distance, all which way was a Lane of many thousand Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of sundry Nations, and next the Gate
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54711:709"/>
were posted the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> The first came out was the Queen in a Chair, her two Daughters and two Sons in two others. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them 40 beautiful Ladies led by as many ancient ones encompassed with <hi>Talegrepos,</hi> (a sort of Religious Men among them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited like our <hi>Capuchins)</hi> who prayed and comforted them. Then came the King guarded by his Enemies, seated on a small She-Elephant, cloathed in black Velvet; his Head, Beard, and Eye-brows shaved, and a Rope about his Neck, which moved even the Enemy to compassion.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The unfortunate King seeing the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> would not stir one foot till they were removed from that Post, and that done went on. Being come before the King of <hi>Brama,</hi> he cast himself at his Feet; but not being able to speak for Grief, the <hi>Raolim</hi> of <hi>Mounay Talaypor,</hi> Chief Priest of those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and esteemed a Saint, made an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue in his behalf, of force to have moved to Compassion any other but that obdurate King. The miserable King, his Queen, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Ladies, were secured. The two following days were spent in removing the Treasure, at which 1000 Men laboured, and it amounted to 100 Millions of Gold. The third day the Army had liberty to plunder, which lasted four days, and was valued 12 Millions. Next the City was burnt, wherein perished by Fire and Sword above 60000 Souls, besides as many made Slaves; 2000 Temples, and 40000 Houses, were laid even with the Ground. There were in the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54711:709"/>
Town 6000 Pieces of Cannon, 100000 Quintals of Pepper, and as much of other Spices.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The morning that followed this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, there appeared on a Hill called <hi>Beydao</hi> 21 Gibbets, with a strong Guard of Horse. Thither was led the Queen, with her Children and Ladies, in all making 140, and were all hanged up by the Feet. The King and 50 Men of great Quality were cast into the Sea with Stones about their Necks. The Army seeing this Barbarity, mutinied, and the King was in great danger.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. He leaving People to Rebuild the ruined City, returned to <hi>Pegu</hi> with the rest of his Army, and among them <hi>Iohn Caeyro</hi> and his 700 <hi>Portugueses.</hi> Of these, four stayed at <hi>Martavam;</hi> one of them was <hi>Iohn Falcam,</hi> who, in stead of assisting <hi>Fernan Mendez Pinto,</hi> sent by <hi>Peter de Faria</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of <hi>Malaca</hi> to confirm the Peace with the murdered King, accused him to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Town as an Enemy to the King of <hi>Brama.</hi> The Governour seized <hi>Pinto</hi>'s Vessel, and in it Goods to the value of 100000 Ducats, killed the Master and some others, and sent the rest Prisoners to <hi>Pegu.</hi> This false Dealing was not new in <hi>Falcam,</hi> for he had before forsaken the murdered King after being much honoured by him.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The King of <hi>Brama,</hi> who thought now to reap the Fruit of his Victories in Peace, was alarmed by him of <hi>Siam,</hi> who attempted to recover the Kingdom of <hi>Tangu,</hi>
                        <pb n="352" facs="tcp:54711:710"/>
which had been wrested from him. In <hi>March</hi> 1546, he embarked 900000 Men on 12000 Vessels upon the River <hi>Ansedaa,</hi> and passing out of it into that called <hi>Pichau Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacon</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> came before the City <hi>Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> The King hereof was dead, and had left a Son to inherit but 13 Years of Age, married to the King of <hi>Avaa</hi>'s Daughter, from whom he expected 60000 Men would come to his Assistance. This moved the King to press the Siege, hoping to gain the City before that Succour could come. After 6 days, the Queen offered to hold the Crown of him, and pay what Tribute he should impose, provided he would draw off from the City.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The King insisted, that the Queen should put herself into his hands with all her Treasure, but she knowing how perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious he was, resolved to defend herself. He gave several Assaults, and by the Sword in them, and a Plague that raged in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, lost 80000 Men, among which were 500 <hi>Portugueses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. This way of Assault proving so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, he raised a Mount, which overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Town, and being full of Cannon, left no place of safety to the besieged; but 5000 of them sallying, destroyed the Mount, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led 15000 of their Enemies, carried off 80 Cannons, and wounded the King, who in a rage slew 2000 <hi>Portugueses</hi> that were upon the Guard, as negligent of their Duty.</p>
                     <p n="15">
                        <pb n="353" facs="tcp:54711:710"/>
15. About the end of <hi>August, Xemin Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latay,</hi> one of the four principal Men that commanded in the City, treacherously gave him entrance, and the Place was utterly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted with Fire and Sword. Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Children cut in pieces were served as Food for the Elephants. The Queen was publickly whipped, and delivered up to the Lust of the Soldiers till she died. The young King was tied to her dead Body, and cast into the River; the same was done with 300 Gentlemen, after Stakes were drove through their Bodies.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Prince of <hi>Avaa</hi> marching to the relief of his Sister, understood what had happened, and meeting the Traytor <hi>Xemin</hi> that had betrayed her leading a great Power, they came to a Battel, in which all the <hi>Avaa's</hi> were slain to 800, having made an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble slaughter of their Enemies. The King coming up, fell upon those 800 and slew them all, with the loss of 12000 of his Army, and then beheaded the Traytor <hi>Xemin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. After this Victory he went up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Queytor</hi> with 60000 Men in 1000 Boats, and coming to the Port of <hi>Avaa</hi> about the middle of <hi>October,</hi> burnt above 2000 Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and some Villages with the loss of 8000 Men, and among them 62 <hi>Portugueses.</hi> He understood the City was defended by 20000 <hi>Moors,</hi> 30000 of which People had at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leytay</hi> slain 150000 of his Army; and that the King of <hi>Siam</hi> was preparing to come to their Relief. Upon this News he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with speed to <hi>Prom</hi> and fortified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54711:711"/>
whilst an Ambassador went to purchase Succours from the Emperor of <hi>Calaminam</hi> with rich Presents, and the offer of certain Lands.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. The Empire of <hi>Calaminam</hi> is said to be 300 leagues in length, and as much in breadth, formerly divided into 27 King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, all using the same Language, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with many Cities and great Towns, and very fruitful. In it is to be found all that <hi>Asia</hi> produces. The Metropolis is called <hi>Timpham,</hi> seated on the River <hi>Pitui,</hi> which is covered with multitudes of Boats. It is girt by two strong and beautiful Walls, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 400000 Inhabitants, the Buildings good, especially some stately Palaces with fine Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; in and about it are 2500 Temples belonging to 24 several Sects. Some use bloody Sacrifices, and some of the Priests abstain from Women, but satisfie their Lust by such ways, it were better they did not abstain. The Women are well shaped, fair and beautiful; though beautiful, they are chast, two Qualifications seldom go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Their Habit suitable to their Quality, not the Purse. The great ones are served in Gold. In their Law Suits, (O happy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try!) they use no Attorneys, Sollicitors, not Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Kingdom maintains 1700000 Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, 400000 of them Horse: 6000 Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, whereof the Emperor styles himself <hi>Lord</hi> by reason of their numerousness; his Revenue is above 20 Millions. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main some footsteps of Christianity from
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:54711:711"/>
ancient Times among them; as, that they believe the Blessed Trinity, and make the sign of the Cross when they sneeze.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. This was the Empire of <hi>Calaminnam,</hi> whither the King of <hi>Brama</hi> sent his Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador. He being returned, the King sent 150000 Men in 1300 Boats against the City <hi>Sebadii,</hi> 130 leagues distant towards the North-East. The General <hi>Chaunigrem</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost many Men in several Assaults, raised two Mounts, whence he did great harm in the City; but the Besieged sallying, killed at once 8000, another time 5000 of his Men. Let us a while leave the King of <hi>Brama</hi>'s Affairs in this condition to see what was done at <hi>Siam,</hi> in order to treat of them both together.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. The King of <hi>Cheammay,</hi> after destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 30000 Men that guarded the Frontiers, besieged the City of <hi>Guitirvam,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> who immediately ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered 500000 Men, among which were 120 <hi>Portugueses</hi> much honoured by him. This multitude was conveyed along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in 3000 Boats, and by Land marched 4000 Elephants, and 200 Pieces of Cannon. He found the Enemy had about 300000 Men, and 2000 Boats. The <hi>Siammite</hi> gave the Command of his Army to three Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, two <hi>Turks,</hi> and one <hi>Portugues</hi> called <hi>Dominick Seixas.</hi> At first the <hi>Siammite</hi> was worsted, but recovering, defeated his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, killing 130000 Men, whereof almost 40000 were good Horse. This Victory cost him 50000, but of the worst of his Army.</p>

21. This done, he marched against the Queen of <hi>Guibem,</hi> who had given the Enemy passage through her Country, and entring the City <hi>Fumbacor,</hi> spared neither Sex nor Age. The Queen being besieged in her Court of <hi>Guiror,</hi> agreed to pay a Tribute of 60000 Ducats, and gave her Son as Hostage. Then he advanced towards the City <hi>Taysiram,</hi> (whither he thought the King of <hi>Chiammay</hi> was fled) putting all to Fire and Sword, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sparing the Women; then Winter coming on, returned home.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Being come to his Court of <hi>Oiaa,</hi> or <hi>Odiaz,</hi> he was poisoned by the Queen, then big with Child by one of her Servants; but before he died, caused his eldest Son, then young, to be declared King. He left 30000 Ducats to the 120 <hi>Portugueses</hi> that served him, and ordered they should pay no Duties in any of his Ports for 3 Years to come.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. The Adulterous Queen, being near the time of her Delivery, poisoned her lawful Son, married her Servant, and caused him to be proclaimed King. But they enjoyed not the Crown long, being both slain at a Feast on the second of <hi>February</hi> by the King of <hi>Cambodia</hi> and <hi>Oya Pansiloco,</hi> with all their Adherents.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THERE being no lawful Heir to the Kingdom of <hi>Siam, Pretiel</hi> a Religious <hi>Talagrepo,</hi> bastard Brother to the poisoned King, was by common Consent received as such, in the beginning of the Year 1549. The King of <hi>Brama</hi> or <hi>Pegu</hi> (for it is the same) seeing the Affairs of <hi>Siam</hi> in Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, resolved to conquer that Kingdom. He raised an Army of 800000 Men, among which were 1000 <hi>Portugueses,</hi> 40000 Horse, 60000 Musqueteers, 20000 Elephants, 1000 Cannon drawn by as many Yoke of Oxen and Abadas, and 1000 Waggons of Ammunition drawn by Bufaloes. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> were commanded by <hi>Iames Suarez de Melo</hi> called the <hi>Gallego,</hi> who came to <hi>India</hi> in the Year 1538, in 1542 was Pyrating about <hi>Moçam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique,</hi> in 1547 was at the Relief of <hi>Malaca,</hi> and in 1549 being in the Service of this King was worth four Millions in Jewels and other things of value, had a Pension of 200000 Ducats yearly, and the Title of the King's-Brother, was supream Governour of all his Dominions, and General of his Army.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The King marched with that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious multitude, and after one repulse took the Fort of <hi>Tapuram</hi> defended by 2000 Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ammites,

putting all to the Sword, with the loss of 3000 of Men.

Another attempt was made with Elephants, but with no better success.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The King offered 500000 Ducats to have a Gate of the City delivered to him; <hi>Oya Pasiloco</hi> who commanded in the Town understanding it, opened a Gate, and sent to tell him he might bring the Money, for he was ready to receive it. The Tyrant had no answer to make, but continuing the Siege with vigour, was forced to flacken upon the coming of the new King. Five Months being spent with the loss of 150000 Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> News was brought that <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> a Man of great Parts, had rebelled at <hi>Pegu,</hi> and killed 15000 Men that opposed him. As soon as this was known in the Camp, 120000 <hi>Pegues</hi> deserted in hatred to that Foreign Ring that oppressed, and to the Insolence of <hi>Iames Suarez</hi> who commanded them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Xemindoo</hi> was of the ancient Blood Royal of <hi>Pegu,</hi> a great Preacher, and esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Saint. He made a Sermon so effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious against the Tyranny of Princes and Oppression of that Kingdom; that he was taken out of the Pulpit and proclaimed King. Whereupon he slew 5000 Brama's
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:54711:713"/>
in the Palace, seizing all the Treasure, and in a few Days all the strong Holds in the Kingdom submitted to him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Armies of the two Kings met within two Leagues of the City <hi>Pegu;</hi> that of <hi>Brama</hi> consisted of 350000 Men, <hi>Xemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boos</hi> of 600000; of the latter about 300000 were slain, and 60000 of the former. The victorious King entred <hi>Pegu,</hi> and contrary to agreement slew many, and seized great Treasures.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Mean while the City <hi>Martavam</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares for <hi>Xemindoo,</hi> killing 2000 <hi>Bramaes. Xemim</hi> of <hi>Zatam</hi> did the same in the City of that name. The King marched towards him, but he contrived to have him murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the way. This was the end of that Tyrant.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Xemim</hi> was proclaimed King by his Party, and in nine Days gathered above 30000 Men. <hi>Chaumigrem,</hi> Brother to the dead King, plundered the City and Palace and fled to <hi>Tangu</hi> where he was born. <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim de Zatan</hi> became so odious by his ill Government, that in four Months many of his Subjects fled, and some joined with <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Iames Suarez</hi> passing by a rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's House, on the Day of his Daughter's Wedding, and seeing the great Beauty of the Bride, attempted to carry her away by force, killing the Bridegroom and others
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:54711:714"/>
who came to her rescue. Mean while the Bride strangled her self.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Father expecting no Justice whilst that King Reigned, shut himself up, and never stirred abroad till <hi>Xemim de Zatan</hi> coming to the Crown, he so lamented his Wrong about the Town, that above 50000 of the People gathered about him crying out for Justice. The new King searing some worse consequence caused <hi>Suarez</hi> to be apprehended and delivered up to that Rabble.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. This was accordingly performed, and and the multitude stoning him he was in a minute buried under a heap of Rubbish. No sooner was that done, but they took the Body from under that Pile, and tearing it in pieces delivered it to the Boys to drag about the Streets, they giving them Alms for so doing. His House was plundered, and the Treasure found being much less than what was expected, it was believed he had buried the rest.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The new King <hi>Xemim de Zatan</hi> soon followed <hi>Iames Suarez,</hi> for his Subjects no longer able to bear his Cruelty and Avarice, fled in great numbers to <hi>Xemimdoo,</hi> who was now Master of some considerable Towns. He marched to the City <hi>Pegu</hi> with 200000 Men, and 5000 Elephants. <hi>Zatan</hi> met him with 800000, and the Fight was long doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, till <hi>Gonçalo Neto</hi> who with 80 <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> followed <hi>Xemimdoo,</hi> killed <hi>Zatam</hi> with a Musket Shot, which opened the way for <hi>Zemimdoo</hi> into the City, where he was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54711:714"/>
on the 3d of <hi>February 1550. Gonzalo Neto</hi> had 10000 Crowns for that fortunate Shot, and his Companions 5000.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Chaumigrem,</hi> who the Year before retired to <hi>Pegu,</hi> hearing afterwards that <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindoo</hi> was unprovided, marched against him, and obtaining the Victory brought that Crown again under the subjection of the <hi>Bramaes. Xemindoo</hi> taken some time after, was publickly beheaded.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The War began again between <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrem</hi> King of <hi>Pegu</hi> and him of <hi>Siam.</hi> The Army of <hi>Pegu</hi> consisted of 1700000 Men, among which were many <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and 17000 Elephants. All this Army came to Ruin, and the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu</hi> was made subject to that of <hi>Arracam,</hi> as was related in the 3d Chapter of the 2d Part of this Tome. The Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> though much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassed with these Invasions, held out, and in the Year 1627, whereof we now treat, was possessed by the Black King, so called because he really was so, whereas all that People is white and fair.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. This King in the Year 1621, sent an Embassy to <hi>Goa,</hi> desiring some Franciscans would come to Preach in his Kingdom. F. <hi>Andrew</hi> of the Holy Ghost went, and was much honoured by him at his Court of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaa.</hi> He not only gave him leave to erect a Church, but was himself a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p n="15">
                        <pb n="362" facs="tcp:54711:715"/>
15. This Prince was of Stature small, of an ill Presence, and of Temper in part most wicked, and in part generous. Tho' cruel Men be generally Cowards, he was most cruel and valiant; and whereas Tyrants for the most part are covetous, he was most liberal. As much barbarity as he practised in some things, he shewed as much goodness in others.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. He was not content to put Thieves and Robbers to common Deaths, but caused them to be torn to pieces in his Presence, and for his Pastime by Tigers and Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles. Understanding that a King his Vassal was about to Rebel, he shut him up in a Cage, and fed him with morsels of his own Flesh torn from his Body, and then had him fryed in a Pan. With his own hand he cut 7 Court-Ladies off at the Waste, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he said they walked too fast. He cut off the Legs of 3 others because they staid long, being sent for Money he was to give to certain <hi>Portugueses:</hi> The first suffered for going too fast, these for being too slow.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. This severity extended to brute Beasts. He cut off the Paw of a Monkey he much valued, because the silly Beast put it into a Box wherein were some Curiosities. A Horse no less esteemed had his Head cut off in the Stable before the rest, because he stopt not when he checked him. Some Crows making a noise over the Palace, he caused 500 of them to be catched, some were kill'd, others shut up, and others turned loose with Yokes about their Necks. A Tiger that did not
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54711:715"/>
immediately seize a Criminal cast to him, was by his Command beheaded as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Thus much of the wicked part of this Prince, now to speak of his Vertues. He kept his word inviolably, was rigorous in the Execution of Justice, liberal above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and very merciful to those that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted pardonable Faults. He sent a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> with much Money to <hi>Malaca</hi> to buy several Goods, he after buying them lost all at Play, and yet had the boldness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the King's Presence, who received him kindly, saying, He valued the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence reposed in his Generosity, more than all the Goods he could have brought. He shewed great respect to our religious Men, and encouraged the planting of Christianity in his Dominions. His Valour was unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Let us conclude this Chapter with a short Description of this Kingdom. Its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Name is <hi>Sornau.</hi> The extent along the Coast is about 700 Leagues, and the breadth up the Inland 260. Most of the Country consists of fruitful Plains, being watered by many Rivers: It is plentiful of all sorts of Provisions. The Hills are covered with variety of Trees, particularly abundance of Ebony, Brasil and Angelin. There are many Mines of Sulphur, Salt-Petre, Tin, Iron, Silver, Gold, Zaphirs and Rubies; much Sweetwood, Benjamin, Wax, Cinnamon, Pepper, Ginger and Cardamum, Sugar, Honey, Silk and Cotton. The King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:54711:716"/>
is about 13 Millions. In his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are almost 13000 Cities and Towns, besides innumerable Villages. All the Towns are walled, the People for the most part timorous, weak and unarmed. The Coast reaches to both Seas; on that of <hi>India</hi> are <hi>Iunzalam</hi> and <hi>Tanauzarim;</hi> on that of <hi>China, Mompolocota, Cey, Lugor, Chinbu</hi> and <hi>Perdio.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Governor <hi>Nunno Alvarez Botello,</hi> in the Year 1629.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Bishop late Governor being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, and the next Patent of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession opened, there appeared two named; D. <hi>Laurence de Cunna</hi> Commander of <hi>Goa</hi> for the Civil Government, and <hi>Nunno Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez Pereyra</hi> for the Military. Of this last Name there were two in <hi>India,</hi> or none; for if D. <hi>Nunno Alvarez Pereyra,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man well known, was meant, there wanted the Title of Don; and if <hi>Nunno Alvarez Botello,</hi> the Sirname was wrong.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It was thought unlikely the Title of Don could be omitted through a mistake, because in <hi>Portugal</hi> it is peculiar to some Families only, and therefore could not be forgot. The mistake as to <hi>Nunno Alvarez Botello</hi> was more probable, because he had
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:54711:716"/>
long gone by the Name of <hi>Pereyra,</hi> in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his Grandfather <hi>Alvarez Pereyra,</hi> and changed <hi>Pereyra</hi> for <hi>Botello</hi> when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited the Estate of his Father <hi>Botello;</hi> yet some called him by the one, and some by the other Name. For this Reason, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Counsel of <hi>Goa,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Linnares</hi> when he came to <hi>India</hi> allowed <hi>Nunno Alvarez Botello</hi> as such, I have given him this Place among the Governors of <hi>India.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Nunno Alvarez Botello</hi> zealous of the Honor of his Country, and considering how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Delays might prove to <hi>Malaca</hi> then in distress, undertook the Relief of that Place, saying, he would refer the Decision of the Debate about his or the others Right to the Government till his return. Nevertheless by general Consent he went with the Title of Governor. Afterwards it was concluded by the Counsel of <hi>Goa,</hi> that <hi>Gonçalo Pinto de Fonseca</hi> the High Chancellor, should have the Charge of the Administration of Justice. Thus the whole Government was divided between <hi>Cunna, Fonseca,</hi> and <hi>Nunno.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Nunno</hi> now admitted as Governor, left the Palace to go live upon the Shore, to be the more at hand to forward the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for his Design, wherein he used such Diligence, that having that Charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him on the 2d of <hi>August,</hi> by the beginning of <hi>September</hi> he had gathered 900 <hi>Portugueses,</hi> a good Train of Artillery, store of Arms and Ammunition, and had 30 Sail ready to put to Sea, if the Weather had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="366" facs="tcp:54711:717"/>
5. He set Sail the 22th of <hi>September,</hi> and was in 4 Storms; 2 of them so terrible, they all gave themselves for lost. In this manner he sailed to <hi>Pulubutum,</hi> and sent 2 Vessels to give notice of his coming at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca,</hi> but came himself before the Advice, and understood that <hi>Michael Pereyra Botello</hi> sent by the Bishop late Governor was there before him. At <hi>Pulubutum</hi> he found a Vessel of <hi>Cochim,</hi> and two of <hi>Negapatan,</hi> which was some addition to his Fleet. On the 22th of <hi>October</hi> after Noon, the Fleet arrived at <hi>Malaca</hi> divided into 3 Squadrons, <hi>Nunno</hi> commanded one, the Vice-Admiral <hi>Coello</hi> and D. <hi>Hierome de Silveyra</hi> the other two. <hi>Laçamane</hi> was strangely surprized, because his Fleet was then in the River <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,</hi> a League from the Fort, whence they could not escape ours.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Our General landed and gave the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Orders, then imbarquing again entred the River through showers of Bullets, which he repaid so effectually, that the Enemy the same Night abandoned their advanced Works, retiring to those of the Capuchin Monastery. There was not Water enough in the River <hi>Pongor</hi> for our Ships, therefore our General put what Men he could aboard 33 Balones or Balames, lighter Vessels, and with them went in Person to view the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Strength.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Enemy in care for their Galleys, quit their Works at <hi>Madre de Dios</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and with wonderful Expedition cast up others. <hi>Nunno</hi> attacks them, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54711:717"/>
so much advantage, he proposed to the Enemy to surrender, <hi>Marraja</hi> returned a civil and resolute Answer.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. His Case being desperate, he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to escape by Night in the lesser Vessels, leaving the main Fleet to our disposal, but was discovered and prevented by the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and bravery of <hi>Beltasar Mendez Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez de Evora,</hi> who cut off many of his Men, not without some Loss, whereof was no small part that of his own Arm. Our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor understanding the Enemy resolved to make use of their formidable Galleys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive them, and perceiving that called <hi>The Terror of the World</hi> move, sent <hi>Francis Lopez</hi> Admiral of our Galleys to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack her: He pierced through Clouds of smoke, and millions of Bullets, boards, and after two hours fight makes himself Master of her, killing 500 of 700 Moors she car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, with the loss of seven of his own Men.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. On the 25th of <hi>November</hi> the Enemy firing a Galley that was full of Women brought to People <hi>Malaca,</hi> and now sent to People Hell, again attempted to break through our Fleet, but without success, many of them were taken, and many leaping into the Water fled to the Woods, where they were devoured by wild Beasts. <hi>Laçamane</hi> hanging out a white Flag, sent Commissioners to treat with <hi>Nunno,</hi> who answered, <hi>No Treaty could be allowed, till they delivered our Ambassador</hi> Peter de Abreu, <hi>whom they kept
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:54711:718"/>
Prisoner.</hi> But they delaying, our Cannon began again to play furiously.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The last Day of <hi>November</hi> our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor understood <hi>Marraja</hi> was killed, and at the same time, that our Allye the King of <hi>Pam</hi> was coming with 100 Sail to his assistance. <hi>Nunno</hi> went to visit him, and his Mother who came with him, and was received with the greatest Ceremonies used by those Eastern Princes to our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors. Presents were sent reciprocally, and <hi>Nunno</hi> returned to his Post. The Enemy played their Cannon so desperately, it made our Men abate of their Confidence, but on the 4th of <hi>December</hi> sent our Ambassador <hi>Abreu</hi> with Proposals, only desiring 3 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys of all their Fleet to carry off 4000 Men that were left of 20000 that came before the Town.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. It was answered, they must imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately surrender upon promise of Life. Whilst <hi>Laçamane</hi> doubted, <hi>Nunno</hi> assaults him, and forcing all his Works puts many to the Sword; some flying to the River are drowned, others in the Woods become food to the wild Beasts. In fine, <hi>Nunno</hi> obtain'd the most glorious Victory the <hi>Portugueses</hi> ever had in <hi>India;</hi> for of all that Fleet not one Vessel got off, and of that great Army not a Man escaped being killed, or taken. The Booty was such, all our Men were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, and <hi>Nunno</hi> reserved for himself nothing but a Parrot much valued by <hi>Laça<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">

12. He distributed the Cannon that was taken among the Forts of <hi>India,</hi> the Galleys and Slaves among the Religious, and so the rest to others. This done, he entred the City in Triumph, not that he desired it, having begged they would suffer him to go alone and barefoot, to prostrate himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord of Hosts, and acknowledge this Victory was wholly his, and not of the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> but he was forced to submit to the Will and Intreaties of the City.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Streets were thronged with Men, the Windows and tops of Houses with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, sprinkling sweet Waters, and strewing Flowers upon our Hero. The Musick could not be heard for the noise of Cannon, and all the City was filled with Joy. The like Demonstrations were afterwards in all our other Eastern Conquests.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. This done, the Governor returned aboard, having other Designs in hand. Then came an Embassy from the King of <hi>Pera</hi> Tributary to him of <hi>Achem</hi> now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, he offered to pay our Crown the Tribute, he had till then paid the other, and to deliver up great Riches left in his Custody belonging to that King and the General <hi>Laçamane.</hi> D. <hi>Dierome de Silveyra</hi> was sent with 11 Ships to receive the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and established the Peace, which he performed, and returned with all that had been promised. It was applied to pay the Men, and refit the Fleet.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The King of <hi>Pam</hi> came to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Victory, and <hi>Nunno</hi> set out to meet
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:54711:719"/>
him. Great Civilities and presents passed between them, and the King desired leave to see the City, which was granted, and whilst he was there nobly entertained, the Magistrates and Officers went to visit his Mother, a wise Woman, and great lover of the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> These Ceremonies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, <hi>Nunno</hi> resolved to sail towards the Streight of <hi>Cingapura,</hi> to secure the Ships that were expected from <hi>China</hi> against the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> The King kept him Company a little way, and they parted on the 11th of <hi>December, Nunno</hi> earnestly recommending to him the taking of <hi>Laçamane,</hi> who was fled into the Woods, and the King promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his utmost endeavours, after which they steered several Courses.</p>

He returned to <hi>Malaca</hi> to refit his Ships, and resolved to attempt the Fort of <hi>Iacatara,</hi> the best those Rebels possest in <hi>Asia.</hi> But first he sent <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony de Sousa Coutinno</hi> with <hi>Laçamane</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Galley, called <hi>The Terror of the World,</hi> in which he was Prisoner in order to be sent to <hi>Spain,</hi> the Galley went of a Present to the City <hi>Goa.</hi> This Galley carried one Gun of Tambaca, a precious sort of Metal, which was valued at above 7000 Ducats, another much more for its curious Workmanship. <hi>Laçamane</hi> died before he could be brought to <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Nunno</hi> understanding the new Viceroy, the Count <hi>de Linnares,</hi> was arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> gave him an account of what had been done, and desired assistance and his approbation to continue in those Parts, in order to carry on his Designs against the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi> About the end of <hi>April</hi> the Viceroy sent all he desired and much more, which was a full Power to act as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:54711:720"/>
without being obliged to expect any Orders from <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Mean while <hi>Nunno</hi> sailed with 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> Ships towards the Streight of <hi>Cingapura.</hi> Putting in at <hi>Iambe,</hi> a Place abounding in Pepper, and therefore much resorted to by our <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Enemies, after a stout opposition he took two large Ships, the least whereof, with the Prisoners, was sent to <hi>Malaca.</hi> Then sailing up the River, he discovered another Ship so large and beautiful, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed it to make his entrance into <hi>Goa,</hi> but a Bullet falling into the Powder, blew her up. Passing farther up, several of the Men seeing the Water cool and clear, and not knowing its venomous quality, drank of it and died.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They spent 22 days going up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with much trouble. About two leagues from them was the Town where the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> had two Ships under shelter, and our Admiral was desirous to take them. He manned 14 light Vessels to go view the Place and Works; 26 Sail of the Natives and <hi>Dutch</hi> met him, and were put to flight.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Having viewed the Works, and found it not practicable to attempt the two Ships by reason of the shelter they were under, he destroyed all the Neighbouring Places with Fire and Sword, then sailed down the River designing for <hi>Iacatara.</hi> By the way he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship of 24 Guns laden with Powder for their Forts. Our Vessels beset and boarded her, and she took fire.</p>

7. <hi>Nunno</hi> understanding the Danger, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Ships to draw off, lest the Enemy's blowing up some of them might be lost with it. Finding D. <hi>Antony Mascarennas</hi> did not bear away from her, he made to him with his Galliot to bring him off; but coming about the Poop of the Enemies Ship, she blew up, and sunk his Galliot downright. All our Vessels made to that place, and of all that was in the Galliot, they found nothing above Water but the Body of <hi>Nunno Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> as yet with some life, which soon fled.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Every body was astonished at this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Accident, the Body was opened to be embalmed, and his Heart was found to be of an extraordinary bigness. At <hi>Malaca</hi> the Body was received with a general La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the whole City, and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly buried in the Church of the Jesuits.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Nunno Alvarez</hi> was well shaped, of a clear Complexion, his Hair yellow, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tall, and Limbed proportionably, his Srength and Valour equal, his Countenance pleasing and grave. He was virtuously incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, addicted to Learning, chiefly Poetry, very Liberal, and not known to be addicted to any Vice.</p>
                     <p n="10">10.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Government of the Viceroy D. <hi>Michael de Noronna</hi> Count <hi>De Linnares,</hi> from the Year 1629, till 1635.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THis Year sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> D. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael de Noronna</hi> Count <hi>de Linnares,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>India,</hi> with three Ships and six Galleons. One of them was cast away near the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1629.</note> and not a Man of 400 that were aboard saved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the Count arrived at <hi>Goa, Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Alvarez Botello</hi> was gone for <hi>Malaca,</hi> and all Men promised themselves good success, when about the beginning of the Year came
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:54711:721"/>
the News of the Victory by him obtained. The Viceroy returned Thanks to the King of <hi>Pam</hi> for the Succours he carried to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca,</hi> and sent him Presents. In the same manner he endeavoured to oblige the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Kings, and honoured the Admiral <hi>Antony Pinto de Fonseca</hi> for his good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Constantine de Sa,</hi> who Commanded in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> puffed up with the Honour of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving destroyed the City <hi>Candea,</hi> and relying too much upon the Fidelity of the Christian <hi>Chingala's,</hi> who underhand held Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with that King for our Destruction, gave too much Credit to <hi>Theodosius</hi> their Captain, by whom his Head was promised to the King, at the same time he promised D. <hi>Constantin</hi> to deliver the King into his hands. D. <hi>Constantin</hi> had more faith in that Traytor than in the <hi>Franciscan,</hi> who being among the Enemy sent him intelligence, or in his own Officers who foresaw his Ruin, which soon followed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He marched from <hi>Columbo,</hi> leaving that Fort with almost no Garison, entred the Kingdom of <hi>Uva</hi> with 400 <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and destroyed the Capital City. As he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned after this Victory, the King of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> who had left that Town as a Bait to draw him on, meets him with a great Power. D. <hi>Theodosius</hi> and his <hi>Chingala's</hi> no sooner discovered the King's Forces, but they went over to him and faced the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> whom they served the moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="376" facs="tcp:54711:722"/>
5. The 400 <hi>Portugueses</hi> and 200 Natives that remained with them fought three days with incredible bravery. The General D. <hi>Constantin</hi> having done more than Man, was slain, and then his Men being broke, many were put to the Sword, and many made Prisoners. The King of <hi>Candea</hi> understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding how weak the Garison of <hi>Columbo</hi> was, sate down before it with 50000 Men, and a number of Elephants, believing the Natives had (as was agreed) murdered those few <hi>Portugueses</hi> left there. But they seeing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their General, had destroyed those were to kill them, and so the King was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. The Death of D. <hi>Constantin</hi> being known, <hi>Lancelot de Seixas</hi> succeeded him in the Command, and being in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, did more than could have been expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from so small a Force.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. He distributed 400 Men, which was his whole Strength, including the Religious, among the most important Posts, who beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themselves so well, the King found he had a harder Task in hand than at first he had imagined. But Hunger was a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemy within the Walls, than the other without. This was much increased by the useless multitude of Women and Children, notwithstanding D. <hi>Philip Mascarennas</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of <hi>Cochin</hi> sent a Ship loaden with Provision and Ammunition to their Relief, D. <hi>Blas de Castro</hi> five from St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the Viceroy one. Yet all their Hope was in <hi>Nunno Alvarez Botello,</hi> not knowing, as yet, of his unfortunate End.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="377" facs="tcp:54711:722"/>
7. The Inhabitants of <hi>Cambolim à Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sula,</hi> 40 leagues from <hi>Goa,</hi> and in sight of <hi>Cananor,</hi> offered the Viceroy leave to build a Fort there upon certain Conditions. <hi>Iames de Fonseca,</hi> Commander of <hi>Zofala,</hi> was sent to carry on that Work. Being begun, it was interrupted by <hi>Virabadar Hayque,</hi> the Usurper of the Kingdom of <hi>Canara.</hi> After much opposition, finding it could not be obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, he made a Virtue of Necessity, and seemed to be well satisfied it should go on. <q>The principal Article of the <hi>Cambolims</hi> was, That no Religious, but those of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> should be sent thither.</q> At this time arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Goa</hi> two Ships from <hi>Portugal,</hi> one of them returning, was lost upon the Bar of <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. It is, doubtless, those who are destined to perish unfortunately, meet their Fate even where they thought to find their safety; this will appear by the loss of the Ship St. <hi>Gonzalo,</hi> some of the Men whereof being taken up by that mentioned in the last Paragraph, were cast away in her; I will therefore give some account of the loss of the said Ship St. <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalo,</hi> in relation to the other. This Vessel having set out from <hi>Goa</hi> with two others, finding, after being parted from her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that she could not be kept above Water, they made the shore, and came to an Anchor in the Bay called <hi>Formosa,</hi> for its largeness being 3 leagues over, exposed to no Winds but the East, North-East, and South-East, and lies near the Cape of <hi>Good Hope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="378" facs="tcp:54711:723"/>
9. Being come to anchor, they ought whilst the Weather favoured to have landed the Men and Goods that were not before cast overboard; but in stead of that, at the persuasion of some Officers, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to suck the Ship dry in order to sail again. Three Men were let down one after another to clear the Pump, and returned not; then a fourth being put down with a Rope about him, and brought up almost dead, it appeared the Steam of the Pepper which had taken wet killed them.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. In order to refit the Ship, 100 Men landed, and 130 remained aboard, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 50 days perished together with the Ship, by a sudden Storm being beaten to pieces upon the Coast. The 100 Men left ashore built Huts, because it would be long before they could find the means of going to Sea, which were only by building two small Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels out of the Wreck and the Trees on the Mountain. The Captain being old and sick, gave the Men leave to choose another, and they pitched upon <hi>Rocque Borges,</hi> who beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself well; but one <hi>Simon de Figuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redo,</hi> in that misery ambitious of Command, endeavouring to kill him missed his Design, yet grievously wounded him, but <hi>Borges</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering, stabbed him, and all was quiet again.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. They sowed some Seeds, and reaped the Fruit; mean while they lived upon Rice that had been saved, some Fish taken, and Cows and Sheep they bought of the Natives for Iron. The Language of these Natives
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:54711:723"/>
could not be understood, therefore they had recourse to Signs. They are not quite black, go naked, cover their Privy Parts with a Skin, in Winter wear Cloaks of the same, about their Necks hang Bulls Pizles, their Bodies anointed with the Dung of those Beasts, they make sudden stops in their Speech, carry Fox tails in their Hands to make Signs with; have no Towns, but wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with their Cattle like the Hords of <hi>Arabs;</hi> some carry Stakes and Mats to make a sort of Tents; they use no Tillage, and offered our Men a Cake that seemed to be made of Meal of Roots mixed with Cow-Dung; they eat Flesh, but almost raw, just shewed to the Fire, which is made by rubbing Sticks together; their choicest Food is the Guts and Tripes, the Filth only squeezed out; their Weapons are Darts and Bows, no sign of Religion was discovered among them. But it was observed, that on <hi>Midsummer</hi> or St. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>'s Day they appeared crowned with Garlands of sweet Herbs and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Soil is fruitful, free from Stones, produces all sorts of Herbs, Plants, sweet Flowers, and variety of Trees. It is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by great Rivers, and many Springs. The <hi>Spring</hi> begins in <hi>November. Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> in these Parts, as also in <hi>India,</hi> are not caused by the Sun coming near or going from the <hi>Zenith</hi> as in <hi>Europe,</hi> but by the Winds. It is <hi>Winter</hi> when it rains, and then the Sun is in his greatest Altitude; when in his greatest Declination it rains
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:54711:724"/>
not, and then it is <hi>Summer. Winter</hi> begins about the end of <hi>May,</hi> when the West Wind reigns, which brings great Rain, and lasts till <hi>September,</hi> during which time all Navigation ceases. From <hi>September</hi> till <hi>May</hi> the North East Winds blow, which keep a serene Sky, and this is the Summer when all put to Sea. Let us return to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of that Country, and our Men there.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. There is an infinite number of wild Beasts, and those very large, as Deer, Wolves, Sea-Horses, Bufaloes, wild Boars, Monkeys, Tigers, and Elephants, and some Rabbets not unlike our Ferrets. They have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wild Turkeys, Geese, Pigeons, Turtles, and Partridges, which last build their Nests hanging on Branches of Trees. Thus much of the People and Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Cape of <hi>Good Hope.</hi> There lived our Shipwreck'd <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and had erected a sort of Church where Mass was said, and there were frequent Sermons, five Priests being in that Company.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Ships being built, in stead of Tar they made use of Benjamin and Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incense; and wanting Oyl to dissolve them, supplied it with that of Sea-Wolves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their departure they erected a Cross on the top of a Mountain, with an Inscription signifying their Misfortune. The Vessels were launched, the Men and Goods shipped, one Party designing for <hi>Portugal,</hi> the other for <hi>India.</hi> The former, after some days fruitless labour, were almost in the same
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:54711:724"/>
place they set out from, and in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were taken up by <hi>Antony de Sousa &amp; Carvallo</hi> in that Ship which, as was before said, afterwards perished.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. D. <hi>Nunno Alvarez Pereyra</hi> was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of <hi>Moçambique,</hi> and died this Year. D. <hi>Philipa Christian</hi> was Emperor of <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motapa,</hi> with whom we were in league. A <hi>Cafre,</hi> called <hi>Capranzirle,</hi> rebelled against him, who falling upon a Body of our Men as they marched to <hi>Tete,</hi> slew 300 <hi>Portugueses,</hi> the chief cause whereof was a Dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Captains about Superiority. All had been lost but for <hi>Christopher de Brito &amp; Vasconelos,</hi> who put a stop to the Current of the Victorious Enemy. <hi>Iames de Sousa &amp; Meneses</hi> commanded <hi>Moçambique</hi> at that time in the Place of <hi>Pereyra.</hi> Soon after it was known the <hi>Cafre</hi> died of a Musket Shot he had received, and a Brother of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror but 13 Years of Age, and a Christian, baptized by the <hi>Dominicans</hi> by the Name of <hi>Dominick,</hi> was proclaimed King.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. About the end of this Year a great <hi>Danish</hi> Ship entred the Port of <hi>Coulam. Emanuel de Camara &amp; Noronna</hi> Admiral of the <hi>Canara</hi> Coast went to meet her with a Galley and eight other Vessels, she fled, he gave her chace, and coming up after a sharp Dispute, fired and then took her; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of her was carried to <hi>Coulam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. In <hi>April</hi> 1631, D. <hi>Blas de Castro,</hi> who commanded 12 Sail at <hi>Negapatam,</hi> took a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship, and soon after in a Storm lost half his Ships, and about 100 <hi>Portugueses,</hi>
                        <pb n="382" facs="tcp:54711:725"/>
who got ashore, were left in slavery. The excessive Covetousness of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> keeping the Prices of Spice so high, moved our European Enemies to seek it at a cheaper Rate in <hi>India,</hi> and their Insolencies inclined the <hi>Indians</hi> to receive those <hi>Holland</hi> Rebels into their Ports. Covetousness couched under the Pretence of Religion, carried the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> to conquer those remote Countries; and the insatiable Avarice of some expels and makes them esteemed less than Rebels and Pyrats.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Two Ships that sailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> for <hi>India,</hi> after five Months Voyage were put back into the same River, having lost many Men by sickness. In <hi>November</hi> sailed two Pinks. The Viceroy desiring to recover <hi>Ormuz,</hi> sent <hi>Dominick de Toral</hi> and <hi>Valdez</hi> a a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to view the Place, and confer with <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> then at <hi>Mascate</hi> about it, but it came to nothing. However a Fort was built at <hi>Iulfar,</hi> a Fishery of Pearl 50 Leagues distant from <hi>Mascate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. This Year our European Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ranging the Seas without any <note place="margin">1632.</note> opposition took many of our Ships, and ruined our Trade. Besides they incensed the <hi>Indian</hi> Princes against us, we having no body at those Courts to disappoint their Designs. The Ruine of our Affairs proceeds from the little regard the great ones have for the lesser sort; and the covetousness of the small ones, which made them forget their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and their Honour.</p>

He sailed from <hi>Goa</hi> on the 17th of <hi>November</hi> 1624, and at <hi>Chaul</hi> received a Letter from the Emperor, Congratulating his arrival in <hi>India.</hi>

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:54711:726"/>
of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1625. The Emperor much rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the News of his arrival, and sent two Men of great Quality to Conduct him, but could not then see him, being in the Field with his Army against certain Rebels. On the 6th of <hi>February</hi> 1626, he was sent for by the Emperor to the Army. The Prince accompanied by the Viceroys and Nobility, went out to meet and conduct him through a Lane of 18000 Men to a Tent provided for his reception. There he put on his Pontifical Robes, and being mounted on a Horse led by the Emperor's High-Steward <hi>Sarta Christos,</hi> and under a Canopy held up by Viceroys and Lords, went to the Church, where the Emperor sitting in a rich Chair, with a Crown of Gold on his Head, and rich Cushions at his Feet, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. The Emperor rising embraced him, and then all the Cannon was fired.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Emperor went to his Palace, the Patriarch to the Habitation of his Religious, and having put off his Pontifical Ornaments returned to Court. The Emperor made him sit, expressed much Joy for his coming, and appointed a Day for all the Nobility to meet and make their publick Submission to the Sea of <hi>Rome. Wednesday</hi> the 11th of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> being the Day prefixed, the Emperor and Patriarch were equally seated, and there appeared before them all the Princes, Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys, Lords, Commanders, Priests, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, Masters and Lawyers. The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch made an Harangue to them, which was answered in the Emperor's name by his
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:54711:726"/>
Nephew and High-Steward Viceroy of <hi>Semen Melcam Christos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Speeches ended, the Emperor turning to the Patriarch said, <q>I would not have your Lordship believe the thing I am going about is newly thought of, for it is long since I made my Submission to to his Holiness by the means of Father Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, who is here present.</q> Then the Patriarch opening a Missal, or Mass-Book, the Emperor knelt and swore in these words. <q>We <hi>Sultan Segued,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> do believe and confess, That St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Prince of the Apostles, was by our Lord Jesus Christ constituted Head of all the Christian Church throughout the World, when he said to him, <hi>Tu es Petrus &amp; super hanc Petram edificabo ecclesiam meam, &amp; tibi dabo claves regni coelorum;</hi> and again, <hi>Pasce oves meas.</hi> We believe and confess that the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> duly elected, is the true Successor of St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle, and has the same Power, Dignity, and Supremacy over all the Catholick Church. And we do Promise and Swear to give true Obedience to, and humbly submit our selves and our Empire at the Feet of the Holy Father <hi>Urban,</hi> by the Grace of God the Eighth, and our Lord: So help us God and the Holy Evangelists.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. All there present Swore in the same manner, and that done they took an Oath to the Prince as Heir apparent. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror allotted the Patriarch more and better Lands than his Predecessors had enjoyed,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:54711:727"/>
and sent him a Present of 2000 Crowns. There was a great resort of <hi>Ethiopians</hi> to be instructed in the true Catholick Doctrine, their greatest difficulty was to be satisfied with one Wife, and fast Lent; nevertheless the number of Converts in a few Days amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to 100000.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Emperor after this taking the Field against the Rebels, subdued them, kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above 100000. Still the Empress con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued obstinate, and was a great favourer of the Schismaticks. In the Years 1627 and 1628, above 160000 were converted. There were nine Residencies of the Jesuits, and in them above 200000 Communicants.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Who would imagine this same Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Sultan Segued,</hi> who had given such evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Signs of a real Conversion, should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to root out the Faith in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. The same Emperor on the 24th of <hi>Iune</hi> 1632, by publick Proclamation banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Catholicks, and gave free liberty to all his Subjects, to return to their antient Ceremonies and Errors.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The chief Motives of this great Change, were the natural inconstancy of the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> and their Inclination to Judaism. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Proclamation for banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 4 <hi>Portuguezes</hi> suffered Martyrdom; nor were there wanting <hi>Ethiopians</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained constant, notwithstanding the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Edicts. Thus ended the great hope of reducing the Emperor to the Church.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Continues the Government of the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy D. <hi>Michael de Noronna,</hi> Count <hi>De Linnares.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. IN its proper place we said the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> would one day pay for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence wherewith they treated the Kings of <hi>Mombaça,</hi> and now the Day is come, which was the 15th of <hi>August. Peter Leytam de Gamboa</hi> was Commander of that Fort, who using that King as if he had been his Slave, provoked him to revolt, and deliver himself from the Tyranny he was under. The King was D. <hi>Hierome Chingulis,</hi> who being bred a Catholick at <hi>Goa</hi> under the Religious of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> had submitted to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as was related in the Year 1627. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his Father's Death, who was cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murdered by the Commander <hi>Simon de Melo Pereyra,</hi> was no small incentive to stir up the King.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He used often to visit his Father's Tomb, and was once observed by a <hi>Portugues,</hi> who seeing him weep, and use some Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies he thought savoured of Mahometa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, gave an account thereof to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander <hi>Gamboa,</hi> who told him privately, he would the next Day secure and send the King to <hi>Goa.</hi> As soon as that Man heard it,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:54711:728"/>
he acquainted the King by whose Order he was slain in a Wood by the Cafres.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The King having dispatched that <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugues,</hi> gathered 300 Cafres, and entring the Fort as it were to visit the Captain, slew him and all the Guards, making himself absolute Master of the Place. The Wife and Daughter of the Commander were killed with a Priest, for refusing to renounce the Faith.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This done, the King in his Fury put all the <hi>Portugueses</hi> to the Sword, and fired their Town. Some few escaping to the Convent of the <hi>Augustins,</hi> held out 7 Days, when for want of Provision they surrendred upon promise of their Lives, but were all with their Wives and Children shot to Death. Then the King declared himself a <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>tan,</hi> affirming he had long hated the name of a Christian. This was the effect of the <hi>Portugues</hi> Villanies; for could he have lived among them, he had never proceeded to commit all these Murders.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. After gathering the Plunder of the Dead, the King came out a Horseback to view the Bodies of the slain, which were 60 with their Families. Some of the Converts died among the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> the rest being assembled in the Church the King made a Speech, advising them to return to their old Religion, which some of the Auditory did; such as refused were sent to <hi>Meca</hi> with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize to be sold in order to bring some <hi>Turks</hi> to his Assistance. All was sent in a good Ship, which returned with a Flag; the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:54711:728"/>
Cazices or Priests of theirs said, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them against all Enemies, being set upon the Fort.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The King putting to Death all that would not renounce the Faith, only spared his Queen who was a Native of <hi>India,</hi> and that at the request of his Aunt, but treated her as a Slave, and it was said afterwards, when he fled to <hi>Arabia,</hi> he prevailed with her to turn Mahometan. In fine, all that belonged to the Church was profaned, and then the King applied himself to carry his Revenge farther, advertising the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings of what he had done, and advising them to kill all the <hi>Portugueses</hi> in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Those of <hi>Montangante, Tanga</hi> and <hi>Motone</hi> put it in Execution; others sent him Succors. <hi>Manazonga</hi> King of the <hi>Mozungoes,</hi> came in Person to his Assistance.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The News of the Loss of <hi>Mombaça</hi> being brought to <hi>Goa,</hi> all Men of Sense ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admired it had been kept so long, than that it was now lost, being sensible of the reason there was to expect it: However im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate care was taken for the recovery of it. The Viceroy fitted out a Galley, a Pink, 7 Galliots, and 7 other Vessels, carrying 500 <hi>Portugueses</hi> and his Son, who being too young for that Command, it was given to D. <hi>Francis de Moura,</hi> a Man well versed in the Affairs of <hi>India.</hi> He sailed from <hi>Goa</hi> about the middle of <hi>December,</hi> came to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paza</hi> on the 2d of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and was <note place="margin">1632.</note> there informed of the Posture of those Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs by certain <hi>Portugueses.</hi> On the 10th
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:54711:729"/>
he arrived at <hi>Mombaça,</hi> and was joined by 3 small Vessels sent from <hi>Mascate</hi> by <hi>Ruy Freyre</hi> with 100 Men; <hi>Adam Barbosa</hi> and <hi>Martin Lorenco</hi> brought 20 Men at their own charge. The Cities of <hi>Chaul</hi> and <hi>Baçaim</hi> sent each a Vessel, in which were 30 Soldiers; so the number of Sea and Landmen was made up to 800. It soon appeared this Fleet would not be very successful; for whereas they might have taken or burnt some Ships of the Enemy that were in the Harbour, they did neither, every-Captain striving to execute it, it was omitted by all.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. D. <hi>Francis</hi> began to land some Men with difficulty, because the Sea ran high, and on the 11th of <hi>Ianuary</hi> went in his Boat with the Viceroy's Son to view the Channel of <hi>Marepa,</hi> leaving five Vessels there to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any resort from the Continent to the Island. Five Men deserted to us from <hi>Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baça. Gaspar Pacheco</hi> was ordered to land all Necessaries for a Siege under the Fort upon the Continent. Two Boats that were under the Fort were taken, and D. <hi>Francis</hi> sent an Express to our King by the way of <hi>Moçambique,</hi> promising speedily to make himself Master of that Place, but the Event depending upon Fortune, he was not so good as his Word. The Major <hi>Dominick de Toral &amp; Valdez,</hi> who went over with the Viceroy from <hi>Madrid,</hi> was sent to view the Ground about the Fort, which he found would be dangerous to be supplied with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions from the Sea, because being in the middle of the Island, Provisions and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54711:729"/>
must be conveyed thither with a strong Guard.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Andrew Vello</hi> took 6 of the Enemies Boats, and had 5 Seamen and a Soldier killed and others wounded. On the 15th <hi>Toral</hi> went again to view the Fort with 10 Men in a Boat, had 3 killed, and the Ensign <hi>Carvallo</hi> who dying confessed great Crimes aloud. <hi>Andrew Vello</hi> attempting to burn the Cops near the City lost one Man had 3 wounded, and failed of his Design. On the 16th D. <hi>Francis</hi> with the Viceroy's Son went to view the Fort on the side of the Sea. <hi>Toral</hi> and others going up a Creek observed that side. On the 17th D. <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Toral</hi> viewed the City of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and Bastion of the <hi>Turks.</hi> It was resolved in Council to land at the Place called <hi>Our Lady.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. D. <hi>Francisco</hi> was ashore on the side of <hi>Tuaca</hi> preparing Gabions and Necessaries to land, he made a Review of his Men, and found above 400 <hi>Portugueses</hi> and many Blacks. On the 22th he ordered <hi>Andrew Vello</hi> what was to be done on the side of the <hi>Moors</hi> City to divert the Enemy, that they might not hinder our Landing. This Day 8 of our Seamen deserting to the Enemy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered our Designs; which caused them to move their Cannon to a place whence they could annoy us. On the 24th the Men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to land, could not perform it in the place appointed, because the Sea was rough, but did at the place where two of the Enemies Ships lay.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <pb n="392" facs="tcp:54711:730"/>
11. They marched in good Order with their Cannon, through difficult ways to a Wood where they halted and Entrenched, to find out a fit Place for a Battery. Three hundred Blacks opposed the Landing, but were repulsed with Loss; of our Men 8 were killed. Those who were to return to the Ships did it in a great Conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, some throwing away their Arms at the first sight of the Blacks. On the 26th the Enemy appeared, shewing the Heads of 2 <hi>Portugueses</hi> they had killed the Day before. In order to make our Approaches, a House defended by some Blacks was taken, but found of no use to us. Three Battalions of Blacks beset the House, and pressed those within so vigorously, that we lost 28 Men, besides many wounded, among which was D. <hi>Francis</hi> hurt with 24 Arrows; 7 of which were mortal, as being poisoned, if the Limb be not cut off, or the Blood-sucked. A Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant sucked those Wounds and died, but saved the Life of D. <hi>Francis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. The no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>se of the Fight brought D. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Viceroy's Son thither with some Men, which saved those that were left in the House, for the Blacks presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to a Wood, whence they annoyed us, till the Cannon being brought they fled. D. <hi>Francis</hi> being unfit to Command by reason of his Wounds, was carried aboard his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and <hi>Gonçalo Barros de Silva</hi> was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Command in his stead, but the Men refusing to obey him, <hi>Peter Rodriguez Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tello</hi> the Vice-Admiral, who had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:54711:730"/>
that Post, was obliged now to accept of it. It was now the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and our Men were more attentive to commit Villanies, than prosecute on the War; D. <hi>Francis</hi> understanding it, caused himself to be carried ashore in a Chair, and put some Remedy to it. Two large Vessels were built to batter the Fort, and they began to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it successfully, and promised a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. A Battery was also raised upon the <hi>Turks</hi> Bastion. On the 2d of <hi>March</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy began to play a twelve Pounder from the <hi>Moors</hi> Town, which did much harm aboard our battering Vessels, killing 3 Men and wounding 10.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. On the <hi>Turks</hi> Bastion were planted 2 ten Pounders, and began to play. The <hi>Moors</hi> of the Continent attacked it by Night, killed 2 of our Men, and wounded 6. At last that Battery was found to be useless, so all was Shipped again; and it was agreed, there was no staying there longer, for Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came on, and it was necessary to return to <hi>Goa.</hi> Winter begins there at the end of <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>March</hi> was not yet over; there was time enough to take the Place, because it could not hold out four Days. In fine, D. <hi>Francis</hi> returned to <hi>Goa,</hi> leaving three Ships to guard the Coast, and hinder any Provisions from being carried to the Enemy. Two of them had Orders as soon as Winter began to retire to <hi>Patij</hi> and <hi>Zanzibar,</hi> which they did before their time, leaving their Vessels behind. A Seaman deserting before the Fleet set Sail, gave Intelligence to the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:54711:731"/>
Enemy of our Designs; and they planting a Gun on the top of the Mosque did much harm, chiefly among those that were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering to return to <hi>Goa.</hi> The Fleet sailed on the 20th of <hi>March,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> the last Day of <hi>May.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. As soon as the King of <hi>Mombaça</hi> saw the Coast clear, he made use of his own and our two Ships left there, to get away. He imbarqued all the Artillery, razed the Fort and City, destroyed all Fruit-trees, and then sailed with his Treasure, some Moors, and some Native Christians to the Coast of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia.</hi> That Place lay 2 Months desolate before any of our People knew it, and might have been so much longer, had not some <hi>Moors</hi> advertised <hi>Peter Rodriguez Botello</hi> who was at <hi>Zanzibar,</hi> and immediately went over to <hi>Mombaça,</hi> where beginning to build he found 5 or 6 Servants of <hi>Portugueses</hi> that had lain hid in the Woods when that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction happened.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Mean while at <hi>Goa</hi> the Viceroy was accused for sending D. <hi>Francis de Mour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </hi> upon that Expedition, and he for want of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and coming away too soon. The Viceroy excused himself, and put the other upon his Tryal, desiring <hi>Toral</hi> to take the Guilt upon himself, by saying he had voted for coming away, which he refused, and was 2 Months in Prison without any cause shown. At last he was released to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany D. <hi>Roderick de Costa,</hi> who towards the end of this Year was going to discover cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Islands, but meeting two <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:54711:731"/>
about <hi>Damam</hi> had his Head struck off by a Cannon Ball the first Charge; so the Fleet returned without doing any thing. D. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de Moura</hi> was cleared of that Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being honoured at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16.

                     <p n="17">17. The Persecution of the Christians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at <hi>Iapan,</hi> but there were hopes it would cease, the Emperor lying very ill.

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. AFter the Natives had left but a small part of the Island, <hi>Ceylon</hi> in our Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, the Kings of <hi>Matale, Uva</hi> and <hi>Candea</hi> with 20000 Men came to Besiege <hi>Columbo,</hi> the chief Place then in our hands. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged were reduced to that Extremity, it is said they eat the Dead, and some Mothers their own Children. Then came in five Ships sent by the Viceroy, rather to take up the Cinnamon was to be sent to <hi>Portugal,</hi> than relieve the Place. But the Besiegers thinking it was Relief raised the Siege. D. <hi>Philip de Mascarennas</hi> went over from <hi>Cochin</hi> to <hi>Ceylon</hi> with a Pink loaden with Provisions and well manned at his own expence, which was a great help to that Place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Viceroy gave the Command of General of <hi>Ceylon</hi> to D. <hi>George de Almeyda,</hi> who set out on the 19th of <hi>February</hi> 1631, in the great Galley taken by <hi>Nunno Alvarez Botello,</hi> when he destroyed the Fleet of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem.</hi> This Vessel tho' large being not sound enough to endure any Storm might rise, a Flyboat that went loaded with Provisions, was ordered to keep close always with D. <hi>George,</hi> which soon left him, and was the cause that many perished.</p>

3. The Galley having coasted as far as Cape <hi>Comori,</hi> and then striking over to <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> a Storm arose, and it appeared impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to save her. D. <hi>George</hi> perceiving she must perish, launched the Boat and got into it with 29 Persons, whereof 4 were Religious. This was done so late and with such preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, that there was not in the Boat Provision for one meal. The Night was spent in lading out the Water the Sea and Rain brought into the Boat. In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discovering a Sail at a distance, tho' D. <hi>George</hi> assured them in 3 or 4 Days he would bring them to <hi>Maldivia,</hi> they made towards it, and coming near found it was their own Galley then sinking.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. With much trouble on the 4th Day they reached one of the <hi>Maldivia</hi> Islands about evening. This was at a time that the Natives keep a Fast of 30 Days, during which time they eat nothing between Sun and Sun, and do nothing but gormandise all the Night. Here D. <hi>George</hi> stayed 30 days, spending what he had got to maintain his Men, and got some Shipping to go over to the Coast of <hi>India.</hi> The Men made a sort of Habitation, but D. <hi>George</hi> lay in his Boat to be always the readier against the <hi>Moors,</hi> who kept them always upon their Guard. There was a vast number of Mosquitoes or Gnats, that made the Blood run where they stung; next followed a Sickness which none were free from, and was cured by Bleeding; two died of it, one a Franciscan. The King of the Islands writ to D. <hi>George,</hi> condoling
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:54711:733"/>
his Misfortunes, and sending him a parcel of Rice.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Being provided with all Necessaries they sailed to <hi>Cochim,</hi> where D. <hi>George</hi> lay sick a long time. When he was somewhat recovered, there came to that Port 2 Pinks sent by the Viceroy to the Relief of <hi>Ceylon</hi> with 500 <hi>Cafres,</hi> 800 <hi>Canaraes,</hi> some <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,</hi> 40000 Xerasins, which are worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a piece of Eight each, Provisions and Ammunition. D. <hi>George</hi> emba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>qued with them, having raised some more Men; sailed from <hi>Cochim</hi> on the 17th of <hi>October,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Columbo</hi> the 21th. He marched not presently towards the Enemy (though cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured upon that account) by reason the Season being wet, that Country, which is for the most part plain, is boggy and overflowed. Besides the Trees are full of Leeches, which drop down upon Men as they pass, and bleed them to Death.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Season being somewhat more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, D. <hi>George</hi> marched on the 5th Day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1632, and passed the River <hi>Calane</hi> towards the North. Six Ships were ordered to go up the River with several Pieces of Cannon, but only two could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. The first day they could march but one League, and quartered at <hi>Calane.</hi> Next Morning having heard Mass, they marched with great difficulty, by reason of the Bogs and Waters, through which they waded up to the Breast. Besides the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Musketiers endeavoured to hinder our Passage about the Fort called <hi>Tranqueyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grande,</hi>
                        <pb n="399" facs="tcp:54711:733"/>
but many of them were slain, our General giving 3 or 4 Pistols for every Head that was brought him. This Pass being clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they advanced to another, where the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy appeared again. Our General went himself to view it, and returning disposed his Men to attack those Works, in which were almost 6000 Men. It was done with such fury, that many of the Enemy being killed, the rest fled, firing all they left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. Our Army advanced to <hi>Maluana,</hi> where they found only 3 old Men, who said the Prince of <hi>Candea</hi> hearing the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of our Men, had the day before aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned that Place. All the Houses were burnt by D. <hi>George</hi> his Order.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Fame of these Actions made many come in and submit, whom our General treated with kindness and rewarded; but Fear and Malice being equally prevalent in them, they hid themselves, thinking to get away to their own People again, which D. <hi>George</hi> understanding caused them to be apprehended, gave some as Slaves to the Captains, and delivering one to the Cafres, they in sight of his Wife and Children im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cut him in pieces, which they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among themselves to eat.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Army marched to <hi>Cardevola,</hi> where were 2 Forts, whence showers of Bullets flew. The General having viewed them, drew out 3 Battalions to give the assault. These advanced, and the whole Army ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of sharing the Honour, followed of their own accord, and D. <hi>George</hi> had much
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:54711:734"/>
difficulty to stop them. On a sudden the 3 Bodies crying St. <hi>Iames</hi> applied the scaling Ladders, mounted, and planted our Colours upon the Walls of both Forts. We lost two Officers and four private Men, and had some few wounded. As our General entred one of these Forts, a Chingala came and told him that of <hi>Tanqueyra Grande</hi> was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Enemy; he sent thither a Body of Men, and found it was true, and that they had left in that Fort good Brass and Iron Cannon, many Muskets and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Those of <hi>Cardevola</hi> which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently demolished were no worse provided, one piece of Cannon was found with the Royal Arms of <hi>Portugal</hi> upon it.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. In several Parts of the River Bodies were afterwards found with Cymeters, which showed many in confusion were drowned for haste. The Enemy had strowed Crows<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet about the Fort to gall our Men, which did them the greatest harm as they fled. Our Army pursued the Enemy, but could not come to any Action, till they met at the Foor of the Mountains of <hi>Candea,</hi> where they were defeated, and we remained Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Forts of <hi>Manicravate, Sofragan, Maluana,</hi> and <hi>Caliture.</hi> About <hi>Maturé,</hi> where D. <hi>Theodosius</hi> lived as a King, was the like Success.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The same at <hi>Chilao,</hi> a Sea-Port, which our General assaulted by Sea and Land, and took there a great Booty, part whereof were 130 Vessels. The King of <hi>Candea</hi> sent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors to sue for Peace, the General was
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:54711:734"/>
against it, but being importuned by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, in consideration of the Misery the Country was reduced to by those Troubles, he granted the Ambassadors should go to <hi>Goa,</hi> to treat with the Viceroy. In fine, D. <hi>George</hi> not only recovered our lost Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but encreased it.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. D. <hi>George</hi> found the Inhabitants of <hi>Columbo,</hi> that ought to have worshipped him for delivering them from a deplorable Condition, more dangerous Enemies than the Natives. He endeavoured to put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the King's Orders, to prevent the Frauds committed by the Officers of the Revenue; they arming made several Shots at him, by one of which he lost a Finger. This Mutiny being looked into, those concerned were put out of their Places and the Island; and it was declared in the Council of State, that D. <hi>George</hi> had acted better then any before him; and it was requisite for the King's Service, he should be continued in that Post. <hi>Peter de Silva,</hi> who was Viceroy after the Count <hi>de Linnares,</hi> removed him, only because it is a Custom for the new Viceroy to undo what his Predecessor has done. But no sooner did D. <hi>George</hi> leave the Command of the Island <hi>Ceylon,</hi> than all that he had gained was lost. Returning to <hi>Goa</hi> poor and full of Merit; he died in a low Condition, rather (as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved) through Grief than Age.</p>

                        <p>Of several Occurrences till the end of the Government of the Viceroy the Count <hi>De Linnares.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. AN <hi>Indian</hi> Woman married to a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> was delivered at <hi>Bardes</hi> of a Monster with two Heads and Teeth, the Ears like a Monkey, on the Forehead an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crescency of Flesh like a Horn, the Legs so joyned they looked like one, leaping out of the Midwife's hands; it seized a Black, and bit out a piece of her Flesh. The Wife of a Heathen Barber brought forth much such another Creature, and a Cow a third, all successively one after the other. These Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies were general through most of the World this Year.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Year 1633. was not quite unlike it; the beginning of this Year we lost the Town of <hi>Golin</hi> in <hi>Bengala</hi> in this manner. The <hi>Mogol</hi> having lost above 50000 Horse the last Year in several Engagements he had with <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> attributed it to the Assistance the latter received from the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> In Revenge thereof he now besieges <hi>Golin</hi> with almost 200000 Men by Land, and a vast Fleet sent down the River <hi>Ganges.</hi> In the Place were 200 <hi>Portugueses</hi> and their Slaves, who defended themselves several days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:54711:735"/>
out any Fortifications, killing 50000 <hi>Mogols.</hi> Being no longer able to hold out, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to escape in four Vessels, two whereof full of Women and Children, and vast Riches, fell into the Enemies hands. The Women, rather than remain in Slavery, fired the Vessels, and were burnt with their Children and Treasure. The other two Ships with the Men were also taken; and the <hi>Mogol</hi> offering their liberty to such as were not Inhabitants of <hi>Cambolim,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, saying, They would all share the same Fortune. It is not known whether they were killed or made Slaves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The War continued in <hi>Ceylon</hi> with the King of <hi>Candea.</hi> The false D. <hi>Theodosius</hi> had returned to our Friendship but with a design to deceive us, but was at last killed. The King sued for Peace, and submitted to our Conditions, but then again refused to ratifle it, and <hi>Iames de Melo &amp; Castro</hi> offering him Battel if he persisted in the denial, he signed the Treaty. Thus we were again restored to all that had been lost in <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Last Year three Ships were ready at <hi>Lisbon</hi> to sail for <hi>India</hi> at the usual time, which is about <hi>March,</hi> but the Weather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so bad, they were disappointed. In <hi>Iuly</hi> three others set out, and two of them had the good fortune to make the Voyage without seeing Land till they came to <hi>Goa.</hi> This Year we now treat of sailed the three Ships that were disappointed the last. One of these coming back, was cast away beyond
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:54711:736"/>
the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> but lost not one Man, and very few of them died ashore. Of the Wreck, and some Wood cut in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they built two small Vessels that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them off, though not without difficulty, the greatest to make the Men agree to this only means of saving themselves.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. On the 16th of <hi>February 1634, Antony Tellez de Silva</hi> sailed from <hi>Goa</hi> towards the North with 6 Galleons, in search of the like number of <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships that came from <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi> About <hi>Trapor</hi> he discovered them, and giving chase they fled, throwing overboard many Goods to lighten.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Viceroy was not so wholly taken up with the Military Affairs, but he could attend adorning and beautifying the City. He built a Church dedicated to St. <hi>Laurence</hi> near the Bar, and gave it to the <hi>Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</hi> Then he founded and endowed an Hospital for the Poor in the Field of St. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> which made four Hospitals at <hi>Goa.</hi> He rebuilt the Council-house of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and Palace of the Viceroys, which were going to ruin.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. For Military Works, at <hi>Panelim</hi> he finished that called the Powder-house, where are daily made 14 Quintals of Powder. Repaired the Fortifications of <hi>Mascate,</hi> and others. These Works seem sufficient to have made him beloved, but either some Humours made him odious, or else it was impossible to please the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> Some discontented Persons, when the Viceroy was about to depart, set up several scandalous
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:54711:736"/>
Libels against him in publick Places, and hanged his Effigies on the publick Gibbet. Yet after all it was voted, that an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Statue should be erected to him in the same place where the other had been hang'd, but it succeeded not, for when the Pedestal was set up, there arrived a new Viceroy, and the arrival of such always reverses whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was done before.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Now died the famous Commander <hi>Ruy Freyre de Andrade</hi> full of Merit unrewarded; we have already spoke of his Actions, his Qualities were a mixture of good and bad, more Politick than Conscientious. He was Prudent and Generous. Gave all his Orders in doubtful terms, to reserve a Meaning to justifie himself by in case of ill success. Was familiar with no body, choosing rather to be feared than beloved. He heard all Soldiers standing, or made them sit. Any breach of Orders he never pardoned, but beheaded a Captain for saving a beautiful young Woman, being commanded to put all to the Sword. It is needless to repeat more Extravagancies of this kind.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Two Ships sailed from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> carrying a new Viceroy to <hi>India.</hi> The Count <hi>De Linarez</hi> returned with them, one whereof was cast away near <hi>Lisbon;</hi> the other, in which he was, went to <hi>Malaga,</hi> where many of the Men died, much of the Loading was wasted, and the Ship was broke up.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Count went to Court, and was the first that presented his Prince with part of what he had gained. To the King he
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:54711:737"/>
gave a Hatband, to the Queen a pair of Pendants, both valued by some 100000, by others 80000 Crowns. He was at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with Hononr, and after Imprisoned. The Count was of a beautiful Presence, and comely Aspect, discreet and well inclined, of Viceroys the 27th, of Governours the 51st, and 6th of the Sirname.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. This Year was remarkable in <hi>Cochin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>china</hi> for a Dearth, which caused such a Famine as had not been known in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Man, and for repeated Treasons. About the beginning of the Year a Bastard Son of the King, but Adopted by the Queen, went to govern the Provinces between <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham</hi> and <hi>Chapa;</hi> he had before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conspired with eight principal Men to bring the Government of the Kingdom into his and his Brothers hands, which then was managed by the Sons of another Woman. As soon as he came to his Government he began to make Warlike Preparations; the King understanding it sent for him, and he kept off till the Kind died, and the Princes possessed themselves of the Palace. The Conspirators came to celebrate the Funeral Rites. An Uncle of those young Princes was present, who understanding those Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors design to murder his Nephews, called up the Guards that were ready to execute his Orders, but he thought it enough to terrifie those Conspirators. The Funeral ended, the Prince having with difficulty got the Royal Seal from the Queen, tendred it to his Uncle, offering to acknowledge him as
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:54711:737"/>
King; but the old Man unwilling to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the Youth, refused the Offer, only desiring him to remember his Children.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The News of the King's Death being brought to the Bastard at the City <hi>Cacham,</hi> he ordered the deepest Mourning according to the custom of that Country, which was to cut their Hair short. This to them is a great Affliction, for they wear their Hair at length like Women, and think it makes them beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, whereas they are very ugly. This done, he raised Men, and fortified himself at <hi>Turam.</hi> The young King's two Brothers soon came upon him, and were Masters of all. He fled, and being taken, attempted to kill himself with a Knife; but failing, was committed to Prison, where he poisoned himself. After his Death many Persons of great Note, being Accomplices in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, were put to Death.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the Viceroy <hi>Peter de Silva,</hi> from the Year 1635, till 1638.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. ABout the end of this Year 1635, the Count <hi>de Linarez</hi> resigned the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Peter de Silva.</hi> The same People that accused the Count for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so rigid, accused <hi>Silva</hi> of being too easie. Perhaps they blamed the Extreams, but what Man can overcome his Inclinations? Every Man's Qualifications ought to be looked into before an Employment is given him. I know not whether <hi>Sylva</hi> were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally easie, but he had gained the Nickname of <hi>Mole,</hi> which in <hi>Portugues</hi> signifies Soft. Neither did he like the Government, being often heard to say, <hi>God forgive them that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me for this Imploy, for I am not fit for it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In <hi>March, Antony Tellez</hi> set out again with his 6 Galleons, after 13 Sail of <hi>Dutch</hi> he expected to meet at <hi>Surat.</hi> A Storm forced him to <hi>Bombaim,</hi> and the Enemy to shun him put into <hi>Dabul. Tellez</hi> returned to <hi>Goa,</hi> and being there at Anchor, four great <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Ships appeared before the Port, he went out, and having fought two days, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to lighten their Loading, the better to escape. This done, he enters the Port
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:54711:738"/>
again, and a Squadron of 10 Sail of the Enemy was seen at his Heels, the Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage being too great, it was not thought expedient to fight them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Year was signalized with a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that happen'd with a Crucifix. There is a Monastery of Nuns at <hi>Goa,</hi> in the Arch of their Choir facing the Nuns was placed a Crucifix, the Workmanship whereof was not liked because the Eyes were quite shut, and the Knees too high. On the first <hi>Friday</hi> of Lent, after the usual Procession, some Nuns being at Prayers in the Choir, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly saw the Image open its Eyes; the Women frighted cried out, and all the other Religious with the Father Confessor resorted thither, and before Midnight all of them saw the Eyes open 26 times, and sometimes the Body and Cross seemed to move, the Mouth opened as if it spoke, and Blood ran from the Temples and Wounds. Some part of these Wonders were seen several days, till on a <hi>Tuesday,</hi> the Church being full of People, they all saw what the Nuns had seen, for the Body of the Image turned to one side. The Bishop and Inquisitors were Witnesses of much of this Motion, and the whole was confirmed by the Asseveration of all the Citizens. The Eyes remained half open, the Knees stretched lower, the Feet falling and dragging the Nail after them, and the whole Body of the Image appeared more beautiful.</p>

4. Only two Ships sailed from <hi>Portugal</hi> this Year for <hi>India,</hi> whereof one was put into <hi>Lisbon</hi> again. D. <hi>Hierome Chingala,</hi> who now called himself <hi>Sufo,</hi> that had lost the Kingdom of <hi>Mombaça,</hi> as has been related, appeared about this time in the Island <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagascar.</hi> When he fled he carried with him above 400 Christians, and sold them on the Coast of <hi>Arabia,</hi> obliging many to turn <hi>Mabometans.</hi> After wandering on that Coast he returned towards <hi>Africk,</hi> and landed at <hi>Madagascar,</hi> where the King of <hi>Massalaye</hi> and Moors of <hi>Pate</hi> favoured him. The News hereof being brought to <hi>Moçambique,</hi> the Inhabitants of that Town resolved to attack him. They fitted out 10 Ships and some other small Vessels, in which were about 60 <hi>Portugueses</hi> and 110 <hi>Cafres,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Andrew Borges</hi> and <hi>Antony de Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyra,</hi> who were to obey <hi>Rocque Borges</hi> that was about that Coast.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. On the 17th of <hi>May</hi> the <hi>Cafres</hi> landed to discover <hi>Sufo</hi>'s Works, where they slew some Men, and brought the Heads of three, losing one Man. <hi>Borges</hi> resolved to assault the Works next day, leaving the Care of the Vessels to <hi>Iohn Gomez Suarez,</hi> a secure Man, that he might have a Retreat in case of any Misfortune. The Men marched half a League through Bogs up to the Knees, at the foot of a Mountain <hi>Sufo</hi> met them with a multitude of Blacks. After a resolute Fight, <hi>Sufo</hi> retired so orderly, that <hi>Borges</hi> suspected it was to draw him into some Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush; wherefore after 4 hours Engageme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>t
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:54711:739"/>
finding it impossible to overcome by reason of the multitude of Enemies and disadvantage of Ground, he withdrew to the Ships, having killed many of the Blacks without losing one Man. <hi>Suarez</hi> had not been idle there, for 1000 Blacks and Moors of <hi>Pate</hi> had assaulted the Ships, but were repulsed with conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loss. Our Commander carried the War along the Coast, burning some Towns and 15 large Vessels, besides the small, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he saved much Rigging, Ammunition, and Cannon.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. On the 21st of <hi>Ianuary, Antony Tellez</hi> obtained leave to set out to fight the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> who upbraided us with Cowardice. After 8 hours Dispute the Enemy gave way. Our Admiral meeting them again about the middle of <hi>February</hi> in the Northern Sea, had the like success.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. At <hi>Malaca</hi> the Feuds were so great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Commander of the Town and Admiral of the Coast, that the latter shot an Uncle of the other. This encouraged the King of <hi>Achem</hi> to break with us, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning <hi>Francis de Sousa &amp; Castro,</hi> who resided there as Ambassador, and killing all the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi> about his Court. <hi>Malaca</hi> being much distressed for want of Provisions, and the Viceroy endeavouring to relieve it, News came that our Commander at <hi>Damama</hi> was dead, whereupon it was found necessary to divide that Relief. Four Galleons were sent to <hi>Malaca,</hi> and <hi>Antony Tellez</hi> the Hero of these Times with 500 Men, half of them Soldiers, to <hi>Damam. Tellez</hi> went no farther
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:54711:740"/>

There are other Emloyments no less profitable than the Command of Forts, as are the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Voyages.

                  <p n="13">13. The Viceroy's Salary is 18000 Crowns, besides the disposing of Places, which are all sold; but the chief thing which they all look upon is Trade, for whereas the King gets nothing out of <hi>India;</hi> some Viceroy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Salaries are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable enough to have made Men honest, but Avarice knows no bounds. Thus much of the Temporal Power, let us come to the Spiritual.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The Archbishop of <hi>Goa</hi> is Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan and Primate of all <hi>Asia.

History, writ at the same time as the last: Many make a doubt of Truth of what he writes; and as many who have travelled those Parts affirm he might with truth have writ much more no less incredible to our apprehension. I look upon him as a very true Historian, for many Reasons. Yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing he is not, it is in things wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by me.</p>
