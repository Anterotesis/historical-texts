         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following Treatise is not so much of the <hi>direct Nature</hi> of a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy, whatever like it may occasionally fall in, or within compass of the same, as it is literally, by way of Quotation, <hi>expressive</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Judgments of several Perswasions, and that about the <hi>main Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation Points of the Christian Religion</hi> (such I mean as lie more immediately next unto the Notion of a <hi>Deity,</hi> the mysterious Doctrines both of a God in <hi>Trinity,</hi> together with that ineffable Discovery of eternal Love in the <hi>Hypostatical Union)</hi> which when thou hast perused, thou art at full liberty to make thy <hi>discriminative choice</hi> of either of them; and this we must all certainly do sooner or later: for there is not in the least any <hi>Medium</hi> between them; but Life <hi>entirely,</hi> or <hi>Death entirely,</hi> and that both spiritual and eternal, are held forth <hi>disjunctively</hi> or <hi>immix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, i. e.</hi> not partly Life, and partly Death, either in the one or in the other: This I say is so, in a <hi>doctrinal Sense or Acceptation;</hi> for I determine no Man's final State, as to his particular Person; no! That is a sovereign Flower of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable God's Prerogative, which must not be touch'd upon by any one, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. But this I say, as worthy Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> of old did, <hi>That a Papist, as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, cannot be saved, i. e.</hi> upon those <hi>Principles</hi> whereon such lay their stress of hopes for Salvation; <hi>viz. That the Righteousness of Christ made way in the Merit's thereof, for the Justification of the Person of a Sinner, in the material Righteousness of Faith, Repentance, Holiness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>before God.</hi> Now if the <hi>rankest</hi> Papist in the World will not acknowledg and own this as the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of his hopes for Glory, I am utterly at a loss: Nay I am so far from being mistaken in this Point, that do but allow of it, and I shall easily or with a <hi>wet Finger</hi> reconcile both Papist and Protestant; and so overthrow the very standing or vertical Spring of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, yea the very Natures of both Covenants in their publick, federal, and as such substitutive Headships, whereon as Covenants they mainly depend. The Thoughts of which cause me to lay before thee what Mr. <hi>Troughton,</hi> in the close of his Preface to his second part of <hi>Lutherus Redivivus,</hi> recites out of Mr. <hi>Norton.</hi> 
               <q>Taking <hi>Heresy</hi> for a fundamental Error, <hi>i. e.</hi> such as whosoever liveth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in, cannot be saved. The Dialogue containeth three Heresies; The <hi>first</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the imputation of the Sin of the Elect unto Christ, and his suffering the Punishment due thereto. The <hi>second</hi> denying that Christ as <hi>God-man, Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> obeyed the Law, and therewith that he obeyed for us as our Surety. The <hi>third</hi> denying the imputation of Christ's Obedience unto Justification, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very being of a Sinner's Righteousness, by taking away the Obedience of Christ unto the Law, and Imputation, which are the matter and form, <hi>i. e.</hi> the essential Causes of Justification; and placing a Sinner's Righteousness in a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Atonement or Pardon of Sin, such as in effect manifestly doth not only deny it self to be the effect of, but denyeth, yea and defieth the very Being of the mediatorial Obedience of Christ to the Law for us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The nine subsequent Heads being according to my Apprehension the Substance of the Protestant Reformation, as Apostolical, I think meet to lay here before
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:94224:3"/>
thee. And that because of the several Citations out of divers Authors inserted in the twice told three Columns of this Piece, do either fall in with one or other of them, or are wholly rejective of the same: This thou wilt find out by comparing each with other. Only by the way take notice of what Mr. <hi>Theophilus Gale</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares as the Excellency of Mr. <hi>Strong</hi>'s Treatise of both Covenants. <q>1. That God never did nor will deal with Mankind merely in a way of <hi>Dominion,</hi> but also in a way of <hi>Covenant.</hi> 2. That both Covenants are made with Men not <hi>immediately,</hi> but in and by some <hi>publick Person.</hi> 3. That it is Union with either of these <hi>publick Persons,</hi> that brings a Man under <hi>their Covenants.</hi> 4. That it is impossible for a Man to be under both Covenants. </q>The Heads designed follow, as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Predestination, and consequently Election and Reprobation, are absolute; Rom. 9. 11, 15, 16, 22, 23. ch. 11. 5, 7, 28. Ephes.</hi> 1. 5, 11. The following Texts hold forth the <hi>Marks, not Causes of Reprobation;</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5. 2 Tim. 3. 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> had not a <hi>temporal</hi> but <hi>eternal Origination,</hi> was in all Generations particular and special, the same in matter and effect, never of an universal nature, or differently transacted Mediums between God and Man, any further than as Type and Antitype stood related each to other, and that not only as abiding in the Purpose and Decree of God, but as <hi>made, agreed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon,</hi> by a mutual <hi>personal Compact</hi> between the Father and the Son; and that none but those that were personally and formally inserted then in that Covenant, and that respectively in each <hi>Individual of them</hi> (tho not then created, yet as truly known as if so, in God's intuitive Vision, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2.) ever have been or shall be in time actually taken into the same; <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30, 31. compared with <hi>John 17. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Heb. 2. 11, 12, 13. 2 Tim. 1. 9. Rev. 13. 8. Luke 10. 20. John 10. 3, 4, 5, 16, 26, 27, 28, 29. Isa.</hi> 59. 21. For the confirmation of this Truth, take Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Testimony unto the same.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <q>(1.) That the Lord Jesus Christ was the principal <hi>subject matter</hi> of this <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> the Undertaker in it, and Surety of it, the Scriptures expresly declare; for the great Promise of it was concerning him and his Mediation, with the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that should redound unto Mankind thereby in Grace and Glory. And the <hi>preceptive Part</hi> of it required Obedience in and from him, new and distinct from that which was exacted by the Law of Creation, altho enwrapping all the Commands thereof also. And he was the Surety of it, in that he undertook un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God whatever by the terms of the Covenant was to be done for Man, to accomplish it in his <hi>own Person;</hi> and whatever was to be done in and by Man, to effect it by <hi>his own Spirit and Grace;</hi> that so the Covenant on every side might be firm and stable, and the ends of it fulfilled. <bibl>
                     <hi>Exercit. Vol. 2. Heb.</hi> p. 50.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>(2.) Such is the Distinction of the Persons in the Unity of the divine Essence, as that they act in natural and essential Acts <hi>reciprocally</hi> one towards another; namely, in Understanding, Love, and the like; they know and mutually love each other. And as they subsist distinctly, so they also act distinctly in those Works which are of external Operation. And whereas all these Acts and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, whether reciprocal or external, are either with a Will, or from a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Will and Choice, the Will of God in each Person, as to the peculiar Acts ascribed unto him, is his Will therein peculiarly and eminently, tho not exclusively to the other Persons by reason of their mutual <hi>In-being.</hi> The Will of God, as to the peculiar Actings of the Father in this matter, is the Will of the Father; and the Will of God, with regard unto the peculiar Actings of the
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:94224:3"/>
Son, is the Will of the Son; not by a distinction of sundry Wills, but by the distinct Application of the same Will unto its <hi>distinct Acts,</hi> in the Person of the Father and of the Son. And in this respect the Covenant whereof we treat differeth from a pure Decree, for from those distinct Actings of the Will of God in the Father and the Son, there doth arise a new Habitude or Relation, which is not natural or necessary unto them, but freely taken on them. And by virtue hereof were all Believers saved from the Foundation of the World upon the account of the Interposition of the Son of God, antecedently unto his Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in the Flesh. For hence was he esteemed to have done and suffered what he had undertaken so to do, and which through Faith was imputed unto them that did believe. <bibl>
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 56.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>(3.) When God came to reveal this <hi>Counsel</hi> of his Will, this Branch and Part of the eternal Compact between him and his Son, and to represent unto the Church what had been transacted within the Vail for their Faith and Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as also to give them some previous insight into the manner of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of these his holy Counsels, he did it by the Institutions of a <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Sacrifices,</hi> or a sacred Office and sacred kind of Worship, suted and adapted to be a resemblance of this heavenly Transaction between the Father and the Son. For the <hi>Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the Law were not the <hi>original Exemplar</hi> of these things, but a <hi>Transcript and Copy</hi> of what was done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it self, in Counsel, Design and Covenant, as they were a Type of what should be afterwards accomplished in the Earth. Now altho the Names of <hi>Priest and Sacrifice</hi> are first applied unto the Office mentioned under the Law and their Work, from whence they are traduced under the New Testament, and transferred unto Jesus Christ, that we may learn thereby what God of old instructed his Church in, yet the things themselves intended and signified by these Names, belong <hi>properly and firstly</hi> unto Jesus Christ, upon the account of this his Undertaking, and the very Names of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were but <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly</hi> ascribed unto them who were so called, to be obscure Representations of what was past, and Types of what was to come. <bibl>
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 61, 62.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Original Sin</hi> is absolutely distinguished in its inherent communicative Defilement, from what it is under an external and personally juridical Charge; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. <hi>Psal. 103. 3. Psal.</hi> 32. 1, 2.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That <hi>peculiar Redemption,</hi> as wrought out by an immetaphorical Sacrifice, and identically substituted Sufferings, offered, laid down, and accepted of as a Price, Solution, or personally proper Ransom, is vastly dissonant from the same in its Consequences and infused Effects, which consist barely (as physical) in a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the Dominion of Sin, a Communication of Grace, and thereby an actual, gracious and presential Enjoyment of and Fellowship with God, both here and eternally. For whether is it <hi>Persons</hi> or a <hi>Law</hi> that was purchased by Christ? If <hi>Persons,</hi> the Athenian Club must down: If a <hi>Law,</hi> then <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Cap must up, lin'd with a new Covenant of Works, and wreath'd with his Motto, <hi>Sic volo sic jubeo, stat pro ratione voluntas. 2 Cor. 5. 21.

6. That <hi>personal Justification</hi> is <hi>positively</hi> and <hi>materially distinct</hi> both in its <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Place, Nature</hi> or <hi>Kind,</hi> from a <hi>Heart-Renovation</hi> or Change of the inward Man; <hi>Ezek. 16. 8, 9. Zech. 3. 4, 5, 7. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Luke 1. 74. Psal.</hi> 56. 13. our Lord speaking to <hi>Peter,</hi> John 13. 8. where Christ says not, If I wash thee not thou <hi>shalt have</hi> no part in me; but, If I wash thee not thou never <hi>hadst</hi> it, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious unto the same, <hi>i. e.</hi> hast it not at present even before I wash thee. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 2. the Psalmist rejoices in his being freed from a damnatory State, brought into a justified one, and that thereby his Walkings with God were established.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That <hi>inherent Sanctification</hi> is the Fruit both of the Change of our State and Nature; and not any thing either of the Nature or Essence of that <hi>Reformation</hi> which purely arises from the refining and new furbishing of old depraved <hi>moral Principles; Mat. 7. 17, 18.

            <p n="8">8.

            <p>The Substance of these Positions, Reader, is what the old Protestant Reformers, <hi>as such,</hi> adhered unto, yea for which in all Generations they <hi>earnestly contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> against their most subtle and violent Opposers; and many of them as by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence called unto their Trials did in Faithfulness testify unto the same, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Blood. New Attempts have been made formerly and of late, both <hi>by Craft and Subtilty, Violence and Impudence,</hi> and that under a pretence of <hi>Moderation,</hi> and a <hi>new-coin'd</hi> milder way to strip us of the same, as thou wilt easily find from the Quotations express'd in the following Tract, unto which I shall refer thee, and the guidance of that blessed God, who ever was and ever will (notwithstanding the seeming Success of his Enemies) be seen in the Mount of Difficulties in defence both of his Truths and People; which puts me in mind of the following Lines.</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>Away Despair, my gracious Lord doth hear:</l>
                  <l>Tho Winds and Waves assault my Keel,</l>
                  <l>He doth preserve it: he doth steer,</l>
                  <l>Ev'n when the Boat seems most to reel.</l>
                  <l>Storms are the Triumph of his Art:</l>
                  <l>Well may he close his Eyes, but not his Heart.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <bibl>Herb. Poem, p. 145.</bibl>
            <p>It may not be improper here likewise to insert the following Passage relating to the chief Author of the bold Attempts lately made against the Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, as it is in Mr. <hi>Walter Cross</hi>'s Sermon of Justification, preach'd at <hi>Pinners Hall</hi> Lecture in 1695. p. 10. <q>The Scholastick <hi>Pitcarne,</hi> Provost of the Old Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> weeps over this Opinion, and its Reverend Author thus: <hi>cap.</hi> 285. O Reverend <hi>Baxter,</hi> for what end, or to what good hast thou wrote so many Volumes for thy conditional Justification by Faith and Obedience? To how many Contentions hast thou given occasion? How many precious Hours
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:94224:4"/>
hast thou lost to thy self and thy Reverend Brethren? Into an Abyss of how many anti-Gospel Errors are they now sunk, who glory in thee as their Guide and Patron? Who after they have once left the way of Truth, scarce know where to stop; and yet thou still tellest the World, all thy Disputes are about the Wool of a Dog, for thou differest only in Words and Names from thy Brethren.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, <hi>Reader,</hi> take along with thee this following Advertisement or Neonomian Test; that whenever any Position of Truth <hi>seemingly</hi> so is laid down by them, whereby they delude the Hearts of the simple, it is in <hi>such terms</hi> as are capable of letting go <hi>that</hi> which thou or another think they hold forth in the <hi>face of them,</hi> and yet sufficiently retentive of their Errors, even to an utter Exclusion of the Truth it self. As for instance, we shall for the present allow them perhaps more than ever yet they have acknowledg'd, or are willing to own (if they do not think us Imposers for the same) as that whereby under a shadow of Orthodoxy they would absolutely undermine the Doctrine of Justification, and the whole of both Covenants, as each are founded upon their different or distinct, substitutive and representative Person or Headship. Now suppose they should own Election in its proper Sense, suppose also they should acknowledg a peculiar Redemption, and that of individual distinct Persons, as particularly selected from the rest of Mankind; yet the Question is, how and when are they justified? Is it that they are <hi>materially</hi> justified in the sight of God, before or only when they actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? they may perhaps own that they are <hi>materially</hi> justified before God, and that even before they actually believe: Let us see then upon this supposed Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how far this may, according to their usual Fetches and Prevarications, secure them in their undiscerned heretical Reserves, and thereby indeed overthrow the whole of that Doctrine, which they seem to own. As thus, they are <hi>materially</hi> justified before God, and that before they actually believe, in that the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ in the matter thereof is always in the <hi>approved</hi> sight of God for <hi>them,</hi> as having a Sufficiency of <hi>Merit</hi> in it to plead for, and procure that Faith, Repentance, Sincerity, Holiness and Obedience, which in time upon their actual Believing and <hi>persevering</hi> Reformation, through the <hi>Merit</hi> of this <hi>material</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, becomes their Robe of justifying Righteousness before God, upon which the Sentence of a juridical Condemnation or Justification must pass; and so far is it <hi>materially</hi> owned by them as our Righteousness, and no further: and herein let them disprove me if they can. This is their new Law forsooth of Justification, as purchased by the Righteousness of Christ: whereas do but observe the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. who speaking of the <hi>Disobedience of one, and the Obedience of another,</hi> mentions not in the least any two distinct Laws, (wherein he had a fair Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so to do if any such thing had been) whence that by a Disobedience unto one of them many were made Sinners, and that by an Obedience unto another of them, or some peculiar <hi>mediatorial Law,</hi> a <hi>remote</hi> meritorious Righteousness must come forth to make many righteous by a third Law; or that a former Law was vacated by Obedience to a middle Law, and all to bring in Justification by a third Law: Not at all, for the Apostle as acted by the Spirit of the Lord, speaks but of Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Obedience, without the Interposition of two different Laws unto which apart they must stand related, but that both had a positive relation either in Condemnation unto Death, or Restoration unto Life, to one and the self-same Law. And tho our Adversaries would confidently assert, that the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:94224:5"/>
had no relation unto the moral Law, or that of the ten Commandments, which is quite contrary to Scripture and all sound Interpreters; yet see <hi>Rom. 5. 12, 13. By one Man Sin entred into the World—and until the Law Sin was in the World, but Sin is not imputed when there is no Law.</hi> How came it then to <hi>be in</hi> or <hi>imputed</hi> unto the World, before the coming of the Law? and that the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Sin that was in the World before the coming of the Law, should be the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Sin that was charged upon and imputed unto the World after its Promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? for it is plain from the scope of the place, that this Sin has its Denomination of being a <hi>Sin</hi> from one and the same Law as well before as after its Publication. It is indeed, as one well observes, that from that one Species of Sin in <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> Genus or Kind is shewn, as the same Law being more clearly unfolded doth express; <hi>Deut. 27. 26. Gal.</hi> 3. 10. I shall shut up this with some Observations of Dr. <hi>Light foot:</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> heard as much in the Garden as <hi>Israel</hi> did at <hi>Sinai,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in fewer words, and without Thunder. Again, how could there be a greater Sin committed than that when <hi>Adam</hi> at that one clap brake all the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? 1. He chose himself another God when he followed the Devil. 2. He idolized and defiled his own Belly; as the Apostle's Phrase is, <hi>He made his Belly his God.</hi> 3. He took the Name of God in vain, when he believed him not. 4. He kept not the Rest and Estate wherein God had set him. 5. He dishonoured his Father which was in Heaven, and therefore his days were not prolonged in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

From <hi>Eve</hi> he was a Virgin, but in Eyes and Mind he committed spiritual Fornication. 8. He stole (like <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the same in the contextual as well as analogical design of the Holy Ghost therein, must be content to undergo the scalding Sarcasms of our <hi>new Schematists;</hi> and well they may, for <hi>it is but what a Prophet of the Lord hath undergone in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some of late, that in his Testimony for God against a wicked King, and his false Prophets, he was acted by a Zeal which proceeded from an irregular Passion;</hi> 2 King. 3. 13, 14. Thus they, to stave off Persons from a just and weighty attendance upon the <hi>very things themselves in debate,</hi> represent their opponent Authors either as <hi>a piece of tumified Flesh, jocular, passionate, or too strait-lac'd,</hi> and all bound up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the old invented and artificial Twig of <hi>Antinomianism:</hi> Whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are none that I know, especially under a Vizard of Reformation, that would more promote such a Religion as is absolutely destructive of the Law, both in its foederal Relation, together with its practical Efficacy, as laid up in Christ the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> than these Persons do. For thou wilt find this to be but the same method and to the same end, as arising from the same Principle in the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old, and their dealings with the People thereupon against a <hi>Reception</hi> of the <hi>Ministry of Christ, and his faithful Witnesses; John</hi> the Baptist's work being to <hi>guide Sinners wholly unto Christ for Salvation:</hi> Joh. 1. 29. This also being expresly the design of Christ to bring Souls nakedly unto himself: <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. Nay, that the very Scriptures themselves would little avail them without coming unto and laying hold of him in and by their searching of the same: <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39, 40. Now which way do the <hi>Pharisees</hi> take to divert the People from closing with these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Instructions and Offers? Even by representing <hi>John as a morose, austere, and stern Man,</hi> i. e. <hi>too strait-lac'd, passionate, or a piece of tumified Flesh: And Christ as a Man gluttonous, open or loose, a Converser with Publicans and Sinners,</hi> i. e. <hi>jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, licentious, or a real</hi> (in their sense) <hi>Antinomian;</hi> and also <hi>all his Followers</hi> and <hi>their delegated Teachers</hi> such as were <hi>ignorant, blockish, illogical Creatures, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligent, unstudied Divines, full of mysterious Nonsense.</hi> And this meerly to serve their own inherent Righteousness in order unto their Justification, and that by the Messiah himself whom they expected as their <hi>Rectoral Governor and Deliverer,</hi> i. e. <hi>in that very sense to be their Saviour;</hi> tho all acknowledged also with thankfulness to spring from the free Grace of God: <hi>Mat. 11. 18, 19. John 7. 48, 49. ch. 9. 28, 34. ch. 5. 45, 46. Rom. 9. 31, 32. Luke</hi> 18. 11, 12, 14. This is deductively clear from both what was prophesied of <hi>John</hi> as the immediate fore-runner of Christ, that he should preach, and as is expresly declared, did preach, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 3, 4, &amp;c. compare <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6. That <hi>all towring Imaginations of Man's own Works and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> should be brought low or to nothing, and every <hi>self-abased Soul</hi> should be filled with the <hi>Righteousness, Salvation and Glory</hi> of God in Christ. This is also positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparent from their coming unto Christ, and for what end, together with his Carriage towards them thereupon: <hi>Luke 16. 15. ch.</hi> 18. 9, 18, &amp;c. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 31, 32.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is that Christ likens <hi>that Generation</hi> (tho <hi>great pretenders to Holiness)</hi> to a pitiful trifling sort of Fellows, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 16, 17. such as never descended into the <hi>just merits</hi> of a Cause laid before them, but were taken up with some <hi>empty, external, shadowy</hi> Appearances and Florishes of things: And from thence draws a most divine Inference, leaving it as a standing <hi>doctrinal Position</hi> against all the false charges of Self-justiciaries, and in defence both of himself and his People, <hi>ver. 19. But Wisdom is justified of her Children:</hi> q. d. whatever imputation of Folly and Irrationality may be cast upon my Truths and People, in order to evade the one and asperse the other, as being <hi>absurd, impious,</hi> and a meer <hi>putative Imagination,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94224:6"/>
yet one day shall discover and make it evidently appear, that both the one and the other in their <hi>synonymous Testimony</hi> for me against the fleshly Reasons and carnal Artifices of Man, will prove (as it is at present in my judgment and irreversible esteem) no less than a justifying of, or a setting the Seal even unto infinite Wisdom it self, in the whole of the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of Man's Redemption, and that both as to order and matter: 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>I shall lay these three Heads before thee in reference unto a real and genuine work of Regeneration, both as to its <hi>Rise, Nature and Growth,</hi> and that as it stands related to the <hi>Grand</hi> (and yet opposed) <hi>Doctrine of Justification.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> As to its <hi>Rise, Spring, or original Cause,</hi> I mean in a more immediate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguously apprehended, and present applicatory sense, as precedaneous in order of Nature to an actual setting of the same (in the new Creature) on foot in the Soul; tho the efficient creating Cause thereof be the Spirit: therefore, <hi>To be born again, is to be born of the Spirit;</hi> John 3. 3, 6. But this he does by receiving of that which is peculiarly Christ's, shewing it unto the Sinner; and through an effectual, imputative application of the same, enabling him by Faith of his own mighty Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; whereupon the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nay, on this very Righteousness God has founded his Proceedings in both the ruin of his Enemies, and salvation of his People: <hi>Isa.</hi> 46. 12, 13. for it shall either <hi>dissolve</hi> (wherein <hi>Regeneration</hi> consists) <hi>the obstincy of the stout-hearted;</hi> or if pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously opposed by stumbling at and falling upon it, as reckoning it <hi>unintelligible, licentious, and unscriptural,</hi> they shall not only for the present be broken in all their attempts against it, but hereafter it shall so fall upon them, not as <hi>a Covering or Shelter by imputation,</hi> (being as such in its <hi>essential matter</hi> and <hi>imputative form</hi> rejected by them) but an exact <hi>Accountant,</hi> weighing and scanning both their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Performances from the compleat dimensions of its infinite and scrutinous Perfection, as to grind them to Powder. Hence it is that Christ in a familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison declares bemoaningly, as well as figuratively, wherein the actual Rebellion of the Jews was <hi>originated,</hi> notwithstanding their great pretences unto Religion, Holiness, and the several Duties perform'd by them; and yet that they were but Hypocrites, and all they did but meer Hypocrisy; namely, that they would not come unto him as their <hi>Righteousness</hi> or <hi>Covering,</hi> under the shelter of which (as a Hen with her Wings both protects, engenders and cherishes her young ones even from the Egg) he would not only have saved them from an incensed justice, the infinite Charge of a contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and violated Law, the Accusations of Conscience, Men and Devils; but also by his Spirit have begotten them after, or <note n="*" place="margin">

For all that <hi>Faith, Repentance, and Obedience</hi> precedent unto, and <hi>persistingly rejective</hi> of this Righteousness in its material ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation, as abstracted from a bare meritorious Subserviency, will not only be found <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>mercenary,</hi> but also fall under the denomination of <hi>Presumption, worldly Sorrow, and actual Rebellion: Mat. 22. 11, 12. Rev.</hi> 20. 15. compare <hi>chap. 19. 14. 2 Cor. 7. 10. Hos. 7. 14. chap.</hi> 10. 1, 9, 13. compare <hi>v. 12. Rom.</hi> 10. 2. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>chap. 9. 31, 32. Psal.</hi> 118. 19, 20, 21, 22. Nay, observe, that that Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance antecedent unto an Act of Justification and Pardon, are materially for the present no more, than that the damned are, and for ever shall be possessed of; only with this difference, that in this Life they have the hope of the Hypocrite to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, with some flashy unrenewing Impressions, whereof they are wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in the World to come: <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29, 30. compare <hi>v.</hi> 34. compare <hi>Judas</hi> his case with that of <hi>Peter</hi>'s. On these sorts of Convictions, <hi>previous to this Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> rested in or taken up with, as I could easily manifest, does the <hi>Doctrine of Non-perseverance</hi> tacitly (tho not ownedly) grow.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that amongst the Jews there were two sorts of Grapes, the one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and the other wild: <hi>Deut. 32. 32. Isa. 5. 2, 4. Cant. 2. 13. chap. 7. 7. Isa.</hi> 17. 6, 7, 8. The whole in substance of this Head is comprehended in <hi>Job</hi> 33. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The <hi>nature</hi> of it, and that still as mainly referring to this <hi>Doctrine of Justification,</hi> and therein its genuine Offspring from its resultive Operation, is highly discovered, as all other things are, by their bending, bowing, inclining; hastning, yea pressing towards their proper Center and Element. And as the Eagle tries the Legitimacy of her young ones by bringing them to the Sun, so will the Faith, and consequently in order of Nature, Regeneration, and Holiness of the Church in each of its individual subjective professing Matter, be proved as to the reality of the same. Now towards what does it work? whether would it head that Person in whom it is formed to be enwrapped, against the eternal demand of an infinite Justice, upon the eternal charge of an imputed Sin? As knowing that though God will testify unto it, as his <hi>own Image, being his Workmanship in Regeneration,</hi> yet it also knows, when in its right mind (not clouded or distracted with Corruptions) and proper operation, as sitting at the feet of Jesus, that it is not either the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, meritorious, formal or prerequisite adapting and conditional</hi> cause of God's Act in justifying a Sinner, or the Ungodly; but that by it, and the testimonial Seals of that Spirit who is its Author, God manifests to that Soul wherein it is, that he was materially and really, tho not appliedly and sensibly, justified of God, and that before this new Creature put forth it self in a proper act of believing: It is the spiritual Optick of the Soul given and wrought of God, to discern into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his Covenant. And tho it knows, and gives them also to understand in whom it is wrought, that by it alone God is to be enjoy'd, I mean as to Experience and Complacency, yet it also knows and gives them to understand, that this will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be truly attained unto without a previous personal acquitment in Judgment arising from an external imputed Righteousness. But how will this be proved?</p>
            <p>The Apostle tells us from what this very new Creature put him upon, (as having by the same discerned into his Acquitment and Justification wrought out by Christ, when he was in the height of Rebellion against him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 1. compare <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.) even to renounce it (which no natural Man, tho never so moral, was ever capable of) as any <hi>cause, part or matter</hi> of his <hi>Justification</hi> before God, and to betake
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94224:7"/>
himself <hi>wholly</hi> unto the <hi>Righteousness of Christ,</hi> for his appearance and standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and that even at the day of Judgment, before which time we may safely suppose that he knew that this new <hi>Creature</hi> in him should be rid of all Sin and Corruption, as compleated in the perfect and <hi>unspotted Holiness</hi> thereof, and that this would be upon the first moment of his Dissolution; and yet renounces it as the <hi>matter</hi> of his <hi>Justification</hi> in the last and universal day of the trial of all Flesh, <hi>Phil. 3. 3, 8, 9, &amp;c.</hi> This Language also proceeds from the <hi>new Nature</hi> in <hi>David,</hi> who was reckoned a Man after God's own Heart: Psal. 71. 16, 24. <hi>I will go in the strength of the Lord God; I will make mention of thy Righteousness, even of thine only. My Tongue also shall talk of thy Righteousness all the day long,</hi> &amp;c. His <hi>Graces</hi> constantly, as you will find throughout the most part of his Psalms, more or less, as a real Evidence of the truth of Regeneration, excite him unto Duties, so as to betake himself unto the Lord, as his not only <hi>providential,</hi> or barely <hi>gracious and rectoral Protection,</hi> but as his <hi>Covering, Shelter, strong Tower, Fortress, Hiding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,</hi> &amp;c. which bespeaks an <hi>imputed material Righteousness:</hi> Psal. 27. 5. &amp; 91. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; 61. 1, 2, 3, 4. And that which is exceeding remarkable, the Psalmist pleads with the Lord in Prayer for his being <hi>covered</hi> with the same, and that he might have a continual resort unto it as his <hi>strong Habitation,</hi> and that from his <hi>Interest</hi> therein, as arising from the Tenure of the <hi>Covenant of Grace between the Father and the Son,</hi> Psal. 71. 2, 3. compare <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 8, 9, 10. with <hi>John</hi> 17. 6, 8. For this <hi>Pavilion, shadow of Wings, or Cherubims,</hi> it is true, had a reference to the <hi>Mercy-seat,</hi> and therein the free Grace of God, upon which the whole is founded; but all this bore a connective respect unto the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> over which they were placed, wherein the Law lay, not one jot removed, or ever to be so; and in whom, i. e. <hi>the Ark,</hi> all renewed Souls (which <hi>David</hi> knew full well, as the natural tendency of the new Creature did dictate unto him) desire to be found, being assured by Regeneration, that tho the Law be not <hi>vacated</hi> or <hi>abrogated</hi> by Christ, yet that they may safely, with an unaccusing Conscience, and unimpendent Wrath, lie by <hi>it</hi> in him, by whom they know it was perfectly fulfilled in and on their stead and behalf; it being there and thence, as such alone in its <hi>Antitypical</hi> Design or Institution, that God meets and communes with his People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 21, 22. Hence it is that the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us that the <hi>Law</hi> is not <hi>against</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and reason good; for what Creditor would not rather close with a willing and responsible <hi>Surety,</hi> than run a poor Bankrupt out of House and Harbour, yea into Jail to die and rot there, and yet never be satisfied, tho always demanding? For the cancelling of a Bond doth not disanul any Law, only it disengages from an Obligation thereunto in a Covenant-sense, and that as to any possibility of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the Penalty thereof, either to the loss of a freedom from a charge unto Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, or title to an Inheritance: <hi>Gal. 3. 21. 1 Cor. 15. 55, 56, 57. Ephes. 2. 15. Col.</hi> 2. 14. Many more Instances might be given to shew that true Regeneration is the result of an <hi>essential</hi> (as respecting the Law) <hi>material application of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God in Christ</hi> unto the Soul, from the very nature of its Operation, and the Effects thereof upon such Souls in whom it is wrought. This is clear from Experience; for the more a truly renewed Creature apprehends this Righteousness and his Interest therein, the more active and transparent are his Graces, the more ready and regular his Duties, and the more genuine and evangelical is his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for <hi>causa causae est causa causati:</hi> And on the other hand, their Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmings, Deadness, Darkness, Unsavoriness, Tossings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do arise from God's
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94224:8"/>
hiding his Face in the aforementioned sense, the Land of Promise being a hilly Country: <hi>Cant. 6. 12. Psal.</hi> 118. 19, 22. &amp; 143. 1, 11. &amp; 17. 15. &amp; 4. 1. &amp; 31. 1. &amp; 35. 28. &amp; 71. 15, 16, 24. &amp; 51. 14. &amp; 69. 27. &amp; 119. 40. &amp; 88 11, 12. &amp; 89. 16. Whereas on the contrary, where the Righteousness of Christ is regarded in a more remote <hi>meritorious</hi> subserviency <hi>only,</hi> there is little care taken as to Graces or Duties, either in their spring, nature, place, or exercise, (the difference lying on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in words, as if God had only a House, but that this House wants a form, and that he were not the God of Order but Confusion) as is too apparent this day, so something like them be attended unto in a blustering Zeal, together with a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious bodily Exercise, and external glorious appearance therein, which profiteth little; and that as forecasting that the aforesaid Righteousness in the forementioned sense, will secure all in a dying hour, or at a dead lift, especially if they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce these their supposed Evidences, whereby to lay a <hi>causa sine quâ non-claim</hi> unto the same. Thus they make Christ not only a Minister of Sin, but cast the Efficacy of his Sacrifice to depend upon their own Works. Then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> The <hi>Growth of Regeneration:</hi> And herein we shall find that it springs from a material application of the <hi>Righteousness of another</hi> by way of <hi>imputation;</hi> and that its native Disposition, when formed, is to head the Soul unto and keep it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shelter and protection of the said <hi>Righteousness:</hi> so also is it maintain'd and cherish'd by a <hi>continued appropriation</hi> of the same unto such a Soul; Mal. 4. 2. <hi>But unto you that fear my Name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in his Wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as Calves of the Stall: i. e.</hi> That unto such as so fear the Name of the Lord, as to dread standing before him in their <hi>own Righteousness,</hi> God makes a gracious and ample Promise of healing them of such a fear, (otherwise for what must this healing come in?) and that in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, but not as at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where indeed he manifested himself in this very <hi>Righteousness,</hi> then unto the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as is here spoken of; but that was <hi>in</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> by the Law: and hence it is that it was attended with a keep-off, or touch not, a burning Fire, Blackness, Darkness, Tempest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the issue upon their Spirits was fear and trembling, and a wishing that God in such a Voice would withdraw; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18, 19, 20, 21. But in this Prophecy of Christ where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the self-same Righteousness materially was of God to be revealed, which consists of an exact Obedience unto the Moral Law, and was their Terror in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it is quite otherwise: for here, that which formerly laid them open and naked in their Guilt, and that immediately before a just and holy God, and threatned present Destruction, is promised to become their speedy and sheltring Relief, couch'd in the word <hi>Wings:</hi> And that which formerly kept back from the Lord, as a burning Fire, Blackness, Darkness, Tempest, and so broke the very Nerves and Sinews of Faith, Love and Obedience, here is promised to become their healing by an exhaling, cementing, bright, gentle, refreshing, nourishing and fructifying Power. <hi>The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing,</hi> &amp;c. And yet after all, the Law not vacated or abrogated; for <hi>ver. 4. Remember ye the Law of</hi> Moses, and that as not disanulled, only in a Covenant-sense, but as a discovery of that Righteousness (tho wrought out by another) wherein you must stand justified before God; and also as the safe Rule unto and Test of that Sanctification (tho inherently and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently created by the Spirit) as will prove acceptable with God. Therefore the Church of God in all Generations thought it not only necessary to pray unto him in the <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> as an interposing Peace-maker, Interceder or Reconciler,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94224:8"/>
but <hi>Advocate</hi> also, that had laid down a proper Ransom and Price for <hi>another,</hi> and that from a mutual, personal Compact; and therefore now claims for such a juridical Discharge. There is sufficient proof for this in <hi>John, ch.</hi> 17. compared with <hi>chap. 10. 15. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. and in numberless other places of Scripture. The Psalmist also infers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 12. That he that is justified or covered with this Righteousness, shall flourish in the fruits of Regeneration: And <hi>ver. 13. Those that be planted in the House of the Lord,</hi> (which House, I suppose, in an <hi>antitypical acceptation,</hi> is Christ, in whom it is said that <hi>the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth bodily,</hi> and that as <hi>tabernacling</hi> in our Nature) they shall flourish in the Courts or Assemblies of our God, <hi>viz.</hi> such as are changed in the state of their Persons by a Transplantation of them, since nothing can be planted but what had its Being and Station before, from the first to the second <hi>Adam,</hi> or united unto Christ by the Spirit and realizing Faith, they shall not only have true Grace, but grow and persevere therein unto the end, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. Now all this is discerned, received, applied, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, and particularly improved by Faith, and that both in its objective and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Operation, as it is the principal leading Member of the new Creature; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. and as truly necessary and useful thereunto, as the five Senses are to a healthful, serviceable, and well-ordered Constitution in the Body. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the <hi>hearing Faculty</hi> of a new-born Soul: wherein note, That Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as being God's peculiar Act) in order of Nature precedes this hearing of Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> in its actual exercititious Office, as differing from an habitual Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12, 13. For if an effectual saving Faith be part of the new Creature, then it must necessarily follow, that <hi>this must be created before it can act;</hi> for as our Lord says, <hi>He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear:</hi> Now he knew they had (as having created the same) Ears to hear in a natural, acquired, moral, or civil sense; but it was the <hi>hearing of Faith</hi> that he insisted upon, as being not only part, but the very root in a subjective internal sense of that new Creature. And this <hi>perfectly demonstrates</hi> God's passive Act in justifying, as not only precedent unto, but causal of our Act in believing, in a proposal and application of some distinct Substance, or (if I may so say) Matter to be fixed upon in God, which particularly relates to a righteous, tho violated Law, and consequently the condemning Guilt of a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Transgressor: for the word of Faith is not Faith it self, but a Righteousness offered in the preaching of the Word to be received by Faith: Therefore with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto this Righteousness, both as to Matter, Form, Office, Use and Effects, the Apostle tells us that <hi>Isaiah</hi> was very bold, which our brisk impertinent Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evangelical Scriblers this day would have called <hi>Antinomianism</hi> in another. See <hi>Acts 16. 14. Rom.</hi> 10. 4, 8, 14, 16, 17. compare <hi>ver. 20. Gal. 3. 2, 5. Mat. 13. 14, 15, 16. chap. 11. 15. Rev. 2. 7, 11, 17, 29. chap.</hi> 3. 13, 22. Hence,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the <hi>Eye</hi> thereof, <hi>or the new Creature exerting it self by Faith in its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faculty.</hi> Isa. 45. 22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth. It is the Evidence of things not seen,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. And that from a distinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of several things proposed unto it from that very Chapter, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That none but he who is God, and that by Nature, can save; <hi>ver. 22. For I am God, and there is none else:</hi> Intimating, that if ever polluted, forlorn and rebellious Wretches <hi>(the ends of the Earth,</hi> by Sin become the very shreads and refuse of the Creation) would be <hi>saved,</hi> they must look for the same from a <hi>God of such infinite Perfections,</hi> whose very <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Essence</hi> is not only <hi>Holiness, Justice</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> it self, and yet saves <hi>as such,</hi> as well as <hi>Love, Mercy, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94224:9"/>
Grace,</hi> but also that will not save without a compleat regard unto the whole of his Attributes in the uttermost, immense and incomprehensible Dimensions of the same, and that not <hi>by a new-formed milder Law, curtail'd Covenant, nor by entire or par'd whole, or sophistically scrap'd Conditions</hi> (an Arminians Crutch or Wooden Leg) and all this attended with the squinting reserves of <hi>annihilating an eternal Law,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive of as <hi>eternal a Righteousness;</hi> which had he done, or should he do, he would not only impair and eclipse himself in this very Property of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but without a due, full commensurately adequate regard unto the same, bring an indelible Stain upon the rest of them; <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 17. For to save from a <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Act of Grace in God,</hi> which our Adversaries themselves will acknowledg (or they are horn-mad) and yet to do this without as equal a regard unto a precedent Act of Righteousness in the same God, I suppose, is highly irregular, and not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the least to a Covenant well-ordered and sure. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He swears by himself, That this Salvation should be founded in <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> even such a Righteousness as should not be remotely the cause thereof in a bare atoning, meriting or procuring sense, but such as wherein (and not barely for which) the saved <hi>Sinner</hi> must <hi>as such</hi> be found, and that as in a material clothing; <hi>ver. 23, 24, 25. Isa.</hi> 61. 10. For if I be not righteous, and perfectly so, both in degree as well as kind, or reckoned upon as such of God before he actually justifies me, he cannot (with reverence be it spoken) be just in justifying of me. Now this word <hi>cannot</hi> in God arises not from any Impotency in him, no more than that he cannot lie, either as to diminish his Soveraignty, or eclipse any other of his Divine Attributes; but it is an <hi>Evidence</hi> of his Perfection, which in the issue will redound infinitely more to his Glory in a <hi>comparative sense</hi> than to the Sinner's advantage, tho that be <hi>unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Consult Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atriba de justitiâ divinâ,</hi> which piece of his I could freely wish were by some skilful hand translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to English, and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded would be of great use this day.</note> 
               <hi>and immensly great:</hi> for were it not so, and to this end mainly contrived and cast upon by <hi>eternal Wisdom</hi> it self, he could take no pleasure in the Salvation of a Sinner, which certainly he does, but therein his <hi>chief respect</hi> is to his own Glory. And tho it is true that God may, yea will in due time testify unto a <hi>real</hi> work of Regeneration, when wrought, yet to justify in and for the same, is, 1. To make him a Minister of Sin, the best of our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness being but as filthy Rags, attended with manifold Corruption, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that there is no <hi>compleat, perfect</hi> Justification in this Life. And, 2. To change the Covenant of Grace into that of Works, or cause the former in its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration and Dispensation to depend upon the latter; and herein by a preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Hysteron Proteron,</hi> if the Scriptures may be our Judg, postpone God's <hi>moral Act</hi> in the Justification of Sinners in the material Righteousness of Christ, unto his <hi>Physical Act</hi> from infused Qualities in their Regeneration and Sanctification by his Spirit. The compleatness of God's Act in Justification both in its negative and positive form, without any respect to an inherent Qualification, is conspicuously held forth in the Vision that <hi>Zechariah</hi> had of <hi>Joshuah</hi>'s typical Representation of the Church, whom tho Satan accused, yet the Lord, as we find, does not excuse (as appears from his owning that he had filthy Garments upon him) by either plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Graces, or extenuating his Faults, from a new compiled and pretendedly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased Law, but from a change of his Station: <hi>Is not this a Brand pluck'd out of the Fire?</hi> But how? By removing him from a state of Sin and Guilt unto Death,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94224:9"/>
in taking away his filthy Garments, and thereby causing Iniquity to pass from him, which includes the dying Obedience of Christ, and by clothing him with change of Raiment, which is that Righteousness that springs from the Life-obedience of Christ, and thereby intituling him unto Glory; whence it is that a fair Mitre is put upon his Head, which principally has a relation unto Christ's Priestly Office, intimating that in his Death <hi>Joshua</hi> overcame the Accusations of him that had the power of Death, which is the Devil. Hence,</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Faculty of <hi>Faith</hi> in a renewed Soul, as it is the spiritual Eye thereof, discovers the absolute necessity of all Self-abasement, the Glory of <hi>free Grace</hi> in its distinguishing Soveraignty, and the miserable Disappointment of all such who will not stoop or bend the Knee unto, but rather arm and incense themselves against this way of God's justifying a Sinner in his own Righteousness, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23, 24, 25. compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3, 4. with <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 31, 32, 33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 44. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence comes in the spiritual Ability of the Soul by Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the feeling, handling, or fastning nature thereof, as having apprehensively discerned and felt Substance, it lays hold upon the same, and that from the Strength of God; as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s wrestling, who is called <hi>Israel:</hi> and therefore God stiles himself <hi>the Strength of Israel,</hi> who cannot lie, or fail, where he by Faith engages in the Soul; hence it removes Mountains, overcomes Difficulties, yea does Wonders, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 18. Heb. 11. 1. Isa. 27. 5. Hos. 12. 4. 1 Sam. 15. 29. Isa. 53. 1. Col. 1. 29. Psal. 36. 9. Phil. 4. 13. Rom. 8. 37. Psal.</hi> 87. 7. It is remarkable in <hi>Mark 11. 22. Have Faith in God,</hi> is in the marginal reading, <hi>Have the Faith of God.</hi> Now what can stand before a Faith of God's creating and managing?</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Faith is the Taste or relishing Disposition of a new-born Soul, it is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God in Christ, yea it is Truth received in the love of it; it is that whereby the Soul is enabled to say, as <hi>Isaac</hi> in another case commanded, <hi>Make me savory Meat, such as I love:</hi> Nay, it is that branch of Faith in its actings wherein the Salt of the Covenant consisteth, and without which no Sacrifice, whether taken in a proper or improper sense, would ever be acceptable with the Lord; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3, 4. compare <hi>ver. 7, 8. 2 Cor: 2. 14, 15. 2 Thess. 2. 10. Gen. 27. 4. Numb. 18. 19. Lev. 2. 13. Psal. 40. 7, 8. John 4. 32, 34. Mark 9. 49, 50. Mat.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Faith puts forth it self in a spiritual sense as the smelling Capacity of the Soul, or as the judicious Sentiment of the new Creature, exercising it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one thing and another, both as to Kinds, Parts, Offices and Degrees; as whether the Persons in the Trinity be essentially one God, and yet three posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively distinct Subsistences; and in their peculiar relation one to the other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not one and the self-same Will and Purpose in each of these blessed Three, as to one and the self-same thing, and yet this exerted as the proper separate Act, not in Deity but Personality, of each of them; whether Christ without or Christ within us does materially and personally justify us before God; whether Morality and Grace differ only in kind or degrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now Faith in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, from a scriptural acceptation, is termed the <hi>Nose</hi> of the Church, and that as directed towards <hi>Damascus,</hi> or the <hi>Church's Enemies,</hi> scenting and discriminatively determining between what is true and false: and this Act of Faith is reckoned upon to be no less (from the figure of a Tower, by which it is set forth) than to be in its place, the Strength or Fort of a Church; not promiscuously to take in things, as pretending that <hi>the difference lies only in words,</hi> from a supposed Notion of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks</hi> to amuse People withal, but righteously and accurately to scan and weigh
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94224:10"/>
them, and assign unto each Truth its proper station and office, which tho mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially owned; yet if misplaced, will be of as little use unto the Glory of God, and the benefit of Souls, as Error it self; <hi>Cant. 7. 4. Heb. 5. 14. 1 Cor. 12. 10. John 7. 24. Jer. 15. 19. Psal. 48. 12, 13. Mat.</hi> 23. 23. Now all this is done by Faith, which is a fruit of the Spirit, and without which it is impossible to please God, <hi>Mark 9. 23. Gal. 5. 22. Heb.</hi> 11. 6. Hence it is that the Messengers and Servants of Jesus Christ are termed <hi>Watchmen, Seers, a Light upon a Hill, the Salt of the Earth, the Savour of Christ, and the living Epistles of Jesus Christ seen and read of all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I must needs say, that I am fully satisfied that there is as deep a sifting hand of Providence on foot this day, and that both with respect unto Persons; and therein Practices, Things, and therein Doctrines, as has been since the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> first receiv'd its Commencement: Neither can I call to mind from the little reading I have perhaps been engaged in, any particular Reason that may in the least give us a resemblance of the Trials of this day, unless it be the deceitful Practices of the <hi>Socinians</hi> with the Churches in <hi>Poland,</hi> who subscribing Articles sound in themselves (yet retaining their own wretched reserves) did thereby the more covertly and unexpectedly proceed in the carrying on of their Designs, their AGREEMENT on the one side being no more than a Bait to cover the cursed Hook of their rotten <hi>Doctrines</hi> withal, whereby they more undiscernedly sowed their pernicious Seed, caught and ensnared Souls, and that is to be feared to their eternal ruin and destruction. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That in all Ages it has evidently appeared, that those who have most cry'd up <hi>Graces, Duties, and good Works,</hi> tho not in a meritorious sense, yet as either being in part or in whole the Matter of, or necessary Prerequisites unto God's Act in justifying of a Sinner, have proved the loosest in their Lives, most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful in Practices injurious unto <hi>Authors,</hi> and of the most proud, insolent, morose, and pharisaical Spirit imaginable, witness <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>and her Popes,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all those that <hi>adhere unto her in the controverted Point this day;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is possible, if Provocations be renewed, as undermining Truths of so great a moment, a particular account both of Persons amongst us, and their vile Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings therein, may be openly produced: for none do more obstruct a thorow spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel, both in its distinct and shining Purity, its effectual and abiding Power, and thereby endanger the Souls of the Children of Men, than, meer <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally zealous</hi> and <hi>(as such) devout Professors:</hi> Nay, the more externally exact in Practice, and yet unsound and rotten in Principle, the more will such become the prepared as well as coveted Engines by which the Enemy would mainly desire to carry on his Designs; and yet, after all, none will appear more opposite unto God, and destructive unto Men than such Persons: <hi>Rom. 10. 2. Acts</hi> 18. 14, 15. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 50, 51. with 1 <hi>Thess. 2. 15. Luke 23. 20, 21. Acts</hi> 5. 33, 34, 35.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed, take along a charging Sentence of one of the Heads of their Tribe, as if fulminated out of the <hi>Papal Chair,</hi> thorowly leavened with a pretended spirit of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and that against some by name, and all by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of our former precious and industrious Reformers, who in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings of matters in difference (it seems with him) were but pure Ideots, and in their Labors both for the Lord and his Truths but superfluous, needless and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent; nay further, that <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> were of one and the self-same Judgment, but it seems, poor Fools, they did not understand it; here is a swinging

                  </gap> of many good Mens Opinions and Fears, I was my self some years confident that <hi>Arminianism</hi> was a Character of an Enemy to the soundness and safety of the Church: <note n="*" place="margin">Alas what a loss the Church has had, if not from the Apostles times, yet at least from <hi>Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s even to these latter days, that this <hi>Panaretus</hi> had not entred into the World upon the first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Gospel, and taken a double lease of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusalem</hi>'s Years, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by with his Paludament, as a chief Leader, he might have eased the Church of many Broils, secured it from an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of want of Brains, but especially sav'd it from a needless dying in defence of that which they as it seems erroneously took to be Truth?</note> But when I set my self throughly and impartially to study it, I found that which so amazed me, that I durst scarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what I could not deny, even that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Quarrel between <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> all the voluminous Contentions of the <hi>Thomists</hi> or <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,</hi> and the Jesuits and <hi>Franciscans,</hi> and between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians</hi> (herein) and the <hi>Synodists</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> have been mostly about either <hi>unsearchable things, which neither side understood,</hi> or about ambiguous words, which one party taketh in one sense, and the other in another; or about the meer <hi>methodizing</hi> and <hi>ordering</hi> of the <hi>Notions</hi> which both sides are <hi>agreed in;</hi> and that indeed the most reach not the very Point of the Difficulty and Controversy, but talk before they understand, as their Leaders have taught them; (now they are become meer Parrots) and that when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is distinctly opened, it is found, that multitudes that write, rail, and plot against one another, are really <hi>of one opinion de rebus</hi> (a bold Assertion) <hi>and did not know it:</hi> And that the few remaining Controversies that are <hi>real,</hi> and not only verbal, are but of such small or dubious things, as should break no <hi>Love</hi> nor <hi>Communion</hi> among Christians, but all should with forbearance love each other, in that liberty of judging which they cannot remedy.</q> 
            </p>
            <p>Now there are three things that eminently appear in this Author and his Followers, especially in Debates of this nature. 1. Rotteness in Principle. 2. Imperiousness in Spirit. 3. Deceitfulness in Practice with Authors, Hearers and Readers. This contexture of Qualifications runs through their <hi>Polemical Treatises,</hi> and that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally and more apparently when they set themselves, and that with the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curateness and sedateness, against Sin and Righteousness, both as to the form and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Imputation. Wherefore it is that I think it not altogether unnecessary to lay down some Prelibations or Foretastes of their Methods, whereby the <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Reader</hi> may discern into, and thereby be enabled to judg upon the present Controversy, that whenever they enter upon the same, either in their Teachings or Writings, they never lay before thee a just and naked account of the Debate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94224:11"/>
between us, either as to the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>nature</hi> of the same: for they fully in their way secure, tho but in <hi>cloudy Expressions,</hi> their own Judgment, and that with as <hi>seeming an appearance</hi> of Truth <hi>(where indeed it is not)</hi> as possibly can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and to enforce the same home upon thee and others, they represent their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents thereunto by <hi>Exceptions</hi> drawn forth from most <hi>precarious Positions,</hi> issuing in as <hi>beggarly Conclusions,</hi> never so much as dream'd of by them, and those not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from their just stating either in Words or Matter, of that which they in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position unto the same do really hold. As when Justification is pleaded for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5.

This let me tell thee, is in plain terms their constant course and practice. For instance, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Scripture-Gospel defended, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script to the Reader, compared with Mr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Preface to his Father's Works, <hi>p.</hi> 6. positively asserts, without any manner of just distinction, which he ought to have attended to, if either God or Man had been regarded by him, That his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers hold that Christ and the Elect are one and the same Person, <hi>i. e.</hi> identically or essentially the same, <hi>viz.</hi> as he expresses it, by a <hi>physical or substantial Personality;</hi> here lies his bold, prevaricating and blinding Dexterity: In which method he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, for that ever I have seen of his Books in Controversial Points of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, proceeds; and then tells us, This, Mr. <hi>Crisp</hi> saith, is <hi>more than natural, we being one Spirit, and Bone of his Bone, and Flesh of his Flesh.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Assertion and Explanation being both scriptural and sound, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> could not wholly omit, tho he gives but a partial recital of the same; and all that he does therein is but to anticipate the designed sense thereof, meerly in a prejudicate way to forestal thy Apprehension: That because we are one Spirit with him, therefore we must be essentially and individually one and the self-same Spirit; and because Bone of his Bone, and Flesh of his Flesh (omitting as <hi>foederal Members of his,</hi> in a spiritual relation, wherein one main part of the force of this Mystery lies, tho Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thought meet for several reasons not to mention it) therefore we must be <hi>materially</hi> and <hi>substantially</hi> but one Person; and from hence draws a number of wild, yea most blasphemous Inferences, tho <hi>congenial</hi> enough with his <hi>forged Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Thou mayst see in Dr. <hi>Willet</hi>'s <hi>Tetrastylon Papisticum,</hi> that this is the very way the Papists took of old in their misrepresenting and accusing the Protestant Doctrine in general; they would parcel so much out of every Head thereof that they had a mind to expose as a <hi>ridiculous Notion,</hi> not leaving out the <hi>whole,</hi> but either <hi>cut off,</hi> or add unto what might best lay the same more naked, and liable to a seemingly just Exception: Thus also Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> deals in his doctrinal end of Controversies, <hi>chap. 10. p.</hi> 94. where treating of <hi>original</hi> Sin, he tells us;</p>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>By one Man Sin enter'd into the World, and Death by Sin, and so Death passed upon all, in that all have sinned—</hi>This is pretty honest—But never tells thee; that this same <hi>All</hi> have sinned in him; but as clean Water is defiled by pouring foul into it, so we sinned in him. Now comes in his Exceptions.</p>
            <p>§. 2, 3, 4. <hi>We were not in</hi> Adam <hi>distinct Persons really,</hi> (but whether we were not in God's account considered as such in a foederal sense, he never offers at; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. compare <hi>chap. 4. 17.) for our Persons then existed not,</hi> (here lies the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94224:11"/>
Fallacy) <hi>and therefore did not inexist,</hi> &amp;c. with a great deal more of such pitiful stuff. Now who tells him so? Who pleads this? For unless, it seems with him and the rest of his Disciples, that all the Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> had been createdly and so personally presential in him, <hi>as the Grecians were in the Trojan Horse,</hi> God did not enter personally into Covenant with them by their <hi>Representative Head,</hi> Adam. Thus instead of giving a just account of his Antagonists Sentiments of things in Controversies, he presents them unto thee under disallowed and most gross Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, never so much as thought of or owned by them; as do also the Opposers of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Works: And from hence informs us how we were in <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 5. <hi>We were seminally or virtually in</hi> Adam <hi>when he sinned, as a</hi> virtus generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why all this is very true, but this is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e than a History of the Creation, and the natural Consequences issuing therefrom, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> offers us: For what is this to God's foederal dealing with Man in a <hi>commutative juridical Act</hi> of his, and that by way of transferring <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Righteousness</hi> from the one to the other? He might as well have told us that all the Oaks in the World were seminally and virtually in the first Oak, and have proved it also with as many Arguments, which might have passed for as many Divinity Topicks and Cases, as wherewith he has endeavoured to fortify this his jejune Notion.</p>
            <p>But the Question is, Whether <hi>all the Posterity</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> according to the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>tenure</hi> of <hi>that Covenant</hi> God enter'd into with him, had not a <hi>foederal</hi> (not personally created, wherewith he would blind us) Existence as well and as truly as a <hi>radical one</hi> in him? The latter he acknowledges, the former he denies, tho very obfuscingly, like the Fish <hi>Sepia,</hi> when she designs the overturning of a Ship, vomits out of her Gorge a Cloud of Ink, under which Umbrage, as being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with and therein encompassed and hidden from the sight of the Mariners, she the more covertly and securely accomplishes her Purpose. Thus the Socinians deal with their Opposers; <hi>e. g.</hi> they will in their pleadings against the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity</hi> betake themselves unto <hi>Gen. 1. 26. Let</hi> us <hi>make Man,</hi> &amp;c. and draw Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions from <hi>thence,</hi> that if there be distinct personal Subsistencies in the Deity, and that to be pleaded for from <hi>thence,</hi> why then they blasphemously infer, that the word <hi>[us]</hi> may bespeak either a lesser or greater number than <hi>three</hi> in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, tremendous and blessed <hi>Trin-union,</hi> not at all regarding, or giving their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to know, that that place speaks of a plurality of Persons, which as to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise number <hi>[three]</hi> ought to be regulated and guarded by other <hi>Texts</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, none being of a private Interpretation.</p>
            <p>This is the constant diverting method of these our <hi>Athenian Logicians;</hi> some new thing (which indeed is not new if considered, but an old Error new vampt) they would intrude upon us, tho by old Measures and Practices. For tho it's true, God <hi>personally</hi> and orally entred into Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> but whether it was with him upon his own account, or with Mankind in and by him, is that which is so far from being brought into the state of the Question, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> perfectly shuffles it (by his false and disingenuous forming of the same) out of thy sight. Nay, suppose now since the Fall, that any one Person of the Race of Mankind should be brought into the World with an universal rectitude in his Nature unto the whole of the Law of God, as the direct <hi>Medium</hi> between a Creator and a rational Creature, and should yield, living and dying in that state of natural Perfection, an unspotted or <hi>sinless Obedience</hi> unto the same, yet since that his <hi>Representative</hi> not <hi>quatenus infusing</hi> original, but <hi>substitutive</hi> Head, sinned, this very act of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94224:12"/>
would perfectly overthrow him in Judgment, and that by Imputation. For tho physical Transgression, and consequently sinful Habits and Practices do contract Guilt in themselves barely as <hi>such</hi> considered, yet these have no proper, material, or congenially strict relation (any further than as a consequential Effect) unto a personal, eternal and juridical Charge or Discharge; the one respecting an inward, depraved Nature and Qualification, the other a personal Title, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiousness by way of judicial Right unto this or the other Good or Evil in a forensick sense: Infusion and Imputation being of two different natures, both as to their Matter, Ends and Uses; the one to <hi>qualify,</hi> the other to <hi>justify;</hi> the latter to <hi>enstate,</hi> the former inherently and apprehensively to <hi>fit</hi> for that said state in a fruitional not entituling sense. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Case fully manifests this, in which three things are observable: As, 1. His Sin as a <hi>matter of Fact</hi> laid to his charge, and that by the Lord, <hi>Hast thou eaten of the Tree?</hi> &amp;c. 2. The <hi>Guilt</hi> of that Sin breaking in upon him, as Eyes opened, Nakedness discovered, and Fear oppressing. 3. A defiled, crooked and besotted Nature issuing, therefrom, as extenuating the Crime, casting it wretchedly rather upon God than where it should be, sewing Aprons of Fig-leaves to secure from the stroke of an infinite Divine Arm of offended Justice, and seeking a shelter in the Creature (behind the Trees) from the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing Eye of an uncircumscribed boundless Creator. Now there is not any one of the after Sins of <hi>Adam, i. e.</hi> after his Fall; that is charged upon his Posterity; but this of his Transgression that cast him out of his state of Innocency is fully so, and only imputed unto them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. not any, of his other Sins being in the least mentioned in that respect; which fully demonstrates, (as overthrowing Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Position) that their Guilt as a Covenant-Charge, was not propagated or transferred from <hi>Adam</hi> barely as a communicative Root, through their Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Channel-wise, or in a derivative sense; for he was as much the first of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, truly and properly so, and the Original of all his Offspring afterwards as before. This Supposition of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, it is true, constitutes a Headship, but it is by way of Primacy, or Aeval Precedency, and not Headship by way of Foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy or Covenant in a substitutive sense; for by his account we were no more in <hi>Adam</hi> as a common Person, than as <hi>seminally and virtually so:</hi> but thus we were in him after his being turned out of the Garden as well as before; which strikes at the very root of the nature of Imputation it self. This indeed is the full compass of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, and the Concessions of some others, as to the charge of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> it being in their sense only imputed as it is transfused and inheres, and not as an external, juridical Charge; but it seems it is with them [original] because <hi>Adam</hi> happened to be the first of Mankind, and the first that sinned, but not by them counted <hi>Original Sin,</hi> because the <hi>all of Mankind as in the just and true esteem of God sinned, in his very act of Transgression:</hi> which more fully appears from what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> further urges in the aforesaid Chapter, That the Sins of our more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Parents are as much, if not more, reckoned upon us as our Sins, than the Sin of <hi>Adam.</hi> Now consider, tho <hi>Eve</hi> was first in the Transgression, yet we find not that she saw her Nakedness till <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned, which fully proves, not barely his <hi>original</hi> but <hi>representative</hi> Headship; nay, had she only her self eaten of the forbidden Fruit, unto all eternity she had never in a proper juridical sense broken that Covenant, her Guilt not being charged upon her, till her and our <hi>publick Head</hi> had transgressed, and she and we in him: for tho in what she did as to matter of Fact, in her disregarding of and disobedience unto a negative Precept,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94224:12"/>
render'd her a Transgressor, and that in a positive sense, against her <hi>Creator, Rector</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver;</hi> yet there was no place, no not for infinite Justice it self, to come in and pass a Sentence of Condemnation upon her whilst <hi>Adam</hi> stood, for she foederally stood in him; and whilst he performed the Conditions of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, she was safe from any thing that Divine Vengeance could inflict upon her. Whence, <hi>viz.</hi> from a just Consideration of <hi>Adam</hi>'s being treated with the Lord as a <hi>publick Person,</hi> or <hi>common Head,</hi> it clearly appears to me, that the reigning Pollution of our Natures is the effect of an imputed Sin unto our Persons (weigh these Texts <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>All this my Apprehension <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ay be clearly vindicated from several places in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, especially from the Analogy of Faith therein, and more particularly from <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. hinted at before (beside that of 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 44, &amp;c.)</hi> if the scope of that Chapter in the main design thereof be attended unto: for tho the Apostle (as has been said) knew that he had attained unto Holiness in the reality of its kind, and withal pressed after the same in the perfection of its degree, which he knew would be at farthest made apparent unto all (in the re-uniting of Soul and Body) at the Resurrection of the Dead; yet he also knew, that if he stood not materially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with the Righteousness of another, he would be cast in Judgment (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his <hi>unspotted Holiness)</hi> from a juridical Covenant-charge of the Sin of <hi>another,</hi> in the compleat <hi>matter of Fact</hi> thereof lying upon him.</p>
            <p>Therefore says the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 5. 2. If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</hi> Now the Question will arise, Whether does the Apostle intend, that this Ordinance of Circumcision in its bare <hi>external Administration,</hi> by a meer literal cutting off of the foreskin of the Flesh only; or, that in its spiritually figurative relation also, as holding forth the change of the Heart, would be so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing any thing, either in whole or in part, towards their <hi>Justification,</hi> if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon for that end, that <hi>even</hi> Christ himself thereby would be render'd of no effect, or unprofitable unto them? I suppose he means it chiefly in the <hi>latter</hi> sense, the former being too gross a piece of Hypocrisy, even for those false Teachers themselves who had crept in among the <hi>believing Galatians,</hi> to insist upon; and so palpably absurd, that it is hard to imagine how <hi>Peter, Barnabas,</hi> and other good Men should be caught by it: But that tho they brought in a Heart-renovation, or a Circumcision of the Heart, shadowed forth by their actual compliance with its outward Application in the use of that Institution, yet if as to any part of the matter of their Justification, they excluded Christ thereby. Therefore <hi>Circumcision,</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>the Works of the Law</hi> are convertible terms with the Apostle in this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94224:13"/>
case, as totally expunging and abhorring them from having any share or part in this Doctrinal Point and Concern: For a spiritual Circumcision is the Law written in the Heart, which if either more or less relied upon as to the forementioned end, will absolutely make us Debtors to do the whole Law, by which we must be either acquitted or cast, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4. But the Apostle, whatever others might do, durst not trust unto this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22, 23, 24, 25. and therefore says, <hi>Phil. 3. 3. We are the Circumcision which worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the Flesh;</hi> compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Nay, grant we were throughly, by way of Inherency, holy, yet this Sin of Imputation, which respects a foederal Headship, tho not actually in our own personal existence contracted by us, notwithstanding the compleat supposed healing of the vitiosity of our Natures, would absolutely and irresistibly condemn and overthrow us. <hi>Job</hi> knew this very well, <hi>chap. 9. 15. Whom tho I were righteous, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore Christ's Righteousness so far is not imputed unto him for Remission.</q> A piece of perfect <hi>Diabolism!</hi> And no less indeed than that wherein and whereby all those wild, heretical, yea blasphemous Notions and Treatises, that have pester'd the Church of God in all Generations, do lie and are cherish'd; nay the very bottom on which the <hi>Papal Justification,</hi> and the Quakers state of Perfection in a <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness</hi> are founded.</p>
            <p>Now it is true, many may be qualified for the managing of vast Estates, Offices and Places, yea Kingdoms, who yet have no right thereunto; and their entrance upon the same without a juridical Title thereunto, would soon constitute them Thieves and Robbers, as not entring into and upon the same legally, or at the door, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 7, 8, 9. compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 11. Hence Christ is called <hi>the Door,</hi> or certain unquestionable entrance into a legal Inheritance; which tho of Grace it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes such to all the Elect, in the drawings of the Father by his Spirit, yet in Righteousness through the Son they come in time to lay claim unto the same; for no elect Vessel, as chosen in Christ, but has as just a Title (tho founded in Grace) unto such a Faith as enables him to receive that Righteousness to his Justification, as he has a right to Glory in and by virtue of the same Righteousness so receiv'd,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94224:13"/>
nay, his very Faith depends absolutely upon the application thereof, or otherwise what must we believe or receive by Faith? for this Righteousness in the preaching of Christ is the first thing offered unto Sinners, as unrighteous and ungodly ones: and to whomsoever of them this Righteousness doth belong, Faith is given unto such to receive the same; but those that have not a previous Interest in and Title unto it, tho in the right of another, are left to stumble at it through Unbelief; <hi>Acts 13. 48. chap. 18. 10. Luke 10. 6. Mark 4. 11, 12. Joh. 6. 36, 37, 39, 64, 65. Rom. 9. 30, 31, 32, 33. chap. 10. 3, 4. Acts 13. 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. chap.</hi> 28. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>True Regeneration</hi> never more expresses it self in the <hi>reality</hi> of its kind and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Operation, than by bringing the Soul under a submissive active reception of an <hi>external Righteousness</hi> for its Justification in a material (not meritorious, and as such subservient thereunto) sense before God; not as it is previous thereunto, but <hi>consequential</hi> upon such an <hi>Imputation,</hi> and ever operates <hi>towards,</hi> and <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in</hi> the same as its <hi>proper Basis, resultive Centre, and cherishing Spring; Rom. 10. 3, 4. Isa. 61. 10. Mat. 22. 11. Rev. 3. 18. Psal. 69. 27, 28, 29. 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5. Joh. 6. 68. Psal. 119. 40. Mal. 4. 2. Psal.</hi> 87. 7. And indeed it is this, and this alone, that is the physical or internal cause of a Person's actual discerning, embracing and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting unto the same; <hi>which tho it be the first in Man's Experience, yet it is the last in God's Order;</hi> there being nothing that can dispose the Sinner unto a reception of such an Offer, but what becomes the holy Nature of God himself, even his Image, which is made up of <hi>sound Knowledg,</hi> exerting it self into <hi>practical Wisdom,</hi> as its Flower or the perfection of its Growth, issuing in a well <hi>sounded</hi> and <hi>stable Judgment,</hi> altogether attended, at least habitually, with a <hi>readiness of Will</hi> and <hi>warmth of Affections,</hi> &amp;c. Now tho all that be the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putedly righteous or justified State, yet it is thorow these as created and managed by the Spirit of the Lord, that the Soul comes sensibly to apprehend, approve, lay hold of, and experimentally to apply the same unto it self, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 11, 12. compare <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 20, 21, 22. Therefore it is that our actual <hi>seeing</hi> of the Kingdom of God arises from our being born again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. tho our Interest therein depends not upon the same, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>Now this blessed <hi>Image</hi> is not in the least any part of <hi>that Righteousness</hi> which the Scripture calls for our voluntary submission unto, either as to the matter or form of its application to our personal Justification; for what should incline us unto an actual submission or stooping unto this Image or express Likeness of God in Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? there being nothing in us by Nature but what is <hi>perfect Enmity</hi> against the same, therefore wrought by <hi>Super-creation Grace:</hi> But it is that whereby God capacitates the Soul <hi>discerningly, perswasively</hi> and <hi>experimentally</hi> to receive this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Righteousness,</hi> and to take full possession thereof as its <hi>material Clothing,</hi> being previous unto this act of Submission, reckoned upon and imputed unto <hi>such</hi> of God himself; <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 16. compare <hi>Psal. 119. 18. Joh. 6. 29. Rom. 10. 4. Psal. 69. 27. Isa. 46. 13. chap. 51. 5. Phil.</hi> 3. 9. Therefore says Christ, <hi>Luke 10. 5, 6. Into whatsoever House ye enter, first say, Peace be to this House: And if the Son of Peace be there, your Peace shall rest upon it; if not, it shall return unto you again.</hi> Here we find that the offers of Peace and Reconciliation was the Commission that the Primitive Gospel-preachers were entrusted with by Christ the great Lawgiver, to lay before Sinners; but these offers of Peace and Reconciliation Christ positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares should not be received but by those who were indeed the Sons of Peace,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94224:14"/>
even before they heard so much as the glad tidings thereof, much less receiv'd it: for it is one thing to have Peace with God, and another thing to be <hi>at</hi> peace with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19. compare. <hi>ver.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that tho Christ is said to be made <hi>Righteousness, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> unto his People; yet we find also that this his being so made over unto them is manifested in order to their reception of, comfort and establishment in the same, by his being made also of God, and that in the first place, Wisdom unto them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. for it is he, tho by his Spirit, that opens their Eyes, takes away the Vail off their Hearts, causes them to dive by Faith into the very inward Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualities of the Word, unseals the Book of Life, and gives them a saving sight of the Mysteries of Divine Love, together with their Privileges therefrom, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the same, and that from Eternity; to Eternity; <hi>Joh. 1. 18. Rev. 3. 18. Mat. 11. 27. 2 Cor. 3. 16, 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. compare <hi>ver. 16. Joh. 1. 50, 51.

Jer. 31. 3. 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 9. Into a want of this it is that the Apostle ultimately in a radically decreed sense resolves the Stubbornness of the Jews, who would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto this Righteousness for their Justification, <hi>Rom. 9. 30, 31, 32, 33. chap.</hi> 10. 3, 4. compare <hi>Acts 28. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. 1 Cor. 1. 23, 24. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 14, 15. For a visive and receptive Faculty or Disposition is not the thing received for this use, either in a meritorious or material, or precedent as titular sense; common Reason will tell us this; but it is wrought in us for a certain distinct Use, End and Employ. Now does my faculty of seeing, and apprehending, or laying hold of, give what is seen or apprehended, either a being unto it in it self, or me a Title thereunto? In the prosecution of such an Hypothesis what desperate work would Men make with the Tenth Commandment? since it is either mine before this, and that in a righteous as well as a material sense, or it never will be. An Inheritance is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, bequeathed, and appropriated Blessing, and that by a Law-Title settled upon us; but our Qualification for both our reception, entrance upon, and improvement of the same, springs from an inherent Endowment, which cannot be either the material, meritorious or moving Cause of our right unto, tho it make way for our actual possession of, the same; the state of a Man's Person, and qualification of his Nature being two absolutely distinct things, both as to matter and order: for if we have not the matter of our Justification, either in or of our selves, whence and for what is it, that a Qualification, properly such, must arise? as the hearing, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Faculties of Faith. And if we have the same within us, for what uses and ends are our Qualifications? for if that Righteousness be in us, which must materially justify us, what needs a Qualification to receive it, or Merits to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it? since God will testify unto, and uphold his own Image, both as to its matter, use, and place, being his particular Workmanship whenever it is wrought. Now this is either pure in it self, (which as a Creature of God, is certainly and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially so) and if so, what need remote Assistances to render it acceptable as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (if it must be such) of our Justification? If impure, for what is Merit, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from Matter, brought in? Will the Merits of Christ's material Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness render our Pollutions, in a proper, or improper sense, Holiness unto the Lord? For either the new Creature, and that wrought of God in us, is in its own immix'd nature undefiled, or it is not; which certainly is not, tho attended, yet not contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with various Defilements; for his Image can no more essentially be polluted in a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94224:14"/>
proper identic sense, than he himself can be, it being in Believers (tho much darkened from their sight, and kept back from its proper Evidences by reason of permitted and inter-operating Corruptions) as wrought and maintain'd by God himself, entire in its nature, tho dogg'd and attended with manifold Infirmities, and Pull-backs, as Oil mixt with other Liquors; <hi>Rom. 7. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. Mat. 5. 48. 1 Pet. 1. 15, 16. Gal. 5. 17. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 20. compare <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. with <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 7, 8. And if so, it is as to its own Essence and Nature distinctly pure, and shall by a dissolution between Soul and Body, be perfectly cleared and rid of all manner of sinful adherences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But some may suppose, that this seems to confirm what was so highly and lately condemned in a Latin Saying of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s above-cited.</p>
            <p>Not at all: for tho it is true, That the Image of God sinneth not, neither as such can it sin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. and therefore needeth not Pardon; and it were very uncouth, yea perfect nonsense, to say, that a Creature which springs from the new Birth, wholly compacted and made up of the Graces of the Spirit, should <hi>in se</hi> be capable of sinning; but that any, or the best of Persons in whom the same is wrought, doth not daily sin, and as daily stand in need of Pardon, is high Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if lying against the Truth may be reckoned upon as such, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8, 10. It is not <hi>Natures,</hi> but <hi>Persons,</hi> that are the capable and proper Objects of Pardon, Justification and Salvation: Nature, it is confest, is inherently the distinct Subject of Sin, or Grace; and where totally under the power and dominion of Sin, if in an elected and pre-justified Vessel, in time it is renewed by the mortifying and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Efficacy of the Spirit's Operation; which, as renewed, so maintain'd, and as maintain'd, so testified unto, and that from impressive Evidences congenial with his Work manifested, which is either sooner or later, more or less, oftner or sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer, longer or shorter, as to its experimental abode; and all by the self-same Spirit, who as a free Agent both works and seals unto the same, when and how he pleases.</p>
            <p>But the grub of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Notions lies here, as retaining this in it, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward special work of Grace (to speak more favourably of him than ever yet I could see ground for) being the material Righteousness of a Sinner's Justification before God, of consequence it must be, that where this is truly wrought and drawn forth into sincere acts of Obedience, then, thence and there he rationally concludes according to his own <hi>moral Swasion,</hi> that there needs not any thing of the Righteousness of Christ, either to acquit such in whom it is created from the charge of Sin, or give them a forensick Title unto Glory. This is the <hi>secret Radix</hi> on which all his Antichristian Pile and Fabrick of Divinity is laid and built.</p>
            <p>Do but clear up this, and you will soon find from a diligent attendance upon the Treatises of these Men, into what it is that they both materially, formally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentially lodg and resolve this their violent, false and new-coin'd Charge of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianism; namely, That an actual commutative transferring of Sin and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and that in the very matter of Fact as to each of them, by as true and real an Imputation as God himself could, at least-wise (with a compleat respect to his own Attributes, and the Salvation of a Sinner) would charge upon the suffering, innocent, voluntary Substitutive, and the ungodly, yet righteous Sinner, is the very bottom on which it is essentially founded, and whence <hi>it</hi> as essentially springs and is nourished, under the various pretences of Graces; Duties, Holiness, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience therein. Remove but this, and I shall engage a perfect Coalescency between
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94224:15"/>
Parties more immediately at variance this day, without so much in the least as a talk of Heads of Union, nay, or oral Conference between them: For it is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as the Sun at noon-day, that they knew it was in vain to engage plainly and above board about this Point with their Orthodox trick'd Subscribers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought the most likely Expedient for their success in an insensible removal of this Foundation, and introducal of their own rotten Principles into the room there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and all to deceive the People by their cloudy Preachments, as well as their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniters with their false Subscriptions, was by a hooking in some of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of their Teachers and Leaders into a seeming agreement in Fundamentals, in which they were even then in their judgments no more one, than white and black as Colours are; and this these double-dealers knew very well, as appears by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced and just Consequences, even at the time of their compiling and signing this their subtile Engine and Instrument.</p>
            <p>Nay, even many, if not most of those deceased that they impeach for Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, they cannot but acknowledg to be gracious and holy Men; which, when the good fit takes them, they will pretty honestly own, provided you disturb them not in their designs therein; yea further, I have seen, I think in print, if they may be believed, that they think their Souls are in Heaven, even the Souls of such who when upon Earth they charged for being the promoters of the Doctrines of Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness. Whence then comes in this Charge of Antinomianism against them? Why hence, as was said before, meerly from their holding of a transimputation of Sin and Righteousness, in their distinct matters of Fact, from one to another; which when once quitted, Reader, let me tell thee, thou mayst bid a thorow adieu to the Christian Religion, as to what advantage thou wilt reap by it, either as to any hopes of Peace with God therefrom, acquitment from Sin in its Guilt, or a standing in a justified state before him.</p>
            <p>Now consider, That the Righteousness of Christ in its <hi>pure merit</hi> procures and purchases a free and irrevocable Pardon for Sin, or makes way for the full mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation and application thereof from the Heart of Grace and Mercy, through the hands of infinite Justice, by an immaculate, proper and bloody Sacrifice; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25, 26. And that the same Righteousness in the compleat matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as truly imputed, is that for and in which the Elect are reckoned just, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon brought into an actual state of Grace here, as also an entitling state unto Glory hereafter; and tho they always stand indistant one from the other, yet they fall under a separate Consideration (if the Analogy of Faith be regarded) as to their distinct Uses and Ends: which distinction duly attended unto according to Scripture allowance, would soon unravel the crafty Designs of such who say, <hi>That Merit and Matter are the same in judicial Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore if this indwelling Righteousness so much pleaded for, be our justifying Righteousness, what needs the application of an <hi>external</hi> one in any sense to support the same? (unless, as they say, in a <hi>meritorious way;</hi> but that can be no longer than whilst we are in the Body, after which it is cashier'd both as to its Merit and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as being of no further use unto them, when they are thereby made perfect to stand justified before God in their own Holiness) for as it is pure in its kind, <hi>ut suprà,</hi> so at death all the remainders of adhering Sin shall be done away, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ue Regeneration is wrought. Now if so, then a Justification in this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by virtue or through the Merits of the Righteousness of another, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the day of Judgment, is a downright double-branch'd piece of Popery,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94224:15"/>
it being in it self but a meer Act of Supererrogation, and a Justification by Works also.</p>
            <p>But and if this justifying Righteousness both as to its Matter and Merit be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, How shall we attain unto it, unless the same be given unto us as previous unto our Qualification for our reception of the same? An Heir is an Heir, and that by Law, even before he enjoys his Estate, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 5, 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6. And when he comes to claim Possession, what does he do it by? Is it because he is qualified by his attaining unto such a number of Years? Not at all, he is thereby qualified it is true to plead his Right: But how does he do it? It is by producing old Deeds of Settlement, pleading antient Covenant-Contracts, former Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, ratified, sealed and confirmed even before he was born, and that from a mutual Compact betwixt Party and Party upon valuable Considerations, which tho founded in a free act of Donation, yet is transferred over unto him in a juridical sense, by which he pleads, carries on his Cause, and enters upon his Right. And altho nothing can be freer than a Gift, yet I suppose no way safer for our reception and retention of it, than by attending upon the Intention of the Conveyer, in his dispensing and communicating of the same. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>Note, <hi>That unless the Name of God in the whole and compleat dimensions of the infinite Attributes of the same, be more glorified in the Salvation of a Sinner, than the said Sinner can possibly be benefited thereby, he cannot either unreservedly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly rejoice in God, and consequently find any solid Peace and Comfort in his own Soul;</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30, 31. Revel. 1. 5, 6. chapter 4. 2, 8, 9, 10, 11. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve therefore those Authors and Teachers that give thee Truth by its handle; for many will speak and write that which is Truth in it self, but if either it be mistimed, misapplied, and especially misplaced, or not kept within its proper bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> and station, it will do thee more harm than good. 2 Tim. 2. 15. <hi>Rightly dividing the word of Truth,</hi> is the mark of a sound as well as faithful Teacher; for no posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Error will prove more pernicious unto the Soul than an irregulated or falsly managed Truth, which usually drops from the Pens and Mouths of such who would rather manage Truth, than suffer themselves to be managed by it. <hi>Corruptio optimi est pessima.</hi> I shall hereunto add a Saying of one truly termed a Reverend Prolocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and quoted as such by worthy Mr. <hi>Robert Lancaster,</hi> in his defence of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Works, lately come out, against the unjust Exceptions of one Mr. <hi>Geree; That the Righteousness of Christ is said to be imputed to us by Faith, because it is not discerned to be imputed to us of God but by Faith.</hi> This plainly shews, that it is imputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is either discerned or received. A Sentence highly deserving to be writ in Characters of Gold, both for its Matter and Conciseness.</p>
            <p>Now that thou mayst see that the main design of these great Pretenders unto Holiness (in whose Writings and Practices it could be wish'd that some proper <hi>Vestigias</hi> of its true nature did appear) is but that whereby they might deprive us of a Covenant-Headship, I shall lay a parallel Instance before thee of their Proceedings herein, from a recited Passage out of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and that <hi>verbatim,</hi> lest I be thought to impose upon the Reader, from Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi>'s account of the same, as managed between one Frier <hi>Ambrosius Catarinus</hi> on the one hand, and Frier-<hi>Dominicus Soto</hi> on the other. Nine Articles having been proposed to that Synod, some of them containing the very Abstract of our <hi>Neonomian Scheme</hi> (both joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly synonimous in their Methods for establishing the same) few opposed them save <hi>Catarinus,</hi> and that very worthily and judiciously, as to the main of his design
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94224:16"/>
therein; against whom <hi>Soto</hi> objected, whose Divinity was received and ratified by that Convention, and the former's rejected. For had <hi>Catarinus</hi>'s, sound Proposition taken place, including in it a foederal Headship, (which the Pope dreaded, and therefore posted away his Portmantuas of Gold to make friends [the method of some this day] to preserve his own blasphemously assumed Capitalship, and that upon the same bottom that our present Opposers go to work) Antichrist, or the Man of Sin had long since been laid in the Dust. Now I must desire thee to take notice of what <hi>Catarinus</hi> his design is, in what he urges about Sin, otherwise thou mayst stumble at some Expressions of his in this Citation, <hi>viz.</hi> that he speaks only of that Sin, whereby in the imputation thereof as a matter of Fact, the Sinner in a Covenant-sense stands condemn'd juridically before God, (the Conference being more immediately about Justification) which his Opponent <hi>Soto</hi> endeavours, with the Arguments of some this day, to refute. The words are as follows.</p>
            <q>
               <p>No Man resisted the Condemnation of the Articles: But Frier <hi>Ambrosius Catarinus</hi> noted the Reasons for unsufficient, in that they declared not the true nature of this Sin, and shewed it in a long Discourse: The substance whereof was, That it is necessary to distinguish the Sin from the Punishment; that Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence and privation of Righteousness is the Punishment of Sin, therefore that it is necessary the Sin should be another thing. He added, that which was not a Sin in <hi>Adam,</hi> it is impossible it should be a Sin in us: but neither of these two were Sin in <hi>Adam,</hi> because neither privation of Righteousness, nor Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence were his Actions, therefore neither are they in us; and if they were effects of Sin in him, of necessity they must be so in others also.</p>
               <p>By which reason it cannot be said that Sin is the Enmity of God against the Sinner, nor the Sinner's Enmity against God, seeing they are things that follow Sin, and come after it.</p>
               <p>He oppugned also the transmission of Sin by means of the Seed and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, saying, That as if <hi>Adam</hi> had not sinned, Righteousness would have been transferred, not by virtue of the Generation, but only by the Will of God, so it is fit to find another means to transfuse Sin. And he explained his Opinion in this form; That as God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity when he made him Father of the Faithful, so when he gave original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to <hi>Adam</hi> and all Mankind, he made him seal an Obligation in the name of all to keep it for himself and them, observing the Commandments; which because he transgressed, he lost it as well for others as for himself, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the Punishments also for them; the which as they are derived into every one, so the very Transgression of <hi>Adam</hi> belonged to every one; to him as the Cause, to others by virtue of the Covenant: so that the Action of <hi>Adam</hi> is actual Sin in him, and imputed to others, is original; because when he sinned, all Mankind did sin with him. <hi>Catarinus</hi> grounded himself principally, for that a true and proper Sin must needs be a voluntary Act, and no other thing can be voluntary but the Transgression of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed unto all. And <hi>Paul</hi> saying that all have sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> it must be understood that they have all committed the same Sin with him. He alledged, for Example, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>Levi</hi> paid Tithe to <hi>Melchisedec</hi> when he paid it in his great Grandfather <hi>Abraham;</hi> by which reason it must be said, that the Posterity vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Commandment of God when <hi>Adam</hi> did it, and that they were Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in him, as in him they received Righteousness. And so there is no need to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94224:16"/>
run to Lust which infecteth the Flesh, whence the Soul receiveth Infection: For it cannot be understood how a Spirit can receive a corporal Passion; and if Sin were a spiritual Blemish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>in the Soul; it could not first be in the Flesh; and if it be corporal in the Flesh, it can work none effect in the Spirit. That the Soul by joining it self with an infected Body, doth receive spiritual Infection, is an unconceivable Transcendency. He proved the Covenant of God with <hi>Adam</hi> by a place of the Prophet <hi>Osea,</hi> by another of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> and by many places of St. <hi>Austin.</hi> That the Sin of every one is the Act only of the Transgression of <hi>Adam,</hi> he proved by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he saith, That <hi>by the Disobedience of one Man, many are made Sinners:</hi> and because the Church hath ever understood that Sin is nothing else but a voluntary Action against the Law, of which kind there was none but that of <hi>Adam;</hi> and because St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that Death enter'd by original Sin, which enter'd only by actual Transgression. And he brought for the principal proof, that tho <hi>Eve</hi> did eat the Apple before <hi>Adam,</hi> yet she knew not she was naked, nor that she had incurred the Punishment, but only after <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned. Therefore <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, as it was not his alone, but of <hi>Eve</hi> too, so was it also of all his Posterity.</p>
               <p>But Frier <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> to defend the Opinion of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the other Divines from the Objections of <hi>Catarinus,</hi> brought a new Exposition, and said, That <hi>Adam</hi> sinned actually in eating the forbidden Fruit, but after he remained a Sinner by an habitual Quality, caused by the Action, as by every bad Action such a Disposition is bred in the mind of the Actor, by which, tho the Act be past, he remain'd and is called a Sinner; that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Action was transitory, nor had existence but while he wrought; that the habitual Quality remaining in him, passed into the Posterity, and is transfused as proper unto every one; that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Action is not original Sin, but that consequent Habit which the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues call privation of Righteousness, which may be well expounded, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that Man is call'd a Sinner, not only when he transgresseth actually, but after also, until the Sin be cancelled, not in regard of the Punishments, or other consequences of Sin, but in regard of the preceding Transgression it self; as that which maketh a Man crooked until he be straitned again, who is said to be so, not by an actual Action, but by that Effect which remaineth after the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is past. He compar'd original Sin to Crookedness, as it is indeed a spiritual Obliquity; for the whole nature of Man being in <hi>Adam,</hi> when he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self crooked by transgressing the Precept (here lies the Baxterian Hook) the whole Nature of Man, and by consequent, every particular Person remained crooked, not by the curvity of <hi>Adam</hi> (mark that Friend!) but by his own, by which he is truly crooked and a Sinner, until he be straitned by the Grace of God.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This last of <hi>Soto</hi>'s definition of Sin, and the concerns of a Sinner therein, as he stands either juridically acquitted from or charged with the same before God, is that which was received by that general Synodical Congress at <hi>Trent,</hi> whereon it was, is, and shall remain the foundation of all the hopes o. Self-justiciaries, till the full accomplishment of those Promises and Decrees touching the total and final downfal and overthrow of that Man of Sin, (whose main support, <hi>as such,</hi> lies in this Doctrine) with all his Adherents, be brought about.</p>
            <p>And now, before we enter upon the following Quotations, let me say, which I solemnly do, That I desire no more as to my Justification before, Acceptance and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94224:17"/>
Peace with God both here and hereafter, and that as to the matter and manner of its Communication, together with its assigned, genuine influential Effects both in Graces and Duties, and from the whole my Fellowship with the Lord thereby, than what these Persons, with whom our present Contest does lie, do with the greatest industrious Malice, and deceitful Impudence seek to deprive us of. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was very sensible of this, when he said that he could overlook many things in the Romanists, were they but clear and stedfast in this point of Justification. The same may be said of several this day.</p>
            <p>The subsequent Citations have each of them distinctly their peculiar relation, either in a congruous or incongruous sense, to one or more of the nine Doctrinal, Reformed, Protestant Heads mentioned in the Introduction, unto which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is referred, to determine the matter in hand by an impartial weighing both the one and the other of them in the Ballances, of the Sanctuary.</p>

                           <p>When afterwards some Soldiers came to his house, and threatned to knock him on the head; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered with Confidence, that if they did, they should send him to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where he long'd to be, but they could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing except God gave them leave.</p>

God is not the Author of any evil Action, as it is evil, either by willing, decreeing, bidding it, or moving thereunto, but only as he giveth Power, as our Creator, to his Creatures, to move or work this or that; therefore a sinful work. As it cometh of God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, it is a Work only, and no Sin; as it is of Man it is Sin and Wickedness.</p>
                           <p>Again, God is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be respected in a sinful Work and Action, but as a just Judg, which punisheth Sin by Sin; for it is a just thing before God to recompence one Sin by another: and so it is to be considered not so much as it is a Sin, as a Punishment of Sin. Again, in the same Action God propoundeth one end, as the exercising of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and manifestation of his Mercy, as in the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Job;</hi> the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth respecteth some evil end, as Satan laboureth the subversion of <hi>Job:</hi> and the evil affection and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Instrument maketh the Action evil, but God is free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted: God therefore is not any ways the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Sin.

                           <p>God did eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to glorify himself in the Salvation of some, and Damnation of others, which the Event doth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94224:22"/>
plainly demonstrate: But for those in whose Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he decreed to glorify his Mercy, he worketh in them the means of their Salvation, Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, perseverance in Faith and Godliness, by an influx of Grace into their Souls, by a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet not violent, by a most sweet, and yet most infallible guidance of their Wills, in and over which God hath a more predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant Power than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                           <p>As for those in whose Damnation God glorifieth his Soveraignty and Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he doth it not by an influx of Malice into their Souls, nor by unavoidable wresting of their Wills unto any particular Sin, but leaveth all sinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective Actions to their own sinful defective Wills, which wanting the special Grace and effectual gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance proceeding from divine Predestination, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail to run themselves willingly and wittingly on their own Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>The means whereby Men are brought unto Salvation, are real Effects of the Divine Election wrought by God's Spirit, as the light and heat of the Air is by the Sun.</p>
                           <p>But the means whereby Men are carried to their Damnation grow from themselves, as the coldness

and darkness of the Air is from it self.</p>
                           <p>In this Decree Faith, Perseverance, and all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Graces are not in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature the foreseen Conditions, but the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen Effects of Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                           <p>God is not to learn of us what maketh most for his own Glory; he could have upheld the Angels which made a voluntary Apostacy from him; he could have upheld our first Parents; he could by his special and effectual Grace have brought every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Man in the World unto Salvation; and all this he could undoubtedly have done without prejudice to the Creature's free-will: but since we know and see he hath done otherwise, we must confess that this order of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whereby he hath decreed to guide and bring some infallibly unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happiness, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath decreed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit some infallibly to fall into eternal Misery, doth make most for his Glory.</p>
                           <p>The Maintainers of the absolute Decree hold that nothing is acted in this World good or bad, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an eternal Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Decree of God's Will for the being of such a particular Act: But they detest the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and make this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt good. Actions and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94224:23"/>
bad, that good and holy Actions have God, not only a determining Cause for their Event, but an effectual working Cause in their Production; bad Actions have God the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining Cause of their Event, but the permissive Cause only of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
                           <p>If any Man think that Non-election, or negative Reprobation implieth that some Men are made to be tormented in Hell for God's Absolute Pleasure, and not for their own Sin, he is in a foul Error. God made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and for the illustrating of his own Glory: And he eternally saw that he could illustrate his Glory in most excellent manner, by making all Men capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Salvation, and yet by permitting some Men to incur Damnation: This he eternally and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decreed to do by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring special Grace for some, and bestowing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in due time he infallibly worketh their Salvation: and these only in Scripture are termed <hi>Men predestinated</hi> or <hi>elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And on the contrary, by not preparing, and not bestowing effectual or spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace upon others, they do wilfully and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly work their own Damnation and Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and these we call <hi>not elected, not predestinated,</hi>

                           <p>Reprobation is the most wise Purpose of God, whereby he hath before all Eternity (for his own Will's sake) constantly decreed, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, not to have Mercy on those Angels and Men whom he hath not loved, but hath passed them over when he did chuse others, that by their just Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he might declare his Wrath towards Sin, to the Glory of his Justice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 10, 11, 18, 22, 23.

                           <p>The second Act is a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of condemning, or an Ordination to Pain, even eternal and most just Damnation. This is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, affirmative, or respective Reprobation, which respecteth Sin ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal or actual (as the meritorious cause of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.) But note fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94224:27"/>
that this Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Pain (which is the second Act of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is either simple, whereby this or that Man (as <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Judas)</hi> were ordained to Pain; or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative, whereby <hi>Cain</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> rather than <hi>Peter,</hi> be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained: of this latter the Will of God is the sole cause, but the soveraign cause of both; yet in the former not without rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Sin, as a mean of the Pain. Note yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That what place Christ (in whose Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Suffering we are chosen, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4.) hath in the Election of saved Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; that place Sin hath in the Reprobation of the wicked, in which it is no Efficient that is in God's Will, but a material cause of their Condemnation. <hi>Tho.

some Perseverants; the two first Orders are chosen truly, but not absolutely, but only for a time, so long as they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as they are; the the third are chosen finally and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily: for this Act of God is either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued or interrupted according as we ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Condition. <hi>Rem.

                           <p>The Pelagian saith, God foreknew such as would be holy and immaculate by the freedom of their Will, and therefore he chose them before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World in his very Prescience, whereby he foreknew they would become such: Whereas the Apostle saith, he chose us in him before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, that we should be holy and without spot; not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore because we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come such, but that we

should be such: This is certain, this is manifest, that therefore we would become such, because he did choose us, predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us, that we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come such by his Grace. True it is, that St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> himself was once of that Opinion with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians, Pontificians, and our new Pelagians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God's Prescience, as understanding it to be nothing else but a prevision of future Things and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and thereupon to have grounded his Decree: Which Opinion <hi>Augustine</hi> ingenuously retracteth and recanteth in the first Book of his Recantations, <hi>ch.</hi> 23.

Predestination hath two Parts, Election and Reprobation, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 9. Election is God's Decree, whereby on his own free will he hath ordained cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Men to Salvation to the praise of the Glory of his Grace, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6. This Decree is the Book of Life, wherein are written the Names of the Elect, <hi>Rev. 20. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Decree of Reprobation is that part of Predestination, whereby God, according to the most free and just purpose of his Will, hath determined to reject certain Men unto eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and Misery, and that to the praise of his Justice, <hi>Rom. 9. 21. 1 Pet. 2. 8. Jude 4. 1 Thess. 5. 9. Perk.</hi> Golden Chain, <hi>p.</hi> 10, 23, 163. This is verbatimly contradicted by Mr. <hi>B. Method. Theol.</hi> Par. 1. p. 59.</p>
                           <p>This Election the Word of God proposeth unto us, as the gracious immutable Decree of <hi>Almighty God, whereby; before the foundation of the World, out of his own good Pleasure, he chose certain Men, determining to free them from Sin and Misery, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon them Grace and Faith, to give them unto Christ, to bring them to everlasting Blessedness for the Praise of his glorious Grace.</hi> Dr. <hi>O</hi>'s Display of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianism, <hi>p.</hi> 51.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, The Article of the Ch. of <hi>Engl.</hi> (which he recites) is clear, that the Object of this Predestination is some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Men chosen out of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; that is, it is such an Act of God, as concerneth some Men in particular; taking them as it were aside from the midst of their Brethren, and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for some special end and purpose: the Scripture also aboundeth in asserting this Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, calling them that are so chosen <hi>a few, Matth.</hi> 20. 16. which must needs denote some certain Persons; <hi>and the residue according to Election,</hi> Rom. 11. 5. <hi>Those whom God knows to be

his,</hi> 2 Tim 2. 19. <hi>Men ordained to eternal Life,</hi> Acts 13. 48. <hi>Us,</hi> Rom. 8. 39. those that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Lamb's Book of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. All which, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others clearly prove, that the number of the Elect is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, not only <hi>materially</hi> as they say, that there are so many, but <hi>formally</hi> also, that these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Persons and no other are they, which cannot be alter'd: Nay the very nature of the thing it self doth so demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively evince it, that I wonder it can possibly be conceived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any other Notion: to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>an Election of Men,</hi> not circumscribed <hi>with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of particular Persons,</hi> is a conceited <hi>Platonical</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, as it seems strange that any one dares profess to understand. That there should be a Predestination, and none predestinated; an Election, and none elected; a choice amongst many, yet none left or taken; a Decree to save Men, and yet thereby Salvation <hi>destinated to no one Man,</hi> either <hi>re aut spe,</hi> in deed or in expectation; in a word, that there should be <hi>a Purpose of God to bring Men unto Glory,</hi> standing inviolable, tho never any one <hi>attained the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed end,</hi> is such a Riddle as no <hi>Oedipus</hi> can unfold. Now such an Election, such a Predestination have the <hi>Arminians</hi> substituted in the place of God's everlasting Decree. <hi>Pag.</hi> 54, 55.</p>
                           <p>If final perseverance in Faith and Obedience be the cause of, or a Condition required unto Election, then none can be said in this Life to be elected; for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94224:18"/>
no Man is a final <hi>Perseverer</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he be dead, until he has fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his course, and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the Faith: but certain it is, that it is spoken of some in Scripture, that they are even in this Life elected: <hi>Fow are chosen,</hi> Mat. 20. 16. <hi>For the Elect's sake those days shall be shortned,</hi> Mat. 24. <hi>And shall seduce, if it were possible, the very Elect,</hi> ver. 24. where it is evident, that Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is required to make one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in the Faith; but no where is Perseverance in the Faith required to Election: yea, and <hi>Peter</hi> gives us all a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that we should give all diligence <hi>to get an assurance of our Election even in this Life,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. and therefore sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it cannot be a Decree pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing consummating Faith and Obedience, <hi>p.</hi> 62.</p>
                           <p>Election is an eternal Act of God's Will; <hi>He hath chosen us before the foundation of the World,</hi> Eph. 1. 4. consummated antecedently to all Duty of ours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. Now every cause must in order of Nature, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede its Effect; nothing hath an Activity in causing, before it hath a being; Operation in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very kind is a second Act, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the essence of a thing, which is the first: But all our Graces and Works, our Faith, Obedience, Piety and Charity, are all temporal, of yesterday, the same standing with our selves, and no longer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be the cause of, no nor so much as a Condition ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily required for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of an eternal Act of God, irrevocably established be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="28" facs="tcp:94224:19"/>
If Predestination be for Faith foreseen, these three things, with divers such Absurdities, will necessarily follow: First, That Election is not of him that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. that is, of the good pleasure of God, who calleth us with an holy calling, but of him that is called; for depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Faith, it must be his whose Faith is that doth believe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, God cannot have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will have Mercy, for the very purpose of it is thus tied to the qualities of Faith and Obedience, so that he must have Mercy only on Believers antecedently to his Decree; which, thirdly, hinders him from being an absolute free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and doing of what he will with his own, of having such a power over us as the Potter hath over his Clay; for he finds us of different matter, one Clay, another Gold, when he comes to appoint us to different uses and ends; <hi>p.</hi> 63, 64.</p>
                           <p>And principally, the Effects of Election infallibly following it, cannot be the causes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection certainly preceding it: this is evident, for nothing can be the Cause and the Effect of the same thing, before and after it self: But all our Faith, and Obedience, Repentance, good Works, are the Effects of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection flowing from it as their proper Fountain, erected on it as the Foundation of this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Building: and for this the Article of our Church is very evident and clear; <hi>Those,</hi> saith it, <hi>that are endued with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent benefit of God, are called
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94224:19"/>
according to God's purpose, are justified freely, are made the Sons of God by Adoption, they be made like the Image of Christ, they walk religiously in good Works,</hi> &amp;c. Where first they are said to be partakers of this benefit of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and then by virtue thereof, to be entituled to the fruition of all those Graces. Secondly, it saith, <hi>Those who are endued with this Benefit, enjoy those Blessings;</hi> intimating that Election is the Rule whereby God proceedeth in bestowing those Graces, restraining the Objects of the temporal Acts of God's special Favour to them only whom his eternal Decree doth embrace. Both these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are denied by the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> which maketh a further discovery of their <hi>Heterodoxies</hi> in this particular. <hi>You say,</hi> saith <hi>Arminius</hi> to <hi>Perkins, that Election is the rule of giving, or not giving of Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Election is not of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but Faith of the Elect: But by your leave this I must deny.</hi> Armin. Anti-Per. <hi>fol.</hi> 221. But yet whatever it is the sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Heretick here denies, either Antecedent or Conclusion, he falls foul on the Word of God: They believed, saith the Holy Ghost, <hi>who were ordained to eternal Life,</hi> Acts 13. 48. <hi>And the Lord added daily to his Church such as should be saved,</hi> Acts 2. 47. From both which places it is evident, that God bestoweth Faith only on them whom he hath pre-ordained to eternal Life: but most clearly, Rom. 8. 29, 30. <hi>For whom he did foreknow, he also predestinated to</hi>
                              <pb n="30" facs="tcp:94224:20"/>
                              <hi>be conformed to the Image of his Son: Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified, them he also glorified.</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> interpreted this place, by adding in every link of the Chain, <hi>only those:</hi> however, the words directly import a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Predestination, before the bestowing of other Graces; and also a restraint of those Graces to them only that are so predestinate. Now the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from this is, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the from Logical, but for the matter also, it containeth the very words of Scripture, <hi>Faith is of God's Elect;</hi> Tit. 1. 1. For the other part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are the fruits of Election, they cannot be more peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in its Denial, than the Scripture is plentiful in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. <hi>He hath chosen us in Christ, that we should be holy; Ephes.</hi> 1. 4. not because we were holy, but that we should be so. Holiness, whereof Faith is the Root, and Obedience the Body, is that whereunto, and for which we are elected: The end and meritorious cause of any one Act cannot be the same, they have divers Respects, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire repugnant Conditions. <hi>P.</hi> 64, 65, 66.</p>

And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. it is not said, he predestinated those whom he foreknew that would be conformable to the Image of his Son: no, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that those whom he <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew,</hi> and so loved, he predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to be conformable unto the Image of Christ his Son.

And thus the sense or meaning of this <hi>Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> riseth up to this, That those particular Persons whom out of pure Grace and Love, (without any consideration of Works of any kind that were to be in them) he casting his Love freely upon them, did from everlasting, and out of that Love chuse to be his, they are <hi>alone his People.</hi> And so for substance and in effect, both these words in <hi>v. 2.

And then oppositely he speaks of another company, <hi>ver. 26. Ye are not of my Sheep:</hi> And the same different Events follow on each that are here said to befal these two Companies here. Even as here, of those that were his Sheep, he says, <hi>ver. 16. They shall hear my Voice, and them I must bring:</hi> And <hi>ver. 27. My Sheep hear my Voice, and I give unto them eternal Life, and they shall never perish,</hi> ver. 28. But of the other, <hi>You believe not, because you are not of my Sheep;</hi> ver. 26. Observe, It is not that Christ says, they were not of his Sheep, <hi>because they believed not;</hi> but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>They believed not, because they were not of his Sheep</hi>—So it was his Father's Gift of them before calling, for which

There are those in the World that say God loved all Mankind alike as to Salvation, and to that purpose hath in all Ages given them Helps and Divine Assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in common, more or less, which we usually term common Grace; which if their Wills, being stirred up and moved thereby, will use well, then they may and do obtain Faith, and an effectual calling unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And upon the right use of those common Adjutories it is that God doth then elect them, and not till then; or upon the foresight from all Eternity that they will do so. But if they do not use those Helps well, then they are reprobated, or rejected. But from that rehearsal of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances through all Ages, when put all together, it will appear, that the special Grace of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath put the difference: The one obtaining, the orher blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 24.</p>

Why doth he write some Names in the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> and leave out others? Why doth he enrol some whom he intends to make Denizons of Heaven, and refuse to put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in his Register? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle tells us, 'Tis the pleasure of his Will: you may render a reason for many of God's Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till you come to this the top and foundation of all; and under what Head of Reason can Man reduce this Act, but that of his Royal Prerogative? Why doth God save some, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others at last? Because of the Faith of the one, and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the other. Why do some Men believe? Because God hath not only given them the means of Grace, but accompanied those means with the Efficacy of his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94224:25"/>
Spirit. Why did God accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany those Means with the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his Spirit in some, and not in others? Because he had decreed by Grace to prepare them for Glory. But why did he decree or choose some and not others? Into what will you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve this but into his soveraign Pleasure? <hi>It could not be any merit in the Creature that might determine God to chuse him.</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> on the Attributes of God, <hi>p.</hi> 720, 721. Nor could it be any foresight of Works to be done in time by them, or of Faith, that might determine God to choose them. What Good could he foresee resulting from extreme Corruption, and a Nature alienated from him? What could he foresee of good to be done by them, but what he resolved in his own Will to bestow an Ability upon them to bring forth? His choice of them was to a Holiness, not for a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness preceding his Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. &amp; 2. 10. What is a Fruit, cannot be a moving Cause of that whereof it is a Fruit. Grace is a stream from the Spring of electing Love: The Branch is not the cause of the Root, but the Root of the Branch—Good Works suppose Grace, and a good and right habit in the Person; as rational Acts suppose Reason. Can any Man say that the rational Acts Man performs after his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were a cause why God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him? This would make Creation, and every thing else, not so much an Act of his Will, as an Act of his Understanding. God foresaw no rational Act in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94224:25"/>
Man, before the Act of his Will to give him Reason: Nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees Faith in any, before the Act of his Will determining to give him Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. In the Salvation which grows up from this first Purpose of God, he regards not the Works we have done, as a principal to settle the top-stone of our Happiness, but his own Purpose, and the Grace given in Christ, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. The Honour of our Salvation cannot be challenged by our Works, much less the Foundation of it. It was a pure Gift of Grace, without respect to any spiritual, much less natural Perfection. Why should the Apostle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Circumstance when he speaks of God's loving <hi>Jacob</hi> and hating <hi>Esau, when neither of them had done good or evil,</hi> Rom. 9. 11. if there were any foresight of Man's good Works as the moving cause of his Love or Hatred? God regarded not the <hi>Works</hi> of either as the first cause of his Choice, but acted by his own Liberty, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to any of their Actions which were to be done by them in time. If Faith be the fruit of Election, the prescience of Faith doth not influence the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Act of God: <hi>Tit. 1. 1. 'Tis called the Faith of God's Elect:</hi> Paul <hi>an Apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the Faith of God's Elect,</hi> i. e. settled in his Office to bring the Elect of God to Faith. If Men be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by God upon the foresight of Faith, or not chosen till they have Faith, they are not so much God's Elect, as God their Elect; they chose God by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94224:26"/>
Faith, before God chooseth them by Love. It had not been the Faith of God's Elect, <hi>i. e.</hi> of those already chosen, but the Faith of those that were to be chosen by God afterwards—Men are not chosen because they believe, but they believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are chosen. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle did ill else to appropriate that to the Elect, which they had no more interest in by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Election, than the veriest Reprobate in the World. If the foresight of what good Works might be done by his Creatures; was the Motive of his choosing them, why did he not choose the Devils to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, who could have done him better Service by the strength of their Natures, than the whole Mass of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity? <hi>Ibid.</hi> pag. 722, 723.

                           <p>It was not the <hi>whole lump of Mankind</hi> that was the Object of <hi>Election;</hi> nor was this Election (as some speak) a Decree to elect such as should happen to be <hi>thus</hi> and so qualified: but certain <hi>determinate Persons</hi> were chosen by <hi>name,</hi> or singled out from among the <hi>rest,</hi> and ordained to eternal Life.

                           <p>This gives a reason why Men of the largest Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for Learning and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Understanding, are so mightily puzzl'd and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth'd in spiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, particularly the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Election; why they do so strongly oppose it, and are so hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd with it: They are not in truth subdued to the Doctrine of God's <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty;</hi> and therefore, whilst in discussing those Points of Faith they judg as their natural Optick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents them, they lose both themselves and the Truth; which yet (in some degree) is made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Babes (Men of low sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to them) whose Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits the Lord hath subdued to rest contented with what their Father is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to tell them: and for the rest (as namely, the manner and reason of God's Disposements and Dispensations) they live by Faith in his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, waiting for the day that shall reveal all things; when the Tabernacle of God which yet is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, shall be let down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, [or they taken

            <p>Hitherto I have delivered the truth of this weighty Point of Religion, which also is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> now it followeth that we should consider the Falshood. Sundry Divines have devised, and in Writings published a new frame or platform of the Doctrine of Predestination; the Effect whereof is this. The Nature of God (say they) is infinite Love, Goodness, and Mercy it self; and therefore he propounds unto himself an End answerable thereunto, and that is, the communication of his Love and Goodness unto all his Creatures. Now for the accomplishing of this supreme and absolute End he did four things. First, He decreed to create Man righteous in his own Image. Secondly, He foresaw the Fall of Man after his Creation, yet so, as he neither willed nor decreed it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He decreed the universal Redemption of all and every Man effectually by Christ, so be it they will believe in him. Fourthly, He decreed to call all and every Man effectually, so as if they will they may be saved. This being done, he in his eternal Counsel foreseeing who would believe in Christ, did thereupon elect
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94224:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them to eternal Salvation: And again, foreseeing who would not believe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn Grace offered, did thereupon also decree to reject them to eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>This Platform, however it may seem plausible to Reason, yet indeed it is nothing else but a Device of Man's Brain, as will appear by sundry Defects and Errors that be in it. For, first, Whereas it is avouched that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall came by the bare Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of God, without any Decree or Will of his, it is a flat Untruth. The put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Christ to death was as great a Sin as the Fall of <hi>Adam, Acts</hi> 2. 23. nay, in some respects greater: Now that came to pass not only by the foreknowledg of God, but also by <hi>his determinate Counsel.</hi> And therefore as the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> saith, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 28. Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>with the Gentiles and People of</hi> Israel, <hi>gathered themselves together to do whatsoever thine Hand and thy Counsel had determined before to be done:</hi> So may we say, that <hi>Adam in his Fall did nothing but that which the Hand of God and his Counsel had determined before to be done.</hi> And considering the Will of God extends it self to the least things that are, even to Sparrows, whereof none do light upon the ground without our Heavenly Father; How can a Man in reason imagine that the Fall of one of the most principal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are, shall fall out altogether without the Will and Decree of God? And there can be nothing more absurd than to sever the Foreknowledg of God from his Counsel or Decree. For by this means things shall come to pass, God nilling or not knowing, or not regarding them. <hi>Mr.</hi> Perkins'<hi>s Exposition of the Creed in his Golden Chain,</hi> p. 477.</p>
            <p>You are therefore to understand, that in the point touching Man's Conversion, there is scarce any Circumstance that we have formerly spoken of, but it is quarrel'd at, and corrupted with false Opinions; not the nature and substance of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, which, say they, is not by the infusion of habitual Sanctity into the Soul, but through Grace acquired by much Pains and industrious Actions of our own, excited and assisted by some help of the Spirit; not the moving cause, which is affirmed by them to be, not God's special and actual Love to his Elect, but his common and equal Love to all Mankind alike; not the efficient cause, which we affirm to be the Work of God's Spirit, they say it is the freedom of our Wills: not the manner of it, without and above the strength of our natural Abilities, as we hold, but so far in the compass of our own Power, that we may help or hinder it at our own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: not the Instrument of it, the Word by the work of the Spirit, but as they would have it, the Word working by it self, without any inward virtue of the Spirit besides: Lastly, not the Subject, the Elect only, as we maintain, but all in common, upon whom sufficient Grace to Conversion is bestowed, if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. All these erroneous Opinions are founded upon other rotten and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound Principles, which are chiefly these. 1. That God hath not precisely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of any Man's Salvation or Damnation in particular, but hath left it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the liberty of their own Wills. 2. That God doth not bear any special Favour to one more than another, but that his Love is equal to all in general, and his desire of the Salvation of all Mankind alike. 3. That Christ hath died for all Men alike, procuring so much by his Death, that God is <hi>placabilis</hi> towards all, and all Men indifferently are <hi>salvabiles,</hi> if they list to make use of the Benefits purchased for them. 4. That God requires Faith in Christ of all Men whatsoever, even of such Insidels as to whom Christ was never preached. 5. That God cannot in Justice demand of Man the performance of those things, which since his Fall he hath no
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94224:29"/>
strength to perform: and that if God require any such Service, he is bound in Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to give unto Man new strength for to perform it. I do but only name these Articles of the Arminian Faith, tho even that's enough to shew their Weakness and Untruth, to any that can judg of sound Doctrine; but I say, I mention them only, that you may the better perceive what is that main Issue whereinto they are finally resolved; and that in plain terms is this <hi>[That all Men, whether Christians or Infidels, within or without the Church, may be converted and saved if they will]</hi> you will say this is broadly spoken; but I do them no wrong, read their Books, compare their Tenets, and you shall see that this is the upshot of all their Discourses. God hath excluded none, he loves all alike, Christ hath died for all, Faith is required of all, sufficient Ability to believe and repent is given to all; who then, or what should hinder the Conversion or Salvation of any one, but himself, his own meer Free-will? Surely an Opinion that should not be gainsaid by any, but readily embrac'd by all, if it had as much Truth in it as it caries shew of Pity and Commiseration to Mankind: We would be loth to be judged cruel; but 'tis Folly, not Pity, to take upon us to be more merciful than God hath declared himself to be; and it is Impiety to tell a Lie for God, by magnifying the glorious largeness of his Mercy beyond the bounds which himself hath prescribed unto it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore against this wide and vast Conclusion of Arminianism, that <hi>[God hath given sufficient Grace to all the World to convert and believe, if they will]</hi> I oppose this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contradictory, <hi>[God hath not given sufficient Grace unto all; and in those to whom he hath given such Grace, it depends not on their Free-will, whether they will be converted or no.]</hi> These two Propositions destroy one another, and one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by that which confirms the other, <hi>&amp;c.

So that now in him, and by him every true Christian may be called a fulfiller of the Law—For the very true and lively Christian Faith is not only to believe all things of God which are contained in holy Scripture, but also is an earnest Trust and Confidence in God, that he doth regard us, and that he is careful over us, as the Father is over the Child whom he doth love: And that he will be merciful unto us for his only Son's sake, that we have our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ our perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Advocate and Priest, in whose only Merits,

                           <p>Where God is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reconciled, there he actually loveth; for Love and Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are inseparable: But with the Elect before they convert and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, God is actually reconciled. <hi>Ergo,</hi> He loves them before their Faith and Conversion. The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident, because before they were born, much more before they are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat, a full Atonement and Satisfaction for all Offences is made by Christ, and accepted on God's part: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon actual Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must needs follow. And this the Scriptures make manifest, Christ being <hi>[the Lamb slain from the beginning of the World]</hi> and God testifying of him at his Baptism, long before his Death, in that Speech of admirable Consolation, <hi>(This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.)</hi> Well pleas'd with him for the unspotted Holiness of his own Person, well pleased with us in him for his unvaluable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Hence a second Reason <hi>à pari.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If God did actually love the Elect before Christ's time, when an
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94224:35"/>
actual Reconciliation was not yet made, then much more may he actually love the Elect after the Atonement is really made by Christ's Death, even before they believe it. But the former is true, as appears by the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs; and therefore the latter may not well be denied. The reason of the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is this, because it is far more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that God should love us upon Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made before our Faith, than love them upon their Faith before Satisfaction was given; especially seeing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Faith nor ours is any efficient cause why God loves either them or us. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, effectual Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Faith, all are Fruits and Consequents of God's actual Love unto the Elect: which Graces and Favours he therefore bestows upon them, because he loves them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis vain to say, <hi>Deus elegit homines di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligendos, non dilectos.</hi>—Pemble vindiciae gratiae, <hi>p.</hi> 17.</p>
                           <p>God's Love to our Persons, and to our Qualities and Actions, is a distinction which God well knows how
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94224:35"/>
to make; Parents are well skilled in putting this difference between the Vices and Persons of their Children, those they hate, these they love; and when for their Vices they chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise their Persons, they remember with much Compassion, that 'tis a Child whom they have under the Rod—The Cause is alike between God and the Elect, his Love to their Persons is from everlasting the same, nor doth their Sinfulness lessen it, nor their.

                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap>ctity encrease it; <hi>because God in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Persons ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver consider'd them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, than as, most perfectly holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable in Christ.</hi> But God's Love to their Qualities and Works then begins, when both the one and the other become holy by the Grace of Conversion; before which time, and after too, God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry even with his Elect, and testifies his hatred of their Sins, as much as of any others, by manifold Chastisements upon their Persons for their Offences. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho <hi>Paul</hi> was a chosen Vessel, dearly beloved of God for his Person, even then when in ignorant Zeal he furiously persecuted the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94224:36"/>
Church, yet for his Conditions they were hateful and highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to God till after his Conversion. Most true it is, that Sin doth justly make the Person hateful in whom it is—Yet in the Elect whom he hath loved for ever, this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Affection is manifest, God approves of their Persons, whilst he disallows their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; and when his fiercest Wrath was shewed against the Sins of the Elect in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, then did God most compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately love the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons both of Christ and of all the Elect. Wherefore God might easily take away his Image from <hi>Adam</hi>'s Nature, yet not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from his Person, which he loved as elect in Christ, whilst yet he punished his Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              </gap>arply—In God's sight justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on goes before all our Sanctification: for even whilst the Elect are unconverted, they are then actually justified and freed from all Sin by the Death of Christ; and God so esteems of them as free, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accepted of that Satisfaction, is actually reconciled to them. By this Justification we
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94224:36"/>
are freed from the Guilt of our Sins; and because that is done away, God in time proceeds to give us the Grace of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to free us from Sin's Corruption still inherent in our Persons.——Our Justification in God's sight even long before we were born is purchased for us by Christ. For it's vain to think, with the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that Christ's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have made God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>placabilem,</hi> not <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum,</hi> procured a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that God may be reconciled, if he will, and other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, but not actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. A silly shift, devised to uphold the liberty of Man's Will; and universality of Grace. No, 'tis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; the Ransom demanded is paid and accepted: Full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Divine Justice is given, and taken; <hi>all the Sins of the Elect are actually pardoned:</hi> God's Wrath for them is suffered and overcome, he relis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and appeased, the Book is crossed, and the Hand-writing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd. This grand Transaction between God and the Mediator Christ jesus, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded upon and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd in Heaven long before we had any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                              <p>By the Covenant of Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship Christ and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever are in a manner in one Writ; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that there be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with him, and that which is made with us, yet it may be said, that Christ and the Believer are some way in one Writ. 1. Because these two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants are all of a piece; they are to be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not to be divided; it is the same design of Grace, the same business of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming and saving lost Man that is carried on in both. 2. Altho Christ and the Believer be not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, and as Parties, in this Writ of Christ's Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-covenant to God; yet
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94224:40"/>
they are virtually, and as to their Interests and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments: it is Christ's Business and Concernment, and the Believers too, even all his eternal Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are in that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and ours; these meet together, are transacted in one Writ: And thus even among Men, a Person may be said to be in a Writ when his Concernments are handled. 3. Because of the contexture and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terweaving not only of Christ and the Believers Interests, but also of their Names in the same Writ: for in the Covenant where his Name is put alone as Undertaker, and which is his single Bond, to wit, the Covenant of Suretiship, even there is the Believer's Name put, as being the Person for which he paid a Price, and for whom he undertook, and who were promised to him for a Seed, as a satisfying sight for the Travel of his Soul. And again, in the Writ given to us, we stand not alone in Covenant-dealings with God; but in the same Writs of the Promises made to the Believer, Christ's Name stands as principal Party covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, and receiving the Promises, as is manifest from what is already said. 4. There is not only a Contexture, but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation with Christ and the Believers Name in the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94224:40"/>
Covenant-Writs; for his Name is put in our Bond, for he wrote himself the <hi>Sinner</hi> (legally) and in the Sinner's place under the Law accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: and our Name is put in the Writ of Justification given to him; and the new Law of Faith writes the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever <hi>righteous and blessed,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>Gal. 3. 13, 14. Rom.</hi> 3. 22. 5. There is not only a Commutation, but a Community of Writs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Christ ànd the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: for one Writ and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise writes God, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Believer; this Covenant-relation to him and us, is by the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Covenant, <hi>Heb. 1. 5. Psal.</hi> 89. 26, 29. One Writ makes Christ the first Heir and Son of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and the Believer a younger Brother coming in under Christ the first Heir, <hi>Psal. 89. 27. Gal. 3. 26. Rom.</hi> 8. 17. One Writ and Letter of Acquittance dischargeth both Christ and the Believer from the Curse and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4, 6.</p>
                              <p>By the Covenant of Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship Christ is constituted the grand Instrument and Actor of all things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to his Peoples Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Salvation, and that not only of eternal Salvation and Redemption, which he alone brought unto his People, <hi>Heb. 5. 9. ch. 9. 15. Luk.</hi> 1. 68. and of such part
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94224:41"/>
of that Redemption as is wrought within time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. but of whatsoever Salvation and other Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations are good for them in this Life: And therefore we find that Christ was the grand Instrument, and had an active hand in the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of his People from all Afflictions and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in all Ages, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 5, 9. Again, By the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Suretiship, all the hard Conditions lay upon Christ, all that the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of Man Condition-wise, <hi>Gal. 4. 4. Rom.</hi> 6. 14.—All the Conditions that are Works, and nothing rests to the Believer Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-wise, but that which is Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever worketh, <hi>and is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto good Works,</hi> Phil. 2. 10. for by this Suretiship he is under a Covenant to work in his People what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth Condition-wise of them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. That in the Covenant of Suretiship the Believer is undertaken for by both the Parties; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah undertakes, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10. Christ undertakes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. He is by this Covenant of Suretiship in a sure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed State. And whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Christ acted by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Suretiship, he did it for us, <hi>[And we did that in him.]</hi> By the Covenant of Suretiship, besides all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Attributes in God, Justice it self, that is most terrible to the Believer, and was sometimes a dreadful
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94224:41"/>
Attribute, and speaking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to fallen Man, is now turn'd to be as much for the Believers Salvation, as any other Attribute in God; and upon that account is and may be comfortably look'd upon, 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 9.

                              <p>By this procuring of the new Covenant for us, which they ascribe to the Death of Christ, they intend the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation</hi> of the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or the Law, or at least such a <hi>Derogation</hi> from it, that it, shall no more oblige us either unto sinless Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or Punishment, nor require a perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto our Justification before God, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a new <hi>Law of Obedience</hi> accommodated unto our present State and Condition, on whose Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance all the Promises of the Gospel do depend. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say, that in the Death of Christ there was real Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction made to God; not to the Law, or to God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the Law required, but unto God abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely: That is, he did what God was well pleased and <hi>satisfied</hi> withal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect to his Justice, or the Curse of the Law. And they add, that hereon the <hi>whole Righteousness</hi> of Christ is imputed to us so far, as that we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And moreover, that the way of the Communication
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94224:42"/>
of them unto us, is by the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> which by his <hi>Death the Lord Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured:</hi> For the <hi>Conditions</hi> of this Covenant are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the Covenant it self, whereon God will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow all the Benefits and Effects of it upon us, which are Faith and Obedience; wherefore what the Lord Christ hath done for us is thus far accepted as our <hi>Legal Righteousness,</hi> as that God upon our Faith and Obedience, with respect thereunto, doth release and pardon all <hi>our Sins of Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Commission:</hi> Upon this Pardon there is no need of any <hi>positive</hi> perfect Righteousness unto our Justification or Salvation, but our <hi>personal Righteousness</hi> is accepted with God in the room of it, by virtue of the new Covenant which Christ hath procured.

                              <p>That Christ did not satisfy the Law, but the Lawgiver, because he is above his own Laws. Christ, as proved, satisfied not the threatning of the Law, or its obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation unto Punishment, whereby it obliged us Sinners; for nothing else could be the fulfilling of it, but the Damnation and eternal Death of all Sinners.—Here he abrogates the Law, tramples under foot its Righteousness, makes its Author to slight it in his Demands of a full Satisfaction unto Justice, and renders the Death of Christ a meer fantastical <hi>Chimaera,</hi> or at least but a Metaphorical Sacrifice.</p>

began: some say it had no beginning, but was from Eternity, because Election was from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and we were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in Christ; and so were Persons from Eternity in him. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say, That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at the making of the World, Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the first of God's Works in a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angelical Nature ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Divine, which contained all our Persons in it, as the Beams are of or in the Sun.

The Covenant made with Christ is not the same that is made between Christ and us, and which we ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate in Baptism.

                           <p>The thing that I deny is, That Christ by his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience made Atonement and Merit for us, as a proper peculiar Surety in the Law of Works. The thing is far otherwise, for Christ suffered and obey'd as a principal and sole Undertaker, and not as a Surety, that supposed us Principals in that Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. (Here lies the <hi>Baxterian</hi> Fallacy.) He bound himself to God, to give his Life by dying in our stead to save ours (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remotely) but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was bound in one Bond with us, that he should do so. 1. <hi>Reas.</hi> God never <hi>proposed</hi> it to fallen Sinners to make Atonement for their Sins, and by Merit recover eternal Life, which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94224:40"/>
they had forfeited.</p>
                           <p>Where is the Law or Covenant whereby God proposed this to Sinners as their Duty, and a way for their Recovery? By the Law of Works it was impossible, and a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns a thought of it, as contrary to the whole scope of it: The Compact between the Father and the Son, was not a Law or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant proposed to Sinners for their performance of the Conditions thereof. Now a Mony-Surety is bound to no more than the Principal is bound to do. If I am not obliged to pay a hundred Pounds, neither is my Surety bound to pay a hundred Pounds.</p>

what more proper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression can set forth Christ's Engagement from Eternity with the Father on the behalf of the Elect, [so far forth as terrene Comparisons may subserve for the Illustration of Divine Mysteries] than a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary Surety</hi> doth? for, as the wise Man says,—Mony an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers all things; a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som from Slavery, and a Purchase of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Elect from their fallen State unto God must be a Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the very <hi>idem,</hi> both in Acquitment and Title, as that self-same Law requires (never abrogated, but stands in full force to all Eternity, both in Hell and Heaven) by a breach whereof they lay under this double forfeiture of Life and Glory.)

Mercy as of free Gift, unless he forgave us more than Christ satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for, or bestowed what he did not merit. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 96.</p>
                           <p>Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> tells us, that the Remonstrants say, that <hi>Adam</hi> being by God deprived of original Righteousness (which is the Faculty and Fountain of all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience) and being now constituted under the deserved Curse, all the Debt of legal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, wherein he and his Posterity in him were unto God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, did immediately cease: So that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Outrages should after that have been by <hi>Adam,</hi> or any of his Children commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they would not have been Sins, or Transgressions, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the Authors of them in the Guilt of just Damnation. That which unto us reviveth Sin, is the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, because therein is given to the Law new strength to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and unto us new strength to obey, both which were evacuated in the Fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> upon which Promises it doth most evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow; that unless God in Christ had made a Covenant of Grace with us anew,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94224:41"/>
no Man should ever have been properly and penally damned but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Adam,</hi> and he too with no other than the loss of God's Presence, (for Hell and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of Legal, but of Evangelical Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) <hi>not for any actual Sins,</hi> for there would have been none, because the Exaction of the Law would have ceased; and where there is no Law, there is no Transgression: <hi>not for the want of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> because that was in <hi>Adam</hi> himself but a Punishment, and in his Posterity neither a Sin nor a Punishment, but only a Condition of Nature; <hi>not for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Concupisence,</hi> tho it be a Disease and Infirmity, yet it is no Sin, both because the being of it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and necessary, and the Operation of it inevitable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preventable, for want of that Bridle of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep it in.</p>

This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant passed between God and Christ, the Father and the Son, before the World began. <hi>How many are thy thoughts to usward?</hi> Psal. 40. 5.

                           <p>We may hence see how deep the Plot of our Redemption and Salvation by Christ was laid, it was not a thing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally taken up, and barely to serve a turn, but it was a plotted thing. I confess the Scriptures do hold forth the Incarnation of

His goings forth are from the days of Eternity;</hi> which, as <hi>Calvin</hi> expounds it, refer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mediator as being Head of the Church, and not unto his eternal Generation, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly expounded; and this is the ground of Christ's <hi>Delight with the Sons of Men</hi> before the World was, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 31. as those whose Names he had covenanted to bear, and whose Persons he had engaged himself to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent before the Father; and this shews how the design of God from everlasting hath been to save Sinners, and to glorify himself in a way of Mercy and Grace, through a Mediator: And it is the consideration hereof that is the greatest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in the world to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to come in and return to him, because <hi>God is in Christ reconciling the World,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. for he did undertake to represent your Persons as your Surety and Representative, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World was, <hi>Ibid</hi> p. 135.</p>

Now we come to the <hi>grounds why this Covenant must be made with Christ first, and with us only as we are Members of Christ, and in him.</hi> 1. Because the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is a Transcript of the eternal Purpose of God in Election, and doth fully set forth the way how the Ends of God's electing Love should be effected. Now the Ends of God's electing Love are, (1.) The Praise of the Glory of his Grace. (2.) The Glory of his Son. (3.) The Holiness and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Saints. These Ends are sutably accomplished by this Covenant. Eph. 1. 3, 4, 5. <hi>He has blessed us with all spiritual Blessing; in heavenly things in Christ; according as he has cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen us in him.</hi> Here three things are observable, (1.) It is spoken of Christ as a Mediator, as God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; for in him we are blessed, in him we are chosen, but our Blessings proceed from Christ as Mediator. (2.) The order of Election, we are <hi>chosen in him,</hi> that is, in him as the Head; and therefore he is first elected, as he is first beloved: <hi>In whom I am well pleased,</hi> Mat. 3. 17. well pleased with his People, all the Members of Christ, but first with Christ, and with them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are in him, and one with him. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 140, 141.</p>
                           <p>All that serveth to make a Covenant are here, (1.) God demandeth of his Son, that he lay down his Life; and for his labour he promiseth, <hi>That he shall see his Seed, and God shall give him many Children;</hi> Isa. 53. 10. (2.) The Son consenteth to lay down his Life, and saith,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94224:32"/>
                              <hi>Here am I to do thy Will; thou hast given me a Body.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is the formality of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, when Christ consenteth to the Conditions.</p>
                           <p>Now this Covenant was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in time between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, but it was transacted from Eternity.</p>
                           <p>This is comfortable, that the Father and <hi>Christ</hi> transacted a Bargain from Eternity concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee by Name.</p>
                           <p>There was a communing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and Son con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thy Heaven: Father, what shall be given thy Justice to ransom such an one, <hi>John, Anna,</hi> &amp;c.? And Christ from Eternity did bind for such a Person, He shall believe in me. The Redemption of Sinners is not a work of yesterday, or a business of chance; it was well advised, and in infinite Wisdom continued, <hi>&amp;c. Mr.</hi> Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford'<hi>s Trial and Triumph of Faith,</hi> p. 52.</p>
                           <p>And hence (i. e. <hi>from the Eternity of the Covenant)</hi> was the Salvation of Men before the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> by the Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mediation, and Death of Christ. That the Saints under the <hi>Old</hi> Testament were saved by Christ—That they were saved by virtue of a meer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, will not be said. From hence was Christ esteemed to be incarnate, and to have suffer'd; or the fruits of his <hi>Inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                                 </gap>rnation</hi> and <hi>Suffering</hi> could not have been imputed to any; for the <hi>thing</hi> it self being denied, the Effects of it are not. The Revelation of this Covenant is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; not that it was then <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,</hi>
                              <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94224:33"/>
when it is first <hi>mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in the Promises and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Christ, but then first <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi> or revealed. Christ was declared to be chosen of God, by the Resurrection from the dead, but he <hi>was</hi> so from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                           <p>As in other places, as shall be evinc'd, so in <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. is this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant mentioned; in which Chapter there is this <hi>Prophetical Scheme,</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> between Father and Son, which was <hi>past,</hi> is spoken of as <hi>to come,</hi> and the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of Christ which were <hi>to come,</hi> are spoken of as <hi>past,</hi> as appears to every one that but reads the Chapter. It is also signally ascribed to Christ's coming into the World, not <hi>constitutively,</hi> but <hi>declaratively.</hi> It is the greatest folly about such things as these, to suppose them then <hi>done,</hi> when <hi>revealed,</hi> tho <hi>revealed</hi> in Expressions of <hi>doing</hi> them.

                           <p>There are the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> as distinct Persons agreeing together in Counsel, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the <hi>common End,</hi> the Glory of God, and the Salvation of the Elect.</p>
                           <p>The End is expressed, <hi>Heb. 8. 9, 10. ch.</hi> 12. 1. now thus it was. Zech. 6. 13. <hi>And the Counsel of Peace shall be between them both, inter ambos ipsos:</hi> that is, the two <hi>Persons</hi> spoken of, not the two Offices there intimated, that shall meet in Christ; and who are these? The Lord <hi>Jehova,</hi> who speaks, and the <hi>Man,</hi> whose Name is the <hi>Branch,</hi> ver. 12. who is to <hi>do all the great things there mentioned. He shall grow

up,</hi> &amp;c. but the Counsel of <hi>Peace,</hi> the design of our <hi>Peace</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them both: They have agreed and consented to the bringing about of our Peace.

                           <p>The Covenant of God is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon his <hi>Eternity;</hi> the Oath whereby he confirms it is by his <hi>Life:</hi> since there is none greater than himself, he swears by <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> or by his own Life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 13. which he engageth together with his Eternity for the full performance; so that if he lives for ever, the Covenant shall not be disannul'd, it's an <hi>immutable Counsel,</hi> Heb. 6. 16, 17. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of his Counsel fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Immutability of his Nature. Immutability and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity go hand in hand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The promise of Eternal Life is as antient as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in regard of the Purpose of the Promise, or in regard of the Promise made to Christ for us. <hi>Eternal Life which God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before the World began:</hi> Tit. 1. 2. As it hath an <hi>Ante-eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> so it hath a <hi>Post-eternity;</hi> therefore the Gospel, which is the new Covenant publish'd, is term'd <hi>the everlasting Gospel, Rev.</hi> 14. 6. which can no more be alter'd and perish, than God can change and vanish into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: He can as little morally deny his Truth, as he can natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally desert his Life. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is there represented in a green colour, to note its perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Verdure.

                           <p>The whole Gospel is nothing else but a Declaration of God's Soveraign Pleasure concerning Christ, and concerning us in him; it's therefore call'd <hi>the Mystery of his Will,</hi> Eph. 1. 9. God had a soveraign right (not as to his Divine Nature only, but as considered in the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of a Redeemer) to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Christ according to the <hi>Articles consented</hi> to. In regard of his Understanding, and the advantage he was to bring to the Elect of God upon the Earth, he calls God by the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Title of his <hi>Lord,</hi> in that prophetick Psalm of him, <hi>Psal. 16. 2. O my Soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord; my Goodness extends not unto thee, but unto the Saints that are in the Earth.</hi> It seems to be the Speech of Christ in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, mentioning the Saints on Earth as at a distance from him. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 741, 742.</p>
                           <p>There is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between God's doing a thing <hi>in Christ,</hi> and <hi>through Christ,</hi>

                              </gap>. It is <hi>Zanchy</hi>'s Observation, That when God is said to <hi>do</hi> a thing <hi>in Christ,</hi> it usually notes out some one of these <hi>immanent</hi> Acts of God's towards us, that past between him and Christ for us when they were alone, before we existed; and Jesus Christ was a common Person repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting us all, and God gave all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94224:34"/>
to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for us; as it is said, <hi>[The Grace that was given us in Christ before the World was.]</hi> But the things that God doth <hi>through Christ,</hi> as 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 9. He hath appointed us to obtain Salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> are usually some transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Acts of God's towards us, or those things which he actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performeth and applieth to us through Christ: So that God redeemeth <hi>through Christ,</hi> justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>through Christ,</hi> saveth <hi>through Christ;</hi> but he chooseth <hi>in Christ.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Q.</hi> In what further sense are we said to be <hi>chosen in him,</hi> so that the Act of choosing should be referred to <hi>in him,</hi> and we to be <hi>in him</hi> at our <hi>Election?</hi>—First, I will shew you what he hath not: He was not the cause of God's electing us; for the Apostle saith, <hi>Eph. 1. 9. [According to the good pleasure of his Will, which he hath purposed in himself.]</hi> What is the cause of all God's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses towards us? <hi>Himself.</hi>—God as he is the first Being, so he and his own Will are the first Movers of himself: So that this <hi>[He chose us in Christ]</hi> imports not, that Jesus Christ was the cause of our Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (taking him a God-Man, as here he is meant)—for he could not be the cause of our Predestination, who himself was predestinated. In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. it is plainly said of Christ, That <hi>he was preordained before the World was founded:</hi> He himself was chosen as well as we, therefore he could not be the cause of our Election: And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94224:35"/>
both he and we being elected by one simple and entire Act, the Predestination therefore of one could not be the cause of the Predestination of the other: And as Christ was not the cause of. Election for the substance of the Act, so nor was he the cause of it for the Persons e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                           <p>Jesus Christ, as God-Man and Mediator, did not choose so much as one Man; it was God that elected all those that were elected: <hi>Thine they were,</hi> (says Christ to the Father) <hi>and thou gavest them me.</hi> And it were a much more fond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to think that God chose such to be saved as he foresaw the Human Nature of Christ would love and choose: This were to make the Divine Will conformed to that of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature; whereas, <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done,</hi> said Christ unto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. Affirmatively, The meaning is this, that Jesus Christ in Election was the <hi>Head</hi> of the Elect. He was consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and from the first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God as a common <hi>Person</hi> to represent us. He undertook for us then, and so in him we' are chosen as in a <hi>Head.</hi> This is the sense that holy <hi>Bains</hi> giveth of it; to note out (saith he) the order of Election, namely, that Christ was chosen first as a Head, and we in him.—1. Learn to distinguish between being elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>with Christ,</hi> and being elected <hi>in Christ.</hi> To be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>with Christ,</hi> is to be elected at the same time he was, for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94224:35"/>
matter of time, for all was from Eternity: But to be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in Christ</hi> is with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, That Christ at God's first Act of Election was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as a common Person, a Head, and Root, and we all in him. This is common both to Christ and to us, that we were elected <hi>with him,</hi> and he <hi>with us,</hi> for matter of time. But this is proper to Christ, that we were elected <hi>in him,</hi> he not in us.—<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>He created Man;</hi> in his own Image created he <hi>him</hi> (Adam) <hi>Male and Female created he them.</hi> God in creating <hi>Adam</hi> created all Mankind, as in blessing <hi>Adam</hi> he blessed all Mankind; yea the Creation of <hi>Adam</hi> was all the Creation that the rest of Mankind had: for, tho they exist by Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on successively, yet in him were they created virtually, and then only.</p>
                           <p>Thus in choosing Christ, God look'd upon him as a common Person, as a <hi>second Adam,</hi> and chose us in him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you shall find, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. that God speaks of <hi>Christ</hi> and of <hi>Adam,</hi> as if there had been but those two in the World. <hi>[The first Man]</hi> (says he) and <hi>[the second Man]</hi> Was there then but a first Man, and a second Man? Yes; but these two Men stood for all the rest.—2. Take heed how you understand it, as if Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone were distinctly chosen, and that our Persons were not as distinctly chosen too: yes, both Christ and we too were distinctly and particularly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94224:36"/>
thought of, and so individually elected. The meaning (I say) of this our being <hi>elected in him,</hi> is not as if he only had been distinctly and by Name chosen, and we all but confusedly and in gross, and as in his Election only. God did not choose in the general, as a Kingdom doth choose the Children of a King that cometh after him, and are involved in him, in a general Notion only; so as their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct choice is of the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone: No, the Scripture saith, <hi>God knoweth who are his;</hi> he knoweth the very Persons fully and particularly, yea, and distinctly viewed them then when he elected them. And yet notwithstanding he thus chose us as distinct Persons from Christ, yet still our Election was <hi>in Christ——</hi>Some Divines yield that he was chosen to be a common Person, when he should take up Man's Nature; and that we were chosen then to be by him represented. They acknowledg that he was a common Person, in his Death representing us, and is now a common Person in Heaven, and sits there in our stead, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting us. But (say they) in the Act of choosing, how should he be considered as a common Person in that he did not then exist as God-Man? He might indeed be ordain'd to be a common Person after he did <hi>exist</hi> as <hi>God-Man;</hi> but how in Election was he, or could he be such, he being as then only the Son of God, and not Man? To solve this—1. That the Person of the <hi>Son of God</hi> (who
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94224:36"/>
was ordained this common Person) he was <hi>with God</hi> then; he was then existent. So <hi>Prov. 8. 30. Then</hi> (says Wisdom, namely Christ) <hi>I was by him,</hi> &amp;c. And the Evangelist <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>He was in the beginning with God;</hi> that is, from everlasting. 2. This Son of God that then existed (consider him as one that was to become Man) was the Object of Election as well as the Manhood (which was chosen to become one with God.) That Divine Person was by an Act and Decree of God's Will pitch'd upon, and singled out to assume our Nature, and so sustain the Person of a Head before God in the mean while. 3. At or in the Act of Election, this Son of God, as he actually existed at the passing of that Act of Election upon himself, so he actually and solemnly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to be a Head and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Person, representing us, and to that end to assume our Nature. And this is in order of Nature to be supposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Election, tho co-existent together from Eternity. 4. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this he was <hi>in repute</hi> such with God <hi>the Father;</hi> he was a common Person in God's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem, and that justly. So <hi>Prov. 8. 23. I</hi> (namely Christ) <hi>was set up from everlasting, ere ever the Earth was,</hi> &amp;c. that is, in esteem with God for such. Now this cannot be understood of Christ as he was the second Person only: But God did set him up from the beginning, as bearing and sustaining the Person of God-man (to which Manhood he was chosen, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94224:37"/>
undertook to assume) and as a Head to his Members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, who reputed him such. And of him considered as such are those words spoken, for so only he is called <hi>Wisdom,</hi> as there he is: For Christ is not called the Wisdom of God es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially taken, for that is one of his Attributes, and not a Person: But he is called God's Wisdom <hi>manifestative,</hi> that is, as ordained to manifest God's Wisdom unto us, he being to be <hi>God manifest in the Flesh.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And such a Person or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he thus then actually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, such did God then and from that time repute him, and actually entitle him by, as between himself and his Son. Therefore in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Phrase there) <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify me</hi> (says Christ to God) <hi>with the Glory which [I had with thee] before the World was.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>What Glory was that? He doth not mean his Glory as he was simply the second Person, because he had that Glory now, and therefore needed not to beg it: Nay, he could not beg it, it was too much for him so to beg, for so he is equal with God: Therefore it must be the Glory of the Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>[Which I had before the World was]</hi> that is, in thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; thou accountedst me thus and thus glorious in respect of the Glory ordained me by my undertaking to be Man, and the Mediator too of the Church. And this is plain if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the <hi>24th</hi> Verse, for there he speaks of that Glory
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94224:37"/>
which was given him, which can be no other than the Glory of the Mediatorship: So then Jesus Christ the second Person being existent, and undertaking to be a common Person and a Mediator for Men, God did reckon him as such; he was in his account at the choosing of him, as a common Person, and Head, and as a Mediator too: And indeed there was this great advantage of our Mediator his being God, that thereby he was not only present at, and privy to the making of all God's Decrees, but was also by, to undertake for all that concerned his part in it which God should decree, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the Title and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Head and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor then. And there is this reason why Christ must needs have been an Head to his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers before his assuming our Nature, or his ascending up to Heaven, (which I see not how it can be answered) because otherwise Jesus Christ had not been an Head to the Fathers under the Old Testament, for he had not then taken an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature; and yet was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a common Person, for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving their Sins, by virtue of that Atonement he had engaged to perform for them, which was such in God's repute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting before him in <hi>Job</hi>'s time. <hi>Deliver him, I have found a Ransom,</hi> Job 33. And upon the account thereof, God did as actually and really forgive the Sins of the Old Testament as he did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. Now if he was a Head then, and they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94224:38"/>
actually Members of him, then he might be so virtually and representatively, from everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through his undertaking of it, and this in as just sense as he is to be the <hi>Lamb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                    <desc>•…</desc>

God the Father, who was then present, had a certain assurance, that Christ his Son, that gave his Promise for performance, would and should perform it. And Christ, as Son of God, who was God, having promised, I may say of both, that Christ's Word then was as good as his Bond, and the Father's assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he should perform it, as good as if he had already seen it done: <hi>And his calling things that are not, as certain as if they were:</hi> And may apply one and the same effect of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> equally to both, if of God the Father giving Christ his Promise before the World began, it must be said, <hi>God that cannot lie.</hi> And so it is, and was as firm and sure, as if done and fulfilled, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is God; <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2.

You must know this, that tho a Sinner as to <hi>himself</hi> is justified upon the terms of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> yet as to his <hi>Surety,</hi> he is justified upon the <hi>Covenant of Works:</hi> for the Surety must pay the whole Debt, and the Father will bate him nothing.</p>

                           <p>The Conditions of the Covenant of Suretiship made with Christ, did fully and perfectly answer the intent of the Covenant of Works, and that in both the parts of it copulatively, which did but alternatively oblige Man; for the Law does not oblige Man in an absolute sense, both to perfect doing and suffering, but to one of them; for if we keep the Law, we are not oblig'd to suffer; <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>

There is no <hi>Medium,</hi> but that either the Law is utterly abolish'd, and so there is no Sin; for where there is no Law, there is no Transgression; or it must be allowed to require the same Obedience that it did at its first Institution, and unto the same degree.

is that Law which our Lord Jesus Christ came <hi>not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, but to fulfil,</hi> that he might be the end of it for Righteousness unto them that do believe.

            <p>First then, They <hi>(i. e.</hi> the <hi>Arminians)</hi> grant Salvation to the antient <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and Jews, before the coming of Christ, without any Knowledg of, or Faith in him at all: Nay, they deny that any such Faith in Christ was ever prescribed unto them, or required of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is certain that there is no place in the Old Testament, from whence it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that Faith in Christ (as a Redeemer) was ever enjoin'd, or found in any of them,</hi> say the Remonstrants jointly in their Apology, <hi>chap. 7. fol.</hi> 91. The truth of which Assertion we shall see hereafter; only they grant a general Faith, involved under Types and Shadows, and looking on the Promise as it lay hid in the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Providence of God, which indirectly might be called a Faith in Christ; from which kind of Faith I see no reason why thousands of Heathens and Infidels should be excluded. Agreeable unto these Assertions are the Dictates of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Arminius,</hi> affirming, <hi>That the whole description of the Faith of</hi> Abraham, Rom. 4. <hi>makes no mention of Jesus Christ, either expresly, or so implicitly, as that it may be of any one easily understood:</hi> and to the Testimony of Christ himself to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,

What they teach of the Jews, that also they grant concerning the Gentiles living before the Incarnation of Christ; they also might attain Salvation, and be justified without his Knowledg: For altho, saith <hi>Corvinus,</hi> the <hi>Covenant was not revealed unto them by the same means that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jews, yet they are not to be supposed to be excluded from the Covenant (of Grace) nor to be excluded from Salvation; for some way or other they were called.</hi> 3. They are come at length to that Perfection in setting out this Stain in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that <hi>Bertius</hi> on good Consideration, deny'd this Proposition, <hi>That no Man can be</hi> saved, that is not ingrafted into Christ by a true Faith. And <hi>Venator</hi> to this Question, <hi>Whether the only means of Salvation, be the Life, Passion, Death, Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Ascension of Jesus Christ?</hi> answereth, <hi>No; Thus they lay Men in</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's Bosom, who never believed in the Son of <hi>Abraham;</hi> make them overcome the Serpent, who never heard of the Seed of the Woman; bring Goats into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who never were of the Flock of Christ, never entred by him the Door; make Men please God without Faith, and obtain the remission of Sins, without the sprinkling of the Blood of the Lamb; to be saved without a Saviour, redeemed without a Redeemer; to become the Sons of God, and never know their elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which prodigious Error might yet be pardoned, and ascribed to human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity, had it casually slipt from their Pens as it did from some others. But seeing it hath Foundation in all the grounds of their new Doctrine, and is maintained by them on mature deliberation, it must be looked upon by all Christians as a Heresy to be detested and accursed. For first, They deny the Contagion and Demerit of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin: Then make the Covenant of Grace to be universal, and comprehend all and every one of the Posterity of <hi>Adam.</hi> 3. Grant a Power in our selves to come unto God by any such Means as he will appoint and affirm; that he doth assign some Means unto all: and it will naturally follow, that the knowledg of Christ is not absolutely necessary to Salvation, and so down falls the Preheminence of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, its Heaven-reaching Crown must be laid level with the Services of Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil Gods—If we look upon the several Branches of this <hi>Arminian</hi> novel Doctrine, extenuating the precious worth and necessity of Faith in Christ, we shall find them hew'd off by the two-edged Sword of God's Word. 1. For their denying the Patriarchs and Jews to have had Faith <hi>in Christum exhibendum &amp; moriturum,</hi> as we in him <hi>exhibitum &amp; mortuum,</hi> it is disproved by all Evangelical Promises made from the beginning of the World to the Birth of our Saviour, as that <hi>Gen. 3. 15. chap. 12. 3. chap. 49. 10.

                           <p>We affirm, that we are guilty of the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> not by bare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, nor yet poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially only in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Loins, but really, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in some sort actually by Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Dr. <hi>Willet</hi>'s Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nop. Pap. 865.</p>
                           <p>The first is, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s both <hi>Transgression</hi> and <hi>Guiltiness;</hi> whereby <hi>in his Sin, all his Posterity sinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. The reason of this is ready: <hi>Adam</hi> was not then a private Man, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented all Mankind; and therefore look what Good he received from God, or Evil elsewhere, both were common to others with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. Here we must not omit to remember the largeness of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall. Sins are either personal, or general: Personal are such as are peculiar to one or some few Persons, and make them alone guilty. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that is common to all Men; and such is <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall. It is a Sin not only of the Person of one Man, but of the whole Nature of Man. And <hi>Adam</hi> must be considered not as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94224:44"/>
Man, but as a Root or Head bearing in it all Mankind; or as a publick Person, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting all his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore when he sinned, all his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity sinned with him: as in Parliament, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is done by the Burgess of the Shire, is done by every Person in the Shire, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. And here lies the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall and the Sins of Men, as <hi>Cain</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which makes not the Posterity of <hi>Cain</hi> guilty, because he was never appointed by God to be the Root of his Posterity, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, and therefore his Sin is personal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Adam</hi>'s is not: Yet this must not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of all the Sins of <hi>Adam,</hi> but only of the first. Mr. <hi>Perk.</hi> p. 16, 254.</p>
                           <p>To speak distinctly, in original Sin there are three things. 1. The Guiltiness of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fact derived unto us by just Imputation. 2. The want of that original Justice which was in us in the Creation. 3. The depravation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Disposition of our Natures.

by his Disobedience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: Christ convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over Righteousness and Life to his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by free imputation of Faith. Also they differ in this, that the Offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> by which Death came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Men, was but once; but the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ imputed to Believers, doth not only cover and do away that one, but all other Offences of the Elect: also his Obedience put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon the faithful a Righteousness which meriteth a far better Condition than we lost by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.

                           <p>The Act it self was peculiar to <hi>Adam,</hi> but the fault lieth upon all. The words <hi>Rom. 5. 12. In whom all have sinned,</hi> being rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, make it plain: <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, that <hi>in one all sinned;</hi> and after, <hi>By the Offence of one, a fault came upon all. We all were that one Man,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine.</hi> His Offence is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of as personal, but as common; such as into which we are all engaged. 2. It stands in a kind of an illness and depravedness, both in regard that that singular Excellency,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94224:45"/>
wherewith <hi>Adam</hi> was once endowed for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and all his Issue, is utterly lost; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that in the stead thereof there is come in a kind (as I may term it) of positive Corruption, which is much like the raging Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sam. Hieron,</hi> Par. 2. p. 144.</p>
                           <p>We were <hi>all one in</hi> Adam, <hi>and with him;</hi> in him <hi>legally,</hi> in regard of the Stipulation and Covenant between God and him; we were in him Parties in that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, had Interest in the Mercy, and were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Curse which belonged to the Breach of that Covenant; and in him <hi>naturally,</hi> and therefore unavoidably subject to all that Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and Burden which the <hi>Human Nature</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in his Fall. And tho there be risen up a Sect of Men, who deny the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> to be our Sin, or any way so by God accounted, and to us imputed; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that before that Arch-Heretick <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius,</hi> and his Disciple <hi>Caelestius,</hi> did vex the Churches, never any Man deny'd the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin (and Guilt is inseparable from the Sin it self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a proper Passion of it) to belong to all his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94224:46"/>
Posterity. This then is the first Charge of the Spirit upon us, Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation with <hi>Adam</hi> in his Sin. And in as much as that Commandment unto <hi>Adam</hi> was the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Law, so justly required, so easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great must needs be the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of it, Pride, Ambition, Rebellion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, Ingratitude, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, Concupiscence, Theft, Apostacy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Affection, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Covenant, and an universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of God's Mercy promised; these and the like were those woful Ingredients which compounded that Sin, in the committing whereof we all are sharers, because <hi>Adam</hi>'s Person was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ours, and <hi>Adam</hi>'s Will the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of ours. <hi>Dr.</hi> Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds'<hi>s Sinfulness of Sin,</hi> p. 134, 135.</p>
                           <p>They say, that tho <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin may be thus far said to be unto Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity imputed, as that by reason of it they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obnoxious unto Death (namely an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Dissolution of Body and Soul without any re-union, and an eternal loss of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vision without any pain of sense) vet

                           <p>The first is <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, from whose Fall this natural Corruption and Weakness is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto us.</p>

                           <p>In Sin are three things. 1. <hi>The Offence of God,</hi> which is the fault. 2. <hi>The Obligation unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Punishment, which is the Guilt. 3. The Stain or Pollution of the Soul</hi> (viz.) <hi>the inherent viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inclination of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Evil. Sin</hi> doth not remain in those that are justified, and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the two first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of the <hi>Fault and the Guilt,</hi> both which are taken away by the Death of <hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94224:47"/>
That in a Man regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate there is not at all any Fault or Guilt to be found: for to say that a Man regenerate, when he sins, were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faulty nor guilty, were a gross Untruth, seeing 'tis impossible that Man should sin, yet God not to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that Man should sin, and yet not be guilty, and deserving eternal Death: wherefore we confess that in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest of Men, if they sin, there is a true Fault, and God is displeased with it; there is also true Guilt, and for it they deserve to go to Hell. But yet this truth also must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged withal, that all Faultiness and Guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness are quite abolished and taken away from them by Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that both are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to them.

                           <p>The Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> was not only personal, neither did he sin as a singular Person, but as carrying all Mankind in the Stock and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, no otherwise than Christ satisfying for us on the Cross, hath not suffered as a private Person, but as sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and representing the whole Church in the Head.</p>
                           <p>The Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. doth affirm, that we are dead and crucified with Christ.</p>
                           <p>If therefore we died in Christ dying, and were crucified with him, it is no doubt but that it may likewise be said, that we sinned in <hi>Adam:</hi> for if the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> be imputed to us, why shall not the Sin of the first <hi>Adam;</hi>
                              <pb n="86" facs="tcp:94224:48"/>
seeing that therefore the Righteousness of Christ is imputed to us, that the Sin of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> might not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us? Reason it self doth consent to this; for if <hi>Adam</hi> had received good things not for himself alone, but for his Posterity, it is no marvel, if being spoiled of these good things, he lost them for himself and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                           <p>If any one be capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally punished for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and brought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Poverty, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren also with him do lose their Nobility: Nor is any thing more equal, than that the Son should pay his Father's Debts, and that as they are Heirs of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, so they might be Heirs of their Debts. But in this Similitude there is one, and that a notable difference; that is, when the Debtor hath wasted the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and there is more in Debt than in Goods, the Son may renounce the Inheritance, and leave his Fathers Goods; but here this yielding up cannot be made, because to the Guilt, by the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> there cometh also the natural Depravation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion; like as he that is born of Parents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

                           <p>If you say, <hi>Adam was legally as many Persons</hi> as are born of him in Sin, I deny it: He was the Root of all his Posterity, and they were in him seminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and virtually, but not <hi>personally, actually,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively: But by one
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94224:43"/>
Man's Disobedience, as their Root and Cause, many are made Sinners: And by one Man's Obedience, as the Root and Cause, all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are made righteous. <hi>P.</hi> 113.</p>
                           <p>Do you mean that Guilt resulteth from <hi>God's part of the Covenant,</hi> or from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s, or from <hi>his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</hi> Not from <hi>ours,</hi> for <hi>we existed not,</hi> and <hi>made no such Covenant;</hi> not from <hi>Adam</hi>'s part (antecedent to <hi>natural Derivation.)</hi> For, 1. No Man can prove that ever <hi>Adam</hi> made such a <hi>Covenant.</hi> 2. Or that God gave him any such <hi>Power</hi> (much less Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) to bring Sin and Death on his Posterity by his <hi>Consent,</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> further than by the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> they must derive it from him if he sinned. 3. Not by <hi>God's Covenant-act.</hi> For, 1. No such Covenant of God can be shewn that made Men Sinners further than natural Derivation did. 2. Else God should be the <hi>Author of Sin,</hi> even of all <hi>Mens original</hi> Sin, if his <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Covenant</hi> made them <hi>Sinners</hi> where Nature did not. <hi>P.</hi> 103.

And that his Fall was to the Guilt and Corruption of his Posterity I doubt not: but (as I said) not without and beyond their natural Interest in him, and derivation from him as the reason of it: And we were as much naturally in our next Parents. The first Law said, <hi>[If thou sin thou shalt be</hi> filius mortis, <hi>and so shall those that are propagated of thee.]</hi> The second Covenant saith, <hi>[For thy original and actual Sin Death is thy due, but I will give thee a Pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Grace procured by the Righteousness of Christ.]</hi> But note, that this Covenant pardoneth our original Sin as from <hi>Adam;</hi> and yet it followeth not that we had none because it is pardoned: even so it pardoneth the Guilt of our next Parents Sins, and therefore we had it to be pardoned: both are pardonable to us, therefore we had both.

                           <p>Whereas he <hi>(viz.</hi> the Arminian, against whom Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> wrote) sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be truly accounted a <hi>personal Offence</hi> in his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, both the Scripture and the common Consent of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines run against him. For tho it be not personal in the same sense wherein actual Sins done by Men, having the use of Reason and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, are said to be their personal Actions, yet it is in another sense voluntary and personal, because it was so done that every singular Person of Mankind is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in that very volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Sin, and in the Guilt of Punishment or Death due thereunto. So saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 5. Sin and Death entred into the World by one:</hi> But how? <hi>In quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in eo omnes peccaverunt.</hi> And again, <hi>By one Man's Disobedience many were made Sinners. Haleuscio</hi> to this purpose saith, <hi>Secundùm Augustinum, concedimus quod non punitur parvulus pro cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa patris, sed pro culpa sua, propriè loquendo. Non enim dicit Apostolus quòd solùm Adam peccavit, sed dicit quòd omnes peccaverunt in Adam: Erat enim in Adam non solùm volunt as unius sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularis personae, sed volunt as universalis Naturae.

We grant, according to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> that speaking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, a little Child is not punished for the fault of his Father, but for his own fault. But the Apostle doth not say that <hi>Adam</hi> alone sinned, but says that all have sinned in <hi>Adam:</hi> for in <hi>Adam</hi> there was not only the Will of his own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Person, but the Will of his universal Nature. <hi>Adam</hi> falling from origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteousness, every <hi>(distinct)</hi> Will of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity fell also.—Last of all; Whereas he taketh it for granted, that <hi>Adam's Sin is only imputed</hi> unto his Children, and so they are <hi>determined to Death</hi> and eternal <hi>Torments for a Sin only imputed,</hi> he is contrary to the Judgment of the Catholick Church: for it is generally held against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin was the Sin of every Person that was a Member of him, so likewise <hi>Adam</hi>'s Crookedness of Will was not barely imputed, but actually propagated to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry singular Person derived from his Loins.</p>

Answ. <hi>Adam</hi>'s first Sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the state of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, wherein by God's appointment <hi>gessit personam generis humani,</hi> was every Mans personal Sin, and was consented unto by every Man's Will, because in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> there was not only the Will of one singular Man, but the universal Will of all Mankind, and of every singular Person, as before hath been declared. And I would fain know, if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s first Transgression was his only, and no Man's else, how every singular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is by God himself for that very Transgression esteemed liable unto Death. <hi>Durandus</hi> answereth the Doubt: Tho it were not voluntary <hi>actu personali in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantium</hi> (who were not yet <hi>in rerum naturâ)</hi> yet it was voluntary <hi>voluntate primi hominis, quae fuit interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative voluntas omnium.</hi> And if God himself and the Catholick Church inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret this Will of <hi>Adam</hi> in disobeying God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, to be so far forth our personal Sin, that every singular Person standeth culpable of it, and liable unto Punishment for it, we must not give Credit either to the old Pelagians, or new Remonstrants, when they tell us that such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree cannot stand with God's Mercy.</p>

By Inhesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—By reason of the Covenant of Works which God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> we were in him all of us le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally; when God first made a Covenant with Man, it was not with <hi>Adam ratione individui,</hi> as an undividual Person, <hi>sed ratione naturae,</hi> as he bore our Nature with him, as the Representative of Mankind—Now <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> violating the Covenant, the Guilt of that Violation descends upon all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, <hi>Rom. 5. 19.

become our <hi>Sin</hi> for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, as he may by <hi>Imputation</hi> make Christ's Righteousness become our Righteousness unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet Christ is made of God unto us <hi>Wisdom, Righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. and we have no other Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to appear in for Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before him at the great day. Hence <hi>Rivet</hi> well observes, that the Church has ever found, and still does, that those very Men that are Enemies to the Doctrin of original Sin, are Enemies also to the Doctrin of the Grace of God in Christ. Thus the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that we have contracted any Debt by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, deny also that Christ satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and paid our Debts to Divine Justice; and if they take away this, let them take away all—Tho ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Corruption be truly Sin by Imputation, yet 'tis not so by Imputation only. It is our Sin by Inhesion, inhering in us, and making of us otherwise than God made us.—'Tis more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive than other Sins; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry actual Sin hath some more particular Faculty in Soul or Body, which it does defile and charge with Guilt, wherein it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or whereby it was acted; but <hi>original Sin</hi> stains all alike; so far as by their several Natures they are receptive of its Defilement, it ruins the whole <hi>little World</hi> of Man.—Personal

                           <p>This was a Covenant not made with <hi>Adam</hi> as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Person, but as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative—Hence it is that in <hi>Adam</hi> all sin, and in <hi>Adam</hi> all die.—The Covenant of Works did not cease by the Fall, but it stands still in force unto all those that are yet in the first <hi>Adam</hi>—God will deal with Men both in a way of Sin and Righteousness, by way of Imputation, and the ground of all Imputation is Union. In the first <hi>Adam</hi> all sin, and all die, because by their Union they stood under his Covenant; so in the second <hi>Adam</hi> we are made the Righteousness of God in him. <hi>Mr.</hi> Strong <hi>of the Covenants,</hi> p. 1, 2.</p>
                           <p>Our Divines do make, and most truly and rightly according to the Scripture, a twofold Sinfulness, which we have hereditary to us, as from our first Parents; the first is, the Guilt of that first Act of sinning, which <hi>Adam</hi> committed: and the second is an inherent Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Flesh, the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to all Sin derived as the Punishment of the Guilt of that Fact.—Now it is not only inherent Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that makes us Children of Wrath, but it is also the Guilt of the first Act.———

                              <hi>Q.</hi> Why should the Guilt of that Act which infects our Nature, be conveyed to us by Generation, as the Channel, and by Nature, rather than the Sins of our Parents? <hi>Answ.</hi> All Divines answer that clearly: That <hi>Adam</hi> was a publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and he was therein Christ's Type, which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parent is: <hi>Eve</hi> was not; for tho she was first in the Transgression, yet it is not said, <hi>By the Obedience of that one Woman,</hi> or, <hi>By the Disobedience of those first Parents, we are made Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> but it is clearly put on the <hi>Disobedience of that one Man:</hi> Why? because he was made a publick Person, and stood so, which <hi>Eve</hi> in that respect did not.—As soon as ever he had eaten the forbidden Fruit, as soon as he had committed that same one Sin, he ceased to be a common Person, he is then but as an ordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, otherwise we had not been made Sinners by that one Disobedience, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. but we must have inherited all the Sins that he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.—Generation is but the Channel; it is the Act of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, and the first Act of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin whilst he stood a common Person, being imputed to us, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us, that makes us sinful.—<hi>Adam</hi> is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Person to him (Christ) no, he was ordained a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Person before <hi>Adam</hi> was made one; for <hi>Adam</hi>

was his Type.—And let me add this likewise for our comforts, that Christ, because he would take away original Sin in us, he came as near as possible could be, so as to escape Pollution. He would be made of the same Matter we were made of, he would be made in the Womb of a Virgin, he would be conceived, and he took upon him too the likeness of sinful Flesh, with all the Frailties of it, as like sinful Flesh every way as could be; nay, he would have his Mother go and be purified, as if she had brought forth an unclean Son; for the Law in <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> was, to shew the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of our Birth, that the Mother was to be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.

Some deny the Depravation and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Nature, which ensued on our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy from God, and the loss of his Image: or if they do not absolutely deny it, yet they so <hi>extenuate</hi> it as to render it a matter of no great concern unto us.

Transgression and Exorbitancy from the Law; yet, <hi>3dly,</hi> In respect of our Wills, we are not thus innocent neither, for we all sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle affirmeth: Now all Sin is voluntary, say the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants, and therefore <hi>Adam</hi>'s Transgression was our voluntary Sin also, and that in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects: 1. In that his <hi>voluntary Act is imputed to us as ours,</hi> by reason of the Covenant which was made with him in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half: but because this consisting in an Imputation must needs be extrinsecal unto us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 2. We say that <hi>Adam</hi> being the Root and Head of all human kind, and we all Branches from the Root, all parts of that Body whereof <hi>he was the Head, his Will may be said to be ours; we were then all that one Man,</hi> we were all in him, and had no other Will but his: so tho that be extrinsecal unto us, considered as particular Persons, yet it is intrinsecal as we are all Parts of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature; as in him we sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, so in him we had a Will of sinning. 3. Original Sin is a defect of Nature, and not of this or that particular <hi>Person;</hi> whereas <hi>Alvares</hi> grounds this difference of actual and original Sin, that the one is always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the proper Will of the Sinner, to the other is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired only the Will of our first Parent, who was the Head of Human Nature.—The sum of their Endeavour in this Particular is, to clear the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man from being any way guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual Sin, as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94224:48"/>
being then in him a Member and part of that Body whereof he was the Head; or from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obnoxious unto an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, by reason of that Covenant which God made with us all in him: so that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, as you saw before, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Corruption and Pravity of Nature, and now all Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation by any means of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Transgression, methinks they cast a great Aspersion on Almighty God, however he dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> for his own particular, yet for casting us his most innocent Posterity out of Paradise.—But let them enjoy their own Wisdom, which is earthly, sensual and devilish. The Scripture is clear, that the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> is the Sin of all, not only by propagation and communication (whereby not his singular Fault, but something of the same nature is derived unto us) but also by an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his actual Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto us all; his singular Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience being by this means made ours. The grounds of this Imputation I touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which may be all reduced to his being a common Person and Head of all our Nature, which investeth us with a double Interest in his Demerits, whilst so he was, 1. <hi>As we were then in him, and part of him. 2. As he sustained the place of our whole Nature</hi> in the Covenant God made with him, both which even according to the Exigence of God's Justice, require that his Transgression be accounted ours. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> is plain, not only, <hi>That by one Man's Offence many</hi>

               <hi>Adam</hi> was the Father of all Mankind, from whom they spring, but he did not so represent the Persons of all that were to spring of him, as if his Obedience without their own would have justified any of them at Age; if <hi>Adam</hi> had not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Cain</hi> should have been condemned if he had sinned, and so others—<hi>Bonum est ex causis integris; malum ex partiali:</hi> Any Defect maketh Sin, but Good must have entire Causes.—<hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin causeth original Sin in all, <hi>ex privatione causa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis boni:</hi> But if <hi>Adam</hi> had not sinned, every Sin of their own would have made his Children unrighteous—They hold that we are justified by the same Law or Covenant of Innocency, which condemneth us; because, say they, we have fulfilled it in and by Christ; falsly (as is aforesaid) supposing that <hi>Christ</hi> was either such a Surety as was in the same Bond disjunctively with the Principal, or else that the Principal (Man) was allowed to do his Duty, or bear his suffering by another: And so they deny the Gospel-Covenant and Gift, which is that indeed which justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth us by the way of Redemption, falsly supposing that the very damning Law doth justify us by way of prevention as innocent, as having fulfilled it in <hi>Christ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxt.</hi> Brevi.

               <hi>Norton.</hi> The scope of Mr. <hi>Forbes</hi> is to prove the Imputation of Christ's passive Obedience, and that only in his Death, to be the matter of our Justification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We consent to Mr. <hi>Forbes</hi> as to the Argument taken from the Comparison, but dissent from him as concerning the Restrictions, the Reasons of the Comparison being founded upon the Conditions of the Persons and Divine Institution it holds
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94224:49"/>
betwixt such Acts, as the first and second <hi>Adam</hi> acted as publick Persons: <hi>Adam</hi> therefore being in that Act of Disobedience only a publick Person, hence that Act only is imputed unto his Seed: But Christ being in all his Acts of Obedience a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Person, hence therefore all the Acts of Christ's Obedience are imputed to his Seed. As upon supposition of <hi>Adam</hi>'s continuing in Obedience (because he had then continued a publick Person) all the Acts of his Obedience, even to the finishing of perfect Righteousness, had been imputed to his Seed, according to the nature of the Covenant of Works, unto their attaining of Justification by the Law. The Union between <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity was not personal, nor only natural, but mystical: It was a Conjunction of the Person of <hi>Adam,</hi> and all contained in his Loins in one spiritual Body, by the Institution of God, whereby he was as their Head, they as his Members, to stand or fall with him, standing or falling.</p>

the World; and therefore his Redemption is not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to all Men; for the Intercession is the means of applying the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. If it be said, by the World is meant only the Contemners of Grace, it appears to be otherwise, in that Christ opposeth the World to them which <hi>are the Father's,</hi> and are <hi>given to Christ</hi> by him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by signifying, that by the World he means all such as are not the Father's, and were <hi>never given</hi> to Christ.

himself.—Christ was first a Firebrand himself, touched or scorched with the Fire of his Father's Wrath, and then as the Coal from the Altar he also purifieth us. Thus then we fear not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess with the Scriptures and Fathers, that Christ bearing our Sins in himself upon the Cross, did feel himself, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Combat, as rejected and forsaken of God, and accursed for us, and the flames of his Father's Wrath burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within him: So that to the honour of Christ's Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we confess, that our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Redeemer refused no part of our Punishment, but endured the very Pains of Hell so far as they tended not neither to the <hi>derogation</hi> of his Person, <hi>depravation</hi> of his Nature, <hi>destruction</hi> of his Office.—The Saints of God need not fear Hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ felt it, but they by his Hell-sorrows are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from Hell: Let <hi>them</hi> rather look to this Danger, that would make us believe that the Hell-sorrows of the Soul have not yet by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, been satisfied for: for seeing they must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, and you say Christ hath not endured them for us, this will rather strike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mind a fear of Hell, that these Sorrows remain yet to be suffered, than the Meditation of Christ's Hell in his Soul, whereby our Souls are delivered. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saints need not fear Hell Flames, because they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94224:52"/>
were kindled in Christ's Soul, but to be bold against them, because Christ in his Soul hath quenched them.—The Question confirmed, that Christ in Soul suffered the Pains of Hell.—Thus then we doubt not to deliver our Opinion, that our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as in himself he bore all the Sins of the Elect, so he also suffered the whole Punishment of Body and Soul in general due unto us for the same, <hi>which we should have endured, if he had not satisfied for it:</hi> and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we affirm, that he felt the anguish of Soul, and horror of God's Wrath, and so in Soul entred into the Torments of Hell for us, sustained them and vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.—Christ more sharply and vehemently felt God's Wrath than ever any Man did or shall; yea, we except not the very Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and Damned, because the Scripture saith, <hi>That God laid on him the Sins of us all,</hi> Isa. 53. 6. then all the Sins of the World <hi>(i. e.</hi> of the Elect) concurring together must needs bring with them a greater Horror than the Sins of one Man.—That Christ by his Death did fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Justice of God, and appeased his Wrath in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ransom for our Sins, which he took upon him, <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> with the Punishment thereof, in which respect he is truly said to have died just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as a Debtor to the Law of God's Justice for us.—

None are forsaken of God, or stand accursed by the Law unjustly: for God is just, and the Law is <hi>just, holy, good,</hi> Rom. 7. 12.

He was also by the Law a Curse for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christ in respect of our Sins in the sight of God suffered justly.—Christ as a Sinner did sustain the Death of Sinners.—We conclude that Christ's Death, as he was our Surety, and took upon him our Sins, could not in the Decree and Counsel of God be unjust.</p>
                           <p>If Christ then suffered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's Justice, and died to satisfy God's Justice, how could his Death be unjust?—That Christ in his Soul did truly feel his Father's Wrath kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him for our Sin.—<hi>Object.</hi> If ye say God loved him as a Son, yet hated him as our Surety, or became a Servant for us, ye fall into <hi>Nestorius</hi>'s Heresy, and so make the Persons of Christ, one beloved, another hated: If we say that God was not angry indeed, but Christ so perswaded, you will coin a new Heresy that Christ had a false Opinion of his Father. <hi>Fevard,</hi> pag. 571.

They that were actually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to bear the Pains of Death; both temporal, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal, are now so far redeemed and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and delivered, that all the <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> necessary to actual Forgiveness is made for them by another, and no one of them all shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish for want of a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice made</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> for them; and an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal conditional Pardon is

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94224:55"/>
it: Only I marvel that any should think to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead this Truth of Christ's suffering the same that we did, by saying, that Christ's <hi>Obligation</hi> to Punishment was <hi>spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionis propriae,</hi> ours <hi>viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae Legis;</hi> as tho it were the manner how Christ came to be obnoxious to Punishment, and not <hi>what Punishment</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, that is asserted when we say, that he underwent the <hi>fame</hi> that we should have done.</p>
                           <p>But as to say, that Christ became <hi>obnoxious</hi> to Punishment the same way that we do, or did, that is, by Sin of his own, is <hi>Blasphemy:</hi> So to say he did not upon his own <hi>voluntary</hi> undertaking, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the <hi>same,</hi> is little less. It is true, Christ was made Sin for us, had <hi>our Sin</hi> imputed to him, not his own; was obliged to answer for our <hi>fault,</hi> not his own, but he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to answer what we <hi>should have done.</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> against <hi>Biddle,</hi> p. 504, 564, 565, 567.—</p>
                           <p>The Lamb of God did not only these things for us, but he underwent Torments, and was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for us—taking unto himself the Curse that was due to us: for what was he but (a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for us) a Price of Redemption for our Souls?

                           <p>Christ should offer himself to undergo that Punishment which his <hi>(viz.</hi> the Father's) Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice had allotted for the Rebels, and should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly do it; he should properly make Satisfaction for their Offence, and in strict Justice they ought to be pardoned: the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Christ by the Payment of the same thing that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is no way preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to that free gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Condonation of Sin, so often mentioned.—Now from all this, thus much to clear up the nature of the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,

                           <p>It was the Law which hindred God from shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy, and made Man's Salvation impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; then that Law doth oblige God to see it fulfilled, or else to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94224:56"/>
grant no Life to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: and if Christ did not fulfil it, nor was made <hi>properly subject to it,</hi> (as they teach) then he could not properly purchase a Covenant of Life; if he did fulfil it for Sinners, then they must be discharged by his Satisfaction, without further Conditions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on them.—They say the Law of Works was neither abolished nor fulfilled by Christ, but relaxed; I suppose they mean, that God did not insist upon the absolute performance of the Law, but was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to admit of an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Reparation of his Honour, by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Christ to the Law which he should impose on him, wherein should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended a great part of the Moral Law. I reply, if God did relax the Law, so as not to require the proper ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of it, then he did lose the Obligation which was laid upon him to see it fulfilled: The ordinate or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Iustice of God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Law; and if he admitted of another way of repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Honour, he did not proceed in a way of Justice in all that he laid upon Jesus
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94224:57"/>
Christ; and he might as well have saved Man without the Obedience of Christ as with it, his Justice or Law allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Relaxation no more than a total super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding or laying aside the Law. By this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase therefore they can mean no more, but that Jesus Christ did so honour the Father by his Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, that he might with <hi>decorum</hi> to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty give to Sinners terms of Salvation, and would do it; but this is no Purchase, which transferreth a Legal Right to the Purchaser, if the Purchase be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but dependeth merely upon Promise or terms of Honour. It is also great Presumption for Men to judg what is becoming Divine Majesty; and what will salve his Honour, other than what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Law or Promise; whereas here they make him to wave his own declared Law founded in the highest Reason and Equity.—Nor in this sense is the Death of Christ a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, Satisfaction, or Propitiation, A Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som respecteth Persons to be redeemed: it is a Price given for them, not for Laws and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, whoever paid
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94224:57"/>
a Ransom without agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to whom it should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and that it should take certain effect? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as here is nothing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased but a Covenant or Promise, that all those that believe and obey the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel should be saved, which perhaps might be none.</p>
                           <p>Nor was it agreed how long the World should stand, and so what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men should be made, or should need, or be capable of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. A Satisfaction to God in this case is a Satisfaction to his Law, whereby the Sinner must immediately be discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A Propitiation is a Sacrifice appeasing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling God to Man, neither of which is done if only a Promise be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to save Men upon their fulfilling the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a new Law.—If Christ only purchased a Covenant of Life, then his Redemption is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual to save, than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Fall was to destroy Man. The Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17, 18. comparing the Death of Christ with <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, saith, As Sin reigned to Death, so Grace much more reigns to Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But where is this much more?

            <p>This was <hi>Pelagius,</hi> whose principal Artifice which he used in the introduction of his Heresy, was in the clouding of his Intentions with general and ambiguous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, as some would be making use of his very Words and Phrases. Hence, for a long time, when he was justly charged with his sacrilegious Errors, he made no Defence of them, but reviled his Adversaries as corrupting his Mind, and not understanding his Expressions. And by this means, as he got himself acquitted in the Judgment of some less experienced in the Slights and cunning Craftiness of them who lie in wait to deceive, and <hi>juridically</hi> freed in an Assembly of <hi>Bishops:</hi> So in all probability he had suddenly infected the whole Church with the Poison of those Opinions, which the proud and corrupted Nature of Man is so apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and embrace, if God had not stirred up some few holy and learned Persons, <hi>Austin</hi> especially, to discover his Frauds, to refel his Calumnies, and confute his <hi>Sophisms,</hi> which they did with indefatigable Industry and good Success. But yet these <hi>Tares</hi> being once sown by the <hi>envious</hi> One, found such a sutable and fruitful Soil in the darkned Minds and proud Hearts of Men, that from that day to this they could never be fully extirpated; but the same bitter Root hath still sprung up unto the defiling of many, tho various new Colours have been put upon its Leaves and Fruit. And altho those who at present amongst us have undertaken the same Cause with <hi>Pelagius,</hi> do not equal him either in Learning or Diligence, or an appearance of Piety and Devotion, yet do they exactly imitate him in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their Minds in cloudy ambiguous Expressions, capable of various Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions until they are fully examined, and thereon reproaching (as he did) those that oppose them as not aright representing their Sentiments, when they judg it their advantage so to do.—<hi>Dr.</hi> O. <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> p. 176, 177.</p>
            <p>That which they seem to aim at and conclude may be reduced unto these Heads. (1.) That God administers Grace unto all in the Declaration of the Doctrine of the Law and Gospel. (2.) That the Reception of this Doctrine, the Belief and Practice of it is enforced by Promises and Threatnings. (3.) That the things revealed, taught and commanded, are not only good in themselves, but so suted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reason and Interest of Mankind, as that the Mind cannot but be disposed and enclined to receive and obey them, unless over-powred by Prejudices and a course of Sin. (4.) That the Consideration of the Promises and Threatnings of the Gospel is sufficient to remove these Prejudices, and reform that course. (5.) That upon a compliance with the Doctrine of the Gospel, and Obedience thereunto, Men are made partakers of the Spirit, with other Privileges of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94224:59"/>
and have a right unto all the Promises of the present and future Life. Now this is a perfect System of <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> condemned in the antient Church as absolutely exclusive of the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.—Tho the loose confused Expressions of some be not considered in particular. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 256.</p>
            <p>Thus have I sufficiently (I trust) maintained this antient Truth concerning the Efficacy and Benefit of Christ's Death ordained only for the Elect; wherein (I doubt not) but that they which are somewhat wavering, and not yet settled in Judgment, may soon be resolved: If on the one side, they do consider the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Grounds and evident Demonstrations of the Truth, and on the other, the weakness of their Proofs, the diversity of Opinion in themselves, and the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Consequence of so many Absurdities that follow upon the Opinion of universal or common Grace. Wherefore I wonder that some, heretofore throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the Truth, should now begin to stagger in Opinion: to whom may be applied that saying of the Apostle, <hi>I marvel that ye are so soon removed away to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gospel.</hi> Again, <hi>Who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the Truth, to whom Jesus Christ was before described in your sight?</hi> Wherefore the Death of Christ being so evidently described unto us in Scripture to appertain to the Elect, let us therein rest, and leave all other strange and new Opinions which may disturb our Peace, and distract simple Minds; let us from henceforth follow the Truth in Love; which God grant.

These two therefore are in no sort to be divided, unless we would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from Hell separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from our Inheritance in Heaven, and still to be subject to the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Loss, tho free from the Punishment of Sense. <hi>Mr.</hi> Burton'<hi>s Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> p. 68, 69, 70, 71,

                           <p>The Obedience of Christ how cometh it to be for our <hi>Righteousness,</hi> but by imputation only? he stood before God <hi>in the Person of the whole body of his Elect.</hi>

                           <p>It will appear by scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the nature of Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship, when one Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes and engageth himself for another. Let the case be betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Onesimus: Onesimus</hi> ran away from <hi>Philemon</hi> his Master, and at his departure (by all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) took with him some part of his Master's Goods: <hi>Paul</hi> becomes a Mediator for him, and for the better furtherance of his Request, he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to see the Wrong and Damage which is done, to be discharged: <hi>If he hath hurt thee, or oweth thee ought, that put on my account. I</hi> Paul <hi>have written this with my own hand, I will recompence it;</hi> Phil. <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19. By this means <hi>Onesimus</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and <hi>Paul</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Debtor to <hi>Philemon,</hi> but how? neither hath <hi>Onesimus</hi> repaid ought, neither hath <hi>Paul</hi> stoln or borrowed ought; it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94224:64"/>
is by Imputation: By virtue of the undertaken Suretiship, <hi>Onesimus</hi> his Debt lies upon <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s freedom from Debt turns to the acquittance of <hi>Onesimus.</hi> So it is in this case of Justification; we stood bound to God to perform so many Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Righteousness, and to sustain so much Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, even the eternal weight of God's Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, for so many holy Services unperformed. Christ cometh between, and giveth himself to God the Father for a full Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. Thus is he now reputed the Debtor, and must pay the Mulct; we adjudged righteous, and must receive the Reward: and yet neither is he a Debtor by his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Transgression, nor we freed by our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Justice, but both by Imputation. This Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude is very fitting, because as our Sins are called <hi>Debts,</hi> so Christ is said to have <hi>given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as a full Price, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable every way to our Debt,</hi> and so by <hi>his Stripes</hi> to have <hi>healed us.

                           <p>Justification hath two Parts: 1. The forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94224:64"/>
of Sins. 2. The making of us just: for as we owed unto God a Satisfaction by Death for the breach of the Law, so we were bound to perform Subjection to God with all power of Body and Soul, and all the might of those Powers, even from the time of our being. Therefore as we needed the Passion of our Lord to discharge the first Debt of Pain and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, so the other Debt of Homage and Conformity to the Will of God was answered in the Obedience of his Life, that so we might not only escape Death, but find an entrance into Life eternal, which without perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment might not be granted according to the tenor of the Law, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> Levit. 18. 5.—There must be a Translation of the Law from us in our Persons unto the Person of our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who must do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry jot for us: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth him to fulfil all Righteousness, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. he is the end of the Law for Righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and hath made us just by his Obedience—And because subject to the Law, to redeem us which were obnoxious

                           <p>Besides, if the actual O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of <hi>Adam</hi> made us Sinners, how should we be just without the actual Obedience of Christ? Wilson <hi>on the</hi> Romans, <hi>p.</hi> 331, 332, 333.</p>

                           <p>They heinously err and subvert the Gospel, who say, that Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is so imputed to us, as that God reputeth, or judgeth Christ to have been <hi>perfectly holy and righteous</hi> (or obedient) and to have suffered, tho not in the natural, yet in the <hi>legal</hi> or <hi>civil</hi> Person of the <hi>Sinner</hi> or <hi>Believer,</hi> as their strict and <hi>proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenter;</hi> and reputeth us to have been <hi>perfectly holy, righteous</hi> or <hi>obedient</hi> in <hi>Christ as our Representer,</hi> and so to have <hi>our selves fulfilled all Righteousness in</hi> and by <hi>him,</hi> and in him to have satisfied Justice, and merited eternal Life, and Christ's Righteousness to be ours in the same sense of Propriety, as it was his own; for his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Righteousness is the

Essence of God, and his human <hi>Habits, Acts</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> which are the Accidents of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son only as the Subject, and cannot be in another.—Therefore they assert a Contradiction when they say, that we both perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey'd by and in Christ, and yet suffered or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in or by him for our Disobedience. <hi>Ibid.</hi> chap. 22. §. 19, 24.</p>
                           <p>That Christ was made a Subject under a Law pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to himself, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his peculiar Works.—If Men will needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose on us their own word of <hi>Representation,</hi> for Peace sake we accept it in a sound sense.—But he did not <hi>absolutely</hi> represent us, he was not our Delegate; our Persons did not in a Law-sense do in and by Christ what he did, or possess the Habits which he possessed, suffered what he suffered; nor doth God account us to have done, for that were to mistake.—And as to that which some call a legal or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative personal Union, it must be proved before it is asserted. And as I know no Word of God that speaketh such a thing, as that Christ and we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively one Person, so I know that they that will assert it of their own heads, presume far in a tender Point.—Are we not righteous by being one
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94224:61"/>
with Christ, as we are Sinners by Union with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam? Answ.</hi> We were but seminally and virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Adam,</hi> and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally (as I have opened in my Dispute of original Sin) and so we were but virtually in Christ when he suffered and obey'd, and we were unborn.—That Christ did obey and suffer, merit and satisfy, in so full and strict a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting and personating every one of the Elect, as that they did and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it in and by Christ, in the sense of the Law of Works, or in God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and that it was not in the third Person of a Mediator, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Effects freely as he pleased by another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: And so that God's imputing Righteousness to us, is his accounting us to have done and suffered in Law-sense what Christ did. This is the root of all the rest, subverting the Gospel it self.—It is a fundamental Fiction lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on many other Errors, to say that the Law of Innocency as it command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Obedience,</hi> or <hi>as it threatned Death to him,</hi> was fulfilled by Christ for him.</p>
                           <p>That Law commanded <hi>Adam</hi> only <hi>personal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, perpetual Obedience:</hi> It mentioned or meant no <hi>vicarius obedientiae aut poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae; dum alius solvit, aliud
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94224:61"/>
solvitur:</hi> Anothers obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or suffering was no fulfilling of the Law as <hi>it commanded</hi> Adam: The Law commandeth each Subject distinctly and personally; Christ fulfilled all the Law as it <hi>obliged himself,</hi> and that <hi>for Adam</hi>'s Redemption who had broken it. But the same Law <hi>as it obliged</hi> Adam was broken by <hi>Adam,</hi> and not kept by him, or any for him.—Many say indeed that Christ <hi>satisfied</hi> the Law for us: But, 1. That proveth that the Obligation of it on us was not <hi>fulfilled:</hi> for <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is <hi>solutio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusabilis tantidem, loco solutionis ejusdem.</hi> 2. But it is an improper Speech to say, that <hi>[the Law is satisfied]</hi> and it meaneth no more but that [the end of Government by that Law is obtained] and it is properly <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> only to the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> and not to the Law; for the Law in its <hi>sense</hi> admits not of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction (tho it hath nothing against it) it is only the <hi>Subjects</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that it commandeth, and <hi>his Death</hi> as Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for Sin that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth. It is the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver</hi> as he is <hi>above his own Law,</hi> and hath power to <hi>pardon,</hi> that is <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi> Tho, as tropically some say, that <hi>finis legis
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94224:62"/>
est lex,</hi> so we will not contend with them that tropically say, <hi>Christ sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the Law,</hi> while they mean but that he satisfied the Law-giver in obtaining the end of the Law. But Christ perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled the Law as it obliged himself upon his Sponsion: And that Law justified him, but no Man else; it is only the new Covenant that justifieth us.</p>
                           <p>The second Error to the same purpose is, that tho Christ and <hi>Adam</hi> were two <hi>natural Persons,</hi> yet they were <hi>one Person</hi> in a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>civil, legal,</hi> or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative sense, in Christ's obeying and suffering; and so that what Christ did and suffered in his <hi>own natural Person,</hi> he did and suffered in <hi>Adam</hi>'s, and every elect Man's <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, legal</hi> or <hi>reputative Person.</hi> This is but the Consequent of the former Error. He may be called our Representer in a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sense, <hi>in tantum &amp; ad hoc</hi> (for there is no hope of holding our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers to Scripture-phrase) but such a strict, full, personating Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is here described, denieth the Substance of the Gospel.—It cannot be said that <hi>we did it le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally by him,</hi> else all the forenamed Absurdities would follow; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that legally <hi>we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94224:62"/>
sinned,</hi> and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Punishment, nor need either Pardon or the Sacrifice of Christ for Pardon. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Christ never sinned, but obeyed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly from first to last; and if we did this <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally by him,</hi> we sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not in Law-sense, that is, not truly at all. When we shew that it was a palpable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to say, that we were perfectly obedient in and by Christ, from Birth to Death, and yet that Christ must suffer for our Sins; it's strange to see how some Men satisfy themselves with wriggling or huddling out a few insignificant words, unfit to satisfy any other.—Either Christ was our legal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>before we were born,</hi> or from <hi>the time of our being,</hi> or from the time of our believing only. 1. Before we had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we were no Sinners, nor bound to obey, and therefore needed not to obey or suffer by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. When we were born, we were not in Christ, and perhaps not Believers till old Age: And so the Elect should legally be just while they are Infidels, and never sin even in their state of Enmity. 3. If only since believing we were so personated by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94224:63"/>
Christ, then his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is not imputed to us for all the time of our Unregeneracy, and then we never sinned in Law-sense after our believing.—Besides that, one that is reputed to have legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled the Law, must be unjustly corrected by the Punishment of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Affliction or Death, or less of the Spirit and Grace, and hath present right to the Reward of that Covenant, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from all penal Evil at least; so that this Doctrine of strict, legal, personating Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion overthroweth the new Covenant and Law of Christ, and all his Kingdom of Grace, and all Religion.—It is not then <hi>too little,</hi> if it must be the <hi>idem,</hi> and not the <hi>aequivalens:</hi> for some of us are bound to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of <hi>Parents,</hi> and some of <hi>Husbands</hi> and <hi>Wives,</hi> some of <hi>Servants,</hi> some of <hi>Magistrates,</hi> some of Souldiers, some to Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proper to the <hi>sick,</hi> to the <hi>old,</hi> and other Conditions which Christ was never in.—It was enough that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took all that was fit for him, and necessary by Equivalency to satisfy, and merit a free Gift of Grace and Glory for us, and that he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the undertaken Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Duties of all

Pernicious also they say it is, as that which takes away the <hi>necessity of our own personal Obedience, introducing Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianism, Libertinism, and all manner of Evils.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Whether Christ in our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son did fulfil the Law, and bear our Punishments, and whether he be judged in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rensick sense to be the Person which sinned? <hi>Answ.</hi> A repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sinning Person (reputed and imputed being the same, as he declares, with this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) is a Person reputed evil, hateful, void of God's Image, clothed with the Devil's Image, to have deserved infernal Damnation without end or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission, and to be loathed of all good: but Christ never was any such; therefore he was not the reputed sinning Person.</p>
                           <p>There were almost innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Persons that have bin Sinners, but Christ was really and reputatively one only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; (for God judgeth not falsly one to be a thousand) therefore Christ was not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or reputatively the sinning Person. The Person bearing Punishment is reputed the

Sinner, he undergoes Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his <hi>own proper Sins</hi> (for if as sinning he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, he is a Sinner; for Reputation is true, not false) but Christ bore not Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by reason of <hi>his proper</hi> Sins.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he that hath given full Satisfaction needeth not Forgiveness, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought he to seek Pardon.

Scripture, with all the Promises and Presignations of his Exhibition in the Flesh from the beginning, cannot now with any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty be expresly denied: Wherefore the <hi>Socinians</hi> themselves grant that <hi>our Sins may be said to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Christ,</hi> and he to undergo the Punishment of them, so far as that all things which befel him <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>afflictive</hi> in this Life, with the <hi>Death</hi> which he underwent, were <hi>occasioned by our Sins;</hi> for had not we sinned, there had been no need of, nor <hi>occasion</hi> for his suffering.

to affirm his <hi>Mediatory Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> as a <hi>publick Person,</hi> to have been for himself, and not for others, hath but less of Impiety in it.—No Man can assign any other way whereby he was <hi>made Sin,</hi> especially his being made so by God, but by God's <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our Iniquities upon him,</hi> that is, imputing our Sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.

As you heard, he bore their Enmities in his Flesh, and so abolished them; and so withal he bore their Persons considered as one collective Body, and under that Consideration reconciled them to God.—Which Body, as hanging upon the Cross, was clothed upon (when most naked) with this other Body, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self took on him to sustain and represent, and to stand in their stead, even the whole Body of his Elect, his Body (personally his) becoming by <hi>Representation</hi> one with his other Body (mystically his.) In sum, in the Body of Christ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, as the Body representing; the whole Body of Christ mystical, as the Body represented, was met in one before God, and unto God. And in that one Body of Christ personally were all these Persons (thus represented) reconciled unto God together, as in one Body, by virtue of this Representation. <hi>Dr.</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win <hi>on the</hi> Ephesians, <hi>Part 3. p.</hi> 24.

A <hi>Surety</hi> is one that undertakes, and is bound to do a thing for another: As, to pay a Debt for him, or to bring him safe to such or such a place, or the like; so as when he hath discharged what he undertook and was bound for, then the Party for whom he undertook is discharged also. 2. A <hi>common Person</hi> with, or for another he goes for, is one who represents, and personates, and acts
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94224:65"/>
the part of another, by the allowance and warrant of the Law; so as what he doth (as such a common Person, and in the name of the other) that other whom he personates, is by the Law reckoned to do: and in like manner, what is done to him (as being in the others stead and room) is reckoned as done to the other. Thus by our Law, an Attorny appears for another, and Monies received by him, are reckoned as received by him whom it is due unto. Thus the giving Possession of an Estate, a Re-entry made, and Possession taken of Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if done by, and to a Man who is his lawful Attorny, it stands as good in Law unto a Man, as if in his own Person it had been done.—Now the better to express and make sure our Justification in and by Christ, according to all sorts of Laws (the Equity of all which God usually draws up into his Dispensation) God did ordain Christ to be a <hi>Surety</hi> for us, and also a <hi>common Person</hi> representing us, and in our stead. That as Christ took all other Relations for us, as of an <hi>Husband, Father, Brother, King, Priest, Captain,</hi> &amp;c. that so the fulness of his Love might be set forth to us, in that what is defective in any one of these Relations, is supplied and expressed by the other: even thus did God ordain Christ to take and sustain both these Relations, of a <hi>Surety,</hi> and a <hi>common Person,</hi> in all he did for us, thereby to make our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by him the more full and legal; and <hi>Justice</hi> (as I may so speak) our Justification it self, or as justifying of us by all sorts of <hi>legal</hi> Considerations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,—The word [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] is used not only in promising to pay a Debt for another, but also in becoming a Pledg for another, for to undergo Death, or a capital Punishment in another's room; as in that famous Story of two Friends, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Euephenus</hi> and <hi>Eucritus, Eucritus</hi> did [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] willingly become a Surety for <hi>Euephenus,</hi> when condemned to die by <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant. This very word is used by <hi>Polyenus,</hi> Historian of that Fact. Now such <hi>Surety</hi> every way did Christ become unto God for us, both to pay the Debt, by undergoing Death in our stead, and so satisfy God; and then as the <hi>Heir</hi> to execute his Will and Testament: He became a <hi>Surety</hi> of the whole Covenant, and every Condition in it, take it in the largest sense.—Observe, that as he laid our Sins on Christ, so withal he discharged us in his Compact between Christ and himself, <hi>[not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their Trespasses to them]</hi> so then all laid upon Christ, and he was to look to it, or else his Soul was to have gone for it.—<hi>Adam</hi> was reckoned as a common publick Person, not standing singly or alone for himself, but as representing all Mankind to come of him; so as by a just Law, what he did was reckoned to his Posterity, whom he represented: And what was by that Law threatned or done to him for what he did, is threatned against his Posterity also. Now this Man was herein a lively Type of our Lord Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14.—Just thus the matter stands in the point of our Justification and Salvation betwixt Christ and elect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; for <hi>Adam</hi> was herein his Type. Christ was considered and appointed of God as a common Person, both in <hi>what he did,</hi> and in what was <hi>done to him:</hi> so as by the same Law, what he did for us is reckoned or imputed to us, as if we our selves had done it; and what was <hi>done</hi> to him tending to our <hi>Justification</hi> and Salvation, is reckoned as done to us. Thus when Christ <hi>died,</hi> he died as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Person, and God reckoneth that we died also. When Christ <hi>arose,</hi> he rose as our <hi>Head,</hi> and as a common Person, and so then God accounts that we rose also with him, and by virtue of that <hi>Communion</hi> which we had with him in all those Actions of his. <hi>Dr.</hi> Goodwin <hi>Christ set forth,</hi> p. 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 71, 76, 81, 82.</p>

               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:94224:66"/>
—<hi>That intimate Conjunction that is between Christ and the Church,</hi> whence it is just and equal in the sight of God, according unto the Rules of his eternal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, that what he did and suffered in the discharge of his Office should be esteemed, reckoned and imputed unto us, as unto all the Fruits and Benefits of it, as if we had done and suffered the same things our selves. For this <hi>Conjunction</hi> of his with us was an Act of his own Mind and Will, wherein he is ineffably glorious.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Enemies</hi> of the Glory of Christ and of his Cross do take this for granted, That there ought to be such a <hi>Conjunction</hi> between the <hi>guilty Person</hi> and him that <hi>suffers</hi> for him, as that in him the guilty Person may be said in some sense to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the Punishment himself.</p>
            <p>But then they affirm on the other hand, that there was <hi>no such Conjunction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and Sinners, none at all, but that he was <hi>a Man,</hi> as they were Men; and otherwise, that he was at the greatest distance from them all, as it is possible for one Man to be from another, <hi>Socin. de Servat. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 3. The falseness of this latter Assertion, and the gross Ignorance of the Scripture under a pretence of <hi>Subtilty</hi> in them that make it, will evidently appear in our ensuing Discourse.</p>
            <p>The Apostle tells us, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 24. That in his own self he bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree.</hi> And <hi>Chap. 3. 18. That he suffered for Sin, the Just for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, that he might bring us unto God.</hi> But this seems somewhat strange unto Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; where is the Justice, where is the Equity, that the Just should suffer for the Unjust? Where is Divine Righteousness herein? For it was an Act of God, <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the Iniquities of us all;</hi> Isa. 53. 6. The Equity hereof, with the grounds of it, must be here a little inquired into.</p>
            <p>First of all, It is certain that all the Elect, the whole Church of God, <hi>fell</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> under the Curse due to the Transgression of the Law. It is so also that in this Curse, <hi>Death</hi> both <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> was contained; this Curse none could undergo and be saved: Nor was it consistent with the Righteousness, or Holiness, or Truth of God, that Sin should go unpunished: Wherefore there was a necessity upon a supposition of God's Decree to save his Church, of a <hi>Translation of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> namely, from them who had <hi>deserved</hi> it, and could not bear it, unto one who had <hi>not</hi> deserved it, but could bear it.</p>
            <p>A Supposition of this <hi>Translation of Punishment</hi> by Divine Dispensation, is the Foundation of Christian Religion, yea of all supernatural Revelation contained in the Scripture: This was first intimated in the <hi>first Promise,</hi> and afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and confirmed in all the Institutions of the Old Testament. For altho in the Sacrifices of the Law there was a revival of the greatest and most fundamental Principle of the Law of Nature, namely, That <hi>God is to be worshipped with our best,</hi> yet the principal end and use of them was to represent this <hi>Translation of Punishment</hi> from the Offender unto another, who was to be a Sacrifice in his stead.</p>
            <p>The Reasons of the Equity hereof, and the unspeakable Glory of Christ herein, is what we now enquire into: And I shall reduce what ought to be spoken hereunto to the ensuing Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not <hi>contrary</hi> unto the nature of Divine Justice, it doth not interfere with the Principles of natural Light in Man, that in sundry cases <hi>some Persons should suffer Punishment for the Sins and Offences of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall at present give this <hi>Assertion</hi> no other Confirmation, but only that God hath often done so, who will, who can do no Iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:94224:66"/>
So he affirms that he will do, <hi>Exod. 20. 5. Visiting the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children unto the third and fourth Generation.</hi> It is no Exception of weight that they also are Sinners, continuing in their Fathers Sins; for the worst of Sinners must not be dealt unjustly withal, but they must be so if they are punished for their Fathers Sins, and it be absolutely unlawful that any one should be punished for the Sins of another.</p>
            <p>So the Church affirms, <hi>Our Fathers have sinned, and are not, and we have born their Iniquities,</hi> Lam. 5. 7. And so it was: For in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity God punished the Sins of their fore-Fathers, especially those committed in the days of <hi>Manasses,</hi> 2 Kings 23. 26, 27. as afterwards in the final Destruction of that Church and Nation: and God punished in them the Guilt of all <hi>bloody Persecutors</hi> from the beginning of the World, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 50, 51.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Canaan</hi> was cursed for the Sin of his Father, <hi>Gen. 9. 25. Saul</hi>'s seven Sons were put to Death for their Fathers bloody Cruelty, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 8, 14. For the Sin of <hi>David</hi> seventy thousand of the People were destroy'd by an Angel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom he said, <hi>It is I that have sinned and done evil, these Sheep what have they done?</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 15, 17. See also 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 29. So was it with all the Children or Infants that perished in the Flood, or in the Conflagration of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> And other Instances of the like nature may be assigned.</p>
            <p>It is therefore evident, that there is <hi>no inconsistency with the nature of Divine Justice,</hi> nor the Rules of Reason among Men, that in sundry cases the Sins of some may be punished on others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is to be observed, that this Administration of Justice is not promiscuous, that any whatever may be punished for the Sins of any others: There is always a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Cause and Reason of it, and this is a <hi>peculiar Conjunction</hi> between them who sin, and those who are punished for their Sins; and two things belong unto this Conjunction. (1.) Special <hi>Relation.</hi> (2.) Especial mutual Interest.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) There is an especial <hi>Relation</hi> required unto this <hi>Translation of Punishment,</hi> such as that between Parents and Children, as in most of the Instances before given; or between a King and Subjects, as in the case of <hi>David.</hi> Hereby the Person sinning, and those suffering, are constituted <hi>one Body,</hi> wherein if one Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber offend, another may justly suffer; the Back may answer for what the Hand takes away.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It consists in <hi>mutual Interest.</hi> Those whose Sins are punished in others have such an <hi>Interest</hi> in them, as that their being so, is a Punishment unto themselves: Therefore are such Sinners threatned with the Punishment and Evils that shall befal their Posterity or Children for their sakes, which is highly penal unto themselves; Numb. 14. 33. <hi>Your Children shall wander in the Wilderness forty Years, and bear your Whoredoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Punishment due to their Sins is in part transferred unto their Children, and therein did the Sting of their own Punishment also consist.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a greater, a more <hi>intimate Conjunction,</hi> a nearer Relation, an higher mutual Interest <hi>between Christ and the Church,</hi> than ever was or can be between any other Persons or Relations in the World, whereon it became just and equal in the sight of God, that he should suffer for us, and that what he did and suffered should be imputed unto us, which is farther to be cleared.</p>
            <p>There neither is nor can be any more than a threefold Conjunction between di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers distinct Persons. The first is <hi>natural,</hi> the second is <hi>moral,</hi> whereunto I refer
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94224:67"/>
that which is <hi>spiritual</hi> or <hi>mystical;</hi> and the third <hi>foederal,</hi> by virtue of mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact. In all these ways is Christ in conjunction with his Church, and in every one of them, in a way <hi>singular</hi> and peculiar.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first Conjunction of distinct Persons is <hi>natural.</hi> God hath made all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind <hi>of one Blood,</hi> Acts 17. 26. whereby there is a Cognation and Alliance between them all.</p>
            <p>Hence every Man is every Man's <hi>Brother</hi> or Neighbour, unto whom loving-kindness is to be shewed, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 36. And this Conjunction was between Christ and the Church, as the Apostle declares, <hi>Heb. 2. 14, 15. For as much as the Children are partakers of Flesh and Blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through Death he might destroy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the Devil: And deliver them who through fear of Death were all their Life-time subject to Bondage.</hi> Hence both <hi>he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified are all one,</hi> ver. 11. His infinite Condescension in coming into this Communion and Conjunction of Nature with us, was before declared; but it is not common, like that between all other Men partakers of the same Nature. There are <hi>two things</hi> wherein it was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and eminent.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) This Conjunction between him and the Church did not arise from a <hi>necessity of Nature,</hi> but from a <hi>voluntary</hi> Act of his Will.</p>
            <p>The Conjunction that is between all others is necessary, every Man is every Man's Brother whether he will or no, by being a Man. Natural Generation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to every one his Subsistence in the same Nature, prevents all Acts of their own Will and Choice. With the Lord Christ it was otherwise, as the Text affirms: For such Reasons as are there expressed, he did by an Act of his own Will <hi>partake of Flesh and Blood,</hi> or came into this Conjunction with us; he did it of his own choice, <hi>because the Children did partake of the same;</hi> he <hi>would</hi> be what the Children were. Wherefore the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of Christ in human Nature with the Church, is <hi>ineffably</hi> distinct from that common Conjunction which is amongst all others in the same Nature: And therefore altho it should not be meet amongst meer Men, that one should act and suffer in the stead of others, because they are all thus related to one another as it were whether they will or no; yet this could not reach the Lord Christ, who in a strange and wonderful manner came into this Conjunction by a meer Act of his own.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He came into it on this design, and for this only end, namely, that <hi>in our Nature taken to be his own,</hi> he might do and suffer what was to be done and suffered for the Church: So it is added in the Text, <hi>That by Death he might destroy him who had the power of Death;</hi> and <hi>deliver them who for fear of Death were subject to Bondage.</hi> This was the only end of his Conjunction in Nature with the Church: And this puts the case between him and it at a vast distance from what is or may be between other Men.</p>
            <p>It is a foolish thing to argue, that because a <hi>meer participation of the same Nature</hi> among Men, is not sufficient to warrant the Righteousness of Punishment one for another, that therefore the Conjunction in the same Nature betwixt Christ and the Church, is not a sufficient and just Foundation of his suffering for us, and in our stead: For by <hi>an Act of his own Will and Choice,</hi> he did partake of our Nature, and that for this very end, that therein he might suffer for us, as the Holy Ghost expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares. Amongst <hi>others</hi> there is not, nor can be any thing of this nature; and so no Objection from what is equal or inequal amongst them, can arise against what is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94224:67"/>
equal between Christ and the Church. And herein is he glorious and precious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that believe, as we shall see immediately.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>mystical Conjunction</hi> between Christ and the Church, which answers all the most strict <hi>real or moral Unions or Conjunctions</hi> between other Persons or Things. Such is the Conjunction between the Head of a Body and its Members, or the Tree of the Vine and its Branches, which are real; or between an Husband and Wife, which is moral and real also. That there is such a Conjunction between Christ and his Church, the Scriptures plentifully declare, as also that it is the foundation of the Equity of his suffering in its stead. So speaks the Apostle, <hi>Ephes. 5. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. Husbands love your Wives, even as Christ also loved the Church,</hi> (that is his Wife, the Bride the Lamb's Wife) <hi>and gave himself for it,</hi> &amp;c. being the Head and Husband of the Church, which was to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and saved, and could be so no otherwise but by his Blood and Sufferings, he was both meet so to suffer, and it was righteous also that what he did and suffered should be imputed unto them for whom he both did it and suffered. Let the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of the Glory of Christ assign any one Instance of such a Conjunction, Union and Relation between any amongst Mankind, as is between Christ and the Church, and they might give some countenance unto their Cavils against his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Sufferings in our stead, with the imputation of what he did and suffered unto us: But the Glory of Christ is <hi>singular</hi> herein, and as such it appears unto them by whom the Mystery of it is in any measure spiritually apprehended.</p>
            <p>But yet it will be said, that this <hi>Mystical Conjunction</hi> of Christ with his Church is <hi>consequential</hi> unto what he did and suffered for it; for it ensues on the Conversion of Men unto him. For it is by Faith that we are implanted into him: Until that be actually wrought in us, we have no <hi>mystical Conjunction</hi> with him. He is not an <hi>Head</hi> or an <hi>Husband</hi> unto unregenerate, unsanctified Unbelievers, whilst they continue so to be: And such was the state of the whole Church when Christ suffered for us, <hi>Rom. 5. 8. Eph.</hi> 2. 5. There was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no such <hi>mystical Conjunction</hi> between him and the Church, as to render it meet and equal that he should suffer in its stead: Wherefore the Church is the <hi>effect of the work of Redemption,</hi> that which rose out of it, which was made and constituted by it, and cannot so be the <hi>Object of it,</hi> as that which was to be redeemed by virtue of an antecedent Conjunction with it. I answer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Altho this <hi>mystical Conjunction</hi> is not actually consummate without an actual Participation of the Spirit of Christ, yet the Church of the Elect was designed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently unto all his Sufferings to be his Spouse and Wife, so as that he might love her, and suffer for her: So it is said, <hi>Hos.</hi> 12. 12. Israel <hi>served for a Wife, and for a Wife he kept Sheep.</hi> Howbeit she was not his <hi>married Wife</hi> until after he had served for her, and thereby purchased her to be his Wife; yet as he served for her she is called his <hi>Wife,</hi> because of his <hi>Love</hi> unto her, and because she was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be upon his Service. So was the Church designed to be the Spouse of Christ in the Counsel of God, whereon he loved her, and gave himself for her.</p>
            <p>Hence in the Work of Redemption the Church was the <hi>Object</hi> of it, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be the Spouse of Christ, and the <hi>Effect</hi> of it, inasmuch as that thereby it was made meet for the full Consummation of that Alliance, as the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly declares, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Antecedently unto all that the Lord Christ did and suffered for the Church
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94224:68"/>
there was a supream Act of the Will of God the Father, <hi>giving all the Elect unto him,</hi> entrusting them with him to be redeemed, sanctified and saved, as himself declares, <hi>Joh. 17. 6, 9. chap.</hi> 10. 14, 15, 16. And on these grounds this mystical Conjunction between Christ and the Church hath its Virtue and Efficacy before it be actually consummate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>foederal Conjunction</hi> between distinct Persons; and as it is various according unto the variety of the Interests and Ends of them that enter into it, so that is most eminent, where one by the common consent of all that are concerned, undertakes to be a <hi>Sponsor</hi> or <hi>Surety</hi> for others, to do and answer what on their part is required of them for attaining the Ends of the Covenant. So did the Lord Christ undertake to be <hi>Surety</hi> of the new Covenant in behalf of the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. and thereon tendered himself unto God to do and suffer for them in their stead, and on their behalf, whatever was required, that they might be sanctified and saved. These things I have treated of at large elsewhere, as containing a great part of the Mystery of the Wisdom of God in the Salvation of the Church. Here therefore I do only observe, that this is that whereby the <hi>mystical Conjunction</hi> that was between Christ and the Church, whereon it was <hi>meet, just</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> in the sight of God, that what he did and suffered should be imputed unto us is compleated.</p>
            <p>These are some of the Foundations of that <hi>Mystery of transmitting the Sins of the Church,</hi> as unto the Guilt and Punishment of them, from the Sinners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto another every way innocent, pure, and righteous in himself, which is the Life, Soul and Center of all Scripture-Revelations: And herein is he exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>glorious</hi> and precious unto them that believe: No Heart can conceive, no Tongue can express the Glory of Christ herein. Now because his infinite Condescension and Love herein have been spoken to before, I shall here only instance its Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in some of its Effects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It shines forth in the <hi>Exaltation of the Righteousness of God in the forgiveness of Sins:</hi> There is no more adequate Conception of the Divine Nature, than that of <hi>Justice</hi> in Rule and Government. Hereunto it belongs to punish Sin according unto its desert; and herein consisteth the first Actings of God as the Governor of the Rational Creation; they did so in the eternal Punishment of the <hi>Angels</hi> that sinned, and the casting of <hi>Adam</hi> out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> an Emblem also of everlasting Ruin. Now all the Church, all the Elect of God are Sinners, they were so in <hi>Adam,</hi> they have been and are so in themselves. What doth become the Justice of God to do thereon? Shall it dismiss them all unpunished? Where then is that Justice which <hi>spared not the Angels</hi> who sinned, nor <hi>Adam</hi> at the first? Would this Procedure have any Consonancy thereunto, be reconcileable unto it? Wherefore the establishment of the Righteousness of God on the one hand, and the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sin on the other, seem so contradictory, as that many stumble and fall at it eternally; see <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>But in this Interposition of Christ in this <hi>translation</hi> of Punishment from the Church unto him by virtue of his Conjunction therewith, there is a blessed Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between the Righteousness of God, and the Forgiveness of Sins, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification whereof is his eternal Glory. O <hi>blessed Change!</hi> O <hi>sweet Permuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</hi> as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> speaks.</p>
            <p>By virtue of his Union with the Church, which of his own accord he entered into, and his undertaking therein to answer for it in, the sight of God, it was a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94224:68"/>
righteous thing with God to lay the <hi>Punishment of all our Sins upon him,</hi> so as that he might freely and graciously pardon them all, to the Honour and Exaltation of his Justice, as well as of his Grace and Mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Herein is he <hi>glorious</hi> in the sight of God, Angels and Men: In him there is at the same time, in the same Divine Actings, a glorious Resplendency of <hi>Justice and Mercy;</hi> of the one in punishing, of the other in pardoning. The appearing Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency between the Righteousness of God and the Salvation of Sinners, wherewith the Consciences of convinced Persons are exercised and terrified, and which is the Rock at which most of them split themselves into eternal Ruin, is herein removed and taken away. In his Cross were Divine Holiness and vindictive Justice exercised and manifested; and through his Triumph, Grace and Mercy are exerted to the utmost. This is that Glory which ravisheth the Hearts, and satiates the Souls of them that believe; for what can they desire more, what is farther needful unto the rest and composure of their Souls, than at one view to behold God eternally well pleased in the declaration of his Righteousness, and the exercise of his Mercy, in order unto their Salvation? In due apprehensions hereof let my Soul live, in the Faith hereof let me die, and let the present Admiration of this Glory make way for the eternal Enjoyment of it in its Beauty and Fulness.</p>
            <p>He is <hi>glorious</hi> in that the <hi>Law</hi> of God in its <hi>preceptive part,</hi> or as unto the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which it required, was perfectly fulfilled and accomplished: That it should be so, was absolutely necessary from the Wisdom, Holiness and Righteousness of him by whom it was given; for what could be more remote from those Divine Perfections than to give a Law, which never was to be fulfilled in them unto whom it was given, and who were to have the advantages of it? This could not be done by us; but through the Obedience of Christ, by virtue of his <hi>mystical Conjunction</hi> with the Church, the Law was so fulfilled in us by being fulfilled for us, as that the Glory of God in the giving of it, and annexing eternal Rewards unto it, is exceedingly exalted, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>This is that Glory of Christ whereof onè view by Faith will scatter all the Fears, answer all the Objections, and give Relief against all the Despondencies of poor tempted doubting Souls; and an <hi>Anchor</hi> it will be unto all Believers, which they may cast within the Vail to hold them firm and stedfast in all Trials, Storms, and Temptations in Life and Death. <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>of the Glory of Christ,</hi> chap. 9.</p>

                           <p>THE New Testament makes up the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Law and Prophets fully, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Thus Christ is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ours by Imputation. This the same Apostle doth excellently demonstrate and conclude, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94224:69"/>
where having spoken of our Reconciliation with God by Jesus Christ, which Reconciliation standeth in the not imputing of our Sins unto us, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. he adds that reason, <hi>ver. 21. For he hath made him to be Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</hi> Now how are we made the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God in Christ? by any inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in us, altho de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Merit of Christ's Righteousness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in the Popish sense? Surely we are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise made the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in Christ, than as Christ was made Sin for us. How is that? Was Christ made Sin for us by having our Sins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in him, or infused into him? God forbid; for he knew no Sin. But if Sin had been inherent in him, or infused into him, he had known Sin; yet he was made Sin for us; that is, by the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our Sin. Note here also, Christ is not said here <hi>simply</hi> to be Sin for us: But to be <hi>made</hi> Sin for us, and that we <hi>simply</hi> are not, but are <hi>made</hi> the Righteousness of God in him, implying a Passiveness in both, both of Christ <hi>made</hi> Sin, and of us <hi>made</hi> Righteousness: <hi>made,</hi> that is, not of or in our selves, but extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94224:69"/>
from without, from another. As therefore our Sins being imputed to Christ, made him become Sin for us; even so are we <hi>made</hi> the Righteousness of God in him: that is, by the <hi>Imputation</hi> of his Righteousness; which Righteousness of Christ imputed to us, is no more inherent in us to our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, than our Sin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Christ was inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in him to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.—This is such an unmoveable Rock of Truth, as the Gates of Hell can never prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. Here all Popish Arguments are put to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; no Romish Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, or School-subtilty can invent any Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or seeming Reason, to oppose this clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Truth.</p>
                           <p>But perhaps they will find some Gloss upon this Scripture, that shall make another sense of it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they want not their Glosses. But <hi>mala glossa, quae corrumpit textum.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ordinary Gloss upon these words, <hi>He was made Sin for us,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands by Sin either the Sacrifice of Sin, according to the Hebrew Phrase in the Old Testament, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 8. or else the similitude of sinful Flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. so the Gloss is uncertain, it pitcheth upon no sense. But the Scripture hath one prime and proper sense.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94224:70"/>
Now that the Apostle should not <hi>simply</hi> mean by Sin, the Sacrifice of Sin, as being an obscure He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Phrase, is more than probable, because he writes this Epistle not to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, to whom writing, his Epistle is full of legal Types and Terms, a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which they well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; but to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> who were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms. But the main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the Apostle can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mean here by Sin barely the Sacrifice of Sin, is in regard of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, or relative Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition here between Sin and Righteousness; for Sin and Righteousness stand here as Terms oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site one to the other: look therefore how Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is here understood, namely, properly, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to Sin; so Sin is to be understood properly, as opposite to Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Christ then was so made Sin for us, as we are made the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in him; and we are so made the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God in him, as he was made Sin for us.</p>
                           <p>Again, Christ who knew no Sin, was made Sin for us; so are we made the Righteousness of God in him, even we who knew no Righteousness, that is, who had no Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our own; but, as the Apostle elegantly saith,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94224:70"/>
were, while in the state of Sin, free from Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 20. Christ therefore was so made Sin for us, as that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, yea judged as a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. saith, <hi>He was numbred with the Transgressors, and he bare the Sin of many.</hi> Now that Christ is said to be <hi>made Sin</hi> in the Abstract, and we to be <hi>made Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> in the Abstract, not righteous in the Concrete, as Logicians speak, <hi>Lyra</hi> saith, <hi>Ideo in abstracto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur justi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Is there no more difference

tween, Do this, and live; and, Believe, and live? between Mens own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and God's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, the establishing of the one being the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of the other? Nor is it to purpose, that these Babylonians alledg, that they ascribe their inherent Righteousness to God, as the Author of it, and by whom it is infused into them. <hi>Adam</hi> in his purest Naturals could say no less, but that all his inherent Righteousness was the Gift of God; for what had he that he had not received? Therefore the main point of difference between the Righteousness of the first Covenant, and of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, is in this, That the one was inherent, and within a Man, and the other imputed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Man: Otherwise what real difference can be imagined to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them? the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence chiefly consisting in a direct Opposition. <hi>Mr.</hi> Burton's <hi>Bulwark,</hi> p. 65, 66, 67, 68, 82, 83.</p>

The Apostle gives two excellent Reasons why our Justification should be of Faith rather than of any other Grace. The first on God's part, that <hi>it might be of Grace.</hi> The second on the part of the Promise, <hi>that the Promise might be sure to all the Seed,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. First, Justification that is by Faith, is of meer Grace and Favour, no way of Work or Merit; for the Act whereby Faith justifies, is an Act of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and self-dereliction, a holy despair of any thing in our selves, and a going to Christ, a receiving and looking towards him and his All-sufficiency: so that as <hi>Mary</hi> said of her self, so we may say of Faith, <hi>The Lord hath respect unto the lowliness of his Grace,</hi> which is so far from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inward for matter of Justification, that it self as it is a Work of the Heart, to <hi>credere</hi> doth not justify, but only as it is <hi>an apprehension or taking hold of Christ:</hi> for as the hand in the very receiving of a thing must needs make it self empty (if it be full before, it must let all that go ere it can take hold on any other thing) so Faith being received of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. must needs sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose an emptiness in the Soul before; Faith hath two Properties (as a Hand) <hi>to work,</hi> and <hi>to receive;</hi> when Faith purifies the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94224:72"/>
Heart, supports the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirits, worketh by Love, carries a Man through Afflictions, and the like, these are the Works of Faith: when Faith accepts of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in Christ, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him as the Gift of his Father's Love; when it embraces the Promises afar off, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. and lays hold on eternal Life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12. this is the <hi>receiving Act of Faith.</hi> Now Faith justifies not by working (lest the Effect should not be wholly of Grace, but partly of Grace, and partly of Work, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9. but by bare receiving, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting or yielding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to that Righteousness which in regard of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was the Righteousness of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. and in regard of disposing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, appropriating un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, was the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, <hi>Rom. 3. 21. 1. Cor. 1. 30. Phil.</hi> 3. 9.—They say we are justified by Grace, and yet by Works, because Grace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables to work; we say we are justified freely, not by the Works of Grace, but by the Grace which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows our Justification, and therewith our strength of working unto us: for surely God's free Grace is more magnified in giving us undeservedly both Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Works, than in giving us Works to

serve our Righteousness. <hi>Dr.</hi> Reynold'<hi>s Life of Christ,</hi> p. 481, 482, 483.</p>
                           <p>What is Justification? <hi>Answ.</hi> Justification is the Sentence of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he of his Grace for the Righteousness of his Son, by him imputed unto us, and through Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by us, doth free us from Sin and Death, and account us righteous unto Life, <hi>Rom. 8. 30, 33, 34. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Phil.</hi> 3. 9. for hereby we both have a deliverance from the Guilt and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of all our Sins, and being accounted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the sight of God by the Righteousness of our Saviour Christ impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us, are restored to a better Righteousness than ever we had in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I perceive your Answer needs further explaining. First, Why call you Justification a Sentence? <hi>Answ.</hi> That thereby we may be informed, that the word to justify doth not in this place signify to make just by infusing a perfect Righteousness into our Natures; (that comes under the head of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication begun here in this Life, which being finished, is Glorification in Heaven) but here the word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to pronounce just, to quit and discharge from Guilt and Punishment, and so it is a judicial Sentence
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94224:73"/>
opposed to Condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34, 35. Now as to condemn is not the putting any evil into the Nature of the Party condemned, but the pronouncing of his Person guilty, and the binding him over unto Punishment; so justifying is the Judges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Law to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the Man discharged and quitted from Guilt and Judgment. Thus God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the Righteousness of Christ to a Sinner, doth not account his Sin unto him, but interests him in a state of as full and perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and acceptance, as if he had never sinned, or had himself fully satisfied: for tho there is a Power pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Corruption of Sin, which followeth upon Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, yet it is carefully to be distinguished from it.—This for the name of Justification, but now for the thing it self.</p>
                           <p>What is the Matter first of our Justification?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> The Matter of Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, or that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness whereby a Sinner stands justified in God's sight, is not any Righteousness inherent in his own Person, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteousness inherent in Christ, and performed for him.</p>
                           <p>What Righteousness of Christ is it whereby a Sinner is justified?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> Not the essential Righteousness of his Divine Nature; but, 1. The absolute
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94224:74"/>
Integrity of our Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which in him our Head was <hi>without Guile,</hi> Heb. 7. 26. 2. The perfect Obedience which in that Human Nature of ours he performed unto the whole Law of God, both by doing whatsoever was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15. and by suffering whatsoever was deserved by our Sins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. for he was made Sin and a Curse for us, that we might be made the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God in him.</p>
                           <p>What is the form or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cause of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that which makes this Righteousness so really ours, that it doth justify us? <hi>Answ.</hi> The gracious Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God the Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting his Son's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto the Sinner, and by that accounting making it his to all Effects, as if he himself had performed it.</p>
                           <p>But how can Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness be accounted ours? Is it not as absurd to say that we are justified by Christ's Righteousness, as that a Man should be wise with the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of another, or live and be in health by the Life and Health of another?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> No doubtless, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Righteousness is in Christ, not as in a Person severed from us, but as in the Head of the Church, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom therefore it is communicated unto all; who being united as Members unto him do lay claim thereto, and apply it unto themselves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94224:74"/>
                              <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 4. For if the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> were of force to condemn us all, because we were in his Loins, he being the Head of our common Nature, Why then should it seem strange that the Righteousness of our Saviour Christ, both God and Man, should be available to justify those that are interested in him; especially considering that we have a more strict Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in the Spirit with him, than ever we had in Nature with <hi>Adam?</hi> And tho it be not fit to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure heavenly things by the Yard of Reason, yet it is not unreasonable that a Man owing a thousand Pound, and not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pay it, his Creditor may be satisfied by one of his Friends.</p>
                           <p>If Christ have paid our Debt, how then are we freely justified by Grace? <hi>Answ.</hi> It is of Grace that Christ is given unto us, and also that his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness apprehended by Faith is accounted ours: It is true, that the Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Sinner, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the case as it is between the Father and Christ, no Man dare call it free; no, the Price of our Redemption was the deepest Purchase that the World ever heard of; but whatever it cost Christ, it cost us nothing: and so to us it is freely of Grace from Christ; yea and to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94224:75"/>
us it is freely Grace from God the Father too, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he acquits us without a full Satisfaction to his Justice, or accepts that for perfect Righteousness which is not perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; but because he receives full Satisfaction from the hands of a Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that Surety being his own Son; whenas he might have challenged the uttermost farthing at our hands, which were the Principals, and then there had been no possibility for us to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>
                           <p>What gather you from this Doctrine of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. To condemn the proud Opinion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who seek Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by their own Works and Righteousness inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in themselves; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as tho being accepted, we must in thankfulness do all we can for God, yet when all is done, we must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg our selves unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants: the only mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our joy and triumph both in Life and Death, must be the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness; not our Persons, nor the best Actions of the holiest Men dare appear in God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, but in his Name and Merit (who consecrates all) the Lord Jesus.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. We may here take notice, that there is no
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94224:75"/>
Comfort to a Christian Soul like that which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from this Well of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, this sweet Doctrine of Justification. 1. Here we have assurance of the sufficiency of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that Soul must be throughly acquitted that is stated in such a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, that Debt must be fully discharged that hath such a Price laid down for it; our Sins tho never so great, cannot weigh down his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Merit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. and God having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his Son's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness for us, will not hold us any longer Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passers, but he disables his own Justice from making any further demand. 2. Hence there is nothing comes upon the Saints from God's revenging Justice, but all our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are medicinal from God's fatherly Love; to purge out that Sin out of our Nature, which he hath already pardoned to our Persons. 3. Lastly, this Doctrine may be great Comfort to weak Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the midst of their troublesome Imperfections, and sense of their weak measures of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: To consider that the Righteousness that is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in themselves, is not the matter of their Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or that which must appear before God's Presence to be pleaded:
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94224:76"/>
the Righteousness of Christ is compleat and perfect; that is our main Joy and Crown of rejoicing to be found in Christ, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but that which is in him, and made ours by God's gracious account.</p>
                           <p>But how is this great Benefit of Justification ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto us, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by us?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> This is done on our part by Faith alone, and that not considered as a Virtue inherent in us, working by Love, but only as an Instrument or Hand of the Soul stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth to lay hold on the Lord our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. chap. 10. 10. Jer.</hi> 23. 6. so that Faith justifieth only relatively in respect of the Object which it fasteneth on, to wit, the Righteousness of Christ by which we are justified: Faith being only the Instrument to convey so great a Benefit unto the Soul, as the Hand of the Beggar receives the Alms.</p>
                           <p>How doth Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion differ from the former Grace of Justification?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> In many main and material Differences: As, 1. In the order, not of Time wherein they go together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. nor of Knowledg and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, wherein this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath precedency, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. but of Nature, wherein this former is the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94224:76"/>
ground of this latter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. 2. In the Subject, the Righteousness whereby we are justified being inherent in Christ for us, but this of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in our selves from him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. 3. In the Cause; our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion following from the Merit, our Sanctification from the Efficacy of the Death and Life of Christ. 4. In the Instrument, Faith, which in Justification is only as a Hand receiving, in Sanctification is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working Virtue, <hi>Acts 15. 19. Gal.</hi> 5. 6. 5. In the measure; Justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all Believers at all times alike, but Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation wrought differently and by degrees. 6. In the end; which being in both eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23, 24. yet the one is among the causes of reigning, the other only as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way unto the Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>But when our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation here begun shall be perfected in the World to come, shall we not then be justified by an inherent Righteousness? <hi>Ans.</hi> No, but by the imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of our Saviour Christ, which being once given us, is never taken away from us. <hi>Thus ends this holy Man of God, Dr.</hi> Usher <hi>in his Body of Divinity,</hi> p. 193, 194, 195, 196, 202, 339.</p>
                           <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> searcheth the Causes of Justification,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94224:77"/>
St. <hi>James</hi> seeks the Effects, by which it may be found and proved: <hi>Paul</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Justification before God, <hi>James</hi> of that which is before Men.—The thing for which they be justified, cannot be their own inherent Justice, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. for <hi>habitual Righteousness,</hi> or inherent Justice, it is a work of the Law, and sticketh in the justified Person: But what so sticketh, and is inherent, cannot be said to be imputed, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of something without, and which we have not in us—Such as be justified by infused Justice, of them it cannot be affirmed that their Sins are <hi>covered,</hi> forgiven, and not imputed: for habitual Justice expelleth and takes away all Sin, and <hi>hideth</hi> it not; whereas a wicked Man is justified by hiding and remitting his Sins. Add to this, that inherent Justice is all one with Sanctification, which may be confounded with Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.—Justification before God is not known in all Scripture to be used for the infusion of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Justice into the Souls of the Elect at their first Conversion, of unjust to make them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually just. This is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and rotten Divinity, which will have Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be understood of, and to signify inherent
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94224:77"/>
Justice, as Sanctification signifies inherent Sanctity.—Sanctification is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily joined unto Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as yet it is a Grace diverse from the Grace of Justification. 1. Justification is an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of a Sinner from the Guilt of Sin and Death; whereas Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is an alteration of Qualities from evil to good. 2. Justification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in remission of Sins, and imputation of Justice for the Obedience of Christ; Sanctification is a Renovation of Nature. 3. Justification is perfect in this Life, so is not Sanctification. 4. Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is in nature before Sanctification, but not in order of time. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Purity of Christ's Human Nature is reckoned unto Believers by free Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Faith, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. Christ is made unto us Sanctification:</hi> This is Sanctification imputed. <hi>Mr.</hi> Wilson'<hi>s Christian Dictionary.</hi>

But the Question stands still in what manner <hi>God</hi> makes a Sinner just; whom he in Judgment pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth so to be: They say by bestowing on him the Grace of <hi>Sanctification and perfect Righteousness,</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in his own Person: We affirm, that it is by imputing unto him the <hi>perfect Righteousness of Christ,</hi> accepting Christ's Obedience for him.—Wherefore, whereas the Popish Doctors fall foul on our Reformed Writers, charging <hi>Calvin</hi> and others for denying all inherent Righteousness in Believers, and maintaining only an imputed Righteousness without them: We tell them 'tis a gross Calumny forged by perverse Minds, that list not to understand Mens plainest Writings: Nor <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor any that ever maintained the Truth with him, ever denied the <hi>Righteousness of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But this he holds, and we also with the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94224:78"/>
Scriptures, that the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness which justifies us in God's Judgment is not in our selves, but all in Christ.—That altho by the Grace of Sanctification in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, God do make him righteous and holy in some measure, that was before altogether unholy and wicked: Nevertheless we affirm, that by and for this Holiness the best of Saints living never were nor shall be justified in God's sight, that is, pronounced just and innocent before the Tribunal of his Justice.—The second Error about this Point is of the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> with whom also the Papists agree.—'Tis this, That we are justified by Faith <hi>sensu proprio;</hi> that is, the Act of believing, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>Whereas our Adversaries say, that Faith of its own dignity and desert, doth not obtain this Favour of God, to be esteemed for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteousness of the Moral Law; but this comes to pass only by the Merits of Christ, who hath procured this Grace unto us, that God should thus accept our Faith. We answer, that this is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, but 'tis not proved.</p>
                           <p>They speak a little more favourable than the <hi>Romanists,</hi> who make Faith it self to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Justification; these will have it not to merit it, but to be graciously accepted for Righteousness.—The word <hi>Justification</hi> may be taken either, 1. <hi>For the absolution of a Sinner in God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. For the declaration of a Man's Righteousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men.</hi> This distinction is certain, and hath its ground in Scripture, which useth the word <hi>justify</hi> in both accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the quitting of us in <hi>God's</hi> sight, and for the manifestation of our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency before Men against ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation or suspicion of Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness. They apply this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction for the reconciling the two <hi>Apostles:</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of <hi>Justification (in foro Dei)</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> of Justification <hi>(in foro hominis.) A Man is justified by Faith without Works,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> that is, in God's sight, a Man
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94224:80"/>
obtains <hi>Remission of Sins,</hi> and is reputed just only for his <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> not for his Works sake. <hi>A Man is justified by Works, and not by Faith only,</hi> saith St. <hi>James;</hi> that is, in Mens sight we are declared to be just by our good Works, not by our Faith only: which with other inward and invisible Graces, are made visible unto Man only in the good Works which they see us perform. <hi>Mr.</hi> Pemble <hi>of Justification,</hi> p. 17, 18, 19, 33, 34, 35, 40, 41, 192, 193.</p>
                           <p>To this we are exhorted (viz. <hi>Sanctification)</hi> as a sound <hi>Effect</hi> of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom. 6. 19, 22. 2 Cor. 7. 1. 1 Thess. 4. 4, 7. 2 Thess. 3. 13. 1 Tim. 2. 15. 1 Pet. 1. 2.

True is the Distinction therefore even of the School-men themselves: Christ doth justify a Man <hi>effectivè,</hi> effectually by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Justification: Faith doth justify a Man <hi>apprehèn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivè,</hi> apprehendingly, because it taketh hold of Christ, who is our Justifier: and Works do justify also, but <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rativè,</hi> declaringly, because

And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Faith it is impossible to please God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. how should our Repentance be acceptable to God, unless it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Faith?

Repentance, which we deny not, by true Repentance and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruits of Justification, to be strengthened and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased; as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith of Patience, It both goeth before Faith, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.—That Grace whereby we are justified, and made acceptable before God, is not a Quality inherent or dwelling in us, but we are
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94224:83"/>
made just by the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Righteousness of Christ: That Righteousness which is in us is imperfect, and not able to justify us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>He hath made him to be Sin for us that knew no Sin, that we should be made the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God in him, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 21. Out of this place this Argument may be drawn: As our Sins are made Christ's, so is his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness made ours; but our Sins are not habitually inherent in him, but only imputed: <hi>Ergo,</hi> his Righteousness, and the Grace whereby we are justified, is not inherent in us, but imputed only.</p>

If we are justified by Faith only, then this justifying Grace is by Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation only, not inherent in us; but Faith only justifieth; <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Proposition is thus proved: Faith justifieth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formally and actually as a Quality inherent, or instrumentally, or passively, as it apprehendeth the Justice of Christ; but it doth not justify as it is a Quality or Grace wrought in us; for the Apostle saith, <hi>not of Works:</hi> Therefore Faith as a Work in us justifieth not; for then other spiritual Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as Love, Hope, should justify as well as Faith. If Faith then only justify in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally, as it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth Christ, then doth the Proposition follow, that the Grace whereby we are
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94224:84"/>
justified is not inherent in us, but in Christ apprehended.</p>
                              <p>—<hi>Distinct.</hi> 51. When we object that place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> against the Popish Doctrine of Merits, <hi>We are justified freely by Grace,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. They answer by a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there are two Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the first, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Grace, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, wherein we proceed daily by good Works. <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist. Annot. Sect. 3. Contra.</hi> The Scripture speaketh but of one Justification, which Glorification followeth, <hi>Rom. 8. 30. Whom he justified; them also he glorified.</hi> If then this one Justification do bring us to Glorification, what need a second?</p>
                              <p>Again, their second Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is nothing else but that which the Scripture calleth Sanctification, which issueth out from Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Fruits thereof: but Christ is both our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Sanctification, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. Ergo,</hi> He is both our first and second Justification, and so both are of Grace. Hear what one of the Popes hath confessed of this matter.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Qui Christum,</hi> &amp;c. he that hath Christ by Faith, hath the Foundation, beside which none other can be laid, and upon this Foundation he may build wholesom Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is then but one Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, because there is but one Foundation by Faith; that which followeth is not another Justification, but a

building upon by good Works.</p>

                                 <hi>Distinct.</hi> 52. There is Justice imputative, when the Righteousness of Christ is imputed unto us, and made ours by Faith: Justice inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent is that Justice that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abideth in us; by this we are justified and truly made just, not by the other. <hi>Rhem.

                              <p>But that Justice whereby we are just before God, not falsly accounted, but made truly just, is by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              <p>We do contrarily hold, that the material cause of Man's Justification, is the Obedience of Christ in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and fulfilling the Law for us; but as for the formal Cause that must needs be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, which is an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God the Father ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Obedience of Christ for us, as if it were our own. <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Look by what we are absolved from all our Sins, and by which we obtain eternal Life, by that alone we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: But by Christ's perfect Obedience imputed unto us we are absolved from all our Sins, and through it we are accepted of God to eternal Life, the which we cannot do by inherent Holiness: Therefore by Christ's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience imputed unto us we are alone justified. This will appear to be true in the exercises of Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on God's Name, and also of Repentance: for in Temptation and Conflicts with Sin and Satan, Faith doth not reason thus; Now I have Charity and inherent Grace, and for these God will accept of me: But Faith doth more rightly behold the Son of God, as he was made a Sacrifice for us, and sitteth at the Right-hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there making Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94224:86"/>
for us: To him I say doth Faith fly, and is assured that for this his Son, God will forgive us all our Sins, and will also be reconciled unto us, yea and account us just in his sight, not by any Quality inherent in us, but rather by the Merit of Jesus Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. 2. As Christ is made a Sinner, so by proportion such as believe are made Just: But Christ was by Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only made and accounted a Sinner for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. for he became a Surety for us, and a Sacrifice for our Sins, upon which all both the Guiltiness of God's Wrath, and Punishment for us was to be laid. Hence it is that he is said to become (<gap reason="foreign">
                                    <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                 </gap>) a <hi>Curse</hi> for us, therefore we again are made just only by Imputation. 3. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Condemnation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins, and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is the opposite of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. <hi>Rom. 8. 33. It is God that justifieth, who shall condemn?</hi> Therefore Justification is the remission of Sin; now remission of Sins dependeth only upon this Imputation of Christ's Merits. 4. Albeit infused and inherent Justice may have its due place, it's Praise, and also Deserts, yet as it is a Work of the Holy Ghost, it is not in this Life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and by reason of the Flesh whereunto it is united, it is both imperfect, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the dregs of Sin,

                                 <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. Therefore before God's Judgment-seat it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not claim this Prerogative, to absolve any from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation.</p>

                              <p>That Popish Device of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Justification, is a fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Delusion. For, 1. The Word of God doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg no more but one Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at all, and that absolute and compleat of it self. There is but one Justice, but one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of God being offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore there cannot be a manifold Justification. 2. If by reason of the increase of inherent Justice, Justification should be distinguished into several kinds or parts, we might as well make an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred kinds or parts of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, as two. 3. That which by order of Nature doth follow after full Justification before God, it cannot be said to justify: But good Works do by order of Nature follow Man's Justification, and his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution from Sin; because no Work can please God except the Person it self that worketh the same do before please him. But no Man's Person can please God, but such a one as being reconciled to God by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ, hath Peace with
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94224:87"/>
him. 4. Such Works as are not agreeable to the Rule of legal Justice; they, before the Tribunal Seat of God cannot justify, but rather both in and of themselves, are subject to God's eternal Curse. <hi>Mr.</hi> Perk. <hi>Golden Chain,</hi> p. 156, 167, 158.</p>
                              <p>That which the Pontificians ascribe to Faith in the work of Justification, is either, that it is a work of Grace, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and disposing a Man to receive the Grace of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or else that it is a Grace concurring with other Graces infused and inherent, as Hope and Charity, and such like, by which jointly a Man comes to be justified: otherwise they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Faith no hand at all in Justification. <hi>Concil. Trid. ses. 5. cap. 8. can.</hi> 9, and 11. If any Man shall say that a Sinner is justified by Faith alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if any Man shall say, that Men are justified either by the only Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, or by the only remission of Sins, excluding Grace and Charity which is shed abroad in their Hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in them; or also that the Grace whereby we are justified is only the Favour of God, let him be <hi>Anathema,</hi> or accursed. <hi>Mr.</hi> Burton's <hi>Christian Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> p. 93, 94.</p>
                              <p>The right distinguishing of things the one from the other, when the nature and due bounds of every word is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, would prove some Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive against Errors and Heresy which commonly arise upon

the ignorance of things while they are shuffled confusedly together, one thing being taken for another; or something being taken to be that it is not.

Whilst some take it to be the making of our selves just, by infusion of Grace in the Hearts of the Elect; others, to be nothing else but a making of our Actions to become just and holy; whereas it is an Absolution of a Sinner from his Guiltiness, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing him righteous before God, when he believes in his Son Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. <bibl>

To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Mr. <hi>Baxt.</hi> As our Sanctification is imperfect, so our, Pardon is yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in <hi>many respects.—</hi>Therefore till our Grace be perfect, we are not perfectly delivered from the penal Fruits of Sin, and therefore not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly justified and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.

your justified state unless you fight and overcome in Mortification, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Perseverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that hath a Title to an Estate, which is held by such a Tenure, and would be lost if he should fail in such Conditions, hath not so perfect a Title, as he that is past all such Conditions. That Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don which is only of Sins past, while there are thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands more hereafter to be pardoned (or else we should yet perish) is not so perfect as that Pardon and Justification in the Conclusion of our Lives, when all Sin that ever will be committed is forgiven absolutely. The <hi>kind</hi> of our present Justification is imperfect, it being but in Covenant-Title, and some part of <hi>Execution,</hi> the full and perfect <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> and <hi>Execution</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I leave them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to say <hi>[Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness imputed to us is perfect, therefore we are as perfectly just and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as Christ]</hi> who know not what <hi>Imputation</hi> here is, nor that Christ's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Righteousness is not given to us as Proprietors, in <hi>it self,</hi> but in the <hi>Effects;</hi> and who know not the difference between <hi>believing</hi> and blaspheming, and making our selves as so many Christs to our selves; and that know not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94224:70"/>
what need they have of Christ, or of Faith, or Prayer, or of any holy Endeavour for any more Pardon and Righteousness, or Justification, than they have already: or who think that <hi>David</hi> in his Adultery and Murder was as perfectly pardoned and justified as he will be in Heaven at last: And in a word, who know not the difference between Earth and Heaven. (But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us a <hi>14th</hi> Error) <hi>That the continuance of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication needs no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to be by us perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, than the continuance of that Faith on which it was begun.

or his <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is <hi>imputed</hi> to us; and yet we justly defend it, as is before explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi> and <hi>Grotius de Satisfact.</hi> have explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture often saith, <hi>that Faith is imputed for Righteousness,</hi> and shall be so to all that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christ</hi> (Rom. 4.) And this these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors peremptorily deny. But expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture amiss, is a much cleanlier pretence for Error than a <hi>flat denial</hi> of its Truth: And a true Exposition is better than either.—We can lay no Claim to this Righteousness of Christ, till we first prove that we are our selves inherently righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, against the charge of <hi>being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Unbelievers.</hi> This <hi>false Accusation</hi> we must be justified against by our own <hi>Faith</hi> and Repentance, that we may be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Christ against the <hi>true Accusation</hi> of <hi>sinning</hi> against the <hi>Law,</hi> and thereby being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable by it.

it is <hi>[only the Merits of Christ given to us in its fruits in the new Covenant,</hi> even the <hi>Merits of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Sacrifice.]</hi> But our <hi>Faith</hi> it self is the <hi>other Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which must be found in our Persons to entitle us to <hi>this</hi> first: And this being it, and being all (in the sense aforesaid) that is made the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Pardon by the new Covenant; therefore God is said to <hi>impute it it self</hi> to us for <hi>a Righteousness,</hi> because that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion maketh it so; and to impute it <hi>to us</hi> for <hi>our Righteousness,</hi> that is, as all that now by this Covenant he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to be perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally done by us, who had formerly been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a harder Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even the fulfilling of the Law by Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, or suffering for Sin; because he that doth not <hi>fulfil</hi> nor <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy,</hi> as is said, yet if he <hi>believe,</hi> hath a right to the Justification merited by Christ who did <hi>fulfil</hi> and <hi>satisfy.</hi> This is easy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as undoubted Truth by the <hi>willing,</hi> and the rest will be most contentious, where they are most erronious. <hi>Error</hi> 37.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94224:79"/>
are no Sins, so his Righteousness is not instead of that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which by his Grace <hi>we have,</hi> but instead of that which we <hi>have not;</hi> not instead of our being <hi>penitent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before we die,</hi> but instead of that perfect Innocency which we want; not that we are reputed <hi>perfect innocent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyers,</hi> because he was such, but that our want of it shall not hinder our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Grace or Glory. Christ hath done all his part, but he hath appointed <hi>(lest his part should fail, and he come off with loss and shame)</hi> us a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary part which must be done by our selves.</p>
                           <p>What is it to be judged according to our Works, or what we have done in the Body?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> To be <hi>judged</hi> is the <hi>genus;</hi> to be <hi>judged</hi> or <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> are the <hi>species:</hi> This openeth all the Controversy. It is not <hi>according to our Works</hi> as they are congruous to the Law of <hi>Innocency</hi> or <hi>Works,</hi> but as justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94224:80"/>
by the <hi>Law of Grace:</hi> Therefore it is not the <hi>same</hi> Works which <hi>Paul</hi> excluded from Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, for we shall not be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them. 2. And <hi>according to them,</hi> is as much as <hi>James</hi> meaneth, when he saith, <hi>we are justified by them.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It's all one, that is, the Law of Christ our Redeemer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth sincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of all that shall be saved by his Blood and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law of Innocency; and accordingly Mens right to Christ and Salvation shall be judged of.</p>
                           <p>Their right to Life through Christ's Merits and free Gift shall be justified, who were sincerely penitent believing Obeyers to the end, and no others.—<hi>What is</hi> Paul'<hi>s drift in all his Disputes about Justification? Answ.</hi> 1. Primarily, to prove the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Saviour's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Intercession to save and justify us, and that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, how excellent soever
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94224:80"/>
esteemed by the Jews, would not jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify without him. 2. To prove that the Gentiles may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law, as well as the Jews by Faith with it: and that it bindeth not the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the Jews, and that the Law of Christ succeedeth it. He confuteth their trusting to the keeping of their Law instead of Christ's Righteousness, and the promise of Grace, and their obtruding their Law upon the Gentiles as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation.—<hi>What is the drift of St.</hi> James? That bare believing the Gospel to be true, will not serve to any Man's Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without obeying Christ's Commands, nor will justify any Man's Title to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or prove him acceptable to God. It is the same Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God (and not only in Conscience or before Men) that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> speak of, and the same instance of <hi>Abraham</hi> they bring, But by <hi>[Works]</hi> they mean not the same thing, as is before
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94224:81"/>
explained.—That which goeth before Pardon (and that as a Condition) go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance goeth before Pardon.—A radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Error is, that the Law of Innocency made to <hi>Adam</hi> is it that justifieth us, by its <hi>fac hoc &amp; vives, as fulfilling it in Christ.—</hi>That Christ did obey and suffer, merit and satisfy, in so full and strict a representing and personating every one of the Elect, as that they did and suffered it in and by Christ, in the sense of the Law of Works, or in God's account: and that it was not in the third Person of a Mediator, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Effects freely as he pleased by another Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And so that God's imputing Righteousness to us, is his accounting us to have done and suffered in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense what Christ did. This is the root of all the rest, subverting the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it self: And so that God <hi>accounteth</hi> us to be <hi>innocent,</hi> and never to have
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94224:81"/>
sinned by Omission or Commission from Birth to Death, and to <hi>have all that is required to merit Heaven,</hi> because <hi>we did it in Christ;</hi> and also to <hi>have suffered in Christ for our Sins,</hi> the Curse <hi>threatned</hi> to us, and (as the last Objector saith) <hi>eternal Damnation equivalently;</hi> and so we had Sin and no Sin: And Christ must die, and we must pray for the pardon of that Sin, which in God's account or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation we never had. When the Text tells us that <hi>[Faith is imputed to us for Righteousness]</hi> and that <hi>[Righteousness is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Believers]</hi> that is <hi>[They are accounted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous according to the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Covenant of Grace, upon their believing in Christ for his meritorious Righteousness and Sacrifice, giving them by the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant their gracious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, with right to further Grace and Glory]</hi> they tell us that <hi>[by Faith]</hi> is <hi>not</hi> meant <hi>[Faith]</hi> but <hi>[Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness]</hi> and by <hi>[Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness imputed to us]</hi> is meant <hi>[God's accounting us to have done all that Righteousness by Christ which he did for us.]</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more such human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, corrupting our Faith (at least in notion) too many fight for, as if they were necessary Truths

In the Preface to this Piece Mr. <hi>Baxt.</hi> tells us, <q>That many worthy Men pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the same Doctrine which I assert, especially Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> of <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friers,</hi> in his Sermon in the Morning Lectures at St. <hi>Giles.—</hi>
                              </q>See what Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> says there, <hi>p.</hi> 389. A Sinner is then actually justified, when he is constituted or made righteous in Law. Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is a Conformity to the Law, is righteous in the eye of the Law; he is <gap reason="foreign">

Now the Law of the new Covenant runs thus, <hi>He that believeth shall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish;</hi> so that a Believer keeps and fulfils this Law, and therefore <hi>Faith</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24. because <hi>Faith</hi> in the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the new Covenant, which therefore is called <hi>the Law of Faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 27. in opposition to the old Covenant, called there by the Apostle <hi>the Law of Works.</hi> As therefore <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, or perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> would have justified <hi>Adam</hi> had he stood by virtue of the Law of Works, or old Covenant,

whose tenor is, <hi>Obey and live,</hi> for then he had fulfilled that Law; and as his <hi>Disobedience</hi> actually condemned him by virtue of the same Law—<hi>Disobey and die for it,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. so now believing in Christ justifieth by virtue of the Law of Faith; for it is the keeping and fulfilling of the Gospel-Covenant, whose tenor is, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.</hi> And again, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief actually condemneth by virtue of the same Law, <hi>He that believeth not is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, because he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God;</hi> Joh. 3. 18. That is, because the Unbeliever is <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>That therefore they that will be justified at last, must <hi>trust in Christ</hi> that redeemed them, and be careful to perform the Conditions of this Law of Grace, and both must concur.

against Justification by Works. But if we will take the Scripture toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not by incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent scraps, the Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is evident. <q>Man is now sinful, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the first Law, and is now under a Law of Grace, that freely giveth Pardon and Life through a Redeemer, to those that <hi>believingly accept the Gift according to its nature, and consent by Repentance to turn to God, and live a holy Life in sincerity.</hi> Now God doth through all the Scripture tell us, That <hi>no one shall pass with God for a just Man, or be saved, that will not do this,</hi> but shall be condemned further for refusing it: And thus he that doth Righteousness is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and all shall be judged according to their Works thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Law of Grace. To deny this, is to deny the scope of the whole Scripture, and the Government of God. But <hi>Paul</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted against those that taught that the Gentiles must be proselyted and keep the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> or else they could not be accounted just Men, nor be saved: And he proveth that

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94224:69"/>
the inherent <hi>Renovation</hi> of our Natures, exerting and acting it self in Newness of Life, or Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in Christ, and Works of Righteousness. But Sanctification and Justification are in the Scripture perpetually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>Causality</hi> the one of them may have to the other: And those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them, as the Papists do, do not so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about the <hi>nature of Justification,</hi> as endeavour to prove that indeed there is no such thing as Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication at all: for that which would serve most to enforce it, namely, the Pardon of Sin, they place it in the exclusion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of it, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of inherent Grace, which doth not belong unto Justification.—By this <hi>inherent personal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> we may be said several ways to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. As; (1.) in our Consciences, in as much as it is an Evidence in us and unto us of our Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Grace of God in Jesus Christ, and of our acceptance with him, which hath no small in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into our Peace: So speaks the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. who yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims any Confidence therein as unto his Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. (2.) Hereby may we be said to be <hi>justified
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94224:69"/>
before Men;</hi> that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted of Evils laid unto our charge, and approved as righteous and unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.—(3.) This Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is pleadable unto our Justification against all the <hi>Charges</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> who is the greatest Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of the Brethren, of all that believe, whether he manage his Charge privately in the <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> which is as it were before God, as he charged <hi>Job,</hi> or by his Instruments in all manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Calumnies, whereof some in this Age have had Exprience in an eminent manner, this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is pleadable unto our Justification. On a supposition of these things wherein our personal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is allowed its proper place and use, I do not understand that there is an <hi>Evangelical Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> whereby Believers are by and on the account of this personal inherent Righteousness justified in the sight of God; nor doth the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ unto our absolute Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before him depend thereon. For, 1. None have this <hi>personal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> but they are <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently</hi> justified in the sight of God. It is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Obedience of Faith proceeding from true and saving Faith in God by Jesus Christ: for as it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94224:70"/>
was said before, <hi>Works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith,</hi> are as by general consent excluded from any Interest in our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and we have proved that they are neither <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of it, Dispositions unto it, nor Preparations for it, properly so called. But every true Believer is immediately justified on his believing: Nor is there any moment of time wherein a Man is a true Believer, according as Faith is required in the Gospel, and yet not be justified.—Wherefore this <hi>personal Righteousness</hi> cannot be the Condition of our Justification before God, seeing it is <hi>consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> thereunto.—<hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before God</hi> is a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and absolution from a <hi>Charge before God,</hi> at least it is contained therein. And the Instrument of this Charge must either be the <hi>Law</hi> or the <hi>Gospel:</hi> But neither the <hi>Law</hi> nor the <hi>Gospel</hi> do before God, or in the sight of God, charge true Believers with Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, Hypocrisy, or the like: For <hi>who shall lay any thing unto the charge of God's Elect,</hi> who are once justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before him? Such a Charge may be laid against them by Satan, by the Church sometimes on mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, by the World, as it was in the case of <hi>Job,</hi> against which this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is pleadable. But what is charged imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94224:70"/>
before God, is charged by God himself, either by the Law or the Gospel, and the Judgment of God is according unto Truth. If this Charge be by the <hi>Law,</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi> we must be justified: But the Plea of <hi>sincere Obedience</hi> will not justify us by the Law; that admits of none in Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction unto its Demands, but that which is compleat and perfect. And where the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel lays any thing unto the charge of any Persons before God, there can be no Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before God, unless we shall allow the Gospel to be the Instrument of a <hi>false Charge:</hi> For what should justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him whom the Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns? And if it be a Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the Gospel from the Charge of the Law, it renders the Death of Christ of no effect: And a Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without a Charge is not to be supposed.—Such a Justification as that pretended is altogether <hi>needless</hi> and <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi> This may easily be evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from what the Scripture asserts unto our Justification in the sight of God by Faith in the Blood of Christ.—Let that be considered, and it will quickly appear that there is no place nor use for this new Justification upon our perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteousness, whether it be supposed <hi>antecedent</hi> and <hi>subordinate</hi> thereunto, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequential and perfective there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This pretended <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Justification</hi> hath not the nature of any Justification that is mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94224:71"/>
that is, neither that by the Law, nor that provided in the Gospel. Justification by the Law is this, <hi>The Man that doth the Works of it shall live in them:</hi> And as unto <hi>Evangelical Justification,</hi> it is every way contrary unto it: for herein the <hi>Charge</hi> against the Person to be justified is true, namely, that he had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and is come short of the Glory of God. In this it is <hi>false,</hi> namely, that a Believer is an Unbeliever; a sincere Person, an Hypocrite; one <hi>fruitful in good Works,</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether barren. And this <hi>false</hi> Charge is supposed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the Name of God, and before him; our Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in true <hi>Evangelical Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> is by <hi>Absolution,</hi> or Pardon of Sin, here by a <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of our own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> There the Plea of the Person to be justified is, <hi>Guilty,</hi> all the World is become guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before God; but here the Plea of the Person on his Trial is <hi>not guilty:</hi> whereon the Proofs and Evidences of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Righteousness do ensue; but this is a Plea which the Law will not admit, and which the Gospel disclaims.—This <hi>personal inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> wherewith we are said to be justified with this <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Justification,</hi> is our own <hi>Righteousness.</hi> Personal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and our own <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> are Expressions equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; but our own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is not the material cause of any Justification before God: For, (1.) It is unmeet
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94224:71"/>
so to be, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. (2.) It is directly <hi>opposed</hi> unto that Righteousness whereby we are justified, as inconsistent with it unto that end, <hi>Phil. 3. 9. Rom.</hi> 10. 3, 4. None have this <hi>Evangelical Righteousness,</hi> but those who are in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at least, justified before they actually have it; for it is that which is required of all that do believe, and are justified thereon: And we need not much enquire how a Man is justified after he is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied—If we are in any sense justified hereby in the sight of God, we have whereof <hi>to boast</hi> before him; we may not have so <hi>absolutely</hi> and with respect unto <hi>Merit,</hi> yet we have so comparatively, and in respect of others, who cannot make the same Plea for their Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                           <p>But all <hi>boasting</hi> is excluded; and it will not relieve to say, that this personal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is of the free Grace and Gift of God to some, and not unto others; for we must plead it as <hi>our Duty,</hi> and not as God's Grace.—I say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the <hi>Evangelical Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> which alone we plead about, is but one, and is at once compleated.—Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is such a Work as is at once <hi>compleated</hi> in all the Causes, and the whole Effect of it, tho not as unto the full possession of all that it gives right and title unto: for all our Sins past, present, and to come, were at once imputed unto, and laid upon Jesus Christ; in what sense we shall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94224:72"/>
afterwards enquire. <hi>He was wounded for our Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 6, 7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. The Assertions being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite without exception or limitation, are equivalent unto <hi>universals. All</hi> our Sins were on him, he bore them <hi>all</hi> at once, and therefore once died for all—at once <hi>finish'd Transgression,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24.—At once expiated all our Sins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3.—by <hi>one offering</hi> he hath perfected (consummated, compleated as to their spiritual state) <hi>them that are sanctified,</hi> chap. 10. 14.—From all which it appears that our Justification is at <hi>once compleat,</hi> it must be so, or no Man can be justified in this World—no time can be assigned, nor measure of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be limited, whereon it may be supposed that any one comes to be justified before God who is not so on his first believing.—The Scripture assigns no such time or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure—To say that <hi>no Man is compleatly justified</hi> in the sight of God in this Life, is at once to overthrow all that is taught in the Scripture concerning Justification, and withal all Peace with God and Comfort of Believers. But a Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted upon his legal Trial, is at <hi>once discharged</hi> of all that the Law hath against him.—<hi>There is a Justification of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Sinners on their belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: Hereon are their Sins pardoned, their Persons accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God, and a right is given unto them unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance.</hi> This <hi>State
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94224:72"/>
they are immediately taken into upon their Faith, or believing in Jesus Christ: And a state it is of actual Peace with God.</hi> These things at present I take for granted, and they are the Foundation of all that I shall plead in the present Argument: And I do take notice of them because some seem to the best of my understanding, to deny any <hi>real actual Justification</hi> of Sinners on their believing in this Life: for they make Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to be only a general conditional Sentence declared in the Gospel, which as unto its execution is delayed unto the day of Judgment: For whilst Men are in this World, the <hi>whole Condition</hi> of it being not fulfilled, they cannot be partakers of it, or be actually and absolutely justified. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it follows that indeed there is no <hi>real state of assured Rest and Peace with God</hi> by Jesus Christ for any Person in this Life. The causality of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument we ascribe unto Faith alone (as justifying) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we do so, it is pleaded that we ascribe <hi>more</hi> in our Justification unto our selves than they do by whom we are opposed: for we ascribe the Efficiency of an <hi>Instrument</hi> herein unto our own Faith, when they say only it is a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> or <hi>caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94224:73"/>
given the specious name of a <hi>Condition,</hi> and a <hi>causa sine quâ non,</hi> unto Faith, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately take all other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Works of Obedience into the same state with it, and the same use in Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and after this <hi>seeming Gold</hi> hath been cast for a while into the Fire of Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there comes out the Calf of a personal inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, whereby Men are justified before God, <hi>virtute foederis Evangelici;</hi> for as for the Righteousness of Christ to be imputed unto us, it is gone into Heaven, and they know not what is become of it.—Let the <hi>Experience</hi> of them that believe be inquired into, for their Consciences are continually exercised herein: What is it they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto? What is it that they plead with God for the continuance of the Pardon of their Sins, and the acceptance of their Persons before him? Is it any thing but <hi>soveraign Grace and Mercy</hi> through the Blood of Christ? <hi>Dr.</hi> O. <hi>of Justif.</hi> p. 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 189, 199, 201, 315, 144, 206.</p>
                           <p>That a Sinner may be saved, the Scriptures declare that he must be both justified and sanctified: the Romanists, as if one of those were but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, call that Justification which in Scripture is Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and that which in Scripture is Justification they admit not, as distinct from inherent Righteousness. The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who most insists
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94224:73"/>
upon the Doctrine of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, delivers these two as distinct things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and elsewhere. He ascribes Justification commonly to the Blood of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 9. Sanctification to the Spirit of Christ, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5.—There are these severals considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about the imputing this Righteousness: 1. Substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Christ sanctified in our stead, <hi>i. e.</hi> he tendred that which was due from us. 2. Acceptance; the Father ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted what Christ perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our stead, as performed on our behalf. 3. Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we have the sruits and advantages of his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, no less than if we our selves had satisfied.—Thus you may be justified in their way, if you will but have patience till your inherent Righteousness in this World be perfect and spotless; or till the lowest degree of it be absolute Perfection. If you think it impossible to be justified on such terms, they will tell you there is nothing more easy. <hi>Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Exerc. against Popery,</hi> p. 442, 454, 456. <hi>How not Christ's Person simply, but Christ</hi> as dying <hi>is the Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94224:74"/>
we believe; and it is called <hi>(Rom.</hi> 5. 1.) <hi>a being justified by Faith,</hi> and <hi>(ver.</hi> 10.) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Atonement:</hi> Now this depends upon Christ's Intercession.—In that he <hi>rose again</hi> as a common Person, this assures us yet further, that there is a formal, <hi>legal,</hi> and irrevocable <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of us passed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in that Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven between Christ and God; and that in his being then justified, we were also justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in him, so that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Justification is made past recalling. <hi>Dr.</hi> Goodwin <hi>Christ set forth,</hi> p. 29, 182, 262.—Whether through Faith as a Condition or not? I would have this word laid aside, <hi>Perkins</hi> upon the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> he will hardly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it a Condition: another in a Book called, <hi>The Triumph of Faith,</hi> saith, it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Condition. If it be not, why do they use the word? There is a danger in it. 1. A Condition may be pleaded: I may go and plead this, I have believed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Will any Man make this a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Giver and Receiver, I will give you an Alms, if you will receive it? Is it not a Condition? 2. All those Expressions, <hi>If a Man believeth, he shall be saved,</hi> &amp;c. import, that he that doth so shall be saved in the Event, which the Elect only are, to whom he giveth Faith. And it is a Phrase that imports a pleading; a Prisoner is not pardoned unless he plead his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94224:74"/>
Pardon, or hath his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don read at the Bar: Will you say this Act of his is the Condition of his being pardoned? It is that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he is not legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardoned, he doth not stand absolved else. <hi>Wash and be clean:</hi> He could never have been cleansed if he had not washed; was his washing a Condition? No, he did not stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Condition with him in it: It was indeed a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was likewise a means or a manner by which God did cleanse him. My Brethren, the nature of Faith, it is modest, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver makes a Plea for it self, it wholly pleadeth Grace, and nothing else: The truth is, if it were a Condition, a Man might plead it before God, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. That it is called the Law of Faith, and therefore this must be the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it follows not, it is the Duty, and it is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Gospel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which God saveth no Man: and is not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough? It seems to me to import, as if there were an universal Grace, and that it is the Condition terminateth it to this Man, and not to that. Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whether it be the Act of Faith that justifies, or that is accounted a Man's Righteousness when we are said to be saved through Faith? Surely no,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94224:75"/>
for God might have took Works as well; if he would have took it as an Act, he might have took any Act, Love it self.</p>
                           <p>There is this reason lies in the bottom of my Heart against it, besides all that else the Scripture saith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: That if when I go to God to be justified, I must present to him my believing, as the matter of my Righteousness, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christ's Death as the MERIT OF IT, what will follow? Two things clearly to me. 1. That the Heart is taken off from looking upon the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ wholly, and diverteth to its own Righteousness in the very act of believing for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and presenteth that to God which the Scripture is clear against: I say, it doth take the Heart off from the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Lord Jesus, or the eying of that, and causeth it to divert into it self, and presents its own Faith to God. 2. Every Man that will believe to be justified, and go to God and say, Lord, justify me, he must have an Evidence that he hath Faith; for how else can he present that as the matter of his own Righteousness? Now millions of Souls cannot do this, they were in a poor case if they should be put to it. The Apostle saith, <hi>it was of Faith that

it might be sure.</hi> If Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication had been founded on the Act of Faith, it had been as sure on Works as Faith; for that Faith that draws out an Act of Love, is as apt to fail as that Act of Love. But here is no uncertainty, while I believe to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Righteousness of Christ, but my Faith is swallowed up there; tho I may doubt of my Faith relying on him, yet I have a sure Object, I have a sure Matter to represent to God for me: whereas if <hi>believing</hi> was that I had to represent to God to be justified by, suppose my Faith fail me, I have not a sure matter of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to represent to God: The very Object Faith believes on is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to this, that the Act of Faith should be the matter of my Justification. I yield this, when God doth justify, he takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Act in its kind, of the degree of it: <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was strong in Faith, but in the point of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication he takes notice of Christ in the Heart.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94224:76"/>
we shall see immediately, he vindicates it from the Abuse that some in those days had put it unto, as other Doctrines of the Grace of God which they turned into Licentiousness.—That they <hi>(Paul</hi> and <hi>James)</hi> have not the same scope, design or end in their Discourses; that they do not consider the same <hi>Question,</hi> nor <hi>state the same Case,</hi> nor determine the same Enquiry; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not speaking <hi>ad idem,</hi> unto the same thing, do not contradict one another. (2.) That as Faith is a word of various significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Scripture, and doth, as we have before proved, denote that which is of divers kinds, they speak not of the same Faith, or Faith of the same kind, and therefore there can be no Contradiction, in what one ascribes unto it, and the other derogates from it, seeing they speak not of the same Faith. (3.) That they do not speak of <hi>Justification</hi> in the same sense, nor with respect unto the same ends. (4.) That as unto <hi>Works</hi> they both intend the same, namely, the Works of Obedience unto the Moral Law.—The whole of his <hi>(Paul</hi>'s) Purpose is to declare how a <hi>guilty convinced Sinner comes</hi> through Faith in the Blood of Christ to have all his Sins pardoned, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94224:77"/>
with God, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a right unto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance; that is, be acquitted and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the sight of God.—<hi>James</hi> doth not state the <hi>Case</hi> how a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Sinner, whose Mouth is stop'd as unto any Plea or Excuse for himself, may come to be justified before God, that is, receive <hi>the Pardon of Sins, and the Gift of Righteousness unto Life.</hi> To resolve this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion into our own Works, is to overthrow the whole Gospel: But he had in hand a business quite of another nature.—A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable Estate they thought they had attained, suted unto all the Interest of the Flesh, whereby they might live in Sin, and neglect of all Duty of Obedience, and yet be eternally saved.—<hi>James</hi> doth not once enquire how a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Sinner, cast and condemned by the Law, may come to be justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: and <hi>Paul</hi> speaks to nothing else.—They speak not of <hi>Justification</hi> in the same sense, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same end. It is of our absolute Justification before God, the Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Persons, our acceptance with him, and the grant of a Right unto the Heavenly Inheritance, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth treat, and thereof alone. This he declares in all the causes of it, all that on the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94224:77"/>
part of God, or on our part concurreth thereunto. The Evidence, the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, the Sense, the Fruit, the Manifestation of it in our Consciences, in the Church unto others that profess the Faith, he treats not of, but speaks of them separately as they occur on other occasions. The Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification he treats of is but one, and at once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished before God, changing the relative state of the Person justified, and is capable of being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced various ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Glory of God, and the Consolation of them that truly believe: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apostle <hi>James</hi> doth not treat at all, for his whole enquiry is after the <hi>nature of that Faith</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are justified, and the only way whereby it may be evidenced to be of the right kind, such as a Man may safely trust un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; wherefore he treats of <hi>Justification</hi> only as to the Evidence and Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, nor had he any occasion to do otherwise.—There is therefore no appearance of the least Contradiction between this Apostle and <hi>Paul,</hi> who professedly asserts, that Abraham <hi>was not justified before God by Works:</hi> for <hi>James</hi> only declares that by the Works which he performed after he was justified, he was manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and declared so to be.

                           <p n="1">1. The matter of our
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94224:79"/>
Justification is Christ's O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, inherent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and absolutely perfect, admitting of no degrees; the matter of our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is wrought within us, imperfect as to degrees, and admits of Wanes and Increases. The very Faith whereby we receive Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is but a Grain of Mustard Seed at first, it admits of degrees; but the Object apprehended, Christ and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, is always the same; and as much of Christ's Obedience (even all) is given to every Believer, to the weak as to the strong; and hence it is they are once and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfected in Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before they have all or half the measures of Sanctification, which the Lord will give them in his time.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The form, manner, and way of Justification is by God's free act of Imputation, reckoning and accounting of Christ's Obedience unto us; the form of our Sanctification is by infusion of Holiness, by the Spirit of Holiness, from Christ's fulness into our empty Hearts.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Justification causeth a relative Change, or it makes a change of Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Sanctification work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us a change of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities by the Creation of the new Divine Nature, and mortifying of our
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94224:79"/>
old corrupt Nature.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The parts of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication are God's not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Sin, through his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of Christ's Sufferings, and his accepting of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as righteous, by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of Christ's active O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. The parts of our Sanctification are Vivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the creating, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and begetting new Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Qualities (resembling God's Nature) and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the old sinful Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions and Seeds of Sin.—In our Justification, Christ's Obedience stands only upon account, and all our most sanctified Works and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesses stand by as Cyphers, and are to be esteemed as Loss and Dung.</p>
                           <p>Take Sanctification by it self, it is of great excellency and use: A good Work done in Faith by a Person justified, is better than all the glorious Deeds of Pharisees and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; but bring it, and all that all the Saints can bring together before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of God's strict Law and Justice for their Justification in that Court, and they and their Works will be damned to Hell for their inherent and adherent Imperfections.—In our Justification we have that perfect Righteousness in Christ, which as it is his, is the Cause and Merit of our Salvation, and that gives a just right and title to the Kingdom: In our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have the Cognizance and Badg of such as shall be
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94224:80"/>
saved, and inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The former is the ground why, the latter the Evidence whereby we know we have the Kingdom.—In Justification we are meer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients all along, through the Righteousness put upon us by God's pure Act and Account: In Sanctification we are after-Agents, <hi>i. e.</hi> after the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of the Spirit's new-born Qualities; being acted, we act in the strength of Jesus Christ. Altho too many be willingly ignorant of these Distinctions, yet they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily useful to deliver Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from Popery, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Babylonish Confusion, in and about this great Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truth of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Sinner's Justification. <hi>Mr.</hi> Stalham <hi>Reviler rebuked,</hi> p. 126, 127, 128.</p>
                           <p>Regeneration <hi>it differs from Conversion.</hi> Regeneration is a spiritual Change, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is a spiritual Motion: In Regeneration there is a Power conferred, Conversion is the exercise of this Power: In Regeneration there is given us a Principle to turn, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version is our actual turning; that is, the Principle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are brought out of a state of Nature into a state of Grace; and Conversion the actual fixing on God, as the <hi>terminus ad quem:</hi> one gives <hi>posse agere,</hi> the other <hi>actu agere.—Conversion is related to Regeneration, as the Effect to the Cause:</hi> Life precedes Motion, and is the cause of Motion.—<hi>In Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi>

By Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication we are reconciled to God; by Regeneration we are assimilated, made like to God.—<hi>It differs from Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the nature of the Change: Justification is a relative Change;</hi> whereby a Man is brought from a state of Guilt, to a state of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; from a state of Slavery, to a state of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; from the Obligation of the Covenant of Works, to the Privilege of the Covenant of Grace; from being a Child of Wrath, to be an Heir of the Promise. <hi>Regeneration is a physical Change, and real,</hi> as when a dead Man is raised from Death to Life; 'tis a filling the Soul with another Nature, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1. The Translators have inserted those words, <hi>hath he quickned,</hi> because those words are put in the <hi>5th</hi> Verse; but me thinks the words refer better to the <hi>23d</hi> Verse of the first Chapter, speaking of Christ, <hi>who fills all in all,</hi> and fills you too with a spiritual Life; or he passes from the Power of God in raising Christ, to his Power in raising us. 'Tis a change of Nature, and of that Nature whereby we are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94224:81"/>
Children of Wrath, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the first Sin, but by a Conversation according to the course of the World: And this quickning respects the change of that Nature which was prone to a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conversation, and a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the desires of the Flesh. The first is a change of a Man's Condition, this is a change in a Man's Disposition. When a Man is made a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, there is a change in his Relation; when a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or Slave is made a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, there is an alteration of his Condition: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ones Magistracy, nor the others Liberty fills their Hearts with new Principles, or plants a new frame in their Nature: <hi>Relation</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> are <hi>two distinct things.</hi> In Creation there is a Relation of a Creature to God, which results from the meer being of the Creature; but there is also the Nature of the Creature in such a rank of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is added over and above to its meer being. The Apostle in the <hi>Verses</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Text, speaks of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, or Non-imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Trespasses, as distinct from that change wrought in us in the new Creation. In <hi>Justificaiton</hi> we are freed from the Guilt of Sin, and so have a Title to Life; in <hi>Regeneration</hi> we are freed from the filth of Sin, and have the purity of God's Image in part restored to us.—<hi>They differ in the Cause, and other ways:</hi> Justification

Sins are imputed or expiated in the Blood of Christ, and for them Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made to the Anger of God, or not; if so, then notwithstanding that God should impute Sins, the Elect is in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, and a true Price paid for Sins imputed. But what Justice is it to impute that for a Debt which is plainly paid? If not, then the Faith of the Elect after they believe,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94224:83"/>
causes that God should not impute Sin, for which as yet no Satisfaction is given to the Displeasure of God, and this were a Remission without shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Blood; or Faith must be the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Justice pleads.</hi> I arraign before the Tribunal a Rebel, who was the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Work of thy Hands, the Center of thy rich Goodness, and a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of thy own Image; he is indeed miserable, whereby to excite thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion; but he is not miserable, without being criminal: Thou didst create him in a state, and with Ability to be otherwise: The Riches of thy Bounty aggravate the blackness of his Crime.</p>
            <p>He is a Rebel, not by Necessity, but <hi>Will;</hi> What Constraint was there upon him to listen to the Counsels of the Enemy of God? What Force could there be upon him, since it is without the compass of any Creature to work upon, or constrain the Will? Nothing of Ignorance can excuse him, the Law was not ambiguously expressed, but in plain words, both as to Precept and Penalty; it was writ in his Nature in legible Characters. Had he received any disgust from thee after his Creation, it would not excuse his Apostacy, since, as a Soveraign, thou wert not obliged to thy Creature: Thou hadst provided all things richly for him, he was crowned with Glory and Honour: Thy infinite Power had bestowed upon him an Habitation richly furnished, and varieties of Servants to attend him. Whatever he viewed without, and whatever he viewed within himself, were several Marks of thy Divine Bounty, to engage him to Obedience. Had there been some reason of any disgust, it could not have ballanced that Kindness which had so much reason to oblige him: However, he had received no Courtesy from the fallen Angel to oblige him to turn into his Camp. Was it not enough that one of thy Creatures would have stript thee of the Glory of Heaven, but this also must deprive thee of thy Glory upon Earth, which was due from him to thee as his Creator? Can he charge the difficulty of the Command? No: It was rather below than above his Strength: He might rather complain that it was no higher, whereby his Obedience and Gratitude might rather have a larger scope, and a more spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Field to move in, than a Precept so light, so easy, as to abstain from one Fruit in the Garden. What Excuse can he have that would prefer the Liquorish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Sense before the Dictates of his Reason, and the Obligations of his Creation? The Law thou didst set him was righteous and reasonable; and shall Righteousness and Reason be rejected by the supream and infallible Reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the rebellious Creature hath trampled upon it? What! Must God abrogate
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94224:88"/>
his holy Law, because the Creature hath slighted it? What Reflection will this be upon the Wisdom that enacted it, and upon the Equity of the Command and Sanction of it? Either Man must suffer, or the holy Law be expunged, and for ever out of date: And is it not better Man should eternally smart under his Crime, than any dishonourable Reflections of Unrighteousness be cast upon the Law, and of Folly, and want of a foresight upon the Lawgiver? Not to punish, would be to approve the Devil's Lie, and justify the Creatures Revolt. It would be a Condemnation of thy own Law as unrighteous, and a sentencing thy own Wisdom as imprudent. Better Man should for ever bear the Punishment of his Offence, than God bear the Dishonour of his Attributes: better Man should be miserable, than God should be unrighteous, unwise, false, and tamely bear the denial of his Soveraignty. But what advantage would it be to gratify Mercy by pardoning the Malefactor? Besides, the irreparable dishonour to the Law, the falsifying thy Veracity in not executing the denounced Threatning, he would receive Incouragement by such a Grace to spurn more at thy Soveraignty, and oppose thy Holiness by running on in a course of Sin with hopes of Impunity. If the Creature be restored, it cannot be expected that he that hath fared so well after the breach of it, should be very careful of a future Observance: His easy Readmission would abet him in the repetition of his Offence, and thou shalt soon find him cast off all moral dependance on thee? Shall he be restored without any Condition or Covenant? he is a Creature not to be governed without a Law, and a Law is not to be enacted without a Penalty. What future regard will he have to thy Precept? or what fear will he have of thy Threatning, if his Crime be so lightly past over? Is it the stability of thy Word? What reason will he have to give credit to that which he hath found already disregarded by thy self? Thy Truth in future threatnings will be of no force with him, who hath expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced thy laying it aside in the former. 'Tis necessary therefore that the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Creature should be punished, for the preservation of the honour of the Law and the honour of the Lawgiver, with all those Perfections that are united in the composure of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Mercy doth not want a Plea.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, the Sin of Man wants not its Aggravations: He hath slighted thy Goodness, and accepted thy Enemy as his Counsellor; but it was not a pure Act of his own, as the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Revolt was: He had a Tempter, and the Devil had none: He had, I acknowledg, an Understanding to know thy Will, and a Power to obey it; yet he was mutable, and had a Capacity to fall. It was no difficult Task that was set him, nor a hard Yoke that was laid upon, yet he had a brutish part as well as a rational, and Sense as well as Soul; whereas the fallen Angel was a pure intellectual Spirit. Did God create the World to suffer an, eternal Dishonour, in letting himself be outwitted by <hi>Satan,</hi> and his Work wrested out of his hands? Shall the Work of eternal Counsel presently sink into irreparable Destruction, and the honour of an Almighty and wise Work be lost in the ruin of the Creature? This would seem contrary to the nature of thy Goodness, to make Man only to render him miserable; to design him in his Creation for the Service of the Devil, and not for the Service of his Creator: What else could be the issue, if the chief Work of thy Hand, defaced presently after the erecting, should for
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94224:89"/>
ever remain in this marred condition; what can be expected upon the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his Misery, but a perpetual Hatred and Enmity of thy Creature against thee? Did God in Creation design his being hated, or his being loved by his Creature? Shall God make a holy Law, and have no Obedience to that Law from that Creature whom it was made to govern? Shall the curious Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship of God, and the excellent Engravings of the Law of Nature in his Heart be so soon defaced, and remain in that blotted condition for ever?</p>
            <p>This Fall thou couldst not but in the Treasures of thy infinite Knowledg foresee; why hadst thou Goodness then to create him in an Integrity, if thou wouldst not have Mercy to pity him in Misery? Shall thy Enemy for ever trample upon the honour of thy Work, and triumph over the Glory of God, and applaud himself in the success of his Subtility? Shall thy Creature only passively glorify thee as an Avenger, and not actively as a Compassionater? Am not I a Perfection of thy Nature as well as Justice? Shall Justice ingross all, and I never come into view?</p>
            <p>'Tis resolved already, that the fallen Angels shall be no Subjects for me to exercise my self upon; and I have now less reason than before to plead for them: they fell with a full consent of Will, without any motion from another; and not content with their own Apostacy they envy Thee, and thy Glory upon Earth as well as in Heaven, and have drawn into their Party the best part of the Creation below: Shall Satan plunge the whole Creation in the same irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Ruin with himself? If the Creature be restored, will he contract a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Sin by Impunity? Hast thou not a Grace to render him ingenuous in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as well as a Compassion to recover him from Misery? What will hinder but that such a Grace which hath established the standing Angels, may esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish this recovered Creature? If I am utterly excluded from exercising my self on Men as I have been from Devils, a whole Species is lost; nay, I can never expect to appear upon the Stage.</p>
            <p>If thou wilt quite ruin him by Justice, and create another World, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man; if he stand, thy Bounty will be eminent, yet there is no room for Mercy to act, unless by the commission of Sin he exposeth himself to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; and if Sin enters into another World, I have little hopes to be heard then, if I am rejected now. Worlds will be perpetually created by Goodness; Wisdom and Power: Sin entring into these Worlds, will be perpetually pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by Justice; and Mercy, which is a Perfection of thy Nature, will for ever be commanded silence, and lie wrapt up in an eternal Darkness. Take occasion now therefore to expose me to the knowledg of thy Creature, since without Misery, Mercy can never set foot into the World.</p>
            <p>Mercy pleads, if Man be ruined, the Creation is in vain; Justice pleads, if Man be not sentenced, the Law is in vain; Truth backs Justice, and Grace abets Mercy. What shall be done in this seeming Contradiction?</p>
            <p>Mercy is not manifested if Man be not pardoned; Justice will complain if Man be not punished.</p>
            <p n="3">

3. <hi>An Expedient is found out by the Wisdom of God to answer these Demands, and adjust the Differences between them.</hi> The Wisdom of God answers, I will satisfy your Pleas. The Pleas of Justice shall be satisfied in punishing, and the Pleas of Mercy shall be received in pardoning. Justice shall not complain for want of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, nor Mercy for want of Compassion. I will have an infinite Sacrifice to content Justice; and the Virtue and Fruit of that Sacrifice shall delight Mercy. Here shall Justice have Punishment to accept, and Mercy shall have Pardon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow. The Rights of both are preserved, and the Demands of both amicably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Punishment and Pardon, by transferring the Punishment of our Crimes upon a Surety, exacting a Recompence from his Blood by <hi>Justice,</hi> and conferring Life and Salvation upon us by <hi>Mercy,</hi> without the expence of one drop of our own. Thus is Justice satisfied in its Severities, and Mercy in its Indulgencies. The Riches of Grace are twisted with the Terrors of Wrath. The Bowels of Mercy are wound about the flaming Sword of Justice, and the Sword of Justice protects and secures the Bowels of Mercy. Thus is God righteous without being cruel, and merciful without being unjust; his Righteousness inviolable, and the World reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable. Thus is a resplendent Mercy brought forth in the midst of all the Curses, Confusions, and Wrath threatned to the Offender; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25.

Here Remission of Sins and Justification are made two distinct things, tho in Use and Fruition never severed; and both of them are imputed unto us by Faith in Christ: and tho it be here answered, that we have both these by the Death of Christ, but the perfecting and manifestation thereof is referred to Christ's Resurrection; yet it remaineth still, that there is more in Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication than Remission of Sins, for otherwise the Apostle should commit a <hi>Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> a verbal Repetition of the same thing: And if the Resurrection of Christ must concur to our Justification, then more is required than his Passion only. <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Rom. 5. 19. <hi>As by one Man's Disobedience many were made Sinners, so by the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one shall many be made righteous.</hi> Here many are directly said to be consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted just by Christ's Obedience. It will be answered that the passive Obedience of Christ is understood, in being obedient unto death. <hi>Contra.</hi> Yea the whole Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ in his Life and Death, is here insinuated, as may thus appear. 1. Christ's Obedience is set against <hi>Adam</hi>'s Disobedience, which was a Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Law; therefore Christ's Obedience must be understood to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. 2. The Apostle speaketh of the Gift of Righteousness, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. but <hi>donum Justitiae,</hi> the Gift of Righteousness is more than the taking away of Sins. 3. And the reigning of Righteousness is set against the Reign of Sin; but for Sin not to reign, and for Righteousness to reign, tho one necessarily followeth the other, yet they are in themselves diverse and different. 4. The Apostle useth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>constituentur,</hi> shall be constituted Righteous; therefore Justification is a settling or constituting of Men in the State of Righteousness before God, which is more than the Remission of Sins, which sheweth a Privation only, acquittal or riddance of Evil and Sin. <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Add hereunto the place before urged against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Justice, that Christ is our <hi>Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption;</hi> which place is thus well interpreted by Mr. <hi>Calvin:</hi> By <hi>Justice</hi> or Righteousness he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth that both Christ doth expiate our Sins by his Death, and his Obedience
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94224:90"/>
is imputed to us for Righteousness: for seeing the Justice of Faith consisteth in the remission of Sins, and our gracious Acceptance, we obtain both by Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beside then the remission of Sins, there is the imputation of Christ's Righteousness that maketh us accepted with God. <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Even Reason it self sheweth, that in Justification there is a Gift of Righteousness, beside remission of Sins: for in every change and alteration there are two things to be considered, from what we are changed, and into what, which are called, <hi>terminus à quo, &amp; terminus ad quem;</hi> as when a thing is turned from black to white, there is the privation of Blackness, and the succeeding of Whiteness; and when in the Air Darkness is expelled, and Light received: so to make a Man just, there must be a remission of Sin, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of Righteousness. And unto Salvation belongeth Deliverance from Hell, and the possession of Heaven: the one we are freed from by the redemption from our Sins, the other is given us for the acceptation of Christ's Righteousness. We are not only freed from Condemnation, but we also are made Heirs with God: the Offender being absolved from the Sentence of the Judg, is not upon that honoured and rewarded: so that it standeth with the Law of natural Reason, and Course of Civil Justice, that two things must concur unto Justification, an <hi>Ablation</hi> of Sin, and <hi>Collation</hi> of Righteousness. <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. To the perfecting of our Redemption, and setting us in possestion of Heaven, it was requisite, that both the Law should be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, which Man had transgressed, and the Punishment of the Law satisfied, that Man by his Transgression had deserved. The one Christ did by his Death, the other he wrought by his Life; and therefore the imputation of both is necessary: so St. <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth this to be one of the ends for the which Christ took upon him our Flesh, <hi>that the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> Rom. 8. 4. But if it be here said, that both are not requisite in God's Justice, to keep the Law, and to pay the Punishment, God's Justice is satisfied, in that the Punishment is answered for transgressing the Law: <hi>Answ.</hi> True it is if we expected to receive no more in Christ than we lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> which was the loss of a terrestrial Paradise; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store us to that we were in <hi>Adam,</hi> Satisfaction for the Punishment had sufficed; but to bring us to Heaven, a new Merit by Christ's perfect Obedience was to be procured, by the which Heaven is purchased. <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If Christ's actual Obedience be not a part of our Justification, then some of Christ's Works had been superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and not necessary. But it will here be said, that after Christ became Man, it was requisite, that he as Man should keep the Law, and as Man he was bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ must not be considered as a particular or private Man, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himself, but in the Person of a Redeemer, doing all he did for us: He saith indeed, <hi>thus it becometh us to fulfil all Righteousness:</hi> but why did it thus become him? as our Redeemer, to finish the work of our Redemption, for the which he was sent; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> directly saith, <hi>Gal. 4. He was made under the Law, to redeem them which were under the Law:</hi> He was to be obedient to the Law, and bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, but for our sakes, to redeem us. This matter may be thus resembled, like as a Prince resolving to go himself into Captivity, to redeem his Subjects that are taken Captives, when he cometh to deliver them, will carry himself decently as becometh a Prince, yet all this was first undertaken for his Subjects. So Christ the Prince of Glory, coming into the World to redeem Man, being come, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in all Virtue and Holiness, as it became the Person of the Redeemer; yet all this was undertaken for us: so that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>originally</hi> Christ became obedient to the Law for us; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>consequently,</hi> he so was obedient in respect of his
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94224:90"/>
Person. <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. The Death and Passion of Christ was available, because of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of his Person: <hi>we were redeemed with the precious Blood of Christ, as of a Lamb undefiled.</hi> Christ could not have redeemed us, if he had not been most holy and innocent: Christ's Person cannot be severed then from his Obedience, from whence it taketh the value and force; the one being imputed unto us, the other must also. It will be answered here, that the Holiness and Obedience of Christ was a Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Disposition unto his Passion; but it followeth not, that the one should be imputed as well as the other. <hi>Answ.</hi> It followeth necessarily. Like as a Prince should accept of an unspotted Lamb for a Captive; if he bring one that is blemished and spotted, it will not be accepted: the Captive then is delivered, because of the spotless Lamb which is offered; the Prisoner then is accepted, because of the spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Gift: and so are we accepted of God, for the undefiled Lamb's sake: it is then his Innocency which maketh his Death, and us in his Death accepted. <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. The Papists themselves grant so much, <hi>that Christ's Justice is imputed in respect of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;</hi> but they utterly refuse <hi>imputative Justice:</hi> shall then Protestants join with Papists in overthrowing one of the greatest Points and Articles, wherein we differ from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning Justification by the imputative Justice of Christ?

                              <hi>Paul</hi> was most sure of God's Grace, and his Justification thro Faith; he is perswaded that nothing can sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate him from the love of God in Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38. but he doth acknowledg, that he is not justified by his faithful Labours in the Gospel, or any other Works of his own, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho he were clear in Conscience.

                           <p>Hence it appears that it was the judgment of the primitive Church that Men should believe the Forgiveness of their own Sins—First of all here comes a common fault of Men to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked.

The Answer will be, I know and believe it. But ask him further: Dost thou believe the Pardon of thine own Sins? And then comes in a blind Answer, I have a good hope to God-ward, but

I cannot tell, I think no Man can say so much: for God saith to no Man, <hi>Thy Sins are pardoned.</hi> But this is to speak flat Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to say they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and they cannot tell: and it bewrays exceeding Negligence in matter of Salvation.

                           <p>Faith is called <hi>an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:</hi> Hence we learn, that the nature of Faith stands not in doubting, but in a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and Assurance.

Man; which may be fitly termed the School of universal Atheism, for it pulls down the Pale of the Church, and lays it waste as every common Field: it breeds a Carelesness in the use of the means of Grace, the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; when as Men shall be perswaded that Grace shall be offered to every one effectually, whether he be of the Church or not, at one time or other, whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever or howsoever he live: as in the like case, if Men should be told that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they live in the Market-Town or no, there shall be sufficient Provision brought them, if they will but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it and accept of it, who would then come to the Market?

out of a pure Heart, and of a good Conscience, and of Faith unfeigned, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 5. Seeing the first beginning from whence every good Action should proceed, is a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Heart, the last end the seeking of God's Glory, and Faith working by Love must intercur between both: the moral Works of the unregenerate failing so foully both in the beginning, middle, and end, are to be accounted Breaches rather of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment than Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances, Deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of good Works rather than Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever these Actions be in their own kind good, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, yet they are marr'd in the Carriage, that which is <hi>bonum</hi> (or good) being done <hi>bene</hi> (or well;) and so tho in regard of their <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted good, yet for the manner they must be esteemed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Pelagian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks were wont here to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>

do now adays unto us) both the Examples of the Heathen, <hi>who being Strangers from the Faith,</hi> did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (as they said) <hi>abound with Virtues:</hi> and as <hi>Paul</hi>'s Testimony al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so concerning them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. by which they laboured to prove, <hi>that even such as were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Faith of Christ, might yet have a true Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; because that these, as the Apostle witnessed, naturally did the things of the Law.</hi> But will you hear how St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> took up <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> for making this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Herein hast thou expressed more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that Doctrine of yours, wherein you are Enemies unto the Grace of God which is given by Jesus Christ our Lord, who taketh away the Sin of the World: bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a kind of Men which may please God without the Faith of Christ, by the Law of Nature. This is it for which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church doth most of all detest you.</hi> And again, <hi>be it far from us to think, that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94224:97"/>
true Virtue should be in any one unless he were righteous, and as far, that one should be truly righteous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he did live by Faith: for the just doth live by Faith. Now which of them that would have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves accounted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but the Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans alone, or even among them perhaps thou thy self alone, would say that an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del were righteous, would say that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Man were righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> would say that a Man mancipated to the Devil were righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous? Altho he were <hi>Fabricius, altho he were</hi> Fabus, <hi>altho he were</hi> Scipio, <hi>altho he were</hi> Regulus. And whereas <hi>Julian</hi> hath further demanded: <hi>If a Heathen do clothe the Naked, because it is not of Faith, is it therefore Sin?</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> answereth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, <hi>Inasmuch as it is not of Faith, it is Sin: not because the fact considered in it self, which is to clothe the Naked, is a Sin; but of such a Work not to glory in the Lord, none but an impious Man will deny to be a Sin.</hi> For howsoever, <hi>in it self this natural Compassion be a good
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94224:98"/>
Work, yet he useth this good Work amiss, that useth it unbelievingly, and doth this good Work amiss, that doth it unbelievingly; but whoso doth any thing amiss sinneth surely. From whence it is to be gathered, that even those good Works which Unbelievers do, are not theirs, but his who maketh good use of evil Men: but that the Sins are theirs, whereby they do good things amiss; because they do them not with a faithful, but with an unfaithful, that is, with a foolish and naughty Will, which kind of Will no Christian doubteth to be an evil Tree, which cannot bring forth but evil Fruits, that is to say, Sin only:</hi> for all that is not of Faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt or no, is Sin.

                           <p>The Doctrine of universal Grace, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth Man's natural Freedom with the name of Grace: for what else is universal Grace, but the very natural Abilities of Man's Will? If it be Grace in Truth as well as in Name, how then is it derived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94224:98"/>
all Men in the same Geometrical Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Degree; when as all other Graces are peculiar unto some, and unequally distributed unto most that have them?</p>
                           <p>There is not a Text in Scripture, not a <hi>Pelagian</hi> or <hi>Arminian</hi> now in Nature, that can shew me either Warrant or Example of any one saving or common Grace, that was ever yet in the same Equality con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon all Men; and shall we begin to forge such Graces now? But to pass on further, and to search into the very depth and bottom of this pretended Grace, I would demand of any <hi>Arminian</hi> this one <hi>Query,</hi> Whether this universal sufficient Grace (which I take to be nothing else but a Power or Faculty in the Will to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and transform the Soul, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Christ Jesus, and apply his Merits when the Gospel of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them) be a native and inherent Faculty of the Will? or only an adventitious, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, or infused Quality not born, not procured with it? If the former only, it
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:94224:99"/>
is verily then no Grace but Nature: If the latter, then it must either be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, derivative, or an infused Quality. If acquisite either by Art or Industry of our own; then it can be neither univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, nor sufficient, it being proportionably, originally in none; acquisitely in few, since few Men seek it, fewer purchase it. If derivative, not from our Parents, not from <hi>Adam;</hi> for then it were not Grace, but Nature; not from Christ or from his Spirit, for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive <hi>Grace only to their living and believing Members,</hi> not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unto all, and that by means which are neither common nor effectual unto all, not immediately. If by Infusion only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out means, I pray what Scripture proves it? If any, then shew it; if none, let none believe it: but if it be thus generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, then tell me how or when; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Soul or after it? whether in the Embrio, Infancy, Childhood, Youth, or riper Age of Men? If with it, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as a native Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94224:99"/>
conjoined with the Soul, undistinct from that whereby it wills all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civil things; and so a natural Power, not a Grace. If after it, I dare presume no prying Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian can tell me how, or when. If in riper years, in Youth, or in Childhood only, then Infants want it who depart this Life, and so it is not universal. If in the very Womb or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of all Men, then God bestows it when and where it is but useless, and so doth things in vain: since Infants (specially those that die before discretion) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to act it, or to embrace Salvation by it. If in neither of all these Reasons, then not at all, and so there is no such Grace. All which being laid together, will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discover this <hi>Pelagian, Popish</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Grace, to be in truth mere Nature, and so unable of it self to change Mens Hearts, to engender saving Grace, or purchase or imbrace Salvation, as our <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Papists,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians</hi> dream.—To wind up all in brief, if there be such a Freedom of Will, or Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Grace imparted unto all Men, whereby they may be saved if they will, why then were not the means of Grace and Salvation, from the very Creation to this present, <hi>alike imparted to all,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94224:100"/>
which it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to be saved? Yea, why then are not all, or most Men saved? Is it because they will not, or because they cannot save, convert or help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? If the latter of these two, you then yield up the Cause; if the former only, because they will not: I answer, <hi>there is no Man whatsoever</hi> so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately prodigal of his own Soul, or so desirous of Damnation, but he unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly desires to be saved, and would certainly save himself at last, if <hi>his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to effect were equal to his Will:</hi> Therefore it is not want of Will, but Power, that bereaves them of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. If you believe not this, believe the Truth himself, who speaks it: <hi>Many</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall strive to enter, and shall not be able.</hi> But admit it rests thus merely in Mens Wills: from whence then springs this Inequality in their Wills, that one Man is thus unwilling to be saved, when another wills it? Is it because one Man's Will is naturally more corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and depraved than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? This were to deny either the Universality or the Equality of original Corruption, which is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derived unto all Men in the self-same measure, without any difference of degrees. Is it because there is an Insufficiency or Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94224:100"/>
in the Grace you speak of, to check and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Obstinacy, the Perversness of Mens Wills? then there is no such suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient universal Grace as you pretend, since it is not sufficient or alike in all. Certainly if Mens Wills were equal, and their Graces equal, their Desire, their Accomplishment of eternal Happiness and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (which is essential and connatural to the Wills of Men) would be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, since <hi>the self-same things</hi> in the same degrees, admit no Equality in their genuine and native Operations: And if so, then all Men by this Doctrine should be saved, and so God's eternal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Hell and Devils were in vain.

                           <p>They (the <hi>Papists)</hi> say not, that a Man by his Free-will only is able to live well, or to obtain eternal Life: for <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> proveth at large, that a Man hath no Power of himself, without the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Assistance of Grace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himself to receive Grace, or to love God, or to will any thing apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Salvation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of God's Grace. This then is their Opinion, that tho the Will of Man be not able of it self only to do any thing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94224:101"/>
in spiritual Actions, yet being aided and assisted by Grace, it may: so that they attribute part to Grace, part to Free-will: the first Motion and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Heart, they say, is only of God; and here the Will worketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; then it is the part of Free-will to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Grace offered, to give consent unto it, and to work together with it. <hi>Trident.

                           <p>The Rhemists also thus define the matter; <hi>Tho our Election, Calling, first coming to God, be not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or principally upon our Will or Works, yet our Will or working of any Good to our Salvation, is the secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Cause: God's special Motion, Grace, Assistance, is the principal,</hi> Rom. 9. Sect. 4.</p>
                           <p>This then is their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that God's Grace and Man's Free-will do work actively together: as the Rhemists note, <hi>The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, tho they believed espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by God's Grace and Preordination, yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved also by their own Free-will.</hi> Rhem.

                           <p>It was another Heresy of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that God to this end gave Grace to Men: <hi>That what they are commanded to do by their Free-will, they may more easily accomplish by Grace.</hi>

So then Grace in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment helpeth Man only more especially, fully, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, more easily to believe: Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without Grace, tho not so especially. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 959.</p>

                           <p>Concerning Free-will, as it may peradventure in some case be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Men without Grace may do some outward Function of the Law, and keep some outward Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances or Traditions: so as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things spiritual and appertaining to Salvation, the strength of Man being not regenerate by Grace, is so infirm and impotent, that he can perform nothing neither in doing well or willing well, who after he be regenerated by Grace, may work and do well, but yet in such sort, that still remaineth notwithstanding a great imperfection of Flesh, and a perpetual Repugnancy between the Flesh and the Spirit. And thus was the original Church of the antient <hi>Romans</hi> first instructed: From whom see how far this latter Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath degenerated, which hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and affirmeth, that Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace, <hi>viz. Regeneration,</hi> may perform the Obedience of the Law, and prepare themselves to Grace by working, <hi>&amp;c. (Here Mr.</hi> Baxter'<hi>s Habit of Grace must dance atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance as to its effectual Form, upon our pre-acting of Grace.)</hi> Fox'<hi>s Acts and Monuments,</hi> p. 25.</p>
                           <p>Another Error also may be noted in the Papists, touching the efficient
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94224:103"/>
or formal Cause of good Works. For albeit they all confess in their Books, that <hi>gratia Dei gratis da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> is the chief and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cause thereof, and worketh in us <hi>Justitiam primam</hi> (as they call it) yet the good Works after Regeneration, they refer to other subordinate Causes under God, as to Free-will, or to <hi>Habitum virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> or <hi>ad integra natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and nothing at all to Faith, whenas Faith only next under God is the Root and Fountain of all Well-doing: as in the Fruits of a good Tree; albeit the Planter or the Husbandman be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agent thereof, and some cause also may be in the good Ground; yet the next and immediate Cause is the Root that maketh the Tree fruitful. In like manner the Grace of God, in a soft and repentant mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified Heart, <hi>(by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Grace made such)</hi> planteth the Gift of Faith. Faith as a good Root can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie dead or unoccupied, but springeth forth, and maketh both the Tree fruitful, and also the Tree thereof to be good, which otherwise had no acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor goodness in them, were it not for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Root from whence they spring. So <hi>Paul,</hi> altho he had certain Works in him, such as they were, before his Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94224:104"/>
yet had he no good Works before the Grace of Christ had rooted Faith in him. So <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> the Sinner, and <hi>Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Publican, so all the Nations of the Gentiles began to bring forth Fruit, and especially good Fruit, when they began to be ingrafted in Christ, and to receive the Root of his Faith, whose Fruits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that were all damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unsavory, <hi>&amp;c.

                           <p>Nature cannot help any thing at all to that which is beside or against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; like as the wild Olive doth not prepare it self the better to be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or grafted into the right Olive. This then is an evident place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24. to convince the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> of these days, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, whereby a Man even before Grace, may make himself more fit and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Grace: but this is contrary to the saying of our blessed Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 15. 5. where he useth the like Comparison which the Apostle doth here, making himself the Vine, and us the Branches; <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> on the <hi>Romans,</hi> p. 527.</p>

thirst after Righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</hi> There is a <hi>Promise</hi> of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but it is with a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hungering. <hi>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth. Blessed are the pure in Heart, for they shall see God,</hi> &amp;c. If I have not the Condition annexed to the Promise, how dare, or how can I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Promise?</p>

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The <hi>Condition</hi> is not the way to get the <hi>Promise,</hi> the <hi>Promise</hi> is the ground of Faith, and the way to get the Condition; because the Promise is the <hi>Motive</hi> Cause that moves the Soul to get the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now the <hi>Mover</hi> must be before the <hi>Moved;</hi> then if <hi>Belief</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> move thy Soul to get the Condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, then Belief of the Promise must be before that the Soul can keep the Condition of the Promise.</p>

                              <hi>Saul</hi> made a Promise to <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 18. that he should be his Son in Law in one of his two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, upon condition that he should give him an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Fore-skins of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listins. Now <hi>David</hi> did first believe the Promise; and thereby he was allured to fight valiantly, to keep the Condition, to get an hundred Foreskins of the Philistins. So <hi>Psal. 116. I believed, and therefore did I speak.</hi> He believed God's Promise, and then
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94224:105"/>
he spake with conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So <hi>we believe,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we speak.</hi> First the Soul believes; and then every Action of a Christian, wherein it moves to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Condition, springs from this Root. Nay Beloved, a Man cannot keep any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Bible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith; <hi>he must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>

                           <p>Before effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a Man was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, and had no Interest in Christ, no Communion or Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with Christ, he was altogether dead in Trespasses and Sins, a cursed. Creature, a damned Creature, in the state of Sin and Condemnation; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Parts or Gifts he had, all were no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than may be in a Reprobate; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. Before that time <hi>you were without Christ, Aliens and Strangers from the Commonwealth of</hi> Israel: May be you were civil, but you had no Union with Christ; tho you were constant Hearers of the Word (which is a laudable thing) yet you had no Union with Christ; may be you were deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with admirable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Jewels, as the Prophet shews; a Man may be decked with golden Virtues, and afterwards turn to Dross; a Man may have admirable things in him, before he hath this: but there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94224:106"/>
of God in a Man, nothing of Christ in a Man, no saving Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God's Spirit at all in a Man, no Union with Christ. This is the first Passage of a Man from Death to Life, from Nature to Grace, from the Devil to God; <hi>we are passed from Death to Life</hi> (saith the Apostle) This is an allusion to a Man's effectual Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, afterwards a Man brings forth the Fruits of Life, and is alive to God; but when a Man is first effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, there is his Passage from Death to Life, he was a Man dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now this effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Calling therefore is the first Work that is wrought in a Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the first Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of a Man from Death to Life; it is a transition from Sin, Hell, and Damnation, to be in Christ; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mark how <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, when he had a hope that his Hearers were effectually called, Acts 8. 40. <hi>Save your selves</hi> (saith he) <hi>from this untoward Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> As who should say, this is your first part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the World, the first shaking of hands, and bidding them farewel, if you be effectually called as

you seem to be, <hi>come out from among them,</hi> and save your selves from this untoward Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; this is the first bursting of the Bonds between you and Sin, the first breaking the League between you and carnal Company; <hi>now save your selves from this untoward Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> make it appear you are called: this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle shews, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 13. that before he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led he had nothing in him at all; you have heard, saith he, how in times past, beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I persecuted the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I confess I had goodly things in me, and I profited in the Jewish Religion above many my Equals in my own Nation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more zealous for the Traditions of my Fathers; I was marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous strict and forward, and for the Letter of the Law; I was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous zealous and blameless: there were excellent good things in me; but I had nothing of Christ all this while, but when it pleased God, <hi>who separated me from my Mother</hi>'s <hi>Womb, and called me by his Grace,</hi> &amp;c. As you should say, now here was the first dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that blessed Light in my Heart,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94224:107"/>
now begun that to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear when God called me by his Grace, and first revealed his Son in me, then was the Deed done, and never till then: so also he shews that he was a cursed Creature living in Iniquity; it may be himself, and his Companions, took him to be as good a Man as any was in all <hi>Israel;</hi> but see how he casts his own Water, <hi>Tit. 3. 3. We our selves also were sometimes foolish, serving divers Lusts,</hi> &amp;c. But after that the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Love of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From thence he began to be in the state of Grace, when God called him out of that bad state, when God made a breach between him and his old Courses; when he made the first Rent, and Division, and Revoke, then Grace began to appear, from that time forward I was in Christ: thus you see that effectual calling is the first Work of God in a Man's Soul, it is the first bringing of a Man to Christ, and the first making of a Man to put him on.

                              <hi>That Faith admits of Fears and Doubtings,</hi> is charged to be a Doctrine of the first Reformers, by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> in a late Piece of his, where Column-wise he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses it to his own created Antinomian Notions. What sort of Reformers he means, as to the Reality and Justice of his Charge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be such as have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the Rhemish An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations, I am at a loss; but if he designs herein, the first Protestant <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> Reformers, I must needs say, that he has cast as foul and unjust an Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon them, as could have dropt from the Pen of the most adulterating Papist, as equally reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby upon the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Doctrine, as upon their Understanding in its discriminating Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to distinguish not only between Truth and Error, but also between things of a different nature, yea of an essential Enmity one to the other. That Fears and Doubtings may be where true Faith is, is not to be denied; but that Faith ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Doubtings, such Fears as produce Doubtings in the Soul, is contrary to the Design of God in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94224:93"/>
Faith, contrary to the Nature and Office of Faith in it self and Operations, contrary to the Scripture where we find the most eminent of the Servants of God met with sharp Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs for entertaining such Fears as are inseparable from Doubtings; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the experience of his People in all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                           <p>It cannot be proved by any Man, that <hi>no Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth</hi> by that <hi>sufficient Motion,</hi> which doth not <hi>necessarily</hi> determine his Will; seeing many prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Acts are done by such a Motion.

more the cause than Man's Concourse is; tho God leave some part of the Causation to Man's Free-will.

The same degree of divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press or Motion, which prevaileth with a Soul pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed by common Grace, is not enough to prevail with some others that are ill or indisposed: Tho God's <hi>absolute Will</hi> and <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable Operation</hi> would prevail with any, how bad soever.—Q. <hi>Whether suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grace to believe, which giveth the mere Power of Believing, to Infants or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult be ever lost?</hi> Ans.

(besides the <hi>natural Power) a moral Power to believe, to any that never do believe?</hi> And, 1. It is certain by <hi>Adam</hi>'s instance, that he gave him a Power to have <hi>perfectly obeyed,</hi> when he did not. 2. And therefore no Man can prove that now he giveth no Man a <hi>moral Power</hi> to <hi>believe,</hi> that doth not. 3. But it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth most probable that he doth, because his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Man's Nature</hi> are not <hi>tota specie</hi> changed. 4. And it is certain that still all Men have Power <hi>to do more good than they do.</hi> 5. And even the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> grant this <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of Grace. 6. But yet for my part, I am <hi>not certain</hi> of it. But if <hi>there be such</hi> a Power given, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acteth Faith (which I think most probable) it is either in the <hi>Adult</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants:</hi> If in the <hi>Adult,</hi> no doubt it's lost; for they that <hi>will not believe</hi> (to the last) retain <hi>not still the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power</hi> in their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. But in the <hi>case of Infants,</hi> I think those of them that <hi>die before the use of Reason,</hi> lose it not, nor any of the <hi>Elect</hi> that live to full Age. But as to <hi>others,</hi> after long doubt, <hi>How far Infant-Grace is loseable,</hi> this seemeth now the most probable Solution to me, <hi>viz.</hi> there is a Grace that reacheth but to a <hi>moral Power</hi> to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, before Men have the

Justification</hi> to the <hi>one sort</hi> (their Sins of <hi>Nature</hi> being pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) but not to the <hi>other</hi> (who are not pardoned without the Act) and it followeth not hence, that the Grace of <hi>habitual Sanctification</hi> is lost in any; <hi>Adam</hi> had such a Holiness as might be lost.

And yet that none are saved without more; but that upon this first degree they have a Right to Salvation, and that their further Holiness shall be given them whom God will, as part of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which they have right at farthest at Death, in the same time and manner as perfect Holiness and Mortification of Sin is given to Believers that are till Death imperfect.

And they will not have the Vivification and reviving of our Will in our Regeneration, to consist in this, that of being naturally evil, it is made good by the infusion of some Virtue, but that by the Illumination of the Understanding and amendment of the Affections, <hi>the Will is made able to put forth that Faculty of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or nilling, which is ingrafted in it.

Conferrers at the <hi>Hague</hi> in the third and fourth Articles, do so speak as if they were of the same opinion with us: for there they profess, <hi>that Man hath no saving Faith from himself, and that the Grace of God is the beginning, the proceding and the finishing of all good, and that all good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Grace of God in Christ.</hi> But the subtle Men, when they say that a Man hath not from himself, they understand that he hath it not from himself alone: And when they say, that every good Work is to be ascribed to Grace, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wary lest they should say <hi>to Grace alone.</hi> Then also in the word <hi>Grace,</hi> they lay a Snare, and being the Apes of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> they feign a certain Grace which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, which doth extend it self as far as Nature: Also they distinguish Grace from the use of Grace; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they will have Grace to be from God, but the use of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94224:103"/>
Grace to be in the Power of Man's Free-will. With the like Craft they say, that the Power of Believing is from Grace: for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently draw back what they have reached forth, while they say, that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it self is of Man's Free-will; and that Grace is given to Man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve if he will. But whensoever they will have a kind of special Grace to come to that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Grace, they make the use of this speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Grace to depend on Free-will; and they roundly, and without any Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances affirm, that the Efficiency and working Power of Grace doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it. We shall also see, that that universal and sufficient Grace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Men, is natural Gifts and Notions that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ingrafted, and that they clothe Nature with the goodly name of Grace, (which thing also <hi>Pelagius</hi> did) which thing, when they do with their greatest cunning, yet their dissembling is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94224:103"/>
never so wary, but that their <hi>Pelagian</hi> Ears and Errors do appear; and altho they do imitate the Speech of Truth, yet their Vizard doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fall from them unawares, and their Ulcers being pressed, do presently cast forth stinking Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Yet <hi>Vorsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> here doth differ from his Master: for when <hi>Arminius</hi> saith, that no Man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Act, by that universal Grace alone, which is common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, but that there is also some special Grace required; <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius</hi> on the contrary side doth affirm, <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. cum Piscat.</hi> p. 57. That some are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by universal Grace (which he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the lesser Mercy) that is, without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, which he calleth more than suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and supera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding Helps: Therefore if this Man be believed, some Men come to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by that Grace alone which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Heathen Men—The <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of Grace and Free-will do so dress
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94224:104"/>
and trim up <hi>Popery,</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> do <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> do often use that distinction of sufficient and effectual Grace; but with such a floating Speech, and affected Ambiguity, that it is hard to know what is effectual Grace with them.—<hi>Arnoldus</hi> saith, <hi>Man if he be not wanting to himself, may convert himself.</hi> The Reader therefore shall mark how pestilent this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is (which the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> restrained as it were with shame, do scarce at any time utter without Ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) <hi>That the Grace of God is effectual</hi> (that is) <hi>efficient and working, it is to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Free-will; and the Efficiency of the Grace of God is subjected to the Will of Man.</hi> By which Speech they mean this, that God doth save Man, if Man himself will, for this it is to depend on Man's Will—But in the term of sufficient Grace, they do not only differ one from another, but every one of them differeth from himself: for they will have sufficient Grace to believe, and Power of Believing to be given to all particular Men: and yet the same Men say, that no Man can believe in Act, and use well this universal Grace, without special Grace. O your faithful Stability! can that be called sufficient Grace, which doth never bring forth that effect for which it is given, unless some other special Grace come to it? Is that a sufficient Cause
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94224:104"/>
which doth never work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? or is it any thing less agreeable to Reason, than with <hi>Arminius,</hi> to make one kind of Grace, which is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, by which the Sinner may be converted, but is not converted; and another which is effectual, by which the Sinner is converted? Is it not of the same Power and Faculty to be able to do, and to do? to be able to see, and to see? Surely a Giddiness hath seized on these Men, while they study for Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—<hi>Arminius</hi> against <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> says, <hi>p. 259, 260. The Gentiles while they were made destitute of the Knowledg of God, yet God hath not left them without a Testimony, but even at that time he made known unto them some Truth concerning his Power and Goodness, he also preserved the Law engraven in their Minds; which good things if they had rightly used, at least from their Conscience, he would have given them greater Grace, according to that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, To him that hath shall be given—</hi>Hear the words of <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> p. 105, 106. <hi>Altho many Nations are destitute of the ordinary preaching of the Gospel, yet they are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely excluded from the Grace of the Gospel, but always the good things which are offered in the Gospel, do remain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually propounded to them as to the rest who do enjoy the Privilege of the preaching of it, so that they perform the Conditions of the Covenant.</hi>
                              <pb n="172" facs="tcp:94224:105"/>
For he saith, that Salvation <hi>is no less propounded to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Men, than to Christians, so that they fulfil the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Covenant.</hi> These Conditions are Faith and Repentance; but how should he believe in Christ, who is ignorant of Christ? how should he repent, to whom God hath not given the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Regeneration? Thus is the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reader openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded—But when they come to explain the Nature of this universal Grace, they do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little differ from the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians;</hi> for <hi>Pelagius,</hi> lest he should seem to be an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Grace, doth ascribe to it every good Work that is done by Men. But by Grace he did understand Nature it self, because it had been made and created of God. But according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> Nature is one thing, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Grace is another: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, he will have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grace to be given to all and particular Men, and that Nature is in no Man to whom God doth not give sufficient Grace to obtain Faith, and by Faith Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whence it cometh to pass, that, according to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> sufficient Grace doth extend it self as far as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Pelagius</hi> doth confound Nature with Grace; but <hi>Arminius</hi> doth join Nature and Grace together, so that Nature is in none, to whom Grace is not given, <hi>&amp;c.

any thing that otherwise ever befel the Mind of Man to think or apprehend; yet if it must be supposed to intend nothing else in its Doctrine of the New-birth or Regeneration, but those moral Duties and their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance, it is dark and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible; I say, If there be not a <hi>secret mysterious</hi> Work of the Spirit of God, in and upon the Souls of Men in the Writings of the New Testament, but only a <hi>Reformation of Life,</hi> and the Improvement of Man's natural Abilities in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of <hi>moral Virtue,</hi> thro the application of outward means unto their Minds and Understandings, conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perswading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; they must be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be obscure, beyond those of any other Writers whatsoever, as some have not feared already to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish unto the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Epistles of <hi>Paul.</hi> But so long as we can obtain an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Men, that they are <hi>true,</hi> and in any sense the <hi>Word of God,</hi> we doubt not but to evince that the things intended in them are clearly and properly expressed, so as that they ought to be, and so as they are capable to be expressed; the Difficulties which seem to be in them arising from the <hi>mysterious Nature</hi> of the things themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, and the Weakness of our Minds in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94224:93"/>
                              <hi>of a Mercy. Doubts of losing a Mercy,</hi> eat out the Heart: and a Man in that case is as much troubled with the fear of wanting, as he can be comforted with the sense of enjoying.—The first part of that great Blessing we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by Christ, consists in our Deliverance from Evil, or in a freedom from perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The second consists in the conveyance of Good to us, as Pardon of Sin, Grace, and Glory. But the third (which is the height of all) consists in our everlasting assurance to enjoy all this. <hi>Adam</hi> had a good Estate, but he was not assured of it; the Blessings we have by Christ are built upon a Foundation, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be shaken. Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> on <hi>Job,</hi> ch. 5. v. 24.</p>
                           <p>So we may answer these places; <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 14. <hi>Blessed is the Man that feareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</hi> Phil. 2. 12. <hi>Work out your Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> These seem to call Christians to live in a doubtful Condition, or in a state of Trepidation, always fearing: but their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, not to keep the Soul from being settled by Faith in Christ, but from being highflown in any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our selves: or the Spirit speaks thus, not to put us upon doubts of our standing, but to preserve us from falling. For these Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are so far from oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Assurance, that they strengthen it.</p>

The way not to be afraid is thus to fear; nor are any so sure as they who thus tremble. They that are working out their Salvation with fear and trembling, may know without fear and trembling that they shall be saved: And they that thus fear always, may be assured that they shall be above fear for ever. But say some, the Preacher speaks out against this Knowledg, <hi>Eccles. 9. 1. No Man knoweth Love or Hatred.</hi> It is true, <hi>not by all that is before him:</hi> We cannot know Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred from the Works of God without us; but we may know Love and Hatred by the Work of God upon us, or by the workings of God within us. We cannot fetch an Evidence that God loves us out of our Chests and Money-bags; nor can we read any Assurance or a Conveyance for Heaven, in the Assurances and Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of our Lands: but we may fetch this Evidence, and read this Conveyance from, and in the Covenant of Grace, received by Faith, witnessed and sealed to our Hearts by the Holy Spirit.

troductive of <hi>Atheism,</hi> before they are confident of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. If there be in, and required unto Regeneration, the infusion of a <hi>new real-spiritual</hi> Principle into the Soul and its Faculties, of spiritual Life, Light, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Righteousness, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto and suted for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction or Expulsion of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary inbred habitual Principle of Sin and Enmity against God, enabling unto all Acts of Holy Obedience, and so in order of Nature antecedent unto them; then it doth not consist in a mere <hi>Reformation of Life</hi> and moral Virtue, be they never so exact or accurate. Three things are to be observed for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Assertion, before we come to the Proof and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it. As, 1. That this Reformation of Life which we say is not Regeneration, or that Regeneration doth not consist therein, is a <hi>necessary Duty</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably required of all Men. For we should take it here for the whole course of <hi>actual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> unto God, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Gospel. Those indeed by whom it is urged and pressed in the room of <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> or as that wherein Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation doth consist, do give such an Account and Description of it, as that it is, or at least may be foreign unto true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Obedience, and so not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it one <hi>acceptable Duty</hi> unto God, as shall afterwards be declared. 2. That the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple before described, wherein Regeneration as <hi>passively</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, or as wrought in us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, doth always certainly and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94224:94"/>
                              <hi>infallibly</hi> produce the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Life</hi> intended. In some it doth it more compleatly, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more imperfectly, in all <hi>sincerely.</hi> For the same Grace in nature and kind is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto several Persons in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous degrees, and is by them used and improved with more or less Care and Diligence. In those therefore that are adult, these things are inseparable. Therefore, 3. The difference in this matter cometh unto this Head; we say and believe that Regeneration consists <hi>in spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Renovatione naturae,</hi> in a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Renovation of our Nature; our modern <hi>Socinians,</hi> that it doth so <hi>in morali Reformatione vitae,</hi> in a moral Reformation of Life. Now as we grant that this <hi>spiritual Renovation</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will infallibly produce a <hi>moral Reformation</hi> of Life; so if they will grant that this moral Reformation of Life doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a spiritual Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Nature, this difference will be at an end. And this is that which the Antients intend by first receiving the Holy Ghost, and then all Graces with him. However if they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly design to speak <hi>ambiguously,</hi> improperly, and unscriptural; confounding Effects and their Causes, Habits, and Actions, Faculties or Powers, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional Acts, infused Principles, and acquired Habits, spiritual and moral, Grace and Nature, that they may take an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to <hi>rail</hi> at others for want of better advantage, I shall not contend with them. For allow a new <hi>spiritual Principle,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94224:95"/>
Habit of Grace, or graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Abilities to be required in and unto Regeneration, or to be the Product or the Work of the Spirit therein, that which is <hi>born of the Spirit being Spirit;</hi> and this part of the Nature of this Work is sufficiently cleared. Now this the Scripture abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly testifieth unto: 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 17. If any Man be in Christ, he is a new Creature.</hi> This new Creature is that which is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that which was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, which being born of the Spirit is Spirit. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Souls of Men by a <hi>creating Act</hi> of the Power of God, or it is not a <hi>Creature;</hi> and it is superinduced into the essential Faculties of our Souls, or it is not a <hi>new Creature;</hi> for whatever is in the Soul of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Disposition, Ability, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination unto God, or for any moral Actions by Nature, it belongs unto the old Creation, it is no <hi>new Creature.</hi> And it must be somewhat that hath a being and subsistence of its own in the Soul, or it can be neither <hi>new</hi> nor a <hi>Creature.</hi> And by our Apostle it is opposed to all outward Privileges; <hi>Gal. 5. 6. ch.</hi> 6. 15. That the Production of it also is by a <hi>creating Act</hi> of Almighty Power, the Scripture testifieth; <hi>Psal. 51. 10. Ephes.</hi> 2. 10. And this can denote no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a new <hi>spiritual Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or Nature wrought in us by the Spirit of God. No, say some, a new Creature is no more but a <hi>changed Man.</hi> It is true, but then this Change is internal also; yes in the <hi>Purposes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi> of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94224:95"/>

                           <p>This is good Gospel at once, to overthrow original Sin, and the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. This Doctrine I am sure was not learned from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> whereof some used to hoast: Nay, it is much more fulsom than any thing ever taught by <hi>Pelagius</hi> himself, who indeed ascribed more unto Grace than these Men do, altho he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied this Creation of a new Principle of Grace in us, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent unto Acts of Obedience. And this turning all Scripture Expressions of spiritual things into <hi>Metaphors,</hi> is but a way to turn the whole into a Fable, or at least to render the Gospel the most obscure and improper way of teaching the Truth of things that ever was made use of in the World.

it, it being a soft Pillow from whence many slide insensibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Destruction. How many upon this account think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves new Creatures, who are yet deeply under the Image of <hi>Satan;</hi> and tho they have blown off some dust from the Law of Nature, yet never had a Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Law of Grace writ in their Hearts? Nay, the Image of the Devil may be more deeply engraven in a Soul, whose Life is free from an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward taint. Profane Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press more of the Beast; a civil and moral Conversation may have more of the Devil and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent within, in spiritualized Wickedness. (1.) <hi>Yet Morality is to be valued.</hi> 'Tis a comely thing among Men, a Beauty to humane Societies, Satisfaction to natural Conscience, Security to the Body, Example to others; Men are to be applauded for it, and encouraged in it. 'Tis a Fruit of Christ's Mediation, left for the preservation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societies, without which the World would be a mere <hi>Bedlam</hi> and Shambles: The Works of Kindness, Justice, Mercy, Love, Pity, &amp;c. are useful and commendable. Tis a thing which our <hi>Saviour</hi> loved, yet not with such a Love as eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to reward it; he looked upon the young Man with <hi>some Affection,</hi> Mark 10. 21. but scarce upon the Pharisees with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Anger and Disdain. (2.) <hi>Yet we must not set the Crown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Grace upon the head of it, and place it in a Throne equal to that of the new Creation.</hi> 'Tis too amiable for Men to be
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94224:96"/>
beaten off from it; yet with just Reason we may perswade them to arise to a higher elevation. 'Tis a curious Plant, a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Picture, an useful Artifice, but not a vital Principle; a Glow-worm is a lovely Light, yet it is not a Star. We prels not Men to throw off Morality, but to advance it, to exchange for Christ, that their moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues may commence Christian Graces. 'Tis an elevation near the Kingdom of God, not a Translation into the Kingdom of God: 'Tis Nature improved, Nature renewed; 'tis a well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Picture without a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Life; an outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance, not an <hi>inward Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5. a form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. As a change is made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Cloth in the draught of a Picture, but no change in it by the conveyance of Life—You may have <hi>Adam</hi>'s Morality with <hi>Adam</hi>'s Corruption; a freedom from gross Vices, with a heap of spiritual Sins in your Hearts, as <hi>Adam</hi> had; but not a true Righteousness without the new <hi>Adam,</hi> the quickning Spirit. <hi>Therefore the highest Morality without a new Creation is but Flesh:</hi> all Men out of Christ agree in a fleshly Nature. 'Tis the highest thing in the rank of Flesh, but it is not yet mounted to Spirit. Water heated to the highest pitch is but Water still; and Morality in the greatest ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it, is but refined Flesh; an old Nature in an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er form. A profane Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a philosophical Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is purified Flesh reduced to some Sweetness, endued with a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94224:97"/>
fresh Colour, but wanting Life as much as before: It is an old Nature new mended, (or vampt) but a new Creature is Christ formed in the Soul. Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue colours the Skin, renewing Grace enlivens the Heart: <hi>that</hi> changeth the outward Actions, <hi>this</hi> the inward Affections: <hi>that</hi> paints the Man, <hi>this</hi> quickens him: <hi>that</hi> is a change indeed <hi>in</hi> the Flesh, not of the Flesh into Spirit; 'tis a new Action, not a new Creation.—It must needs be differenced from the new Creature, <hi>because its Birth is different.</hi> Moral Virtue is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by humane Industry, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Strength, frequent Exercises: 'Tis made up of Habits, engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by frequent Acts (Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>new Creature)</hi> But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is a Habit infused, which grows not upon the stock of Nature, nor is it brought forth by the strength of Nature: for Man being Flesh, cannot prepare himself to it. That may be the Fruit of Education, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Philosophy; this</hi> of the Spirit: that is a Fruit of God's common Grace, <hi>this</hi> of his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace: <hi>that</hi> grows upon the stock of Self-love, not from the Root of Faith, and a divine Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: <hi>that</hi> is like a wild Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Field, brought forth by the strength of Nature; <hi>this</hi> like a Flower in the Garden, transplanted from Heaven, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Christ, set and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Spirit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other being but the work of Nature, cannor bear the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of that Excellency which the Affections planted by the Spirit do: that is the Product

That</hi> is a cleansing the outward Flesh in the fear of Man, out of Reverence to Superiours (as 'tis said of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoash,</hi> he did that which was right, while he was under the awful Instructions of <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> 2 Kings 12. 2.)

                              </hi> It is an Expression of Men that fall away, whom he calleth afterward <hi>Swine</hi> and <hi>Dogs,</hi> unchanged for all this. Nature remaineth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; yet through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Christ, through the Dictates of the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Christ they leave these Sins, refrain from what they have a mind to. Yea, when they are thus sick, they have no mind to their Sins, that's more; yet it is but Nature improved still. For if you should be sick in Body, or in old Age, you will say of all your Pleasures, <hi>We have no pleasure in them,</hi> Eccl. 12. 1. So when a Man is sick in his Conscience, he is dead to all the Pleasures in the World, and yet this is not Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Lusts are not killed; for when he grows well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, his Lusis grow well with him, and gather up their crumbs.—In doing a Man shall have a great deal of Joy: for as the Heathens in doing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Light of their natural Conscience, had <hi>Peace,</hi> they had an excusing; so it is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. So if a Man in this case shall do good Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and reform his Life, the Holy Ghost will give him Joy. No Man shall do any thing for God, but he shall have a Reward, Joy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him. You know the <hi>stony Ground,</hi> they <hi>received the Word with Joy.</hi> Now then all Nature being thus wrought
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:94224:99"/>
upon, a Man falling thus a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reforming, and find ing himself thus kindly used to incourage him, Self-flattery in a Man makes up a Conclusion, that he is in a State of Grace. And the Principles of Nature being thus wrought upon by the Holy Ghost, thus doth a Man to be a Professor of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, lancheth forth, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on strongly; and yet all is but the Principles of Nature improved, and but an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the Spirit, that which indeed is the Point in hand. If there be such Principles in Nature which the Holy Ghost works with, raiseth and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateth so as he need not put in new Principles, but only stir Nature; the Holy Ghost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth indeed, but Flesh endeth. Then, my Brethren, such a Work as this doth not hold proportion with what the Text here speaks of, wherein a Man is raised up from Death to Life, as Jesus Christ was; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 19, 20. or whereby he is made a <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, created to good Works,</hi> as <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 10. for in all this working (if you mark it) there is but an artificial kind of working in comparison. As for example, to express the difference to you between one and the other; Go take an old piece of Cloth, by dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it you may raise a new tust upon it out of the old Piece, and it will seem new; but yet it is but the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple newly raised up. But come to the Work of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, what is it? It is not
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94224:99"/>
a dressing of the old Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it is a <hi>putting off the old Man, and putting on the new,</hi> that is the Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24. To dress the old Garment, to dress old Nature, and make it seem new; here is not a work now proportionable to the Creation. Here is but raising up the Principles there alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but to put it off, and to put on the new Man in all holy and gracious Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons suted to the spiritual part of the Word, this is by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>to put on the new Man which after God is created,</hi> &amp;c. Go, take any Man that hath had never so high a Work, where only the Principles of Nature have been wrought upon and improved, wound up to the highest; if God turn this Man truly to him, there needeth as much Power yet to do it, after all this that I have mentioned, as to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a World, as to raise up Christ from the Dead.

                           <p>Faith and Repentance are the principal converting Graces, and said to be the principal Conditions of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and to be (at least in Habit) antecedent to it: Hence it must follow that Man hath a Power of his own to repent and believe; both because the Law of Grace cannot require him to perform those Conditions of Justification which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to him, and which it self doth not promise shall be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              <pb n="162" facs="tcp:94224:100"/>
wrought in him, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the continuance of these Graces, and the reviving them when decayed, yea reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them when lost, all depend upon Man's own dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence altogether, being the compleat condition of Life. And there is the same reason that the beginning as well as the progress of Grace should be from our selves, and more, seeing it is harder to begin a good Principle and Practice, than to improve and continue it. Moreover, the late plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible opinion of the Sameness of special and common Grace being the same in their phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Nature, differing only morally, is directed to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to this Doctrine. By common Grace we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand those Inclinations or Dispositions in Men towards God before Conversion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can prevail with themselves to give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to God. By special Grace we mean those effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Dispositions whereby a Man is fully determined to love and please God. Now to say these are the same in their physical Nature, or in <hi>specie physica,</hi> is to say, they are the self-same Quality both in kind and number (in the same Subject) which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conversion, and is after; and that they differ morally, or <hi>specie morali.</hi> This only is meant, that it is not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or accepted with God for saving Grace for any part of the Condition of the New-Covenant, till it wholly turn
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94224:100"/>
and engage the Heart to God, tho before it was a truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Qualification not arising to that acceptable degree. Now then I demand, whether Man by his own Power doth ripen this common Grace to be effectual, and so saving, or not? If it doth (which surely these Authors intend) then he hath Power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert himself; if he hath not, but God worketh that saving degree in him, then the same Quality numerically is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural, wrought by Man's natural Power, and partly supernatural, wrought by the divine extraordinary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. One part is within the reach and compass of Nature, and so natural; the other is beyond the reach of Nature, and so supernatural. But this is absurd, for that which is properly natural, and that which is supernatural, do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly differ, not only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally but physically, yea not only <hi>specie</hi> but <hi>genere physico.</hi> Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi>'s <hi>Lutherus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divivus,</hi> p. 55, 56, 57.</p>
                           <p>It could not stand with God's holy Wisdom, to leave those he was pleased to choose unto Salvation to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their own Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Will, with such other Helps as they have in common with other Men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to hang the whole of his great Delign: for by such a Course it would not only be <hi>frustrable,</hi> but <hi>certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</hi>—That whatever things are requisite to Salvation, are given of God freely to all
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94224:101"/>
the Elect; <hi>and wrought ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually by the divine Power,</hi> as the necessary means of that Salvation, to which he hath appointed them.—Our Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, <hi>That the new Creature is God's Workmanship entirely and alone.</hi> This the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seems evident for: But being a Truth unacceptable to Nature; and there being some, who owning the <hi>Name</hi> deny the <hi>Thing;</hi> we must the more intently look to the proof of it: And our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it is this; That the new Creature must be wrought either by a <hi>divine</hi> Power, or by a <hi>natural</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or by the <hi>Concurrence of both together. It cannot be wrought by a natural Power;</hi> 1. Because it is a <hi>Creature;</hi> and of all Creatures the <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest</hi> and <hi>most excellent.</hi> All the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> in the World are not able to <hi>make</hi> an <hi>Atom:</hi> They may <hi>refine</hi> and <hi>sublimate</hi> things that <hi>are,</hi> but cannot <hi>give</hi> the least being to that which <hi>is not.</hi> How then should the natural Man give being to the new Creation? To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such a thing, would be a degrading to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a setting the Image of the <hi>heavenly</hi> below that of the <hi>earthly:</hi> for he that builds is worthy of more Honour than the thing that is built by him. 2. Nothing can afford <hi>[that]</hi> it hath not in it self: Now every Soul in Nature is Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and possest with an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual aversion from God: And Light is not brought out of Darkness, nor a clean thing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94224:101"/>
out of an unclean: No Man will expect Grapes from Thorns: the Product will be according to that of which it is produced, <hi>Mat. 7. 18. John</hi> 3. 6. Therefore the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being a divine thing, cannot be educed of natural Principles. 3. The natural Man is not only void of all Virtue and Property that tends to Regeneration, but is opposite thereto. To be graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the true Olive-Tree, is <hi>contrary</hi> to Nature: He is <hi>Enmity</hi> against God: and Enmity being a Principle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Reconcilement, it cannot be supposed it will help to destroy it self. <hi>They will not</hi> so much as <hi>seek after God, nor take him into their Thoughts.</hi> Satan they follow with natural Motion. But as for the Word of the Lord, they profess stoutly, they <hi>will not hearken</hi> unto it; so <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked are the Hearts of Men:</hi> Psal. 10. 4. John 8. 44. Jer. 44. 16. ch. 2. 25. ch. 17. 9. They are even made up of <hi>fleshly Lusts, which war against the Soul,</hi> and whatever hath respect to its happy Restore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Enmity is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and animated by the <hi>Darkness</hi> that is in them, which all Men in Nature are filled with, or with <hi>false Lights,</hi> which are equally pernitious and obstructive to this Work: By reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the most glorious Objects, tho just afore them, are hid from their Eyes; they do not, nor they <hi>cannot discern the things which are of God,</hi>

Substance and Kind. You may plant and prune, and dig and dung an evil Tree, bestow what cost and pains you will upon it, it does all but ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Production of evil Fruit: Just so doth the natural Man, even <hi>turn the Grace of God into Lasciviousness,</hi> Jude 4.

                              <hi>the Hills in a Balance?</hi> Isa. 40. 12, 13, 14, 15. He that made all things of nothing, cannot be supposed to need the aid of any. As Man had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in the Conception of Christ's humane Nature, but <hi>the Power of the most High</hi> was <hi>alone</hi> in that Work, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it is in <hi>forming Christ in us.</hi> Why should he call in the aid of another, unless deficient of himself? And he must greatly be streightned that takes in the help of an Enemy—If the Holy Ghost had need of Help, the Flesh affords not the least, for the natural Man is <hi>without Strength.</hi>

                           <p>The best natur'd Man in the World, until regenerated, is but <hi>Flesh;</hi> and <hi>all Flesh is Grass, and the Glory of it as the Flower of Grass,</hi> which fades in a Moment: It is <hi>an Arm that hath no Strength.</hi> And it is not only so in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it self, but it renders weak and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent whatever relies upon it, or may be used by it, for any spiritual end. A Straw in the hand of a Giant will make no deeper Impression, than if in the hand of a Stripling. The Law it self, <hi>which was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Life, is made weak through the Flesh,</hi> Rom. 8. 3.—If we should suppose the Flesh able, in any respect, to give assistance in this Work, the Holy Ghost would none of it: suppose a possibility of Conjunction, what would be the issue of it? <hi>When the Sons of God went in to the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Men, Giants were born of them,</hi> Gen. 6. 4.

by which Men are set above the rank of other Creatures; <hi>these</hi> do not contribute towards our divine <hi>Sonship: But, (4.)

God. Of like tenour is that of the Prophet, <hi>Thou hast wrought all our Works in us,</hi> Isa. 26. 12. and that of <hi>Paul, We are his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,</hi> Ephes. 2. 10.

it is worthy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. 1. What sort of <hi>Instruments</hi> were mostly used in this Work; not the <hi>learned</hi> but <hi>illiterate</hi> Men: And of these, <hi>such</hi> most eminently, as had neither Elegancy of Speech, nor majestick Presence: And the end of this was, that it might appear, and Men might be convinced, that <hi>their Faith stood not in</hi> (was neither made nor maintained by) <hi>the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Men, but the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God;</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 10. 1 Cor. 2. 3, 4, 5. 2.

                           <p>I know all Men will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that Holiness is from Gòd, it was never denied by <hi>Pelagius</hi> himself.

                           <p>That all those previous Dispositions wherewith our Hearts are prepared by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of common Grace, do not at all enable us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur by any vital Operation, with that powerful blessed renewing Grace of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whereby we become the Sons, of God. Neither is there any Disposition unto Grace so remote, as that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly it can proceed from a mere Faculty of Nature, for every such Disposition must be of the same Order with the Form that is to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, but Nature in respect of Grace, is a thing of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Allay, between which there is no Proportion: A good use of Gifts may have a Promise of an Addition of more, provided it be in the same kind.</p>

'Tis so great, that others cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it when 'tis offer'd, they are so far from having it in them, or counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or making this inward Work, that they cannot receive it; no not when the Spirit it self comes to work it; <hi>John 14. 17. The Spirit of Truth which the World
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94224:107"/>
cannot receive:</hi> it doth receive prophetical Gifts, and common Graces; but there is a higher and more divine Work which they cannot receive; <hi>Rom. 8. 7. 'Tis not subject, nor can be subject to the Law of God,</hi> where the Holiness of God appears. 4. 'Tis so great, that they cannot understand it what it is spiritually, only in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 14. Neither can he know them:</hi> and hence Men lie groping all their Life for Grace, and ask and have not, because they know not the thing that they would have: <hi>John 4. 10. If thou knewest thou wouldst ask, and he would give.</hi> A Beast cannot conceive what Life a Man leads.—<hi>Use 1. Of Confutation</hi> to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who in their Writings seek to shame the Churches of Christ, saying, that they deny all <hi>inherent Righteousness</hi> or <hi>Graces,</hi> making a Man just by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ, and in the mean while to remain like a Carcase or Ghost, or a Sepulchre full of Rottenness within. Three or four of these Archers that have shot these Arrows I have met with, whereby they wound the Heart of Profession, and keep the People in a professed Enmity and Opposition against the ways of God's Grace: Now we do not only deny this, but we profess that the Lord doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Riches of his Grace accept us in Christ, but out of the same Love sends down the Spirit of Grace, not only to make us civil and moral, or hypocritical, but that the Lord works thereby such a change as is not to be found in the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Hypocrites breathing. And we profess, tho our Justification doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in this, yet whoever hath not this, is not justified (whatever he may imagine) in the sight of God. And the Lord grant the Churches of the Lord Jesus may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver open the Mouths of those Elasphemers of his Name, in denying all Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in our selves at all; deny it to justify, deny it not altogether. <hi>Use 2. Of Confutation</hi> of an old <hi>Arminian</hi> Error; for they hold and maintain an <hi>inherent Righteousness,</hi> but that there is no difference between the Graces of Believers and Hypocrites, only in their continuance, and that that is by chance too, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>viz.</hi> if they hold on; and for this purpose cite many Scriptures, three especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that of <hi>Ezek. 18. 24. If the righteous Man forsake,</hi> &amp;c. which is spoken of rotten pharisaical Hypocrites falling far short of what the Saints have. And the Parable of the Seed, <hi>Mat. 13. They all sprang up:</hi> where it is manifest the Soil was naught, out of which they that fell away did grow. And <hi>Heb. 10. 29. Blood wherewith they were sanctified,</hi> which is meant of such as had some inward enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and lasting, and external Profession really, not in appearance only in them, yet not any saving and effectual Work: but thus by making Grace common they make it vile, and under a colour of making all Men watchful, they destroy all Faith in God's Faithfulness and Promise, especially until a Man come to die. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have many strong Arguments against them, and shew however there may be Decays and Relapses, Winter-Seasons of the Saints, yet ever there remains in them <hi>the Seed of God,</hi> 1 John 3. 9. John 4. 14. The main ground of this their Conceit hath been double. 1. False Observation, in beholding many fall off that were not Stars, but Snuffs, glorious Professors for a time.—2. A great mistake of the Work of Grace, together with their own experience; for they conceiving Grace to be but a mean thing, and not understanding it, because they never felt it in themselves, hence make no difference between one Man and another, and hence maintain Apostacy from Grace.—I grant indeed a Man may fall away from Grace, considering Grace without Christ to keep it.—<hi>Use</hi> 3. Hence we see the difference between the Graces of Hypocrites and Saints doth not only lie in the efficient Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of Christ <hi>barely</hi> considered in it <hi>self,</hi> for then there
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94224:108"/>
should be no difference at all; for there are not two Spirits, and the same Spirit that works in the faithful, the same Spirit is in the faithful to work many strange Works in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3, 4. neither doth supernatural Power of the Spirit distinguish (I mean that which is above the strength of Nature, nor that which is above the use of Nature, for Nature crooks all God's Works to it self) for the Gifts of Prophecy and common Joy are above the strength of mere Nature, but the difference lies in the Work it self. As 'tis in Creation, the least Spire of Grass hath the same Power to make it, that made Heaven and Angels; is there no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then? Yes, it lies in the very Work or Effect of that Power. And as 'tis in a Cedar and a Fly, there is more Excellency in the former in some respects, but the latter hath another Life, which the other hath not: so the meanest Believer is better than the most glorious Hypocrite. And look how it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was anointed King, there was a new Spirit come upon him, the Spirit of a King, which common Subjects had not: So when God makes us Kings and Priests unto Christ, there comes another Spirit upon us, which common Men have not. I know there is the Spirit it self in the Saints, as 'tis not in other Men; but how is it there? I know 'tis there by Faith, but not only by this, but by certain peculiar Effects which are not in other Men. As 'tis with the Soul, 'tis in the Body, hence works a Life which is not in any brute Creature, so 'tis here. And hence 'tis said, <hi>The World cannot receive him,</hi> John 14. 17. Mal. 3. 2, 3. <hi>Who is able to bear his coming, because he comes to purify,</hi> &amp;c. yet still the Spirit, barely considered in it self, puts no difference, unless it be in respect of the Work it self. O therefore look to it, do not say, I have now the Spirit and Christ. But what doth Christ work there? <hi>John</hi> 15. 1, 2. There are but two sorts of Branches there, fruitless and fruitful; the difference is in the very Fruits of them, <hi>&amp;c. Use</hi> 4. O then Terror to them that content themselves with common Works, and so think their Estates good. You have been terrified, confessed, and repented; <hi>Judas</hi> did so. You have reform'd many things, and take delight to draw nigh to God in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; those Hypocrites did so, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. You have seen nothing in your selves, the Devils do so. You have had great Ravishments, and seen the Glory of Heaven, of Saints; <hi>Balaam</hi> did so. You have beheld and seen the Lord Jesus, as if present on Earth: many saw him, heard him, and were lifted up to Heaven by him, and shall see him at last in Glory indeed. O but my Desires are good! many shall seek, and shall not enter. O therefore consider of your State, and tremble, and set before thee all the Mercy the Lord embraceth his People with! and say, O that Mercy for me! and follow him till he hath done it.

                              <hi>Paul</hi> was most sure of God's Grace, and his Justification thro Faith; he is perswaded that nothing can sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate him from the love of God in Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38. but he doth acknowledg, that he is not justified by his faithful Labours in the Gospel, or any other Works of his own, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho he were clear in Conscience.

                           <p>Hence it appears that it was the judgment of the primitive Church that Men should believe the Forgiveness of their own Sins—First of all here comes a common fault of Men to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked.

The Answer will be, I know and believe it. But ask him further: Dost thou believe the Pardon of thine own Sins? And then comes in a blind Answer, I have a good hope to God-ward, but
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94224:111"/>
I cannot tell, I think no Man can say so much: for God saith to no Man, <hi>Thy Sins are pardoned.</hi> But this is to speak flat Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to say they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and they cannot tell: and it bewrays exceeding Negligence in matter of Salvation.

                           <p>This is one of the grand Abominations of Popery, that it brings up the Souls of Men in a kind of continual Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.

                           <p>I said, that no Man in this transitory World is so strongly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propp'd, at least by the Certainty of Faith, that is, unless (as I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards expounded it) by Revelation, that he
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94224:112"/>
ought to be assured of his own Salvation. But now I protest before God, and acknowledg in my own Conscience, that they which are justified by Faith, have Peace towards God, that is, have Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God, and do stand in that Grace by Faith; therefore that they ought to be certain, and assured of their own Salvation even by the Certainty of Faith it self.—I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that Forgiveness of Sins is an Article of Faith, but not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, neither belonging to this Man nor that Man; that is (as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it) that no true faithful Man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can or ought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to believe that his Sins are forgiven: But now I am of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, and do free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confess, that every true faithful Man is bound by this Article of Faith, (to wit, <hi>I believe the Forgiveness of Sins)</hi> certainly to believe that his own particular Sins are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgiven him: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it follow hereupon, that that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Lord's Prayer (to wit, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our Trespasses)</hi> is needless; for in that Petition we ask not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Gift, but also the

doubt, how they shall come to Heaven, and how they shall escape Hell: but the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all these Doubts; because their Faith is grounded upon the Word of God, which teacheth them, that Christ ascended into Heaven for them, and that he died for them, they need none other to ascend to prepare them a way into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor to descend to suffer Death, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from Hell. 2. There is not then any Question remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Faithful of their Salvation, either by doubting how they shall go to Heaven, or in being afraid of Hell: but because our Faith is not here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, there may be some strife and wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Assurance of Faith and carnal Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: sometime the Faithful may make question, in wrestling and striving against carnal Distrust, saying, <hi>If God be with us, who can be against us?</hi> But at length Faith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth and triumpheth, resolving thus with the Apostle, <hi>who shall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us?</hi> 3.

expelleth not all Fear, but only the slavish and servile fear of Hell and Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, joined with Distrust and Torment of Conscience: yet a filial Fear and reverent Awe of God remaineth in the Servants of God, <hi>&amp;c.—</hi>A faithful Man must be considered, as consisting both of a spiritual and regenerate part, and of a carnal: then as in respect of the Goodness of God, apprehended by Faith, in our inward Man, we have Assurance not to fall; yet the Flesh continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally suggesteth doubtful Thoughts, and our carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity putteth us in fear, which notwithstanding is subdued by the strength of Faith: like as when one is set in the top of an high Tower, and looketh down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he cannot but fear, but yet considering the place where he standeth, which keepeth him from falling, he recovereth himself, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh his Fear: So Faith doth prevail against carnal Infirmity, and maketh us in the end to be out of doubt of our Salvation.

                              <hi>That Faith admits of Fears and Doubtings,</hi> is charged to be a Doctrine of the first Reformers, by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Lobb,</hi> in a late Piece of his, where Column-wise he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses it to his own created Antinomian Notions. What sort of Reformers he means, as to the Reality and Justice of his Charge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be such as have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the Rhemish An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations, I am at a loss; but if he designs herein, the first Protestant <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> Reformers, I must needs say, that he has cast as foul and unjust an Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon them, as could have dropt from the Pen of the most adulterating Papist, as equally reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby upon the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Doctrine, as upon their Understanding in its discriminating Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to distinguish not only between Truth and Error, but also between things of a different nature, yea of an essential Enmity one to the other. That Fears and Doubtings may be where true Faith is, is not to be denied; but that Faith ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Doubtings, such Fears as produce Doubtings in the Soul, is contrary to the Design of God in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94224:111"/>
Faith, contrary to the Nature and Office of Faith in it self and Operations, contrary to the Scripture where we find the most eminent of the Servants of God met with sharp Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs for entertaining such Fears as are inseparable from Doubtings; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the experience of his People in all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                           <p>See what Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> says of these <hi>Baxterians</hi> in his <hi>Lutherus Redivivus,</hi> Part 1. Assurance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life is a fruit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but this likewise is rendred impossible. 1. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, by the signs and evidences of true Grace, is impossible; seeing tho we have true Grace, and are sure we are sanctified, yet this Grace may be lost, and our inchoate Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion repealed. 2. Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by the special Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or sealing of the Holy Spirit, is accounted but a fancy of weak Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and some few injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious affectionate. Men: for Justification, and all the fruits of it, depending wholly upon the condition of final Perseverance, it is not proper nor probable, that any should have a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial witness of the Spirit that they shall be saved, lest it should hinder them in their diligence; nor is it sutable to a conditional Covenant. And if any should indeed have such a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94224:112"/>
Testimony, it is a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, not to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an ordinary fruit of Faith, as saith the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14. When you believed you were sealed with that holy Spirit of Promise, who is the earnest of our Inheritance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is pretended by some, that the sealing of the Spirit is no more than his Image, or Resemblance wrought upon the Soul in sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, as the Wax carrieth the resemblance of the Seal: If so, this Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could not be the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of our Inheritance, being so mutable a thing as Grace is supposed to be in this Life by these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. Nor could the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be said to seal us to the day of Redemption, when he only giveth us an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press of his own Likeness, which may be lost before the day of Redemption come. Besides, they do but strain the Allusion of a Seal; for tho every Seal makes some Impression, yet every Seal is not an Image or Resemblance of him that useth it; nor is every Image a Seal. The proper nature of a Seal is to be something that may give an authentick Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to our Word or Promise: 'tis not the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, but the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Seal, for such an use it is to be regarded; and therefore if the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94224:112"/>
of the Spirit be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from being an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Seal and Token of our Right to Life, it is excluded from being a Seal at all. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 69, 70, 71.

                           <p>Neonom. <hi>But when a Believer is examining his Heart and Life by the Word, the Holy Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens the Mind there to discern Faith and Love, and such other Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the Gospel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth to be the infallible signs of Regeneration: and he adds such Power to the Testimony of Conscience for the Truth and In-being of these Graces, as begets in a Soul a joyful sense of its comfortable State, and some comfortable Freedom from those Fears which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a doubting Christian: And according to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of these Graces, Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is ordinarily strong or weak.</hi>

                              <hi>Antinom.</hi> I observe now, tho you would let the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit have no hand in the Evidence of Faith, yet you need its help to enlighten about Signs and Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: I pray, how doth the Spirit enlighten here? Is it by any objective Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, or by any inward Dictate or Intimation? And cannot the Spirit as well enlighten the Mind
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94224:113"/>
to behold Christ in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise by an Act of Faith, as to behold Faith and Love in our selves? 2. You will not admit the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and embraced by Faith to Evidence, but that it seems the Heart and Life must be examined by the Word as a Rule. So that Assurance must be wrought by the Word as a Law, not as a Gospel, so far as you are come up to a Conformity to the Rule, not a Testimony of your Interest in the Grace of the Gospel. 3. You had need have the light of the Spirit to find an infallible sign in you too, tho they be declared in the Gospel. <hi>Hypocrites</hi> pretend to them, and you cannot tell whether you are any better than a <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> without an infallible Voice of the Spirit, (according to your Doctrine) for you must know that you shall perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in those Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and it's impossible for a Man to be assured till Death, or can be assured of his Perseverance till then, (all other signs will signify nothing) without an infallible Witness. 4. You must have a Power added by the Spirit to the Testimony of Conscience, that it may witness the Truth and In-being of Graces. What's the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it cannot witness the Truth of our In-being in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94224:113"/>
Christ, and add a Power to our Faith to believe even unto Assurance. 5. All this Examination, Illumination of the Spirit, Gospel De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may at last beget a joyful sense of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled State, you say; but according to you it cannot be Assurance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you cannot yet try by Perseverance; the Soul is in a little hopes it's in a probable way to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but cannot be assured he is in a sure State, or shall certainly be saved, because he must continue his justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied State by his Works: and therefore it's impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to try and find so far as to Assurance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath not perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, you'l say, it may be, he must believe his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, and be assured of it by Faith; then, I say, there's as much ground to believe and be assured by Faith of our Salvation. 6. You speak not of an Assurance in all you have said, but of some comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Freedom from Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable grounds. This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to more than Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at last, the only judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a contingent Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om; and you tell us else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where our State here is but of Trial, not decided, therefore there can be no Assurance at all in this Life. 7. You do well to add at last, that according to the Evidence of these Graces,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94224:114"/>
Assurance is ordinarily strong or weak: And may not that Assurance be so, which we call the Assurance of Faith? May it not be strong or weak, according to the Evidence that Faith gives in being strong or weak Faith?

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94224:114"/>
give Evidence of Pardon to a Sinner's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of it in an Act of Believing, before there be any Fruits of Faith? Was it not so with the Thief upon the Cross, and many that God pardons just upon the last Moment of their Lives? And is it not so with many of God's Children that can see no Evidences in themselves? The Spirit strips them of all grounds in themselves, and that gives a full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in objective Grace, with the full Assurance of Faith, that the Creature may be laid low, and Christ may be glorified.

                           <p>THE immediate end of the Exercise of this Diligence is, that we may attain <hi>to the full assurance of hope.</hi>—The Hope here intended is a <hi>certain assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Expectation of good things promised,</hi> through the accomplishment of those Promises, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>with a Love, Desire and Valuation of them.</hi> Faith respects the Promise, Hope the thing promised; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a Fruit and Effect of Faith; it being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acting of the Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards things believed as <hi>good, absent,</hi> and <hi>certain.</hi> Wherefore where our <hi>Faith</hi> begets no <hi>Hope,</hi> it is to be feared it is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine; and where our <hi>Hope,</hi> the Evidence or Assurance of our <hi>Faith,</hi> it is but <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</hi> Now this Hope concerns things absent and future, for as our Apostle saith, <hi>If we already enjoy any thing, why do we hope for it?</hi> And this is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of these things. God hath in his Promises de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Goodness, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and Grace, in the great things he will do unto all Eternity for Believers; namely, that they shall be perfectly delivered from every thing that is grievous
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94224:109"/>
or evil in Sin or Trouble, and be brought into the full enjoyment of everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory with himself. In these Promises Faith resteth on the Veracity and Power of God. Hereon the Soul considereth those <hi>good, things</hi> which are so promised, and now secured by Faith, as yet absent and unenjoyed. And the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Soul towards them in Desire, Love, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation, and certain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; is this <hi>Hope.</hi> There may be a pretence of <hi>great Hope</hi> where there <hi>is no Faith,</hi> as it is with the most. And there may be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of great Faith, where there is no true Hope, as it is with many. But in themselves these things are inseparable and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. It is impossible we should believe the <hi>Promises</hi> aright, but that we shall hope for the <hi>things promised.</hi> Nor can we hope for the <hi>things promised,</hi> unless we believe <hi>the Promises.</hi> And this discards most of that <hi>pretended Hope</hi> that is in the World. <hi>(As the hope of such that arises from such a Faith of Christ, as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely overthrows the whole design of God by him)</hi> it doth not proceed from, it is not resolved into Faith in the Promises, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Presumption.</p>
                           <p>Yea none have <hi>greater Hopes</hi> for the most part than such as have no <hi>Faith</hi>
                              <pb n="181" facs="tcp:94224:109"/>
at all. The great Use, Benefit and Advantage which Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have by this Grace, is the <hi>supporting of their Souls under the Troubles and Difficulties which they meet withal upon the account of the Profession of what they do believe,</hi> Rom. 5. 4, 5. 1 Cor 15. 19. 1 Thess. 1. 3. Hence in our Christian Armour it is called the <hi>Helmet,</hi> Eph. 6. 17. The Helmet of Salvation, that is, the <hi>Hope of Salvation,</hi> as it is expounded, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 8. Wherefore an assured Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of these things so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above and beyond what they (the <hi>Hebrews)</hi> lost or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent at present, was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary as to their Supportment, so to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement unto a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in their profession—There is the <hi>full assurance of this Hope.</hi> Hope hath its degrees, as Faith hath also. There is a <hi>weak</hi> or a <hi>little Faith,</hi> and a strong or great Faith. So there is an imperfect and a more perfect Hope. This <hi>full Assurance</hi> is not of the nature or essence of it, but an <hi>especial degree</hi> of it in its Improvement—There is such a degree attainable as is always <hi>victorious,</hi> which will give the Soul Peace at <hi>all times,</hi> and sometimes fill it with Joy. This therefore is the <hi>assurance of Hope</hi> here intended: Such <hi>a fixed, constant, prevailing Perswasion proceeding from Faith in the Promises, concerning the good things promised, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in them, and certain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them, as will support us and carry us comfortably through all the Difficulties and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94224:110"/>
Troubles we have to conflict withal.</hi> And without this it is not possible that we should car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on our Profession to the Glory of God and the Gospel in the times of Affliction and Persecution; for altho the least degree of sincere Hope will preserve from utter Apostacy, yet unless it be confirmed and fortified, and so wrought up unto this <hi>full Assurance,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but that great and sore Trials, Temptations and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions will at one time or another make such Impressions on our Minds, as to cause a <hi>manifold failing</hi> in the Duties of Profession, either as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to manner; as it hath fallen out with not a few sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Believers in all Ages. Object. 1. <hi>Whereas there are degrees in spiritual saving Graces and their Operations, we ought continually to press to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the most perfect of them.</hi> Not only are we to have <hi>Hope,</hi> but we are to labour for the <hi>assurance of Hope.</hi> It is one of the best evidences that any Grace is true and saving in its nature and kind; when we labour to thrive and grow in it, or to have it do so in us. This the Nature of the new Creature, whereof it is a part, inclineth unto; this is the end of all the Ordinances and Institutions of the Gospel, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 13. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alone do we bring Glory to God, adorn the Gospel; grow up into Conformity with Christ, and secure our own eternal Welfare.</p>
                           <p>Obsery. 2. <hi>Hope being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the due Exercise of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94224:110"/>
Faith and Love, will grow up into such an assurance of Rest, Life, Immortality and Glory, as shall outweigh all the Troubles and Persecutions that in this World may befal us, on the account of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession or otherways.</hi> There is nothing in the World so vain as that common Hope, whereby Men living in their Sins do make a reserve of Heaven when they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue here no longer. The more it thrives in the Minds of any, the more desperate is their Condition; it being only an endless Spring of Encouragements unto Sin. Its beginnings are usually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but small and weak; but when it hath been so far cherished as to be able to defeat the Power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, it quickly grows up into <hi>Presumption</hi> and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. But this Hope which is the Daughter, Sister, and Companion of Faith, the more it grows up, and is strengthned, the more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it is unto the Soul, as being a living Spring of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements unto Stability in Obedience. For it being once confirmed, it will on every occasion of Trial or Temptation give such a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Existence</hi> in the Mind unto future certain Glories, as shall deliver it from Snares and Fears, and confirm it in its Duty.

                           <p>
                              <hi>To be assured of a Mercy, is better than the enjoyment
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94224:111"/>
of a Mercy. Doubts of losing a Mercy,</hi> eat out the Heart: and a Man in that case is as much troubled with the fear of wanting, as he can be comforted with the sense of enjoying.—The first part of that great Blessing we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by Christ, consists in our Deliverance from Evil, or in a freedom from perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The second consists in the conveyance of Good to us, as Pardon of Sin, Grace, and Glory. But the third (which is the height of all) consists in our everlasting assurance to enjoy all this. <hi>Adam</hi> had a good Estate, but he was not assured of it; the Blessings we have by Christ are built upon a Foundation, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be shaken. Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> on <hi>Job,</hi> ch. 5. v. 24.</p>
                           <p>So we may answer these places; <hi>Prov. 28. 14. Blessed is the Man that feareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</hi> Phil. 2. 12. <hi>Work out your Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> These seem to call Christians to live in a doubtful Condition, or in a state of Trepidation, always fearing: but their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, not to keep the Soul from being settled by Faith in Christ, but from being highflown in any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our selves: or the Spirit speaks thus, not to put us upon doubts of our standing, but to preserve us from falling. For these Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are so far from oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Assurance, that they strengthen it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="185" facs="tcp:94224:111"/>
The way not to be afraid is thus to fear; nor are any so sure as they who thus tremble. They that are working out their Salvation with fear and trembling, may know without fear and trembling that they shall be saved: And they that thus fear always, may be assured that they shall be above fear for ever. But say some, the Preacher speaks out against this Knowledg, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>No Man knoweth Love or Hatred.</hi> It is true, <hi>not by all that is before him:</hi> We cannot know Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred from the Works of God without us; but we may know Love and Hatred by the Work of God upon us, or by the workings of God within us. We cannot fetch an Evidence that God loves us out of our Chests and Money-bags; nor can we read any Assurance or a Conveyance for Heaven, in the Assurances and Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of our Lands: but we may fetch this Evidence, and read this Conveyance from, and in the Covenant of Grace, received by Faith, witnessed and sealed to our Hearts by the Holy Spirit. Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> on <hi>Job</hi> 13. 18.</p>
                           <p>Because of the <hi>Immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of God's <hi>eternal Purpose</hi> in our <hi>Predestination,</hi> and his effectual <hi>gracious Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in the pursuit, and for the execution thereof, the <hi>Elect</hi> of God shall infallibly be carried through all, even the most dreadful Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94224:112"/>
that are made against them, and be at last safely landed in Glory. And there is no greater Incouragement to <hi>grow</hi> and persist in <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> than what is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by this <hi>Assurance</hi> of a blessed end and issue of it.—Those who have had <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> of that <hi>spiritual Slumber</hi> and <hi>Sloth</hi> which <hi>Unbelief</hi> will cast us under, of these Weaknesses, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and Despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, which <hi>Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Doubts, Fears,</hi> and <hi>Perplexities,</hi> of what will be the issue of things at last with them, do cast upon the Souls of Men, how <hi>Duties</hi> are discouraged, spiritual <hi>Endeavours,</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> impaired, <hi>Delight</hi> in God weakned, and <hi>Love</hi> cooled by them, will be able to make a right Judgment of the Truth of this Assertion. Some think that this Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the <hi>Immutability</hi> of God's purpose of <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Salvation of <hi>Believers</hi> on that account, tends only to <hi>Carelesness</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> in Sin; and that to be always in Fear, Dread, and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the end, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means to make us <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> unto Duties of <hi>Holiness.</hi> It is very sad, that any Man should so far proclaim his Inexperience and Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedness with the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Gospel-Grace,</hi> the <hi>Genius</hi> and Inclination of the <hi>New Creature,</hi> and the proper <hi>Workings</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as to be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94224:112"/>
able thus to argue, without a check put upon him by himself, and from his own <hi>Experience.</hi> It is true, were there no difference between <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Presumption,</hi> no difference between the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Liberty</hi> under the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace,</hi> and that of <hi>Bondage</hi> under the <hi>old Covenant;</hi> no Spirit of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption</hi> given unto <hi>Believers,</hi> no filial genuine <hi>Delight</hi> in and <hi>Adherence</hi> unto God, ingenerated in them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, there might be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Objection. But if the <hi>Nature of Faith,</hi> and of the <hi>new Creature,</hi> the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the one, and the Disposition of the other, are such as they are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and as Believers have experience of them in their own Hearts; Men do but bewray their Ignorance, whilst they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the <hi>Assurance</hi> of God's unchangeable <hi>Love</hi> in Christ, flowing from the <hi>Immutability</hi> of his Counsel in <hi>Election,</hi> doth any way impeach, or doth not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually promote the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry</hi> of Believers in all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Obedience.—Suppose a Man that is on a <hi>Journey</hi> knoweth himself to be in his <hi>right way,</hi> and that passing on therein, he shall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and infallibly come to his Journeys end, especially if he will a little quicken his <hi>speed,</hi> as occasion shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: Will you say, that this is enough to make such a Man <hi>careless</hi> and <hi>negligent,</hi>
                              <pb n="188" facs="tcp:94224:113"/>
and that it would be much more to his <hi>advantage</hi> to be <hi>lost</hi> and <hi>bewildred</hi> in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Paths and Ways, not knowing whither he goes, nor whether he shall ever arrive at his Journeys end? Common <hi>Experience</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the contrary, as also how <hi>momentary</hi> and <hi>useless</hi> are those violent Fits and Gusts of Endeavours, which proceed from <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,</hi> both in things <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>temporal,</hi> or <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> whilst Men are under the power of actual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression from such <hi>Fears,</hi> they will <hi>convert</hi> to God, yea that they will <hi>momento turbinis,</hi> and <hi>perfect Holiness</hi> in an instant. But so soon as that <hi>Impression</hi> wears off, (as it will do on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and upon none at all) such Persons are as <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> towards God, as the Lead or Iron which ran but now in a <hi>fiery Stream,</hi> is when the Heat is departed from it. It is that Soul alone ordinarily, which hath a <hi>comfortable Assurance</hi> of God's eternal immutable <hi>electing Love,</hi> and thence of the blessed <hi>End</hi> of its own Course of <hi>Obedience,</hi> who goeth on <hi>constantly</hi> and <hi>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in a course of <hi>Holiness,</hi> quickning his Course, and doubling his speed as he hath occasion from Trials or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. And this is the very design of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, to explain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. from the <hi>10th</hi> Verse unto the end of the

                              </gap>t appears from what hath been discoursed, that the <hi>electing Love</hi> of God is a powerful constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Motive</hi> unto <hi>Holiness,</hi> and that which proves invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly the <hi>necessity</hi> of it in all who intend the eternal <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment</hi> of God. But it will be said, That if it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed or granted, that those who are actually <hi>Believers,</hi> and have a sense of their <hi>Interest</hi> herein, may make the use of it that is pleaded; yet as for those who are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted,</hi> or are otherwise uncertain of their <hi>spiritual State</hi> and <hi>Condition,</hi> nothing can be so <hi>discouraging</hi> unto them as this Doctrine of <hi>eternal Election.</hi> Can they make any other Conclusion from it, but that, <hi>If they are not elected, all care and pains in and about Duties of Obedience are vain: If they are, they are needless?—</hi>1.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94224:114"/>
whereas this is a matter of great and <hi>eternal Moment</hi> unto our <hi>Souls,</hi> and there is no way to secure our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> in it, but by the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of its <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> which are saving <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holiness;</hi> we will, we must, it is our duty to use our <hi>utmost</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, by attaining of them, and growth in them, to make our <hi>Election sure.</hi> And herein, if we be <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> and <hi>diligent,</hi> we shall not fail. Others, (2.) may conclude, that if it be so indeed, that those who shall be <hi>saved</hi> are <hi>chosen</hi> thereunto, <hi>before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World.</hi> Then it is to no purpose to go about to <hi>believe</hi> or <hi>obey,</hi> seeing all things must fall out at last according as they were fore-ordained. Now I ask, which of these Conclusions is (I will not say <hi>most suted</hi> unto the Mind and Will of God, with that Subjection of Soul and Conscience which we owe to his <hi>soveraign Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> but whether of them is) the <hi>most rational,</hi> and most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Principles of sober <hi>Love of our selves,</hi> and Care of our immortal Condition? Nothing is more certain than that the latter Resolution will be infallibly destructive (if pursued) of all the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Concernments</hi> of our Souls; Death and eternal Condemnation are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94224:114"/>
Issues of it. No Man giving himself up to the Conduct of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, shall ever come to the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of God. But in the other way, it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible at least, that a Man may be found to be the Object of God's <hi>electing Love,</hi> and so be saved. But why do I say it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible?

            <p>The <hi>Hebrews</hi> have three special Words, whereby they express the nature of true justifying Faith, as touching the certainty of it. One is <hi>Emun,</hi> which signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Faith, the Root whereof is <hi>Aman,</hi> which signifieth to nourish: To which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> alludes, <hi>Psal. 37. 3. Trust in the Lord and do good, so shalt thou dwell in the Land, and thou shalt be in</hi> (in the Original, <hi>fed by Faith)</hi> word for word as <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius</hi> renders it. And <hi>John</hi> 6. the Lord joineth believing on him, and feeding on him, together, as both one: Now this word which the Hebrews use for Faith, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth also Truth, or that which is firm, stable or settled. And what can be more firm or certain than Truth? The Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. 9. hath a very elegant Exposition of this word: <hi>If ye believe not, ye shall not be established:</hi> To believe and to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, both coming of the same Root in the Original. Hence also cometh the word <hi>Amen,</hi> used in all Languages, which is a Note of Believing, and assenting to the Truth, and as it were sealing it unto us: 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 20. For all the Promises of God in Christ are Yea, and in him Amen,</hi> &amp;c. that is most true and certain. Faith therefore is no doubtful Conjecture, or wavering Hope, but a most certain Belief, firm as Truth it self.—Another word used by the <hi>Hebrews</hi> for Faith is <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ach,</hi> which signifieth Trust, Security, Confidence and Affiance.—As <hi>Isa.</hi> 32. 17. where speaking of the full Revelation of the Gospel in the coming of Christ in the Flesh, he saith, Then the Work of Righteousness shall be Peace, and the effect of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, Quietness, and Assurance, and Security for ever, as the vulgar Latin renders it. Note here, that the effect of the Righteousness of God's Saints is Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Security in Believing.—The third word used in the Old Testament for Believing is <hi>Chassah,</hi> which signifieth so to believe, trust or confide in God, as to make him our sure Sanctuary and Resting-place, under whose Protection the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is safe and secure, as the Chicken under the Wing of the Hen; as we read this word used in <hi>Ruth</hi> 2. 13. (the words of <hi>Boaz</hi> to <hi>Ruth) The Lord recompence thy Work, and a full Reward be given thee of the Lord God of</hi> Israel, <hi>under whose Wings thou art come to trust;</hi> Hebr. <hi>Lachasoth.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> useth the same word in the same Phrase of Speech, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 7. As the Lord useth the same comparison to the unbelieving Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. Thus we see the true nature of Faith, as it is expressed by significant Words in the Old Testament; all of them setting forth the Certainty and Assurance of Faith in God.—Come we to the new Testament: where let us begin with that excellent Description, which the Apostle makes of saving and justifying Faith, peculiar to the Saints of God, of whom he setteth down an ample Catalogue in <hi>Heb. 11. 1. Faith is the Substance of things hoped for, and the Evidence of things not seen.</hi> The Greek Text is very emphatical and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant. 1. Therefore to acquit this Faith from being that which the <hi>Pontificians</hi> would have it to be, to wit, a mere historical Faith, common with Reprobates and Devils, the Apostle shews the Object of it to be, <hi>things hoped for, things not seen:</hi> such as he meaneth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. which fall not within the reach of that Faith, which is common to the wicked, who are altogether hopeless, and love not the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore the Faith he described, is the Faith of God's Elect alone, who only have the hope of eternal Life. 2. This Faith is called the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> (as also the Vulgar Latin hath it) or Substance of things hoped for: that is, Faith makes those things that are hoped for to be sure and certain, as if they were already in our Possession; or Substance is as much as an under-prop or <hi>Basis,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and sustaining us with constant Patience, in the assured expectation of those things hoped for, as yet unseen. So that it signifieth a most stedfast Unmoveable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94224:115"/>
of Faith. As, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58. It is called also an <hi>Evidence,</hi> Demonstration or Argument (as the vulgar Latin) of things not seen. Now what is more sure and certain than an Evidence or plain Demonstration? Whereupon <hi>Chrysotom</hi> upon these words saith, O what an admirable word he useth, saying the Argument of things not seen! For an Argument or Demonstration is in things most manifest. Therefore Faith is a Vision of things not appearing, and it brings us to the same Certainty to the which we are brought by the things which are seen. So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the Object of things, which are seen, can it be called Credulity or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity: Nor again can it be called Faith, but when a Man hath Certainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these things which are not seen, more than concerning those things which are seen. For because those things which are yet in hope are reputed as yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Substance or Subsistence, and Faith giveth unto them their Substance; not that it adds any thing unto them, but it self is the Substance or Subsistence of them: for the purpose, the Resurrection is not yet fulfilled, nor yet present or subsistent, but Faith makes it to subsist in our Souls: this is that which the Apostle calleth <hi>Substance,</hi> so <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> Yea, this word <hi>Substance,</hi> as it importeth a subsisting, signifieth also <hi>ani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>um praesentem,</hi> a Confidence of full Assurance of the Mind. And it is sometimes used in Authors for a fastning or close-joining together, as a Joint, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a fast juncture. And such is Faith, which joineth the Object and the Subject together, making the things hoped for to be as it were in our present possession. It is also the Evidence of things not seen, presenting them visibly and sensibly before us; like a most clear perspective Glass, which presents and attracts as it were the most remote Objects nearer to the eye, for the clearer view of it. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> and those other Saints of the Old Testament, saw these invisible things afar off with the eye of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. and were perswaded of them, and embraced them.—Thus if saving and justifying Faith be the Substance, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, the Assurance, the Confidence, the Coherence of things hoped for; if the Evidence, the Argument and Demonstration of things not seen, prepared for such as love God, and revealed to us by the Spirit: How then is not this Faith most sure and certain of Justification and eternal Salvation?

                           <p>—SO that the strength of Faith takes in the strength of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it puts Christ into a Man, who by his Spirit dwelleth and liveth in us. And here it is worth our observing, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the House in the Parable did stand firm
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94224:116"/>
against all Tempests, was because it was founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Rock. Why! may not a weak Superstruction of rotten and inconsistent Materials be built upon a sound Foundation? As a strong House falls from a weak Foundation, may not in like manner a weak House by a Tempest fall from a strong Foundation? Surely in Christ's Temple it is not as in ordinary material Buildings. In these tho the whole Frame stand upon the Foundation, yet it stands together by the strength of the Parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, and therefore their mutual Weakness and Failings do prejudice the stability of the whole. But in the Church, the strength of Christ the Foundation is not an immanent, perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, fixed thing; but a derivative and an effused Strength, which runs thro the whole Building: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Foundation being a vital Foundation, is able to shed forth and transfuse its Stability into the whole Structure. Whatever the Materials are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, tho never so frail, yet being once incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Building, they are presently transformed into the Nature and Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Foundation. To whom coming as unto a living <hi>Stone,</hi> saith St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ye also as <hi>lively Stones</hi> are built up a spiritual
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94224:116"/>
House; to note unto us the Transformation and Uniformity of the Saints with Christ, both in their spiritual Nature, and in the firmness and stability of the same.—<hi>God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> flowing from his Love and Grace. <hi>An everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant will I make,</hi> saith God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. And observe how it comes to be everlasting, and not frustrated or made tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary by us: <hi>I will not turn away from them,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>to do them good.</hi> True, Lord, we know thou dost not repent thee of thy Love; but tho thou turn not from us, O how frail, how apt are we to turn away from thee, and so to nullify this thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Mercy unto our selves? Nay, saith the Lord, <hi>I will put my fear into their Hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</hi> So elsewhere the Lord tells us, that his Covenant shall be as the <hi>Waters of</hi> Noah, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 9, 10. The Sins of Men can no more utterly cancel or reverse God's Covenant of Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, than they can bring back <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood into the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: tho for a moment he may be angry, and hide his face, yet his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the main is great and everlasting. The Promises of God, as they have Truth, so they have Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in them; they do not
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94224:117"/>
depend upon our Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether they shall be executed or no; but by Faith apprehending them, and by Hope waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in them, they frame and accommodate the Heart to those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which introduce their Execution. God maketh us to do the things which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, we do not make him to do the things which he promiseth; 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 15. 1 Corinth. 2. 5. John 6. 45. Mal.</hi> 3. 6. It is nothing in or from our selves, but only the Immutability of my Grace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, which preserveth you from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.—<hi>Christ's Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are ours:</hi> He overcame the World, <hi>John</hi> 16. 33. and Temptations, <hi>Heb. 4. 15. Mat.</hi> 4. 11. and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Col. 2. 15. Luke</hi> 11. 22. and Sins for us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13, 14. And therefore they shall not be able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him in us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 18. He who once overcame them for us, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly subdue them in us: he that will overcome the last Enemy, will overcome all that are before; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 26. For if any be left, the last is not overcome.—We have the benefit of Christ's <hi>Intercession: I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.</hi> It is spoken of a saving Faith, as the Learned prove at
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:94224:117"/>
large. And I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before that particular Promises in Scriptures are universally appliable to any Man whose Case is parallel to that particular.—The sum of all is this, since we stand not, like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> upon our own bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, but are Branches of such a Vine as never wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Members of such a Head as never dies, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in such a Spirit as cleanseth, healeth, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth the Heart, Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of such Promises as are sealed with the Oath of God: since we live not by our own Life, but by the Life of Christ; are not led or sealed by our own Spirit, but by the Spirit of Christ; do not obtain Mercy by our own Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but by the Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ; stand not reconciled unto God by our own Endeavours, but by the Propitiation wrought by Christ; who loved us when we were Enemies and in our Blood, who is both willing and able to save us to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost, and to preserve his own Mercies in us; to whose Office it belongs to take order that none who are given unto him be lost; undoubtedly that Life of Christ in us, which is thus under-propp'd, tho it be not priviledg'd from Temptations, no not from Backslidings, yet is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding Life: He who raised

                           <p>But as great a Benefit as it is, that they <hi>(the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God)</hi> shall continue to the end; yet if the Lord would hide it from them, and keep them from the Knowledg of it, it
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94224:119"/>
should be much lesser: and therefore this is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be added, that they which know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be the Lord's, may also know, that they shall be preserved and kept safe against all adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Power of the Devil and his Instruments, and so persevere unto Death. For altho it seems to be a Mystery and a Secret, that the determinate Will and Counsel of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Matter should be known; yet it is a Secret unto such only as lie in Darkness and in the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death, which thro Unbelief are not able to fee into it, because it is a Mystery: but the Secret of the Lord is not hidden from his own Servants, but shall in time be revealed unto them, whom because he calleth his Friends, therefore he sheweth them his Will and Mind in the most precious Secrets which it is expedient for them to know; 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 3. Psal. 25. 14. John</hi> 15. 15. for by often hearing the Doctrine of <hi>Perseverance</hi> plainly preached unto them, God draweth their Hearts to believe it: that as they hear the Lord will perfect the good Work which he hath begun in his People, and withal as they do know themselves to be his People, so they hold this in Perswasion, tho they see not how by any thing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94224:120"/>
in themselves, that he will continue his favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them unto their end. For they which know that they shall have eternal Life, must needs also know that they shall be kept by God in this present World from all Power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil which might hinder them from it; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4, 5. But all Believers may and ought to know, that they shall have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; as 1 <hi>John 5. 13. I write unto you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ye may know that ye have eternal Life.</hi> Therefore they may know, that they shall be kept to the end, that they may also enjoy the same.—Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, to perswade this Point more strongly to God's Children (of whom many are long held in doubting of the same) and for that it is flatly denied by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ought not to doubt of this, but that as God hath been with other of his Servants, in all Ages; <hi>Josh.</hi> 1. 5. so he will be with us that are his in this Age, or which shall be his hereafter.—When God's Children set a deep and due Consideration of the mighty Power of God against their own Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousness and Frailty, and against the strength of the Devil and World: Again, when they weigh the force of God's Promise, who hath warranted a good
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94224:120"/>
end unto them, and the many helps by which God hath provided to bring them well home; they rest quietly, cast their Care upon him, and trust that he which hath said it, will also do the same. The which Perswasion when they have once fastned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and the ofter they think on it the more surely they shall hold it) it is hard to say, how it revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and gladneth their Hearts: It is a Treasure invaluable, when they once soundly know it (as they can best tell the price and value of it, who have sometimes doubted of it, and have felt extream An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish thereby) who, if they might have been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of it in some former Fears and Distress, would have preferred it before the greatest Commodities. These therefore, when they once know and believe it, receiving it with such Joy, as I have said, do not (as carnal Men imagine they will) abuse this precious Liberty to Loosness and Licentiousness, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding what they do, or how carelesly they look to themselves, seeing they have a Promise from God, that they shall <hi>persevere</hi> in his Favour and in a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life unto their end. They do not, I say, by this occasion wax slothful, worldly, idle, vain, or any other way seek to

                           <p n="1">1. The Gifts of God are without Repentance; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 31.

                           <p n="6">6. He that falleth from Faith, sinneth unto Death: but the Faithful are born of God, and cannot sin unto Death, because their Seed remaineth in them, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9. they therefore cannot fall finally from the Faith.</p>
                           <p n="7">7.

And yet that none are saved without more (i. e. <hi>of that which is loseable)</hi> but that upon this first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree they have a Right to Salvation, and that their further Holiness shall be given them to whom God will, as part of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; to which they have Right: At furthest at Death, in the same time and manner as perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and Mortification of Sin is given to Believers that are till Death imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. A <hi>loseable degree of Holiness,</hi> like <hi>Adam</hi>'s, may be the way to <hi>more</hi> in all that so die.—Now some hold <hi>all these loseable:</hi> some hold only the <hi>last not loseable;</hi> and almost all hold the first loseable. Now, 1. What if we think that Infants <hi>first Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> besides relative <hi>(Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and <hi>jus ad impunita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem &amp; regnum)</hi> is but of the <hi>first degree?</hi> Tho a mere <hi>moral Power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> be not enough to the <hi>Adult,</hi> because the <hi>Act</hi> is necessary to them, yet say Protestants, the <hi>Habit</hi> is not necessary to their <hi>first Covenant-Right,</hi> but is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Spirit in <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification as a Covenant-Benefit.</hi>
                              <pb n="195" facs="tcp:94224:116"/>
And why may not Infants be in a pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed State, that at first have but that Grace which giveth a <hi>moral Power</hi> to believe when they come to age? Consider of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I have so fully else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where proved, That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants <hi>Church-membership</hi> was instituted both in the Covenant of Innocency, in the first Edition of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace,</hi> in the Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in the <hi>last Edition</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace by Christ, and also that God never had a Church on Earth, of which Infants were not Members: If the adult Members had Infants <hi>(and so both Fathers and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, even the Church of Christ in all Generations, if they made not use of this their moral Power,</hi> might be damned with their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Graces) Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s <hi>end of Doct. Controv.</hi> ch. 19. § 22, 24, 25. But if <hi>there be such</hi> a Power given, which never acteth Faith (which I think most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) it is either in the <hi>Adult</hi> or <hi>Infants:</hi> If in the <hi>Adult,</hi> no doubt it's lost; for they that <hi>will not believe</hi> (to the last) retain <hi>not still the moral Power</hi> in their Rebellion. But in the <hi>case of Infants,</hi> I think those of them that <hi>die before the use of Reason</hi> lose it not, nor any of the <hi>Elect</hi> that live to full Age:
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94224:117"/>
But as to <hi>others,</hi> after long doubt, <hi>How far Infant-Grace is loseable,</hi> this seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth now the most probable Solution to me, <hi>viz.</hi> There is a Grace that reacheth but to a <hi>moral Power</hi> to repent and believe, before Men have the <hi>Act</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Habit:</hi> Such Grace <hi>to persevere,</hi> did put <hi>Adam</hi> in a <hi>present state of Life,</hi> or Acceptation with God, this <hi>Adam</hi> lost: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly such Grace that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth but this <hi>moral Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> in an Infant's Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (with <hi>relative</hi> Grace of Pardon) is sufficient to prove his <hi>Right to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> if he so die; because he is not <hi>bound to the Act,</hi> nor <hi>capable of it;</hi> and even the <hi>Adult</hi> upon the <hi>Act</hi> have Right to <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to cause the <hi>Habit,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature, before they <hi>have the Habit.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Infants may be in a state of <hi>such Right</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> before the <hi>Habit,</hi> tho they shall not <hi>possess</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without it: And yet the Adult are not in a state of <hi>such Right</hi> by the <hi>mere Power,</hi> before the <hi>Act,</hi> because the <hi>Act it self</hi> is made necessary to <hi>their</hi> Justification; but so it is not to <hi>Infants:</hi> so that Infants and <hi>Adult</hi> may receive a <hi>more Power</hi> to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>believe,</hi> and lose it after (at age) by actual Sin, tho this be a loss of <hi>a state of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

to the <hi>one sort</hi> (their Sins of <hi>Nature</hi> being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned) but not to <hi>the other</hi> (who are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned without the Act) and yet it followeth not hence, that the Grace of <hi>habitual Sanctification</hi> is lost in any.—Others say only that Men may sin, and may lose <hi>acquired Grace,</hi> but no <hi>degree</hi> of that which is <hi>infused.</hi> But we have small Reason to think that our <hi>encreased degrees</hi> are not as <hi>much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused</hi> as the <hi>first degree</hi> was: And yet Experience proveth, that such <hi>added degrees may be lost.—Are all or most Christians cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they shall perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere?</hi> No, for, 1. <hi>Most</hi> Christians in the World hold, that Perseverance is uncertain to the godly; and how can they be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it to themselves? 2. Most that hold other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, hold it but as <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and are not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves certain that it is true, tho they call it <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:</hi> I am uncertain; and I find not by other signs that the most have more Knowledg than my self: And he that is not certain of the <hi>Premises,</hi> is not <hi>by them</hi> certain of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion—that most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have not the Comfort of their own certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, for want of the Certainty of their Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if not of the Doctrine it self.—That Thousands

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94224:118"/>
or that he shall not kill his dearest Friend, or himself: and yet when a Man is conscious that his Nature, his Reason, his Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and his Resolution, do all make him hate such a wicked Act, and that there is no probable Cause to move him to it, and when we know God is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with his Grace to help us, how few lose the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Perseverance</hi> hath its Difficulties too, as to Man's Comfort: for he that holdeth, that no Man falleth from a State of Grace, and seeth many, that to all possible humane Judgment, were once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Persons, fall quite away, can himself have no Assurance that he is so much as justified at the present, unless he be sure that he is better than the best of all those Persons ever were, which doubt the other side are not cast upon. <hi>Ibid.</hi> ch. 26. §. 4, 5, 6, 11, 18, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29.</p>

                              <hi>What was the Judgment of the antient Churches of this Point? (viz.</hi> Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) <hi>Answ. Vossius</hi> in his <hi>Pelagian</hi> History hath tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told you, and copiously proved it in the main: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Augustine</hi>'s time that it was taken commonly as
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94224:121"/>
granted, that Men might fall away from a state of Grace, and that many did; but the case was not curiously discussed: But some thought that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Christians never fell: But upon <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Disputes, <hi>Augustine</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Honour of Free Grace, laid all upon Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and maintained, that tho the Non-elect did fall away from the <hi>Love</hi> of God and Justification, and a state in which they had been saved, had they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet none of the Elect did fall so as to perish, but that the Preservation of Grace in Perseverance was the fruit of Election. Thus <hi>Prosper, Fulgentius,</hi> after him; and some Passages in him and <hi>Macarius,</hi> and some others, intimate that they thought there was a <hi>confirmed</hi> Degree of Grace, which was never lost; but they all took it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that some fell from a <hi>state of Justification,</hi> and perished. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not one Writer that I have read and noted, to be of the contrary Mind for a thousand years after the writing of the Scriptures, nor any mention of any Christian that was so.—What use is to be made of this, I leave to others; but it beseemeth no good Man to deprave or deny the Truth of such Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And some great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are to be blamed for
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94224:122"/>
reproaching <hi>Vossius</hi> for a true historical Report, when they neither can confute him, nor attempt it. Two or three Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences out of <hi>Austin</hi> are cited by some, but merely mistaken, as if they spake that of all the Justified, which he speaketh only of the Elect. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>end of doct. Controv.</hi> ch. 26. §. 22, 33.</p>
                           <p>Thus the Justified in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s judgment and false Representation of <hi>Arstin,</hi> may be damned, but the Elect shall not; his Reason is plain from the whole Current of his Writings, for that Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is Justification, and Perseverance to the end is the compleating of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, upon which it is that Election is determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But to this I shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join what Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in the Preface to his <hi>Saints Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance</hi> notes against Mr. <hi>John Goodwin</hi>'s like deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Austin.—</hi>
                              <q>I doubt not but the <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reader</hi> will easily perceive it to be no other than that which is now agitated between me and Mr. <hi>John Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win:</hi> the Controversy indeed in the matter between <hi>Austin</hi> and the <hi>Pelagians</hi> was reduced to three Heads. 1. As to the <hi>Foundation of it,</hi> which <hi>Austin</hi> concluded to be the <hi>Decree of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination,</hi> which they
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94224:122"/>
denied: the <hi>impulsive Cause</hi> of it, he proved to be the Free Grace of God, <hi>and the measure of quality of that Grace</hi> to be such, as that whoever received it, did persevere, it being Perseverance which was given, both which they denied. About the <hi>kind of Faith,</hi> which temporary Professors might have, and fall from it, which were never elected, there was between them no Contest at all. That Perseverance is a Gift of God, and that no Man either did, or could persevere in Faith and Obedience upon the strength of any Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but that the whole was from his Grace.—This is the Foundation that he lays of the Doctrine of the <hi>Perseverance of Saints:</hi> that it is a Gift of God, and that such a Gift as he effectually and actually works in him on whom he doth bestow it.—<hi>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained you to bear Fruit. Eis</hi> (saith he) <hi>non solùm justitiam, verùm aliam in illâ perseverantiam dedisse monstravit. Christo enim sic eos ponente ut eant, &amp; fructum afferant, &amp; fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus eorum manent quis au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat dicere forsitan non ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebunt?</hi> Tho they dare say so, who also dare to pretend his Authority for what they say! How falsly, how unjustly, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94224:123"/>
to all serious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of his Mind and Spirit, in and about the things of the Grace of God.—He further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly taught this <hi>Gift</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> to be a fruit of <hi>Predestination</hi> or <hi>Election,</hi> and to be bestowed on <hi>all</hi> and only elected Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.—And unto these <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, predestinate Believers,</hi> he concluded still, that Perseverance was so given in and for Christ, so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Will of God wrought by such an Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Grace, that it was impossible that they should not persevere.—In this Perswasion he had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Consent of all the sound and orthodox Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in his time, as was before manifested; but he is followed also by the <hi>School-men</hi> of all Ages, and not forsaken of some of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> themselves.—There are in <hi>Austin,</hi> and those that either join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, or followed immediately after him, sundry Expressions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly urged by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of the Truth in hand, granting many who were Saints, believing and regenerate, to fall away and perish for ever. I need not instance in any of their Sayings to this purpose: The Reader knows where to find them together to his hand, in <hi>Vossius, Grotius,</hi> and Mr.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94224:123"/>
                                 <hi>John Goodwin</hi> from them.

                           <p>The Gifts and Calling of God may be said to be without Repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause let Men continue the same Persons which they were when the Donation or Collation of any Gift was first made by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, he never changes or altereth his Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards them, unless it be for the better, or in order to their further Good, in which case he cannot be said to repent of what he had given: but in case Men shall change and alter from what they were when God first dealt graciously with them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they shall notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously degenerate or cast away the Principles, or divest themselves of that very Qualification on which as it were God grafted his Benefit or Gift, in this case tho he recal his Gift, he cannot be said to repent of his giving it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the terms on which he gave it please him still, only the Persons to whom he gave it, and who pleased him when he gave it them, have now rendred themselves unpleasing to him.

                           <p>If the Apostle should frame this Series or Chain of Divine Acts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. with an intent to shew or teach the Uninterruptible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94224:126"/>
of it, in what case or cases soever he should fight against his general and main scope or design in that part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which lieth from <hi>ver.</hi> 17. which clearly is this, to encourage them to Constancy and Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in suffering Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For to suggest any such thing, as that being called and justified, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could hinder them from being glorified, were to furnish them with a ground, on which to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his Exhortation; for who will be perswaded to suffer Tribulation for the obtaining of that which they have sufficient Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance given, that they shall obtain, whether they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer such things or no? therefore certainly the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle did not intend here to teach the Certainty of Perseverance in those that are justified. And, Lastly, this demonstrates the same thing yet further. If God should justify all without exception whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and that against all bars of Wickedness and Unbelief, possible to be laid in his way by those who are called, then might ungodly and unbelieving Persons inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God: the reason of the Connexion is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it being a known Truth, that the Persons justified are in a condition or present capacity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94224:126"/>
the Kingdom of God. <hi>Ibid.</hi> §. 44.</p>
                           <p>It hath not been proved by any Man, nor I believe never will be, that the Calling here spoken of imports any such Act or Work of God, whereby the Called are irresistibly necessitated savingly to believe. If it import no such thing as this, what hinders but that the Persons mentioned might have been called by that very kind of Calling here spoken of? Suppose it be granted, that the Calling here spoken of is that kind of Calling which is always accompanied with a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Answer of Faith, yet neither doth this prove, but that even such Called ones may obstruct and prevent by Wickedness and Unbelief their final Justification, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently their Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: If so, then that Chain of Divine Acts or Decrees here framed by the Apostle, is not indissolvable in any such Sense, which imports an Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and universal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion or Execution of the latter, whensoever the former hath taken place. <hi>Ibid.</hi> §. 45.</p>
                           <p>But some it may be will further object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94224:127"/>
given, and plead, that the Contexture between these two links of this Chain, Predestination to a Conformity with Christ, and Calling, is simply and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely indissolvable, so that whoever is so predestinated, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails of being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. 2. That it is altogether unlikely, that in one and the same Series of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Actions, there should not be the same Fixedness or Certainty of Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between all the Parts. <hi>Ibid.</hi> §. 46.</p>

of God's Elect, being once regenerate and believing, are and shall invincibly be carried on, to the perfect obtainment of Blessedness and Glory.—For the final Perseverance of Believers, a principal Argument is fetch'd from the <hi>sovereign Decree of Election.—</hi>It was not any loveliness in elect Persons which moved God to love them at first; so neither shall their unlove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Backslidings deprive them of it, (tho it may be eclips'd, by their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, to the breaking of their bones.)

cautionary Words else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where delivered, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17.—There are Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions enough, and of great weight, why Believers should take heed of falling, without supposing a total Loss of their Faith (the breaking of a Man's <hi>Bones,</hi> is ground sufficient for such a Caution, altho he be sure that his <hi>Neck</hi> shall be safe) the Dishonour done to his Father; the shame that is put upon Christ; grieving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter; scandalizing the good ways of God; stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the weak; strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Wicked; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting of him for his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; interrupting his Peace and Communion with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every of which will weigh deep with a Soul that is born of God.—<hi>A righteous Man may turn away from his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; and that so, that he shall die for it,</hi> Ezek. 18. 24. There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Righteousness. 1. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; such as <hi>Paul</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Conversion: <hi>This</hi> a Man may continue in to the last, and yet not be saved. 2. There is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Righteousness: (1.) <hi>Imputed;</hi> This is the Righteousness of Christ, by which we are justified. (2.) <hi>Infused;</hi> This is the divine Nature communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the Spirit of Christ, whereby we are sanctified: These two go inseparably, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94224:117"/>
be lost. But the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness spoken of in the place objected, seems to be of the former sort, <hi>viz.</hi> moral or <hi>outward Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:</hi> for outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law was their condition of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing the Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> with long Life and Prosperity in it.—<hi>The Promise of Perseverance is not made to Faith, that that shall not fail: but in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Favour of God,</hi> viz. <hi>That if Men go on to believe, they shall abide in his Love? Thus</hi> to give the sense of the Promise, is, 1. To enervate it, to make it speak but according to the Covenant of Works: It bereaves it wholly of that <hi>Betterness</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ascribes to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. 2. It renders the Promise as speaking <hi>fallaciously;</hi> as making shew of <hi>that</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not: It would be but as if he had said, you shall <hi>keep</hi> the favour of God, if you do not <hi>lose</hi> it. 3. Faith is the Soul's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to God; Unbelief, its departing from him: The Promise (therefore) that secures against de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from God, secures your continuance in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: He that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes you shall be <hi>crown'd,</hi> doth <hi>virtually</hi> undertake for your holding out to the end of your race.

be totally vanquished, which was introduc'd by his mighty Arm, and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Soul by an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versible Grace.

                           <p>What, to have the Skill of his Grace defeated; If any Soul which he hath graciously conquered should be wrested from him, what could be thought, but that his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is enfeebled?

                           <p>This Oath (as we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore observed out of the Apostles Interpretation of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. comp. <hi>Gal. 4. 22, &amp;c.)</hi> was intended of the spiritual Seed, the Heirs of Promise, such as <hi>Isaac</hi> was, the declared Son of Promise; and this Oath declared how that Promise proceeded from
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94224:119"/>
God's immutable Counsel, as the Apostle interprets it, which is <hi>Election,</hi> that sure Foundation, the <hi>Lord knows who are his,</hi> and knew well what he did in so Swearing.

Isaac</hi> was yet to live a long while in the World, and might, according to the Principles of Free-will-Grace, have fallen away and proved unregenerate; and God could have no such sure and certain Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of him, as to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as I may so say) an Oath upon him, with a peremptory irreversible Blessing of him.

Again, we distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>shew</hi> of Grace, and <hi>true</hi> Grace; there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral instances in the Word of God of Persons falling from a <hi>shew</hi> of Grace, <hi>Demas, Judas, Saul, Hymeneus,</hi> fell from <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy</hi> into open <hi>Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Impiety:</hi> but no sincere Person ever fell from true Grace. <hi>Paint</hi> may be soon wash'd off, when a <hi>healthful</hi> beautiful Complexion will abide: a <hi>Bristol-</hi>stone is soon <hi>broken,</hi> but a true <hi>Diamond</hi> will abide the smartest stroke.

God hath absolutely engaged that elect Believers shall not depart from him, that is, not finally, because in an effectual Call he will put his Fear into their Hearts; they may wander, but not

depart; they may in some Acts deviate, but they shall not be Backsliders in Heart; and the reason is, because tho there may be a tendency in them to turn away from God, yet God stands engaged not to turn away from them. Hence that Expression of God to the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 1.

whom Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath chosen to oppose, held out on any such ridiculous terms, as whether they use means, or use them not, carry themselves well, or wickedly miscarry themselves, but is asserted upon the account of God's effectual Grace, preserving them <hi>in</hi> the use of the means, and <hi>from</hi> all such Miscarriages as should make a total Separation between God and their Souls.—The whole strength of it lies in a Supposal, that those who are so <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> as here is intimated in the Text, <hi>called accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the purpose of God,</hi> called to answer the design of God, to make them like to Jesus Christ, so called as to be hereupon justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may yet lay such bars of Wickedness and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in their own way, when they are so called, as not to be justified, when that Calling of theirs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of all those <hi>bars of Wickedness and Unbelief,</hi> which might hinder their free and gracious Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with God. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 71.</p>

            <p>We have hitherto spoken of the Person and of the Presence of Christ; Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of that mutual inward hold which Christ hath of us, and we of him, in such sort that each possesseth other by way of special Interest, Property and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Copulation.—We are by Nature the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> When God created <hi>Adam,</hi> he created us; and as many as are descended from <hi>Adam,</hi> have in themselves the Root out of which they spring. The Sons of God we neither are all, nor any of us, otherwise than only by Grace and Favour. The Sons of God have God's own natural Son as a second <hi>Adam</hi> from Heaven, whose Race and Progeny they are by spiritual and heavenly Birth: God therefore loving eternally his Son, he must needs eternally in him have loved and preferred before all others, them which are spiritually sithence descended and sprung out of him. These are in God as in their Saviour, and not as in their Creator only. It was the purpose of his saving Goodness, his saving Power, and his saving Wisdom, which inclined it self towards them. They which thus are in God eternally, by their intended Admission to Life, have by Vocation or Adoption, God actually now in them, as the Artificer is in that Work which his Hand doth presently frame. Life, as all other Gifts and Benefits, groweth originally from the Father, and cometh not to us but by the Son, nor by the Son to any of us in particular, but through the Spirit. For this cause the Apostle wisheth to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Love of God, and the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost; which three St. <hi>Peter</hi> comprehendeth in one, the Participation of the Divine Nature. We are therefore in God through Christ eternally, according to that intent and purpose whereby we are chosen to be made his in this present World, before the World it self was made. We were in God through the Knowledg which is had of us, and the Love which is born towards us from everlasting. But in God we actually are no longer than only from the time of our actual Adoption into the Body of his true Church, into the Fellowship of his Children; for his Church he knoweth and loveth, so that they that are in the Church are thereby known to be in him. Our being in Christ by eternal Fore-knowledg saveth us not, without our actual and real Adoption into the Fellowship of his Saints in this present World; for in him we actually are by our actual Incorporation into that Society which hath him for their Head, and doth make together with him one Body (he and they in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect having one Name) for which cause, by virtue of this mystical Conjunction, we are of him, and in him, even as tho our very Flesh and Bones should be made continuate with his. We are in Christ because he knoweth and loveth us even as Parts of himself. No Man is actually in him, but they in whom he actually is: for he which hath not the Son of God, hath not Life. I am the Vine, and you are
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94224:128"/>
the Branches: He which abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much Fruit; but the Branch severed from the Vine withereth: we are therefore adopted Sons of God to eternal Life, by Participation of the only Son of God, whose Life is the Well-spring and Cause of ours. It is too cold an Interpretation, whereby some Men expound our being in Christ, to import nothing else but only that the self-same Nature which maketh us to be Men, is in him, and maketh him Man as we are. For what Man is there in the World which hath not so far forth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Jesus Christ? It is not this can sustain the weight of such Sentences as speak of the Mystery of our Coherence with Jesus Christ. The Church is in Christ, as <hi>Eve</hi> was in <hi>Adam;</hi> yea by Grace we are every of us in Christ, and in his Church, as by Nature we are in those our first Parents. God made <hi>Eve</hi> of the Rib of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Church he formed out of the very Flesh, the very Wound and bleeding Side of the Son of Man: His Body crucified, and his Blood shed for the Life of the World, were the true Elements of that heavenly Being which maketh us such as himself is, of whom we come. For which cause the Words of <hi>Adam</hi> may be fully the Words of <hi>Christ</hi> concerning his Church, Flesh of my Flesh, and Bone of my Bones, a true native Extract out of mine own Body. So that in him, even according to his Manhood, we according to our heavenly Being are as Branches in that Root out of which they grow. To all things he is Life, and to Men Light as the Son of God; to the Church both Life and Light eternal, by being made the Son of Man for us, and by being in us a Saviour, whether we respect him as God or as Man. <hi>Adam</hi> is in us as an original Cause of our Nature, and of that Corruption of Nature which causeth Death: <hi>Christ</hi> as the Cause origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Restoration to Life. The Person of <hi>Adam</hi> is not in us, but his Nature, and the Corruption of his Nature derived into all Men by Propagation. Christ having <hi>Adam</hi>'s Nature, as we have, but Incorrupt, deriveth not Nature but Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and that immediately from his own Person into all that belong unto him. As therefore we are really Partakers of the Body of Sin and Death, received from <hi>Adam,</hi> so except we be truly Partakers of <hi>Christ,</hi> and as really possessed of his Spirit, all we speak of eternal Life is but a Dream. That which quickneth us is the Spirit of the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Flesh that wherewith he quickneth. That which in him made our Nature uncorrupt, was the Union of his Deity with our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And in that respect the Sentence of Death and Condemnation, which only taketh hold upon sinful Flesh, could no way possibly extend unto him. This caused his voluntary Death for others, to prevail with God, and to have the force of an expiatory Sacrifice. The Blood of Christ, as the Apostle witnesseth, doth therefore take away Sin, because through the eternal Spirit he offered himself unto God without spot; as that which sanctified our Nature in Christ, that which made it a Sacrifice available to take away Sin, is the same which quickneth it, raised it out of the Grave after Death, and exalteth it unto Glory. Seeing therefore Christ is in us as a quickning Spirit, the first degree of Communion with Christ must needs consist in the Participation of his Spirit, which <hi>Cyprian</hi> in that respect well termeth <hi>Germanissimam Societatem,</hi> the highest and truest Society that can be between Man and him, which is both God and Man in one. These things <hi>Cyril</hi> duly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reproveth their Speeches, who taught that only the Deity of Christ is the Vine, whereupon we by Faith do depend as Branches; and that neither his Flesh, nor our Body, are comprised in this Resemblance: For doth any Man doubt but that even from the Flesh of Christ our very Bodies do receive that Life which shall
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94224:128"/>
make them glorious at the latter day, and for which they are already accounted Parts of his blessed Body? Our corruptible Bodies could never live the Life they shall live, were it not that here they were joined with his Body, which is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and that his is in ours as a cause of Immortality, a cause by removing through the Death and Merit of his own Flesh, that which hindred the Life of ours. Christ is therefore both as God and as Man, that true Vine whereof we both spiritually and corporally are Branches. The mixture of his bodily Substance with ours is a thing which the antient Fathers disclaim. Yet the mixture of his Flesh with ours they speak, to signify what our very Bodies through mystical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction do receive from that vital Efficacy which we know to be in his; and from bodily Mixtures they borrow divers Similitudes rather to declare the Truth than the manner of Coherence between his sacred and the sanctified Bodies of Saints. Thus much no Christian Man will deny, that when Christ sanctified his own Flesh, giving as God, and taking as Man, the holy Ghost, he did not this for himself only, but for our sakes, that the Grace of Sanctification and Life, which was first received in him, might pass from him to his whole Race, as Malediction came from <hi>Adam</hi> unto all Mankind. Howbeit, because the Work of his Spirit to those Effects is in us prevented by Sin and Death possessing us before, it is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that as well our present Sanctification unto newness of Life, as the future Restoration of our Bodies, should presuppose a Participation of the Grace, Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Merit or Virtue of his Body and Blood, without which Foundation first laid, there is no place for those other Operations of the Spirit of Christ to ensue. So that Christ imparteth plainly himself by degrees. It pleaseth him in Mercy to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himself incompleat and maimed without us. But most assured we are, that we all receive of his Fulness, because he is in us as a moving and working Cause, from which many blessed Effects are really found to ensue: And that in sundry both kinds and degrees, all tending to eternal Happiness. It must be confessed, that of Christ working as Creator and as Governour of the World by Providence, all are Partakers, not all Partakers of that Grace whereby he inhabiteth whom he saveth. Again, as he dwelleth not by Grace in all, so neither doth he equally work in all them in whom he dwelleth. Whence is it (saith St. <hi>Augustin)</hi> that some be holier than others are, but because God doth dwell in some more plentifully than in others? And because the divine Substance of Christ is equally in all, his humane Substance equally distinct from all, it appeareth that the Participation of Christ, wherein there are many degrees and differences, must needs consist in such Effects, as being derived from both Natures of Christ really into us, are made our own; and we by having them in us, are truly said to have him from whom they come; Christ also more or less to inhabit or impart himself, as the Graces are fewer or more, greater or smaller, which really flow into us from Christ. Christ is whole with the whole Church, and whole with every part of the Church, as touching his Person, which can no way divide it self, or be possest by Degrees and Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But the Participation of Christ importeth, besides the Presence of Christ's Person, and besides the mystical Copulation thereof with the Parts and Members of his whole Church, a true actual Influence of Grace, whereby the Life which we live according to Godline<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s is his, and from him we receive those Perfections wherein our eternal Happiness consisteth. Thus we participate Christ partly by Imputation, as when those things which he did and suffered for us are imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us for Righteousness; partly by habitual and real Infusion, as when Grace is
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94224:129"/>
inwardly bestowed while we are on Earth, and afterwards more fully, both our Souls and Bodies made like unto him in Glory. The first thing of his so infused into our Hearts in this Life is the Spirit of Christ, whereupon because the rest of what kind soever do all both necessarily depend and infallibly also ensue, therefore the Apostles term it sometimes the Seed of God, sometimes the Pledg of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance, sometimes the handsel or earnest of that which is to come. From hence it is that they which belong to the mystical Body of our Saviour Christ, and be in number as the Stars in Heaven, divided successively by reason of their mortal Condition into many Generations, are notwithstanding coupled every one to Christ their Head, and all unto every particular Person among themselves, inasmuch as the same Spirit which anointed the blessed Soul of our Saviour Christ, doth so forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize, unite and actuate his whole Race, as if both he and they were so many Limbs compacted into one Body, by being all with one and the same Soul quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. That wherein we are Partakers of Jesus Christ by Imputation, are each equally unto all that have it. For it consisteth in such Acts and Deeds of his, as could not have longer continuance than while they were in doing, nor at that time belong unto any other but to him from whom they came; and therefore how Men either then or before, or since, should be made Partakers of them, there can be no way imagined but only Imputation. Again, a Deed must either not be imputed to any, but rest altogether in him whose it is; or if at all it be imputed, they which have it by Imputation, must have it such as it is, whole. So that degrees being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the personal Presence of Christ, nor in the Participation of those Effects which are ours by Imputation only, it resteth that we wholly apply them to the Participation of Christ's infused Grace: altho even in this kind also the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Life, the Seed of God, the first Fruits of Christ's Spirit, be without Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. For we have hereby only the Being of the Sons of God, in which number, how far soever one may seem to excel another, yet touching this, that all are Sons, they are all Equals, some happily better Sons than the rest are, but none any more a Son than another. Thus therefore we see how the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father; how both are in all things, and all in them; what Communion Christ hath with his Church; how his Church, and every Member thereof, is in him by original Derivation, and he personally in them by way of mystical Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, wrought through the Gift of the Holy Ghost, which they that are his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him, and together with the same, what benefit soever the vital force of his Body and Blood may yield, yea by steps and degrees, they receive the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat measure of all such divine Grace as doth sanctify the same throughout, till the day of their final Exaltation to a State of Fellowship in Glory with him, whose Partakers they now are in those things that tend to Glory.

            <p>Thou seest, <hi>Reader,</hi> with what Perspicuity of Judgment, Simplicity of Speech, Soundness of Argument, analogical Coherence of Scripture, and Savour of Spirit, these two side-column-Witnesses (though in some other things differing) <hi>conjointly</hi> lay before thee the most <hi>fundamental</hi> Truths of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, whilst the <hi>Baxterian,</hi> one while with his <hi>Labyrinth-windings</hi> to évade thy full view of him, another while with his more plainly, and apparently asserted rotten and corrupt Dogmas, to outface (if possible) Truth it self; and, Thirdly, with his dreadfully supposed inforced Inferences and Conclusions to scare his innocent Reader from an Inquisition after Truth, runs the Gantlet between them, as uneasy of their Society,

into such among whom he may have elbow-room enough, as being more consorted to one of his Complexion; and such are the Papists and Quakers. Only by the way note, what Sentiments they have of each other; There are (says Mr. <hi>Baxter)</hi> five several degrees of Peace which lie before us to be attempted between the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Reformed Churches: We shall begin with the highest, and upon supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the failing of our Designs for that, come down to the next, and so to the lowest. 1. The first degree of Peace to be intended and desired is, <hi>That we may so far agree, as that we may hold personal Communion in the same Assemblies, in the Worship of God, and live under the same particular Pastors.</hi> 2. If that cannot be attained, the next degree desirable is, <hi>That we may hold a Catholick Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in several Assemblies, under several Pastors, acknowledging each other the true Churches of Christ, and joining in Synods when there is need, or at least, giving each other, as Christian Brethren, the right hand of Fellowship.</hi> 3. If that may not be attained, the next degree desirable is, <hi>That we may take one another for Christians and Churches of Christ, tho under such Corruptions as we think we are bound to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own by denying the present Exercise of Communion: as we do with particular Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, whom we only suspend, but not condemn.</hi> 4. If thus much may not be had, but we will needs excommunicate each other absolutely, the next degree of Peace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable is, <hi>That we may at least so far regard the common Truths that we are agreed upon, and the Souls of the People, as to consult on certain terms on which we may most peaceably manage our Differences, with the least Hatred and Violence, and Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Peace of Christendom, and with the least impediment to the general Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of those common Truths that we are all agreed in.</hi> 5. If this may not be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the lowest degree desirable is, <hi>That at least we may take each other for more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Adversaries than Mahometans and Infidels are, and therefore may make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Agreement to cease our Wars and Bloodshed, and turn all our Arms against the great and common Enemy of the Christian Name.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Key for Catholicks,</hi> p. 451, 452.—I had never troubled the World about so much as I have done, (says Mr. <hi>Baxter)</hi> had I not found too many Protestants scandalize the Papists, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much on the Notion of <hi>Instrumentality,</hi> ill explained.

                              <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thus defineth Predestination: <hi>Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio est Providentia Dei, &amp;c.</hi> Predestination is a certain Providence or Foreknowledg of God, whereby certain Men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, are by infallible means and ways directed unto Life eternal. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. lib. 2. de grat. &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. arb. cap.</hi> 9. In this definition we find a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fault: First, because <hi>Bellarmine</hi> defineth Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination to be Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg or Prescience. 2. For that he affirmeth it to be only of the Elect. But of the latter fault more shall be said in the next Part. As for the first, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh Predestination to be a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> a kind or part of God's Providence: and further saith, that Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination partly belongeth to the Will of God, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Knowledg and Understanding, but most
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94224:131"/>

See Dr. <hi>Willet</hi>'s <hi>Syn. Pap.</hi> p. 880.</p>
                           <p>Some other held that God ordained Grace and Mercy for all, and was not any way the cause of the Reprobation of Men: This was the Heresy of the Pelagians, every where confuted by <hi>Augustine</hi> in his learned Works writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against the Pelagians: And I am afraid it hath too many Favorites and Friends in these days. The third opinion is of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who deny not but that Reprobation doth proceed in some respect from the Will and Decree of God, but that it is not so properly God's Act as Election is.—The fourth Opinion is ours, that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination is both of the Elect to Salvation, and of the Reprobate to Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Against two of these Opinions we will deal briefly at this time: first against the Papists, then against the Error of the Pelagians. See <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 881.</p>
                           <p>God intendeth no Man's Damnation, say they, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or absolutely, but in respect of their Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: <hi>Rhemist.

Of the same Opinion is <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who altho he simply denieth not Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, as afterward we shall see; yet maketh God far otherwise the Author of it than of Election: yea he excludeth it out of the definition of Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; which he defineth to be the Providence of God only to direct those that are elected to eternal Life. <hi>Lib. de Grat. cap.</hi> 9. Their <hi>Argument 1. God would have all Men to be saved, and come to the Knowledg of the Truth: God would have no Man to perish, but would have all Men come to Repentance; God will not the Death of a Sinner. Ergo,</hi> the Death and Damnation of Men standeth not properly with the Will of God. See <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 882.</p>

Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> also in another place putteth this Example: As (saith he) tho the Apostle confess, that God worketh in us both the Will and the Deed, yet he ceaseth not every where to exhort us, both to will and work those things that please God: our Saviour Christ also biddeth us to believe in him; <hi>John</hi> 14. 1. And yet it is true which our Saviour saith, That no Man can come unto him, unless his Father draw him: for Faith is the Gift of God. So Men notwithstanding ought to endeavour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to walk in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before God, altho they be predestinate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.

which they find reproached by their Party, to remember, that God is Love, and Christ is the Saviour of the World, and the pharisaical Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators of Mercy and Salvation do seldom know what Spirit they are of. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>end of Doct. Controv.</hi> ch. 16. Sect. 37. <hi>Note here that all those that assert that none are taken into Covenant with Christ but the Elect, and that it is by the Preaching of the Gospel only that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation comes, are by this confident Author termed</hi> Pharisaical Appropriators of Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>They feign God to have made an eternal Covenant with his Son, that is, God imposing on God, the Law of Mediation. They that feign Christ to have personated us in his first Covenant of Redemption, make us by him to have covenanted to redeem our selves, and to do the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator-work. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found God's Covenant with Christ as Mediator, imposing on him his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial Part, and the Covenant of the Father and the Son with faln Man, imposing on them the terms of Recovery and Life.

                           <p>The Covenant, tho con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, is a disposition of Grace; there is Grace in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94224:132"/>
giving ability to perform the Conditions, as well as in bestowing the Benefits: God's injoining one in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the other, makes not the benefit to be less of Grace, but it is a Display of God's Wisdom <hi>(to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in his disposing of the Benefit, which is Christ the first Gift, till the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be performed by us through the help of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)</hi> in conferring the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit sutably to the Nature and State of Men in this Life, whose eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is not <hi>eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,</hi> but are in a State of Trial; yea the Conditions are but a Meetness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Blessing.

If Men have nothing to do for Salvation, then Christ hath no <hi>Rule</hi> to judg them who lived under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. I hope none will say the judicial Sentence will pass on Men as elected or not elected. Doth it agree with the Proceedings of that Tribunal at that day, to say, Thou shalt be damned, <hi>because</hi> thou wert not elected? Is this the account the Scripture gives? Doth it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on the difference in Man's Carriage and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers? See the parable of the Talents, they who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94224:133"/>
they say (which alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be spoken) that God cannot make a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which may with this Predetermination be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or move it self, then it must be said further, that this comes about ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because God wanteth Wisdom or sufficient Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (which open Blasphemy by no Christian will be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered) or because it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth a Contradiction, and that it's impossible to be, so that there is no need of Power. But this can no way be proved unto that that they object [that the Creature otherwise would be made God, that is the first or independant Cause] among other Objections shall be answered after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. To me truly it seems an Arrogance not to be tolerated, that blind Mortals in this terrene Darkness should pretend so great a Knowledg in the tremendous Mysteries concerning the Mode of divine Concourse, that they dare assert that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God cannot make some Creature which may be moved some way or other, than by this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Predetermination, to wit, neither by Causa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, neither by sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Natures, Powers, Inclinations of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Objects, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums and Helps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by removing the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;

They who say that the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cannot make a Stone, which if cast from the top of a Tower, may with its own weight descend (Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums being supposed, and convenient Circumstances and divine Providence su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining the nature of all things without a divine efficient physical Premoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on specially predetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) I confess they exceed me in Confidence by many degrees.—He proceeds, <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. That Doctrine which maketh God the Author or the principal Cause of Sin, is not true; but such is the Doctrine concerning Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rejected—And <hi>p. 306.

That Doctrine which feigneth God to torment Men and Devils in Hell continually, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not that which was impossible to the most innocent Angels, or equally natural to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as to make a World, is false; but such is the Doctrine of the necessity of this Determination un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Acts of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, therefore it's false. See also <hi>p. 302. Arg.</hi> 16. I confess without blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I cannot easily believe, if Rocks in the Air should be feigned to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94224:134"/>
hang by a Thred or Chain, that the Thred or Chain being cut and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yet could not fall, nor be moved downwards without an immediate phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical efficacious predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Premotion; if its Gravity and the Nature of the Earth, Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be continued, and all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments be removed. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 313. That Doctrine is false and injurious to God which feigneth him to deal far harder with Men, than if he should compel them, being unwilling to sin, or should damn the Innocent; but such is the Doctrine now opposed: <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 308. <hi>Argum.</hi> 18. The Reason why we use the word Condition, is because it best sutes with Man's Relation to God, in his present Dealings with us, as his Subjects in Trial for Eternity—Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Elect have an actual Interest in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, while they live in Unbelief: This I deny.—It cannot be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this Scheme of the new Covenant that God doth not require any Duty as the condition of the Benefits which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to give: for <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. here's God's Law written in the Heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Relation to him as his People, or the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sins; and tho this Text includes the Effects
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94224:134"/>
and Materials of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet it doth not describe the whole <hi>Form</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for in other places God requires the new Heart as a condition of Life; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 23.—Because the Covenant is everlasting (as to future) therefore he judged there can be no Condition on Man's part, not remembring that the Covenant secures our Perseverance in performing those Conditions.—The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being, and all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Grace, are strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exposed by Conceits so sordid. He calls us to <hi>fear, Heb. 4. 1. Rom. 11. 20. Phil. 2. 12. 1 Cor. 9. 10. Rom.</hi> 8. 24. What are all these, if our State be in no suspense as to what we shall be or do?—But yet that the case of no Hearer is made so desperate by this Election of some, as that if he do repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he shall not be saved, for God will judg all of us by his revealed Will, and not by his Decrees.—Our personal Claim depends on the Gospel-Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Christ is the Mediator. This Gospel-Sanction deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins as certain a Rule of Happiness and Misery as the Law of Works did, tho it be not the same: for while it promiseth Pardon to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving repenting Sinners, and declares a Bar to Pardon to the impenitent Rejecters of Christ and Gospel-Grace, it fixeth true Repentance and Faith unfeigned to be the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94224:135"/>
terms of Pardon: so when it promiseth Heaven to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely holy persevering Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, it fixeth sincere Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Perseverance in Faith, as the terms of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing Heaven.—God in the dispensing of Gospel-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Blessings, doth judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally determine a Conformity to this Rule of the Promise: when he forgives, he judicial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declareth a Man hath true Faith; when he admits into Heaven, he judicially declares a Man sincerely holy and persevering.—Can any think that forgiving, adopting, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, or the conveyance of every other promised Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit given on God's terms, are not judicial Acts of God, as Rector? If so, doth he dispense these blindly and promiscuously, without any regard to our being Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or no? or whether our Faith be true or no? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one would blush to affirm it.—To suppose the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be the sole Act of God, and an Act that is merely absolute, renders all these Phrases impertinent and impossible: can we be said to make or keep the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which is only God's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Grant? It was his Act to appoint this Covenant, and to enable us to <hi>make</hi> and keep it: It's his Act to restipulate on his part; but to deny it to be conditional, as to the very Benefits, is to make God to be the sole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty covenanting, <hi>&amp;c.—</hi>These Conditions are our Duty by
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94224:135"/>
God's Command; and not less so by being terms of the Benefit in the divine Grant.—The non-elect are in the same case with Devils, there being no serious Offers to them; nay their case is worse than Devils, for these Offers are made to them for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther design but to increase their Condemnation: nay every Sin of theirs is the Sin against the Holy Ghost, that is, every Sin is alike, the <hi>unpardonable</hi> Sin, and not only that Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. To say no more, Christ hath no Rule of distributive Justice but his own eternal Purpose, and Mens regards to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Benefits, are all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, even when our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to them is that which subserves his Government, and is supposed in all the Methods of it.

are not afraid to assert, that God by an eternal and immutable Decree hath predestinated to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation, the far greater part of Mankind, not considered as made, much less as fallen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect to their Disobedience or Sin, but only for the demonstrating of the Glory of his Justice: and that for the bringing this about, he hath <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> miserable Souls ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to walk in their wicked ways, that so his Justice may lay hold on them: and that God doth therefore not only suffer them to be liable to this Misery in many Parts of the World, by withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel, and knowledg of Christ, but even in those places where the Gospel is preached, and Salvation by Christ is offered: whom tho he publickly invite them, yet he justly condemns for Disobedience, albeit he hath withheld from them all Grace, by which they could have laid hold on the Gospel, <hi>viz.</hi> because he hath by a secret Will, unknown to all Men, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and decreed (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect had to their Disobedience or Sin) that they shall not obey, and that the Offer of the Gospel shall never prove effectual for their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only serve to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94224:131"/>
and occasion their greater Condemnation: I say, as to this horrible and blasphemous Doctrine, our Cause is common with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, who have both wisely and learnedly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Antiquity, refuted it.—First we may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call this Doctrine a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty.—It is highly injurious to God,</hi> because it makes him the Author of Sin, which of all things is most contrary to his Nature. I confess the Assertors of this Principle deny this Consequence; but that is but a pure Illusion, seeing it so naturally follows from their Doctrine, and is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ridiculous, as if a Man should pertinaciously deny that <hi>one</hi> and <hi>two</hi> makes <hi>three.</hi> For if God has decreed that the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ones shall perish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all respect to their evil Deeds, but only of his own Pleasure; and if he hath also decreed, long before they were in being, or in any capacity to do good or evil, that they should walk in those wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ways, by which, as by a secondary means, they are led to that end; who, I pray, is the first Author and Cause thereof, but God, who so willed and decreed?

Nor doth it at all help them, to say, that Man sins wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, since that Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Proclivity and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity to Evil, is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Judgment so necessarily imposed upon him, that cannot but be willing, because God hath willed and decreed him to be so. Which shift is just as if I should take a Child uncapable to resist me, and throw it down from a great Precipice; the weight of the Child's Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed makes it go readily down, and the Violence of the Fall upon some Rock or Stone, beats out its Brains, and kills it. Now then I pray, tho the Body of the Child goes
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94224:133"/>
willingly down, (for I suppose it as to its Mind is uncapable of any Will) and the weight of its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and not any immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate stroke of my hand, who perhaps am at a great distance, makes it die, whether is the Child or I the proper Cause of its Death? Let any Man of Reason judg, if God's part be (with them) as great, yea more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, in the Sins of Men, (as by the Testimonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove brought doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) whether doth not this make him not only the Author of Sin, but more unjust than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justest Act of Men?—<hi>This Doctrine is injurious to God,</hi> because it makes him delight in the Death of Sinners, yea and to will many to die in their Sins, contrary to these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 3. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 9.

It is <hi>highly injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Christ our Mediator, and to the Efficacy and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Gospel:</hi> for it renders his Mediation ineffectual, as if he had not by his Sufferings throughly broken down the middle Wall, nor yet removed the Wrath of God, or purchased the Love of God towards all Mankind; if it was afore decreed, that it should be of no service to the far greater part of Mankind. It is to no purpose to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that the Death of Christ was of Efficacy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have saved all Mankind, if in effect its Virtue be not so far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as to put all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into a capacity of Salvation.—<hi>This Doctrine is highly injurious to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi> for it renders them in a far worse condition than the Devils in Hell. For these were sometimes in a capacity to have stood, and do suffer only for their own Guilt, whereas many Millions of Men are for ever tormented, according to them, for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, which they neither knew of, nor ever were accessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to. It renders them worse than the Beasts of the Field, of whom the Master requires not more than they are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and if they be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, Death to them is the end of Sorrow: whereas

of the whole World. 2. That of <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor,</hi> whence he hath a Right of disposing all, and all things to their ends as he pleaseth. 3. That of <hi>Rector,</hi> whence a Right of governing and judging the humane World. This threefold Right is new, from the Foundation of Redemption, besides the old Right that sprang from Creation. They therefore that deny universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, the Foundation being denied in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they deny this three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold relation of Christ as Redeemer of the World, to wit, that of <hi>Benefactor, Lord,</hi> and <hi>Rector.</hi> But the State of the Church is to be bewailed, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Ignorance, or of the prevalency of the private opinion of some, that this is not look'd upon to be a Sin in some truly godly, or an injury to Christ.—All are under the Law of Grace, either of the former or latter Edition: All are made Partakers of some medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grace: and <hi>Cain</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if he would have done well, he heard the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Acceptation from God himself. <hi>Job</hi> was no less beloved of God than the Israelites: and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> thought that in <hi>Sodom</hi> there were fifty faithful or righteous ones.

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I affirm, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Whilst God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and given Christ a Redeemer of the World, and out of his Grace hath removed the demerited Punishment of eternal Death, not only by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Sentence or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, but altogether remits under condition: whilst he giveth many good things to Infidels, a Right of which they had lost, and dealeth with none ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Demerits; whilst he granteth a new Covenant, justifying all upon condition of Faith, even to Infidels, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth his Ministers to preach that, and by them beseecheth both Infidels and impenitent ones, that they would be reconciled to God; whilst he giveth some certain <hi>common Grace</hi> of the holy Spirit to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94224:140"/>
and special for the working of Faith, efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Elect even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserving, and deserving things contrary: All these things are some <hi>executive Pardon of Sin,</hi> whilst some degree of Punishment is remitted: And all these things are absolutely given to the Infidels. 2. But there is no such Remission absolutely given to any one which infers a Right of eternal Life, or by a Right of Impunity frees from infernal Punishment. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 342.</p>
                           <p>And likewise some Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments are not remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any of the Faithful; among others he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Mors temporalis,</hi> the temporal Death of the Godly, as being part of the Curse, and so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the Proprietory of Christ's Sacrifice, and the <hi>idem</hi> of his Sufferings. See p. 307. and the like he says in p. 28. and in p. 49. runs to the Popish Evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Christ could not suffer the <hi>idem,</hi> that those for whom he died should suffer, for then he must <hi>lose the Spirit,</hi> be <hi>torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Conscience, despair</hi> and <hi>be hated of God,</hi> which are not only the Popish Cavils, but artificial blinds to stave off poor Sinners from looking unto or after Christ under such a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration as having born our Sins and the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due unto them. Sin
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94224:140"/>
in a proper Sense is <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to Christ, not <hi>ours,</hi> but <hi>his own,</hi> not by <hi>God</hi> but by <hi>Men,</hi> not <hi>good</hi> but <hi>bad</hi> Men, not <hi>truly</hi> but <hi>falsly.</hi>

Therefore God himself did impute Sin unto Christ. Answ.</hi> The name <hi>Imputation</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards must be spoken of. As to the <hi>thing</hi> I say, Christ is made of God Sin, two ways, both of which are contained in the Sense of the Text. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he permitted the wicked by Calumnies to esteem Christ a Sinner, and to crucify him as a Sinner, and to inscribe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross the Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fault of Sin. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by that permission he is made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for <hi>Sins,</hi> and that by a divine Decree, and his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> p. 19. he affirms that God is not only appeased towards the whole World, as that their Sins are pardonable, but pardoned. A Law of Grace or Grant of Pardon and eternal Life is made to the <hi>corrupt Mass, i. e.</hi> Man a Sinner, upon condition, <hi>i. e.</hi> that eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is remitted, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life given under a condition. <hi>Ibid.</hi> Part 1. p. 61.</p>

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94224:141"/>

That Christ hath paid not the <hi>idem,</hi> but <hi>tantundem, i. e.</hi> not fulfilled the Law (as for us) in kind, but satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>(i. e.</hi> bribed or gagg'd it) for us, is most evident <hi>(ly false).</hi> For, 1. The Law obliged the Sinner's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to suffer: Christ was no Sinner. 2. All Men to suffer, forasmuch as all had sinned; Christ was but one Man. 3. The Punishment due by Law was eternal, Christ suffered but for a season, and is entred into his Glory; thus Christ paid not the same thing that was in the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

but something equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thereunto. <hi>Morning-Exerc. Method.</hi> p. 395, 396.</p>
                           <p>To transact our very Sins on Christ as opposed to Guilt, is impossible; for it would argue either a Mistake in the divine Mind, to account him the Committer of our Sins, (prettily begg'd, and as knavishly designed) or a Propagation of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Qualities to him, which is as impossible; and any other way to transact Sin on him, besides impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Guilt, there is none (boldly said) it is needless to the ends for which our Sins were laid on Christ. Sins were laid on Christ that he might make Atonement by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for them, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease us who had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed. Now Christ by submitting to the Guilt <hi>(of an uncharged Sin to be sure)</hi> as an Obligation to Punishment <hi>(i. e.</hi> for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing laid to his Charge, but the Guilt of nothing charged) according to the Terms of the Covenant of Redemption <hi>(whose Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy depends upon Man's both</hi> pre <hi>and</hi> co-<hi>Operation)</hi> was sufficient to this end, and all that was needful <hi>(lest we should lay too much upon him either by conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating or over-loading him).</hi> All that endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us was the Threatning of the Law; <hi>(but that is vacated as to its matter for a justifying Righteousness, and it is to be feared as to

have been certainly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted which are recorded in the holy Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Birth, Life, Miracles, Sufferings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and Ascension of Christ;</hi> so we do also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it is the Duty of every one to believe it to whom it pleases God to reveal the same, and to bring to them the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it: yea, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it were damnable Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief not to believe when so declared, but to resist the holy Seed, which indeed would lead and incline every one to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and it is offered unto them: tho it reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in every one the outwardly and explicite Knowledg of it, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it always assenteth to it, <hi>ubi declaratur,</hi> where it is declared: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less as we firmly believe it was necessary, that Christ should come, that by his Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he might offer up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Sacrifice to God for our Sins, <hi>who his own self bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree;</hi> so we believe that the Remission of Sins, which any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, is only in and by virtue of the most satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Sacrifice, and no otherwise: For it is <hi>by the Obedience of that one that the free Gift is come upon all unto Justification;</hi> for we affirm, that as all Men partake of the Fruit
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94224:140"/>
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, in that, by reason of that evil Seed which through him is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto them, they are prone and inclined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to evil, tho thousands of thousands be ignorant of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, neither ever knew of the eating of the forbidden Fruit; so also many may come to feel the Influence of this holy and divine Seed and Light, and be turned from Evil to Good by it, tho they knew nothing of Christ's coming in the Flesh, through whose Obedience and Sufferings it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased unto them. And as we affirm it is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly needful, that those do believe the History of Christ's outward Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, whom it pleased God to bring to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it, so we do freely confess that even that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Knowledg is very comfortable to such as are subject to, and led by the inward <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Light;</hi> for not only doth the Sense of Christ's Love and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings tend to humble them, but they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also strengthned in their Faith, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to follow that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pattern which he hath left us, <hi>who suffered for us,</hi> as saith Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 21. <hi>Leaving us an Example, that we should follow his steps:</hi> and many times we are greatly edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and refreshed with the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94224:141"/>
gracious Sayings, which proceed out of his Mouth. The History then is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and comfortable, with the Mystery, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without it; but the Mystery is and may be profitable without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit and outward Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the History. Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s <hi>Apology for the Quakers,</hi> p. 96, 97. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as all Men who have come to Man's Estate (the Man Jesus only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) have sinned, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all have need of this Saviour to remove the Wrath of God from them, due to their Offences: in this respect, he is truly said to <hi>have born the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of us all in his Body on the Tree;</hi> and therefore is the only Mediator, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving qualified the Wrath of God towards us, so that our former Sins stand not in our way, being by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his most satisfactory Sacrifice, removed and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned (but it seems our after-Sins, or Sins after Calling, are removed both in their Charge and Guilt by Regeneration and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification) neither do we think that Remission of Sin is to be expected, sought or obtained any other way, or by any Works or Sacrifice what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever (tho, as has been said formerly, they may come to partake of this Remission, that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the History) so
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94224:141"/>
then Christ by his Death and Sufferings hath recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled us to God (but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be thereby irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versibly reconciled unto us is the Debate) even while we are Enemies; that is, he offers Reconciliation unto us, we are put into a capacity of being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, God is willing to forgive us our Iniquity, and to accept us, as is well expressed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the next Verses he intreats them <hi>in Christ's stead to be reconciled to God,</hi> intimating, that the Wrath of God being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the Obedience of Christ Jesus, he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be reconciled unto them, and ready to remit the Sins that are past, if they repent. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 141. The first is the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on performed and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by Christ <hi>for us,</hi> in his crucified Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us <hi>(i. e.</hi> universally of all Mankind alike) the other is the Redemption wrought <hi>by Christ in us,</hi> which no less properly is called and accounted a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption than the former. The first then is that whereby Man, as he stands in the Fall, is put into a Capacity of Salvation, and hath conveyed unto him a measure of that Power, Virtue, Spirit, Life and Grace, that was in Christ Jesus: Which, as the free Gift of God, is able to counter-balance, overcome and root out the evil
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94224:142"/>

the Curse, are not all one; but the remitting of the Curse, is all one with the redeeming from the Curse. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The remitting of the Curse is not to be made a Curse. 2. Again, the Apostle proveth Christ to be cursed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hanged on a Tree, as it is written, <hi>Cursed is every one that hangeth on a Tree,</hi> that is, he is indeed accursed, not the Curse only remitted. 3. The receiving of the Curse is one thing, the remitting another.—That this Curse wherewith Christ was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed for us, cannot be reserred to the external Death upon the Cross, it appeareth; as <hi>Jerom</hi> saith, <hi>non quienque,</hi> not every one that hangeth upon a Tree is cursed before God, <hi>but he that hangeth there for his Sins.</hi> Like as if <hi>Haman</hi> had prevailed against <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and hanged him upon the Gallows which he had made for him, <hi>Mordecai</hi> in his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency notwithstanding that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious Death should not have stood accursed: wherefore it was not the Death of the Cross, but our Sins hanging upon the Cross, that derived this Curse upon Christ. This also is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent out of <hi>Moses,</hi> that not the kind of Death, but the desert of Death made it ignominious, <hi>Deut. 21. 22. If a Man have committed a Trespass worthy of Death, and be put to death, and thou hang him on a Tree,</hi> &amp;c. we see then that our Sins hanging with Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross, made the same an accursed Death.—Christ was made that Curse which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from.—He remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that Curse unto us, which he received in himself.

It's enough, that he reserving the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiars of a Redeemer,</hi> should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to suffer for our Sins: It's enough that we are pardoned and adopted for his sake, when we deserved endless Woe, and are never capable of making the least Atonement. Mr. <hi>D. Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi>'s <hi>Gospel-Truth stated, &amp;c.</hi> p. 34, 35. Christ is denominated righteous on the account of what he personally did, and suffered; he derived not Righteousness from another <hi>(what a blundering diverting Circumference this is)</hi> but possessed it as originally his own, he is eminently <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> 1 John 2. 1. whereas we are reputed righteous for the sake of what Christ did, and not for the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:94224:144"/>
Merit of what we have done. Is it not unagreeable to hear a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Sinner say, I am as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as he that paid the Ransom? or a pardoned Worm say, I am as righteous as he who merited my Pardon? Christ was so righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as to merit the Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all his Seed: he is so righteous as to make many righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous or safe from the Threat, and entituled to the Reward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Gospel-Rule. But we cannot justify one other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by our being righteous: We are not righteous enough <hi>to save a Brother.</hi> Ibid. p. 38.</p>
                           <p>But no Union will make us <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> and personally <hi>happy</hi> by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's Righteousness and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, unless it were a personal Union (natural or legal at least as to relative Rights.) The Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then is, whether <hi>every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be one Person with Christ?</hi> And if so, whether one <hi>natural Person</hi> or one <hi>legal</hi> (as a lawful <hi>Vicarius</hi> is). They that hold the first, plead that the same Spirit that is in Christ, is the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and maketh us one natural Person. But where doth the Scripture say so? The Sun is not one Individual with every Plant that it quickneth, nor eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Plant with it. A Nettle or Rose is not the Sun, nor is it the Illuminator of the World that maketh day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they have so much from the Sun as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth, and no more. So we are not Christ, nor the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and natural Son of God.—And as to that which some call a legal reputative personal Union, it must be proved before it be afferted.

There is a <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> and a Guilt of <hi>Crime,</hi> and a Guilt of <hi>Punishment;</hi> Christ undertook the last, but neither of the former, as in themselves considered, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less as by Connotation relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he may be said to be guilty of the Sin, merely because he undertook to suffer for it, which is improper Speech.—It's a sad case that Partiality can so much prevail, as that they that cry out of some doubtful words as damnable Heresies, do yet think it tolerable Language to say, that by imputation of the very Sin it self to Christ as his Sin, <hi>(this is the constant precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and foisting Treachery of this Author; for if it were his Sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it could not properly be said to be imputed.)</hi> He was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Sinner—I beseech you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from such Words till you find them in Scripture. Christ never was reputed of God a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who did so much to shew his Hatred of it: Nor ever took our Sin unto him, any further than to suffer for it to expiate it: And if this be the Similitude by which we must understand how his <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> is made ours, it will make all very plain. It is ours, or imputed to us, so far as to be reputed the true Cause of our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Adoption, Sanctification, and Glory, as our Sin was the Cause of his Suffering and Death. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 31, 32.</p>
                           <p>If Christ and the Elect be one and the same Person, then Christ sinneth whenever they sin: and Christ suffered for his own Sin, even that which he by them committed: and then he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth his own Sin (or who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth him). But all this is false. And it would follow, that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <p>Christ neither <hi>was a Sinner,</hi> nor <hi>reputed a Sinner</hi> by God: And his being <hi>made Sin for us,</hi> signifieth, 1.

And that he was really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Sinner by those that crucified him, and used as such. If any will use the word [Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son] in a private, narrow and improper Sense, and say, that <hi>[he who undertook in the Person of a Mediator to obey and merit for our Justification,</hi> and to suffer in our stead to save us from defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Suffering, may therefore be called, <hi>the Person of every one that he merited and suffered for:</hi> tho I will not so presume to thrust Phrases on the Church which Scripture never used, when their <hi>obvious</hi> Sense is <hi>pernicious,</hi> yet if that Man will by Explication of the word <hi>Person</hi> (or <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive)</hi> notify to the World that he taketh it in a <hi>sound Sense,</hi> I will not quarrel about an <hi>unfit Word,</hi> while Religion is safe, <hi>(i. e. if we like Children will have a Horse, we shall have one; provided we be contented to mount and ride a Stick, it shall bear the name of a Horse)</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>end of Doct.

that he may be an Heir according to the hope of eternal Life.—If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man shall say, that Men are justified either by the only imputation of Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or by the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Grace and Charity, which is shed abroad in their Hearts by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, and is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in them, or else that the Grace whereby we are justified, is only the Favour of God, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 43, 44. Again, <hi>Soto</hi> makes a threefold Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; The prime and proper Notion of this word Justification (saith he) is an acquisition of Righteousness, namely, of unjust to be made just.

The second Notion, and next to this is, that it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an augmentation of Righteousness.—The third place, the Name of Justification signifies the absolving of a guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Judgment, and pronouncing of him to be quit: This Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, saith <hi>Soto,</hi> is no where in <hi>Paul,</hi> nor in

the Scripture where any mention is made of our Justification by Christ. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 45, 46.</p>

                              <hi>Vega</hi> also, another Champion in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, he speaks the same Language of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and saith, there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Justification; the first, when a Man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just is made just: The second, when of just a Man becomes more just.—The words of the Council.—The only formal Cause of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God, not that whereby himself is just, but that whereby he makes us just; namely, wherewith he having endowed us, we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the spirit of our Mind, and are not only reputed, but nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and are really just, receiving Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in our selves each acording to his measure, which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost divideth to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, even as he will, and according to every Man's Disposition and Co-operation: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho no Man can be just, but he to whom the Merits of the Passion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; yet that is wrought in this Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Sinner, while by the Merit of the same holy Passion,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94224:148"/>
the Love of God is by the Holy Ghost shed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the Hearts of those who are justified, and is inherent in them, <hi>&amp;c. Ibid.</hi> p. 50. Again, says <hi>Vega,</hi> it is superfluous and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy to put any other Righteousness for a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cause of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as the imputative Righteousness of Christ.—But yet the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor afterwards seemeth to shake Imputation by the hand, and to be good friends with it, where he saith, <hi>Non est adeo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visum,</hi> &amp;c. This word <hi>Imputation</hi> is not so odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto us, as that I think we may never use it well to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for we may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and soothly, and in plain terms say, that unto Satisfaction and Merit the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ in his Passion is imputed to Mankind, and is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually imputed to all Men that are justified, and do satisfy for their Sins, and by their good Works do merit eternal Life.—Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness doth not really pass from him into those that are justified, nor by it are we formally justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: But Imputation is of God, which joins the Merits of Christ unto us, and makes them
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94224:148"/>
ours after a sort, in as much as for his Merits sake he giveth us Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, whereby we are righteous. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 52.</p>
                           <p>As it is explained by the <hi>Papists,</hi> it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly derogatory to the Merit of Christ; for it leaves it no Effect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, but only the <hi>infusion of an habit of Charity.</hi> When that is done, all that remains with respect unto our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be wrought by our selves: Christ hath only <hi>merited the first Grace</hi> for us, that we therewith and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may merit Life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. The Merit of Christ being confined in its Effect unto the <hi>first Justification,</hi> it hath no immediate influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Grace, Privilege, Mercy, or Glory that follow thereon; but they are all Effects of that <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Justification,</hi> which is purely by Works.—And those who allow of a <hi>secondary,</hi> if not of a second Justification by our own inherent perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteousness, are also guilty hereof, tho not in the same degree with them: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ascribe unto it our acquitment from all charges of Sin after the first Justification, and Righteousness accepted in Judgment, in the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:94224:149"/>
Judgment of God, as if it were compleat and perfect, whereon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends our final Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reward, it is evident that the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate efficacy of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Merit of Christ hath its bounds assigned unto it in the <hi>first Justification.</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> of Justif. <hi>p.</hi> 193, 194.</p>
                           <p>Others, as the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> utterly disclaim <hi>all merit in our Works;</hi> only some, out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence I suppose unto the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the word, and under the shelter of the ambiguity of its Signification, have faintly attempted an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation with it: But in the substance of what they assent unto to this purpose, to the best of my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are all agreed: for what the <hi>Papists</hi> call <hi>justitia operum,</hi> the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Works, they call a <hi>personal, inherent and evangelical Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> whereof we have spoken before. And whereas the <hi>Papists</hi> say, that this Righteousness of Works is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect, nor in it self able to justify us in the sight of God, but owes all its worth and dignity unto this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to the Merit of Christ; they affirm that this <hi>Evangelical Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>
                              <pb n="269" facs="tcp:94224:149"/>
is the Condition whereon we enjoy the benefits of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ in the pardon of our Sins, and the acceptance of our Persons before God. But as unto those who will acknowledg <hi>no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Righteousness</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are justified before God; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the same, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we say <hi>that on the condition of this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> we are made partakers of the Benefits of the Righteousness of Christ, or that <hi>it is the Righteousness of Christ</hi> which makes this <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> of ours accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 292, 293. Christ is said to be our Righteousness because he hath satisfied God for us; and this Satisfaction is imparted to us when we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in such sort, that it may be called our Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: for altho we are truly just by our inherent Justice, yet thereby we cannot satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy God for our Sins, and the Punishment thereof; but it is an Effect of Christ's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which is confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and applied to us in our Justification: And so we may safely say, that Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and his Merits are imputed to us, when
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94224:150"/>
they are so applied unto us, as if we our selves had satisfied; so that we confess also an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Justice whereby we are truly just. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> cap. 10. <hi>Respons. ad Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>It's very absurd, as the Jesuit here setteth it down, that we should be justified by our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Justice, and yet thereby are not able to satisfy for our Sins: that only hath power to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy us, that is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us, and satisfy for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. Our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Justice is not able to satisfy for us by the Jesuit's confession: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> Not to justify us. We may thus reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so out of the Jesuit's words: That cannot be a cause of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is an Effect thereof; but our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Justice is an Effect of the Satisfaction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto us, which is nothing else but our justification: <hi>Ergo.</hi> That Righteousness, whereby being applied unto us we are just, as if in our own Person we had satisfied for our Sins, is that Righteousness whereby we are justified: But this doth the Righteousness and Merits of Christ applied and imputed to us, as the Jesuit here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges: <hi>Ergo. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> speaketh Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94224:150"/>
and joineth together Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; he saith that the Justice of God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us in as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual manner, as if we had satisfied our selves, and yet he saith besides, <hi>justitiam inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentem,</hi> &amp;c. That Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice inherent is a true and absolute Justice. How can this be an absolute Justice, and that together which is imputed? There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a double abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Justice; for that is absolute which is perfect and entire of it self; but Christ's Justice imputed is an absolute Justice, which hath satisfied for us as fully, as if we our selves had done, but the inherent Justice doth not satisfy for us; all this is by the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit confessed: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not an absolute Justice. Doth not the Jesuit now in joining the Justice of Christ and our Justice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Causes of our Justification? which notwithstanding he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly denied before, affirming this to be the Judgment of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine Chapter, that we are not justified not only, but not at all by the Justice of Christ, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. but here he
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:94224:151"/>
saith, that by Christ's Justice applied, we do satisfy the Wrath of God; What now is this else but by the Justice of Christ tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be justified? <hi>Dr.</hi> Willet'<hi>s Synop. Pap.</hi> p. 998.</p>
                           <p>Christ was made Sin for us, that is, he took upon him the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of sinful Flesh, and we are Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that is, do take the similitude of the Justice of God. As Christ then verily, not imputatively, took our Flesh, and was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Sin; so we verily, not imputative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are partakers of this Justice. First, By preaching of remission of Sins, is not only understood the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donation of the Fault, but the succeeding also of inward Justice, whereof Christ is the efficient Cause, but yet Christ's Justice is not the formal Cause thereof. Secondly, The Publican prayeth not only for Forgiveness, but for perfect Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth also an infusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Justice. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> See Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 999, 1000.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that Repentance goeth before Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith, and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:94224:151"/>
that it is a way rather unto Faith and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the remission of Sins; <hi>poenitentia est via ad remissionem pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum; at prior justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatione.</hi> Bellarm. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</p>
                           <p>To this answers Dr. <hi>Willet.—</hi>Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins is not obtained before God by the Act of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; but we are already, being once called, justified before God by the remission of our Sins, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30.—We must distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the beginning of Faith and Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God, and the perfection and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance thereof to our selves: Faith is first, whereby we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and our Sins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before God; then followeth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whereby our Hearts are assured to our selves of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.—Therefore when remission of Sins is placed after Repentance, it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the assurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made unto our Hearts after Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not the first Decree or Grant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with God, which goeth before Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.—Justification
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94224:152"/>
goeth before Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for this is the fruit of the other: but Repentance is part of our Sanctification, Renovation, or Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, being called by St. <hi>Paul, A walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in newness of Life,</hi> Rom. 6. 4. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it followeth and cometh after our Justification. <hi>Dr.</hi> Willet'<hi>s Synop. Pap.</hi> p. 721, 722.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> affirm, that Contrition is a necessary mean unto <hi>Justification,</hi> and that a Man cannot be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, till he have been truly contrite for his Sins. <hi>Bellarm. lib. 2. de poenitentia, cap.</hi> 8. which he pleads from <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 3. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and true Contrition there is no Justification: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Repentance is a mean unto Justification; for Faith cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, yet Works are no mean unto Faith: So Repentance and Contrition are the fruits of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not a mean thereunto.—<hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> answereth, First, That we are justified freely, tho it be by the merit of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Gift of God. 2. Contrition meriteth not <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digno,</hi>
                              <pb n="275" facs="tcp:94224:152"/>
of Condignity or Worthiness, but <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo,</hi> of Congruity; which kind of Merit is founded not in God's Justice, but in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity and Bounty. <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Contra.</hi> This is the very Answer, 1. Of the old <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who did in like manner affirm, that the good Will of Man was of God, because it could not be in a Man, unless Man were; but for a Man to be is of God: for if therefore remission of Sins be of Grace, and the Gift of God, because Contrition whereby it is merited, is the Gift of God, then say also that we may be saved by Nature, and yet by the Gift of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Nature of Man is the Work and Gift of God. 2. But the Apostle confuteth this Gloss, in saying fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>We are justified freely,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>through the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ:</hi> If through Redemption, then not through Contrition. 3. And again, Men first must be reconciled unto God, and of Enemies be made Friends, before he give them Gifts; as the Apostle saith, <hi>Christ first led Captivity Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> that is, subdueth and removeth Sin that led us Captive, and then
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94224:153"/>
                              <hi>gave Gifts unto Men,</hi> Ephes. 4. 8. Then must we first be reconciled unto God, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the forgiveness of our Sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. before we can have the Gift of Contrition. <hi>Dr.</hi> Willet'<hi>s Synop. Pap.</hi> p. 728, 729.</p>
                           <p>These places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do plentifully testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy against Merits, ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing all to the Mercy of God. Psal. 103. 4. <hi>Which crowneth thee in Mercy and Compassion.</hi> Dan. 9. 18. <hi>We do not present our Supplications before thee for our own Righteousness, but for thy great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> Luk. 17. 10. <hi>When ye have done all, say, ye are unprofitable Servants.</hi> Rom. 6. 23. <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death, but Life eternal is the Grace of God through Christ.</hi> Life eternal then is not so the Wages of good Works, as eternal Death is of evil. Rom. 8. 18. <hi>The Afflictions of this present time, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Glory which shall be revealed.</hi> Rom. 3. 27. <hi>Your rejoicing is excluded by the Law of Faith: Ergo,</hi> Works merit not, for then we might rejoice in them. But says <hi>Bellarmine (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Language of our new</hi> Schematists) the Crown is said to be of Mercy, because the Merits which deserve
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94224:153"/>

                           <p>Eternal Life is said to be the Grace of God, because our Merits whereby eternal Life is procured, are of Grace; for otherwise eternal Life is as well the sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of Justice, as Death is the stipend of Sin. <hi>Bellarm.

To this says Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> this is a most corrupt Gloss, by Grace to expound Works; for the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. maketh a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and Opposition between Works and Grace: and if it be answered, he meaneth Works of Nature, and not of Grace; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith again, <hi>Not by the Works of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but by his Mercy he saved us;</hi> Tit. 3. 5. Here even Works of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:94224:154"/>
Justice and Grace are opposed to Mercy and Grace: wherefore Grace and Works being so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the one cannot be contained in the other. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 1039.</p>
                           <p>Faith is not the only cause of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but there are other also, as Hope, Charity, Alms-deeds, and other Vertues. <hi>Rhem. annot.</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>Sect. 6.

The only formal Cause of our Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is the Justice of God, whereby we are not reputed just, but are made just indeed. This is that Justice

which every Man hath within himself, and is inherent in him: <hi>Sess. 6. cap.</hi> 7. Sic <hi>Rhemist. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Rom. 2. Sect. 4.

                           <p>If the Justice of Christ be truly imputed unto us, so that thereby we are verily and truly counted just, as if it were our own proper Righteousness, we should then be counted no less just and righteous than Christ himself, and so consequently be counted Redeemers and Saviours of the World, as well as he: <hi>Bellarm. cap. 7.

                           <p>If we by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ imputed to us are truly counted just before God, and are become the Sons of God, by the same reason Christ by the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Sins, may be truly counted a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and so also the Child of the Devil; which were a most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Blasphemy. But if Christ notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the imputation of our Sins, be righteous and just still, we also, tho the Righteousness of Christ be imputed, should remain unrighteous and unjust still, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not thereby justified. <hi>Bellarm.

the young Man, <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> Mat. 19. 17.

                              <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then is this, That by the liberty of the Gospel we are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther freed from Sin, so that it is throughly dead, and not only not imputed, but not alive, or having any being in the righteous. <hi>Cap. 6.

God giveth as well ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life and Glory to Men, for and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Works, as he giveth Damnation for the contrary Works.—And Men by their Works proceeding of Grace do deserve or merit Heaven, and the more or less Joy in the same. <hi>Rhem.

                           <p>1. He saith, <hi>That the Righteousness which is by the Law, and which is opposed unto the Righteousness which is by Faith, is not the Righteousness written in the Law, or which the Law requires, but a Righteousness wrought without the aid of Grace, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Law alone. 2. That the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which is by the Faith of Christ are</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera nostra justa facta
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:94224:169"/>
ex fide, <hi>our own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Works wrought in Faith, which others call our Evangelical Works. 3. That it is blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to call the Duties of inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> 
                              <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, <hi>loss and dung.</hi> But he labours (says Dr. <hi>Owen)</hi> in the Fire with all his Sophistry. For as to the first, (1.) That by the Righteousness which is by the Law, the Righteousness which the Law requires is not intended, is a bold Assertion, and expresly contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 9. 31. chap.</hi> 10. 5. in both places he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law to be the Righteousness that the Law requires. (2.) The Works which he excludes, he calls <hi>the Works of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness that we have done,</hi> Tit. 3. 5. which are the Works that the Law requires. Unto the second, I say, (1.) That the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it is, That the Apostle should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that <hi>I desire to be found in Christ, not having mine own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, but having my own Righteousness;</hi> for Evangelical inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteousness was properly his own.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:94224:170"/>
And I am sorry that some should appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that the Apostle in these words, did desire to be found in his own Righteousness in the presence of God in order unto Justification: For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more contrary, not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perpetual te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and design of all his Discourses on this Subject, but also unto the Testimony of all other holy Men in the Scripture to the same purpose, as we have proved before. And I suppose there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few true Believers at present, whom they will find to comply and join with them in this desire of <hi>being found in their own Personal Evangelical Righteousness,</hi> or the Works of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which they have done, in their trial before God, as unto their Justification. We should do well to read our own Hearts, as well as the Books of others in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. (2.) The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which is of God by Faith, is not our own Obedience or Righteousness, but that which is <hi>opposed</hi> unto it, that which God imputes unto us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. that which
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:94224:170"/>
we receive by way of <hi>Gift,</hi> Rom. 5. 17. (3.) That by the Righteousness which is by the Faith of Christ Jesus our own <hi>inherent Righteousness</hi> is not intended, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence, that the Apostle excludes all his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, as and when he was found in Christ, that is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had done as a Believer. And if there be not an opposition in these words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Righteousness that is our own, and that which is not our own, I know not in what words it can be expressed. Unto the third I say, (1.) The Apostle doth not, nor do we say that he doth call our inherent Righteousness <hi>Dung,</hi> but only that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it so. (2.) He doth not <hi>account it so absolutely,</hi> which he is most from, but only in comparison with Christ. (3.) He doth not esteem it so in it self, but only as unto his trust into it, with respect unto one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial end, namely, our Justification before God. (4.) The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isaiah</hi> in the same respect terms all our Righteousness <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> chap. 64. 6.

(1.) <hi>James</hi> calls it a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> the <hi>Faith of Devils,</hi> and casteth all manner of Reproach upon it, which he would not have done on any Duty or Grace truly <hi>Evangelical.</hi> (2.) E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Faith that is true as unto the reality of Assent which is given by it unto the Truth, is neither living, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, nor saving, as hath been proved. (3.) They never had that Faith which is true and saving; <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 13. He urgeth <hi>that in the same place and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:94224:171"/>
Chapter he treats of the Faith of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>and affirms that it wrought with his Works,</hi> v. 22, 23. <hi>But this a vain shadow of Faith doth not do; it was therefore true Faith, and that which is most properly called so,</hi> that the Apostle intends. <hi>Answ.</hi> This Pretence is indeed ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth not give the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> as an instance of that Faith which he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with so much se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, but of that which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto it, and whereby he design'd to prove that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith which he had reflected on, was of no use and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage unto them that had it: For this Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced good Works, which the other was wholly without. Thirdly, He urgeth <hi>v. 24. You see then how that by Works a Man is justified, and not by Faith only: for the Faith that</hi> James <hi>speaks of justifieth with Works, but a false Faith, the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a Faith doth not so; it is therefore true saving Faith whereof the Apostle speaketh. Ans.</hi> 1. He
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:94224:172"/>
is utterly mistaken; for the Apostle doth not ascribe Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>partly</hi> to Works, and <hi>partly</hi> to Faith, but he ascribes Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the sense by him intended, <hi>wholly</hi> to Works in opposition to <hi>that Faith</hi> concerning which he treats: for there is a plain <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis</hi> in the words between Works and Faith, as unto Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the sense by him intended. A dead Faith, a Faith without Works, the Faith of Devils is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from having any influence into Justification. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He adds, <hi>that the Apostle compares this Faith without Works unto a rich Man that gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto the Poor,</hi> v. 16. <hi>and a Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Spirit,</hi> ver. 26. <hi>Wherefore as that Knowledg whereby a rich Man knows the Wants of the Poor is true and real, and a dead Body is a Body; so is Faith without Works true Faith also, and as such is considered by Saint</hi> James. <hi>Ans.</hi> These things do evidently destroy what they are produced in the Confirmation of, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:94224:172"/>
the <hi>Cardinal</hi> helps them out with a little Sophistry: For whereas the Apostle compares <hi>this Faith</hi> unto the <hi>Charity</hi> of a Man that gives nothing to the Poor, he sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests in the room thereof his <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: And his knowledg may be true, and the more true and certain it is, the more false and feigned is the Charity which he pretends in these words, <hi>Go and be fed or clothed;</hi> such is the Faith the Apostle speaks of, <hi>&amp;c.

And this Doctrine will make Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, that they will care for no good Works; and so there should be no more use ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Precepts to exhort them to the Works of Piety, nor of Threanings to terrify them from Sin.

First, it is no good Argument, <hi>a posse ad esse,</hi> from that which may be, to that which is; God might do it, therefore he did it, or would do it, is no good Consequent. 2. Neither is it true, that God could otherwise have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given Men, than by the Death of Christ, his Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice being presupposed: for God cannot deny himself, seeing the Sentence was past, that <hi>they should die the Death,</hi> if they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed; this Decree must stand, and the Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served must be satisfied for: neither is this any want or defect in God's Power, but an Argument of the Perfection of his Nature, that he cannot lie, neither is mutable.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is true, that perfect Mercy and perfect Justice considered apart, and by themselves, have these Effects and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:94224:182"/>
but so can they not be incident into one and the same Subject: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing God's Mercy and Justice are tempered together, they must be so considered as the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy not the other. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the rigor of the Law requireth perfect Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, <hi>&amp;c.

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> The Antecedent is false; for many times for one Captive Prince a thousand common Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are set at liberty: much more available for all <hi>(the Elect)</hi> was the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on purchased by Christ, the Prince of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Ex Paraeo Dr.</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 268, 269.</p>
                           <p>Rom. 5. 18. <hi>By the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of one, the Benefit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded toward all Men,</hi> &amp;c. Hence of late <hi>Huberus,</hi> and before him the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> would prove, that the Benefit of Justification is as universal toward all, even Infidels and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that came in by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> for the Apostle on both sides nameth <hi>all,</hi> for otherwise the Benefit by <hi>Christ</hi> should be inferior

unto the Loss in <hi>Adam</hi> which redounded gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally upon all.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. This term of Universality <hi>(all)</hi> must be restrained to the nature of the Subject: As <hi>Adam</hi> transfused his Sin unto all which were his Off-spring, so Christ also justified all his, that is, all which believe in him: so by <hi>all</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle understandeth the universal company of the Faithful. 2. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit consisteth not in the equality of the Number, that Christ should save as many as are lost in <hi>Adam;</hi> for then there should be only an Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but not a Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 3. But herein is the Prerogative of Grace seen. (1.) In the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Effect; for Life is a more excellent thing than Death, and Righteousness than Sin. (2.) In the powerfulness of the Work, it sheweth a greater Power to save, than to destroy; to jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, than to condemn: for it is an easier matter to destroy than to save, to pull down than to build up, to mortify than to revive and raise to Life. (3.) The Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence is in the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and largeness of Grace, in that we are justified not only from one, but all kind of Sins,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:94224:183"/>
as well actual as origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, whereas original Sin is only derived from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>—Ver. 19. <hi>So by the Obedience of one shall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be made righteous,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Romanists,</hi> as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. lib. 2. de Justificat. cap. 1. Pererius Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.</hi> 17. do much urge this Argument against imputative Justice, that we are not justified by the Righteousness of Christ imputed by Faith, but by an inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness wrought in us by Christ, whereby we are formally made just; because we are so made righteous and just in Christ, as we became Sinners in <hi>Adam:</hi> but that was not by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, but by Sin dwelling in them, whereby they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally made Sinners; therefore we are formally made righteous by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Justice remaining in us, and not imputed only. <hi>Pererius</hi> further urgeth the Phrase <hi>justi constituentur,</hi> many shall be made just, which is not all one as to be reputed just, or to be just by Imputation, but to be just indeed.

noteth, that if Christ be the end of-the Law, it followeth that, <hi>Qui Christum non habet, etsi legis justitiam habere vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deatur, eam tamen non habeat;</hi> he which hath not Christ, tho he seem to have the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law, yet he hath it not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Without Christ then, and Faith in him, there is no true Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before God: for without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to please God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. What is become then of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Works of Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which should go before Justification? as tho a Man having not Faith, yet by his Works<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>—might prepare and make himself fit for Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification following: for all such Works which come before Faith, and so are not sanctified in Christ, are before God no better than Sins. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 475.</p>

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> The Scripture oft saith, that <hi>Faith is imputed to us for Righteousness,</hi> and that is Faith in Christ: And it saith, that <hi>Righteousness is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, or reckoned to us,</hi> that is, we are reckoned, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 6, 11, 22.

The words of <hi>imputing Christ's Righteousness to us</hi> I find not in God's Word, and therefore think them not necessary to the Church's Peace or Safety. But as for the sense of those words no doubt but it may be good, and the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves own them in the same sense as many Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines <hi>profess to use them, as I have proved.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Breviat of Justif. <hi>Part 1. p.</hi> 22.</p>

We must first agree what <hi>Righteousness</hi> is; Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is formally a <hi>Relation,</hi> and therefore must have the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Relation; I need not tell Scholars what it is, The subject of this Relation is, first, Man's <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,</hi> and their <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Rights,</hi> and then their <hi>Persons</hi> as the subject of these. Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is a relation to the Rule or Law, and is an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness thereto: If it be God's Law, it is Righteousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; if but <hi>Man</hi>'s, it is but human Righteousness. As a Law hath two parts, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and the Retribution of Reward and Punishment, so there are two sorts of Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Righteousness: as to the Precept, Obedience is Righteousness, and Sin is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness: As to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, right to Impunity and to the promised Reward is the Person's Righteousness; and so contrary, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness materially is either <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> in some one Cause, or few Causes, or universal and perfect in all Causes: Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness particular is either in some small matter that we are not made happy by; or in some great Cause which our Happiness dependeth on. <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxt. <hi>Brev. of Justif.</hi> Part 1. p. 1.</p>
                           <p>Justification is a word of many senses; sometimes it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>[making us righteous]</hi> sometimes the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's virtual judging us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> it being the <hi>Rule of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> sometimes God's <hi>esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                           <p>Contra. <hi>Is not Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness ours, as our Sins were his, by Imputation?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, as much at least, or more; but take heed of marring Christ's Gospel by your mending it, and of making him no Christ, while you would make him more merciful according to your own Conceits; I know it is said once that he was <hi>made Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God in him.</hi> But as we are not properly <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> much less God's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, but are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and so the instances or demonstrations of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God: So Expositors commonly agree, that by <hi>Sin</hi> is meant a <hi>Sacrifice for Sin;</hi> or by being <hi>[made Sin]</hi> is meant being <hi>used as if he had been a Sinner.</hi> Undoubtedly if God imputed or accounted Christ a Sinner, and if he were truly so by any Means, Practice or Translation, he must be by Sin hateful to the most holy God (even to himself) and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94224:147"/>
would have in him so great a part of Hell and Divine Deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is not consistent with his Personal Perfection, or the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatical Union, as far as we can conceive: And if indeed God imputed to him the Sins of all the Elect, so as first to make the very Sins themselves to become Christ's own Sins by Imputation, then Christ suffered for his own Sins, and must be more odious to God than any ordinary Sinner; and all good Men that knew it by him must have judged accordingly; for Sin, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Sins of so many Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and so great, must needs render him whose own they are, really sinful, hateful and miserable: Any of which to say of Christ is Blasphemy. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 30.</p>

                              <hi>Object.</hi> This is like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who say, <hi>That Christ merited to make our Actions meritorious:</hi> So you say, <hi>That Christ's Righteousness purchased a Personal Evangelical Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness for us, by which we are justified.</hi>

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes; by which we are justified, 1.

that really denieth that Christ's Righteousness hath procured a personal Righteousness in and of us, consisting in our Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the conditional mode of the Promise of Christ and Life.

To the <hi>tenor or mode of the promising and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of the Law of Christ,</hi> which giveth Pardon and Life on condition of <hi>penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, acceptance and consent,</hi> and <hi>continueth</hi> it on condition also of <hi>sincere Obedience</hi> to Christ our Redeemer, and God in him; and so we shall be <hi>judged,</hi> and either <hi>justified</hi> or <hi>damned,</hi> as we have or have not <hi>this personal Righteousness.</hi> Christ in Judgment is not to try his <hi>own part,</hi> but <hi>ours:</hi> He that is not thus justified shall be damned. And as to the Libertine or Antinomian Error, (that this performing of the Condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is <hi>no Righteousness,</hi> but only <hi>Christ's</hi> imputed is <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> because it answereth not the perfect Precept, tho it answer the <hi>imposed Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Promise; and that it is not to be called <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> nor we so far as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said to be <hi>justified by it)</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Scripture and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the thing. The words <hi>Just, Justice, Righteous</hi> and <hi>Righteousness, Justify</hi> and <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> being viewed in the Concordance and examined, will shew you, that God in

Scripture many score or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times giveth such Names to our <hi>personal Qualities</hi> and Acts: And what is that Man that dares deny this <hi>constant</hi> Language of Scripture? <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 57.</p>
                           <p>They talk of Justification in meer ignorant Confusion, not knowing the various senses of the Word, or the divers <hi>parts</hi> of the Work: They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd those Distinctions which no reason can deny; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>justifying efficiently, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying constitutively, justifying virtually</hi> by the <hi>Gospel-Gift</hi> or <hi>Law of Grace, justifying by Evidence,</hi> justifying by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>justifying by Plea and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, justifying by judicial Sentence,</hi> and by <hi>Execution.</hi> They set the Causes against each others, as if it were a thing that had but <hi>one cause;</hi> when they meet with the word used for <hi>sentential Justification</hi> by decisive Judgment, they exclude all the included and supposed Acts, that is, <hi>making Men just efficiently, constitutive Matter and Form,</hi> or <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Relation,</hi> the <hi>Gospel Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Condonation,</hi> and all such previous Acts: And when they have done, not knowing what they affirm or deny, they only cry up the Name of <hi>Christ's Rightcousness imputed,</hi> not knowing what <hi>Imputation</hi> is, nor what sort of Cause <hi>Christ's Righteousness</hi> is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>efficient,</hi> or <hi>material,</hi> or <hi>formal</hi> by <hi>Constitution,</hi> and think its <hi>true meritorious Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality</hi> is too little: And in their description they exclude <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:94224:149"/>
decisive Justification,</hi> which they had denominated it to be, making it to be only the <hi>Donation of Christ's perfect Righteousness</hi> as in <hi>its Essence</hi> to be <hi>ours;</hi> and so joining the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and constitutive Causes, yet leavng out the <hi>instrumental Efficient,</hi> which is the <hi>Gospel Donation,</hi> or <hi>Covenant-Gift;</hi> and calling <hi>Faith</hi> the <hi>instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Cause,</hi> which is no <hi>efficient Cause,</hi> but a <hi>moral Reception of the free Gift,</hi> and a <hi>moral Qualification</hi> as a <hi>receptive Condition</hi> for our Title to the Possession. And whereas God never <hi>judged a Man righteous</hi> till he had <hi>made him righteous;</hi> they say, that to justify is not to <hi>make righteous,</hi> but to <hi>judg righteous,</hi> and yet describe <hi>judging</hi> by <hi>making:</hi> yea, and exclude the sentential Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at the day of Judgment, thinking that it is all perfectly at our first Justification sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced: As if God the Father, Christ as King or Prophet, the Holy Ghost, the Covenant of Grace, Faith, <hi>(together with my Directions in my Life of Faith, and Mothodus Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae)</hi> had no hand in our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness imputed only. <hi>Mr.</hi> Bax. <hi>Breviat. of Justif.</hi> Part 2. Head 51. <hi>p.</hi> 17. They say, all Sins past, present and to come are pardoned, even that not committed (that is no Sin.)—They err as grosly, saying, that <hi>[by Faith imputed for Righteousness]</hi> and <hi>[our being justified by Faith]</hi> is not meant the <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> but the <hi>Object, Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;</hi>

not sticking thereby to turn all such Texts into worse than <hi>nonsense,</hi> put <hi>Christ's Righteousness</hi> instead of the word <hi>[Faith]</hi> in all those Texts, and try how it will run. And why is <hi>Faith</hi> named if it have no part in the sense? They say that it justifieth not as a <hi>Work:</hi> I say, it justifieth not efficiently (here's a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off) at all, much less as a <hi>Work</hi> in <hi>Paul</hi>'s sense, that maketh the Reward to be not of Grace, but of Debt; nor doth it justify as an <hi>Act</hi> in <hi>genere;</hi> for then a <hi>quatenus ad omne,</hi> every <hi>Act</hi> would justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy; nor yet as a meer <hi>good Act</hi> or <hi>Work;</hi> for then every good <hi>Act</hi> would justify as it doth. But we are justified by, 1. This <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>specie,</hi> which is our <hi>fiducial reception of Christ.</hi> 2. And that as it is formally made by God the Condition of our participation of the Gift, which is Christ and his Justifying meritorious Righteousness. Christ is not instead of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> is not instead of <hi>Christ:</hi> It is Christ believed in, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and not Christ without <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Reception.</hi> Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 12, 18, 19. To receive <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Sanctification, Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> physically, is nothing but <hi>justificari, sanctificari,</hi> &amp;c. to be justified, sanctified, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.—They expose Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the scorn of Infidels, by telling Men, that it consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that which every No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in Logick or Reasoning knoweth to be impossible, that one Man's Sins and one Man's
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94224:150"/>
Righteousness should be made anothers; not only so far as that others partake of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects (Christ of our Sins in Sufferings, and we of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his Righteousness) which we all maintain; but that the thing it self is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially thus transferred; and so the Accidents do <hi>transire a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecto in subjectum: (Impudence upon Impudence in lying, the old Prophet of</hi> Bethel <hi>directly.)</hi> And whereas <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> are Accidents in the three Predicaments of Habit (or Privation) Acts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, they feign the <hi>Habits, Acts</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of odious Deformity of all the Elect, to become in themselves the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, Acts and Relations of Christ: And the <hi>Habits; Acts</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in Christ, to become essentially the very Habits, Acts and Relations of every Person elect.—They read in Scripture above six hundred Texts that speak of inherent and acted personal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness joined with the Promises of Life and God's acceptance, and Threatnings to them that have it not; and yet they by putid Contradiction say, it is a Righteousness that maketh no Man righteous, tho but <hi>in tantum subordinate</hi> to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious perfect Righteousness of Christ.

                           <p>In opposition to the Doctrine of Justification by the imputed application of the material Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ, Mr. <hi>Dan. Williams</hi> cries up the Beauty of sincere Holiness, and charges this as an Error upon Dr. <hi>Crisp:</hi> The greatest Holiness in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, tho wrought in them by the Holy Ghost, is meer Dung and Rottenness, and Filthiness, as in them (which is so in spight of his Heart, either as to our Justification before, or accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it is that the <hi>Doctor</hi> so terms it; and from hence our Author flies to the Popish and Quakeristical Method of crying up Holiness jointly for the same end.) <hi>The Truth confirmed.</hi> Consider, that whatever is spoken of Holiness in any meer Man on Earth since the Fall, is spoken of sincere Holiness, for perfect Holiness none had. Is that Dung which is the effect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in the Soul and Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? (Yes that it is, as to our Justification, either immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or subordinately.) Is that Dung which is so often honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the name of the <hi>Spirit</hi> it self, called the <hi>Spirit of Love, Prayer,</hi> &amp;c.? (Yes that it is, the <hi>Spirit</hi> himself tells us so, by the Mouth of <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.) Is not that more lovely which is called the <hi>Divine Nature?</hi> (Yes that it is, but not to be compared to the Righteousness of Christ in which the Elect stand materially
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94224:152"/>
clothed before ever they receive the Impression of the Divine Nature.) How amiable must that be which is the <hi>new Man after God's Image?</hi> Ephes. 4. 24. <hi>The new Heart,</hi> Ezek. 18. 31. The Law of God in the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the <hi>Grace of God?</hi> Are those Works Dung to which we are created in Christ Jesus, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 10. and <hi>enabled</hi> by the Spirit?

(but is it upon the account of this that God loves them, or rather is not this a fruit of his Love in Election, and their materially and actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being</hi> justified, precedent <hi>unto this?)</hi> Is it not pleasing to God, to which he hath made so many Promises, for which he so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Moses, David,</hi> and all the Saints, calling such a <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People,</hi> &amp;c.? (Is it for this they became a <hi>peculiar People?</hi> Let the Scripture decide it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 6, 7. 8. compare <hi>Josh.</hi> 24. 2, 3.) It's no small thing with which Christ is so pleased in his Spouse, as you see in the Song of <hi>Solomon</hi> (but the Church tells us there, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all her Graces she was black, and yet comely, from a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as a <hi>Tent</hi> or a <hi>Curtain,

How can it be acceptable to God through Christ, if it be Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and changed into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Flesh and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption?

And is it not strange that all Religion, and the human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self in a state of Trial should be fully struck at from a gross Conceit, that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God cannot foresee, and purpose Events unless it must null his Government over rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Subjects, and prevent his distribution of Rewards and Punishments by a stated Rule?

this; it's the scope of all the Revelations of God to Men since the Fall. It's true, we have nothing to do in a way of Atonement or Purchase; but it is as true, we have much to do in order to our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of what Christ hath purchased: we must <hi>repent</hi> that our Sins may be blotted out, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. We must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we may be saved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Lord is express, <hi>If you know these things, happy are you if you do them,</hi> John 13. 17. All Gospel-discoveries are made known for the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> Rom. 16. 26. And Christ will take Vengeance on all them that <hi>obey</hi> not the Gospel; neither Christ nor Gospel will secure them, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 8. The Revelations of God to Men are not a bare <hi>description</hi> of Duty and Benefits, but an injunction of Duty in a <hi>connexion</hi> with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, <hi>Rom. 10. 9. If thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess with thy Mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe with thy Heart, thou shalt be saved.</hi> I could shew there is no <hi>one</hi> saving Benefit granted to a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but on supposition of his doing: See much of this, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12. and <hi>chap.</hi> 21. 22. Christ never intended the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Merits for our <hi>Privileges,</hi> without ordering them as Motives to Duty on our part. The influences of the Spirit of God, and God's Institutions, have no causality in our Salvation, if Men have nothing to do in order to be saved. It's plain, that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ascribed to the Spirit,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94224:154"/>
and also to the means of Grace: neither of them are the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Price of Salvation <hi>(tho the</hi> Atonement <hi>and</hi> Price <hi>as to their</hi> Acceptance <hi>and</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy <hi>it seems depends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon)</hi> therefore they must save as they operate on the Soul in order to its actings, <hi>Rom. 1. 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 21. And this must be as it answers the way appointed for our participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life.—On what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is it said that we <hi>believe to the saving of our Souls?</hi> Heb. 10. 39. And <hi>Repentance to Salvation</hi> is the Expression of the Spirit of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. What sense can be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to these and the like Phrases, as they are opposed to their Contraries as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive, if Men do nothing towards their Salvation? See <hi>James 2. 14. Can Faith save him?</hi> Yea, and I may ask, What meaneth the Holy Ghost when he saith, <hi>In so doing thou shalt save thy self, and them that hear thee?</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 16. Sure the Argument is not strong, if it be true, we can do nothing for our Salvation.—The Destruction of Sinners under the Gospel, is still laid on <hi>not doing,</hi> they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law, <hi>(A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Condition of one Covenant of Works saves them from the Condemnation of another Covenant of Works)</hi> but they <hi>remain</hi> condemned, and their Ruin is fixed (and so they are <hi>twice dead)</hi> for want of doing somewhat. <hi>Ye will not come to me that you might have Life,</hi> John 5. 40.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94224:155"/>
How oft is the ruin of Souls laid on not turning, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> If Men have nothing to do for Salvation, then Christ hath no <hi>Rule</hi> to judg them who lived under the Gospel. I hope none will say the judicial Sentence will pass on Men as elected, or not elected. Doth it agree to the proceedings of that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal at that day, to say, Thou shalt be damned, <hi>because</hi> thou wert not elected? Is this the account the Scripture gives? Doth it not proceed on the difference in Mens Carriage and Tempers? See the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the <hi>Talents;</hi> they who improved their Talents were saved, he that hid it in a Napkin was <hi>therefore</hi> damned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 21, 24, 28.</p>
                           <p>Consider any Description of the last day, and you'll find God saves and damns with a respect to Mens neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects and compliance with his Gospel. I could easily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that if Men have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in order to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Ministry of Christ and his Apostles, the Ministry most apt and most blessed to Souls to this very day, is all a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Falshood, they are cold pleadings with Sinners <hi>(mercenary Converts)</hi> that are not backed with Life and Death: <hi>(and yet love to a Lust would make our Author double diligent in crossing Land and Sea to espouse the Object of it.)</hi> Remove saving Benefits and undoing Dangers from being Arguments to compliance with the Will of Christ, and any
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:94224:155"/>
may read the success of such a Ministry; and to use these Arguments to perswade Men to repent and believe, if we have nothing to do for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is a manifest falshood and trifling. It's awful to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how inconsistent some Mens Application is with their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> tho it's well their Uses to the unconverted have so much Truth in them.—True Holiness, sincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or good Works, and Perseverance are the way to Heaven, and so necessary to the Salvation of a Believer, that without them he cannot be saved, and continuing in them he shall be saved.—This might be evidenced by many Reasons. 1. It is not saving Faith <hi>(which is not, he should have said, the conjoint fruit of a state of Salvation)</hi> which is not operative to these Effects: It ceaseth to be true (tho once so) whenever it wholly fails of <hi>purifying the Heart, and working by Love.</hi> Many affirm, that all Graces are seminally in Faith, as in their Principle: Such must grant, that as Faith justifies us at first in receiving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on Christ; so it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to justify us, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Acts, <hi>(not a word all this while of God's justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, he must be forc'd to stay to the last; and when we have made our selves finally meet for it, then he must do it, as not being able to avoid it)</hi> and exerting it self in those other Operations, <hi>(Hold there Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man, I see these bold</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture of Life, or Door of Hope, or Argument to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version with hopes of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance could be framed out of those legal Threats or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to any Man that is a Sinner. <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, Why will you die?</hi> was not the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of that Covenant: No, if a Man is once a Sinner, the Law could speak no lower than this, Thou art undone
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94224:157"/>
whether thou turn <hi>or no.</hi> Things being thus, I would intreat thee to consider all the <hi>Calls</hi> of God in Christ to Men since the Fall; weigh the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and Threats wherewith God strengthens those Calls; see if any one of the Calls to Faith, or Repentance, or Hòli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, thus back'd with Promises and Threats, be not Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Doth God in those Calls promise Life to nothing below sinless, perfect Obedience, or doth he threaten eternal Death in those Calls against whatever is short of perfect <hi>Obedience? (So the rack-rent of the former broken Covenant is cancelled, provided we bring in the Pepper-corn Payment of the Conditionality of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.)</hi> Do the Threats annexed to those Calls exclude all after Repentance? <hi>(Not at all, according to our Author, for that may well be the prevalent Condition of our Re-entry, that was the previous Motive to our first Title and Possession.)</hi> See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. Are not these Calls with the Promises and Threats directed to <hi>Sinners</hi> for their <hi>Conversion</hi> and <hi>Recovery?</hi> Is it not to Sinners God speaks in them? and is it not for their Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Salvation? Are not the Promises an offer of Relief? Are not the Threatnings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to awe and warn Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners against refusal of these Offers? They be not uttered to bind the Curse, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from it, by urging our compliance with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of a Redeemer; <hi>Heb.</hi>

3. 7, 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 7. Every Threatning used by God as an Argument to Conversion, is a Gospel-threatning.—What kind of Government can Men assign to Christ, if there be no Sanction to his Precepts? Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> oft tells us, that the Sanction of the <hi>Law of Works</hi> is <hi>removed,</hi> the Curse is gone as to the Elect. This is true, if he mean, that sinless Obedience is not now the way to Life; <hi>(but a</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial <hi>imperfect Obedience is)</hi> and that all below it shall not bind Death upon us so as to hinder our Relief by the Gospel <hi>(so we be sure of bringing</hi> in <hi>our</hi> conditional Pepper-corn Rent.) But what then, hath the Redeemer no Promises and Threatnings to rule Man by? And is their Obedience or Disobedience an indifferent thing as to their Happiness or Misery? Must he save all or damn all, or else be a <hi>Respector of Persons</hi> in his Judicial Distributions? <hi>(So that our Justification de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon our Works or Doings, and we instigated thereunto from a moral attendance unto the Promises and Threatnings of the Covenant of Grace, as the Sanction thereof, and Christ's Boundaries in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Rectoral Office.)</hi> Is this the Language of God to Sinners since the Fall? Did Christ preach at this rate when on Earth? Or, doth he so speak now from Heaven? <hi>Heb. 12. 25. chap.</hi> 2. 3. Our Lord assures us, Mens Sins are aggravated, and their
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:94224:158"/>
Damnation grows greater by a rejection of his Call to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, through Impenitence and Unbelief; <hi>Joh. 8. 24. Heb.</hi> 10. 29.</p>
                           <p>It's a precarious Dominion that Christ exerciseth, if he hath neither Rewards nor Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments to induce Mens regards to his Authority. Read the Scripture, or wait the Judgment-day, and you'll find it otherwise.—<hi>(So that if a Man cannot then make it appear that he has wrought out an Obedience suted to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Promises and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Covenant of Grace, he must fall in Judgment.)</hi> How unsutable is it to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of Mankind, that Christ should govern us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Promises and Threatnings? He is a King, and we are his Subjects. <hi>(Now</hi> Allegiance <hi>comes in for a</hi> subordinate Righteousness, <hi>what a distended reach our Author has? like a longslang of a School-boy Dunce, of whom his Master said, he knew not what he was good for, unless to reach down Puddings from an high Shelf.)</hi> And we are, 1. Subjects in a State of <hi>trial</hi> for another World. <hi>(So that God cannot individually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine upon the Persons elected, tho he hath Election in store for them, nor Christ for whom he particularly died, nor the Spirit whom he hath effectually called, till this</hi> state of Trial <hi>be over.)</hi>—By this Gospel-Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, persevering Holiness, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience, or good Works, are necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. He that made Faith
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:94224:159"/>
necessary to Justification, hath made Obedience necessary to Salvation: He hath as well promised Heaven to the godly Man, as Pardon to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: And our perseverance in Holiness and Obedience, is as truly our way to Glory as the Scriptures can describe it: <hi>(One of the truest words he ever spake, but the Scriptures tell us that Christ</hi> is the way, <hi>we must be first implanted into him, then we are in our way unto Holiness, Obedience, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance and Glory.)</hi> Nothing of these merit Heaven: <hi>(The word</hi> merit <hi>is not in fashion, and therefore it is dangerous to own it; like K.</hi> James, <hi>by some disaffected Persons not publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged, tho secretly beloved and wish'd back again.)</hi> But he that merited Heaven, hath peremptorily appointed these to bring us thither; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10, 11, 12.—Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is promised to Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, true Holiness, sincere Obedience, or good Works; and the accomplishment of these Promises to these, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>an Act of Righteousness.</hi> These are Gospel-Promises, because Salvation is promised on terms so <hi>below Perfection.</hi> The Texts are innumerable that include these Promises; <hi>Rev. 2. 10. 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. Rom. 8. 13. Heb. 6. 10. 2 Thess.</hi> 1. 6, 7. The Righteousness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, not the proportion of the Work.—Object. <hi>These describe the Men whom God will save. Answ.</hi> True, but not as meer <hi>natural</hi> Signs, but

as <hi>moral instituted</hi> Signs: (i. e. <hi>the very substance and matter indeed of our Justification:)</hi> They are Qualifications which God appoints as Prerequisites to the Blessings: They are not meritorious, <hi>(no, that is left to the Righteousness of Christ, unto which this blasphemous Wretch assigns that</hi> meritorious Office, <hi>of presenting us justified in our own Righteousness)</hi> but they are made by the Promise <hi>necessary</hi> to our partaking of these Gifts, and the neglect of them would exclude our Interest in the Blessing.—Consider the respect to Glory which our good Works have in Scripture-dialect. They are as <hi>Seed to the Harvest,</hi> Gal. 6. 7, 8, 9. as a Way to ones pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Place, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. as <hi>Means</hi> to an End, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. as <hi>Work</hi> to ones Wages, <hi>Mat. 20. 1, 7.

Are they so indifferent to Happiness as the Doctor represents them? <hi>(Yes, that they are in our Justification, either as the conditional, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, or persevering part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for which it is that the Doctor and every sound Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever do perfectly abhor them.)</hi> How much of the Bible must be expunged e're his Opinion deserves Credit?

a Dispensation from striving to enter in at the <hi>strait Gate.</hi> (Strait <hi>indeed, if this sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically revived Covenant of Works</hi> be the way to Glory.) Object. <hi>It's for Christ's Incense these are accepted. Answ.</hi> But Christ's Incense will not be applied to our Sins, but to our Graces and Duties, and that shews they are more pleasing to God than our Sins be. And again, they are these Graces and Duties which are accepted for the sake of Christ: (speak out thou familiar Spirit, and whisper not thus in the Dust, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 4. Is it not for their material Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that all this is meant?) His Incense will not be denied to them, <hi>(now they produce the Matter of their Justification and Discharge)</hi> and thereby they are well pleasing to the Lord, and tend to render us so <hi>(Teste Bellarmino.) Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> to sum up all, I appeal to thee, 1. Whether God doth not require any more of any Sinner for Salvation than that they believe in Christ, repent of Sin, persevere in true Holiness, sincere Obedience, or good Works internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; and if we do so, can we perish? Hath not Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided all else? (i. e. <hi>all besides that which is necessary to save us.)</hi> And doth not the Promise secure Life upon doing these? <hi>(So that let us be sure of doing our part, and if Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon comes not in to do his part,</hi> i. e. <hi>meer saving us, if we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, of consequence the fault must not be ours but his.)</hi>
                              <pb n="291" facs="tcp:94224:160"/>
2. If any Sinner believe not, and repent not, hath Christ ever promised to save him? Will any Decree, or the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ secure him? <hi>(An open black-mouth'd Devil, without limitation! for are they not by the Decree and Merits of Christ, even all the Elect infallibly brought</hi> in viritim <hi>to believe, repent, and persevere therein unto Glory? No, says our Author.)</hi> Again, if any penitent Believer shall aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, prove ungodly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, hate God, or neglect to love God and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour wholly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall this Man be saved? Hath not Christ determined the contrary? Will his first Faith save him? A Resolution of these two things, according to the very scope of the Word, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the main of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy. These assert the Rule of Christ's rectoral Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Decree comes not in opposition to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of his Government, by which we are to govern our Hopes and Fears. <hi>Mr.</hi> Dan.

                           <p>Now, <hi>Reader!</hi> observe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently this <hi>13th</hi> Chapter of Mr. <hi>Dan. Williams,</hi> whence most of this thou hast read was taken, and thou wilt find, that notwithstanding his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Precaution (as a token of his pretended Innocence, which indeed is but a Blind) to the Reader in the very entrance of the Chapter, yet his main
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94224:161"/>
drift is, as appears from the very scope thereof, together with what he takes out of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Works, to engage against, and for what and to what end it was that the <hi>Doctor</hi> used those very Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences which he recites here and embattles; I say, do but observe this, and thou wilt find that his main and only drift is to set up Works <hi>(under a pretence of Holiness)</hi> as both the preparative, material and persevering Condition of our Justification, or justified state before God, directly as the <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Quaker,</hi> even to a hair's breadth, tho managed with more Impudence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness, tho sottishly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, by him: And let me tell thee, that a Protestant, and especially a Protestant-Dissenter in disguise, is worse than the rankest <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Quaker,</hi> and more to be <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred</hi> than the vilest of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.—But still our Author calls upon us to view a new Piece of his.—Obj. <hi>Christ was made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Adoption of Sons;</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I might shew how the Context doth confine to the following sense, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ was made under the Jewish Law as delivered four hundred Years after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which could not give Life, nor the Spirit; under which Law the Jewish Believers were shut up, and it their School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, and they as Servants in Bondage under the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:94224:161"/>
of this World, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Ceremonies, and far from the designed Liberty of adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sons. But Christ was made under this Law to redeem and rescue those Jewish Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers from this Bondage, and to bring the Gentiles as well as they, and at one instant with them, to the Gospel Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Liberty, called the <hi>Adoption of Sons;</hi> even a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from the Jewish Yoke and Bondage, which many were still fond of. Consult <hi>chap.</hi> 3. and 4. In this sense it's not the Law of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as a proper Covenant of Works, that's meant by the Law under which <hi>(a pretty</hi> Evasion <hi>if it would hold)</hi> Christ was made. The Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency or Works had not in it these Ceremonies, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the like.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. I grant that Christ in taking our Nature became a Servant, and subject to the Law of Innocency, to its Precepts and its Punishments, as a <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> according to the terms ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: (i. e. <hi>So far forth as that he might fully vacate it, and bring in a new Law.)</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. But how follows it, that because he obliged himself in the Covenant of <hi>Redemption,</hi> that he would be in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture subject to the Law for our Redemption, that therefore he was such a Surety in what he did, as that we legally did what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:94224:162"/>
that it concludes the contrary; we did it not because he did it, he did it to redeem us, we were to do it to prevent the need of Redemption, and had we done it, there had been no room for his doing of it: and obeying alone would have serv'd our turn before Sin, and neither our obeying nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering have serv'd the turn after Sin.</p>
                           <p>Further, 4. Christ did not then <hi>become a Surety,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to die for us by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made under the Law; but he was made under the Law, because he had undertaken to die for us: His very being made under the Law of Works, was but a performance of a <hi>previous</hi> Engagement to the Lawgiver; this being one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that he should take our Nature, be a <hi>Servant</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and make <hi>his Soul an Offering for Sin,</hi> Heb. 10. 9. Isa. 53. Can any infer then, that because Christ was made under the Law in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his prior Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to redeem lost Sinners, to which Engagement these <hi>Sinners</hi> were never obliged, <hi>(then they were redeemed from that which held them not in Bondage)</hi> that therefore these Sinners did truly do and suffer whatever Christ did, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to redeem and save them? It's true, but for Sinners, and the Law, and Divine Justice, Christ needed not to enter into any Obligation that he would be under the Law, and die for Sinners, and obey
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:94224:162"/>
to make the Law honourable. But what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It was not from any Obligation the Law of Works had upon him, that he became obliged to be a <hi>Subject;</hi> or if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Subject, that he <hi>must die</hi> whilst he was an innocent Person; nor was it the Law of Works that gave him a <hi>right to his Reward:</hi> if he should obey and die, this Law never promised his Death would be a <hi>Ransom for all, (no, nor for any, since none was any way concern'd in it, for ought I can perceive, but Christ himself)</hi> and he be glorious, as <hi>(or, as it were a perhaps Redeemer)</hi> a Redeemer: <hi>(a wonderful mock Redeemer does this fellow make of the blessed Jesus, who has laid down a Ransom that does not identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally answer the State and Law of their Captivity:)</hi> the Law of Works hath nothing of this; <hi>(nor, as it seems, any Obedience unto it, either by</hi> Christ <hi>or our</hi> selves) Christ had to do with an higher Law before he submitted to this; a
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:94224:163"/>
Law wherein he was the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, transacting without us tho for our recovery. I'll give you an Instance, There is a Law made, that he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits High-Treason shall die; a thousand Persons commit High-Treason in various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and are condemned: But the Law-giver, or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute supreme Ruler, makes a Law, that if such a great Monarch will become his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and die to expiate this Treason, those condemned Traitors shall be forgiven, and released in such a time and way as is agreed between the Lawgiver and this Monarch: This Monarch becomes a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and dieth to expiate the Treason, and deliver the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: Now here the Law-giver is satisfied, the end of the Law is answered, the Monarch dies in the stead and place of the Traitors, and they in a fit time and way are released. But yet they cannot be said to die, or pay a Ransom for their Lives, much less to say, that they paid as much as the Monarch. Mr. <hi>Dan.

                           <p>Mr. <hi>Troughton,</hi> giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Baxterian No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> tells us, The Covenant that justifies as a Law, is a Covenant of Works: A Law requireth Works or Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it, and thereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth a Reward, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Punishment to Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; a Covenant that is a Law requiring such things to be done, and promising Life to the doing of them, and threatning Death for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them, is a Covenant of Works: Now such is the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant according to this Opinion; for we are told, that we are not justified by trusting in the Righteousness of Christ, as that which can give us an immediate Title to Life; nor is justifying Faith a trust or reliance on Christ for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made through him; nor doth Faith justify as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument or Means of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending or applying Christ to our selves; nor indeed doth Faith justify at all more than any other Grace, saving that it is the first in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so doth set other Graces on work. But that Faith, Repentance, and the whole course of new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence do justify as the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new Covenant, that is to say, by the Death of Christ God releaseth Man from the Obligation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience, as the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life required in the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:94224:164"/>
old Law, and hath established a new, that if they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Son, repent of their Sins, and serve him as well as they can for the future, they shall be saved. What then is the Gospel but a new Law? and it doth justify as a Law, giving the Reward to Obedience, or the fulfilling of it.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, we are told, <hi>that Faith taken in its full latitude is nothing else but universal Obedience, and that so it is to be understood, when it said that Faith alone justifies,</hi> viz. <hi>Faith and all other Graces with it in habit and exercise to the end.</hi> Aph. 65.

If you know there is an elect Person in the Womb, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> did, he is a more sure Heir to Heaven than ever any great Man's Son was to an outward Estate. And as to Adoption, that may not be till some time after; for that is the Grace of Sonship. It's one thing to be a Son, and another thing to have the Grace of Sonship. And is the calling them the Sons of God, manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking them into the number, and endowing them with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the Sons of God? The relation of an Heir, and the state of Adoption admit of different Considerations. The state of Adoption is the grown state of an Elect Person; he is put into possession of the Estate, and all Privileges, sits together with Christ in heavenly Places as a Coheir.

The Discourse is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that Righteousness which belongs to the Person of Christ, on the account of his fulfilling the Law of his Mediation, and his Title to the Rewards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to him as Mediator for fulfilling that Law, which he did to every <hi>iota.</hi> This Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is accounted to be for us; and to deliver all the Elect, was the end of all his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. Nevertheless it is not subjectively in us, because it is inconsistent with the nature of Gospel-imputation. To impùte to one what is suffered by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to esteem the one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for in the Sufferings of the other, and to deal with him as if himself had suffered the same things, yea, and had never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to suffer; but it is not to judg that he did in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son suffer, for that were false, and a derogation to the Honour of him who endured the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, especially if he freely suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in another's room, and for his advantage, as our Lord did, <hi>Heb. 9. 15.

                           <p>Because our Goodness extends not to God for his <hi>Profit,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he regards it no more than Dung and Filthiness: Because we are, after all our Obedience, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants</hi> to God, and less profitable Servants than we should be, therefore our Holiness is as unpleasing to him as Dung: Because <hi>God abhorred the New Moons and Sabbaths</hi> of the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi> therefore he loaths the sincere Obedience of the upright.</p>

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If this place speaks of Gospel-Righteousness, as his own things which he counted Dung, it doth not prove that Holiness is Dung; all that it can infer, is, that in comparison with winning Christ it was <hi>esteemed</hi> as Dung: And who must not own, that compared with gaining Christ, the best thing in us is vile, yea, compared with his Righteousness? but yet it must not be vile in it self; as Rivals with Christ we must <hi>hate</hi> Father and Mother, but doth it follow that Father and Mother are hateful, <hi>absolutely</hi> considered? No, we are bound to love them when not compared with Christ. I need add no more in Answer to the Doctor's Reason; but tho I own the imputed Righteousness of Christ for our Justification, yet I think to ground it on this place is a damage to the Truth: And therefore I add, <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Gospel-Holiness or Righteousness is not here intended by Dung, the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:94224:167"/>
those Dogs (which term they gave the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ver. 2.) to glory in. Who were those he calls Dogs? They were the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi> (alluding to <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests) or the Jews that reject Christ, by an Opinion of more Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in Jewish Observations, and an abuse of the Mosaick Frame. What were the things he counted Dung? I answer, They were the Jewish Privileges, and that conceited Christless Righteousness, which he once va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, as those Dogs at present did; but it was not that Gospel-Holiness which by the Grace of Christ he was now partaker of.</p>

                           <p>I answer plainly, From the whole scope of the Chapter. 1. They were his Christless Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Righteousness which he calls Dung. For, (1.) His Discourse is a warning against the Jewish Perverters and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of the Gospel. <hi>Ver. 2. Beware of Dogs, beware of evil Workers, beware of the Concision.</hi> (2.) He states a Comparison, wherein he opposeth them, and includes a great part of Gospel-Holiness in that Opposition. Ver. 3. <hi>For we are the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, which worship God in the Spirit,</hi> viz. not carnally, and with beggarly Elements, as they do, and <hi>rejoice in Christ Jesus, q. d.</hi> we feel a true and solid Joy in and by Christ, whom they refusing to accept, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.—(3.) He enumerates these Jewish Pretensions, which he had as much right to glory in as these boasting Enemies; <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. He was a Jew by Birth, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:94224:168"/>
not a meer Proselyte, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised as soon as any, of the strictest Sect, as fiery zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ as they, and as ceremonious as the best, <hi>touching the Righteousness which is in the Law blameless:</hi> He intends not sinless Obedience, nor Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity, but a Life not to be blamed by the Rule of the Jewish Pedagogy, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the judgment of strict Observers. (4.) Of these he professeth a Renunciation when converted to Christ, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, and 8. <hi>Yea doubtless,</hi> &amp;c.—I have not only quitted those Jewish things, but <hi>I have suffered the loss of all things</hi>—and <hi>do count them but Dung, that I may win Christ.</hi> What these Jews do so boast of, and the World so esteem, even all are to me but Dogs Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I may fully possess Christ, and the full Effects of his Undertakings in perfect Peace, Holiness and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, somewhat of which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun in me.—It was not Gospel-Holiness which he accounted Dung or Loss: for this was not his own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is of the Law, as opposed to that which is <hi>by the Faith of Christ (here lies the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry)</hi> nay, this is by the Faith of Christ, our Hearts are <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith,</hi> Acts 15. 9.

And some take God's <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christ's Righteousness to us,</hi> to be a <hi>reputing us to be the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> who <hi>our selves fulfilled</hi> the Law in or by Christ; so that his very Attributes of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. which Christ came purposely to declare, are by some denied, blasphemed or abused, on pretence of extolling Christ and our Redemption, as if we might sin that Grace may abound, <hi>Rom. 6. 1, 2. Gal.</hi> 2. 17.—It is most ordinary to reduce all the Office of Christ to the <hi>Prophetical, Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and <hi>Kingly part</hi> (for it is more proper <hi>(no doubt but it is in our Author's designs about Justification)</hi> to call them three parts of one Office, than three Offices.)

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:94224:169"/>
whole course of Obedience, and fulfilling the Law, to any one, or all of these totally: Tho in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect as it is his <hi>Example,</hi> it is <hi>teaching,</hi> and as it is part of his <hi>Humiliation,</hi> it may be called a part of his <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> yet as it is <hi>meritorious-Obedience</hi> and <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it belongeth indeed to our <hi>High-Priest,</hi> but not formally to his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> no nor yet as <hi>he himself</hi> is the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for Sin: for it is not an Act of <hi>Priesthood</hi> to be <hi>himself a Sacrifice.</hi> But yet I think the common Distribution intimateth to us that sense, which containeth the Truth which we enquire after: For the word <hi>Priesthood</hi> is applied to Christ in a peculiar Notion, so as it is never applied to any other, and therefore is taken more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensively, as including all that <hi>Good</hi> which he doth for us (as good) by the way of <hi>Mediation</hi> with the Father, and all his Acts of Mediation with God, <hi>&amp;c.

to none who answer the Gospel-rule of its Application. <hi>(Thus our Faith and Repentance, and all other Gospel-rule Qualifications, give Life and Efficacy to the Righteousness of Christ, which lies by us as a dormant Drug, till our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence render it of use.)</hi> But we are not as righteous as Christ, we are not so as to Sanctification, <hi>(here's both the Loop-hole and Trap-door too)</hi> he being perfectly holy, we being imperfectly so, tho real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy.

And to suppose the Elect to be as sanctified as Christ, even while they wallow in the Mire, <hi>(a pretty</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine-winding <hi>from the Cause in hand)</hi> is a strange Position: But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Phrase refers to <hi>Justification,</hi> yet it is not proper: For—<hi>Tho Christ be perfectly holy, yet his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is not so imputed to us, as that we are therefore perfectly holy.

I understand that the Promise gives to the imperfectly holy, Impunity, and right to Life, on the account of Christ's Merits: But where hath God said he will esteem the imperfect to be perfect, as to what he deelares
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:94224:173"/>
them imperfect in? Or, hath God ever said we are thus perfect? He may deal with a sincere Christian (who is called perfect in comparison of others) as if he were perfect, having provided for his Justice and Honour in doing thus by the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Christ; but he cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him perfectly holy.

If the very Holiness of Christ's Person be in us, it is his increated Holiness, or created; if his <hi>increated,</hi> then we are Gods, and not Men, for there is nothing increated but God; if the <hi>created</hi> Holiness of Christ's Human Nature be in us, it must depart from him, or cease to be in him, as far as it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us; for the same individual Quality cannot be in two Subjects at once, tho the same for kind may. If we are as holy as Christ, what hinders us to be entituled to the same degrees of Glory and Honour as he? And all this being founded on the change of Person between Christ and us, we may well say we are Christs, even every elect Person severally. And if our perfect Holiness should be surmised from the Union between Christ and Believers, that indeed would not be a change of Person, but
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:94224:173"/>
the making of Christ and us one <hi>natural Person. (Here he strikes at the</hi> mystical Person <hi>of Christ, which consists in their</hi> Membership Union <hi>with, and</hi> Relation <hi>unto him as their</hi> Head.) And then on the same ground as we can say we are as <hi>holy as Christ</hi> is, we may say we are as much Gods as Christ, as wise as Christ, as entituled to Worship as Christ; we do all that Christ doth in Heaven and Earth, and he doth all as we Sinners do, we give what he gives, and he receives what we receive; distinction of Persons is gone, Christ and we do nothing, are nothing as distinct Persons.

                              <hi>Man:</hi> Justification by God is either as he is a <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> and above <hi>Laws,</hi> or as he is a <hi>Judg,</hi> according to his Laws: In the first way <hi>God maketh us just by his Act</hi> of Oblivion, or pardoning Law, or Covenant of Grace. In the second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect God doth two ways justify and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give: 1. As a determining Judg. 2. As the Executioner of his Judgment. In the former respect God doth two ways justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy us: 1. By <hi>esteeming us just.</hi> 2. By <hi>publick sentencing us just.</hi> As <hi>Executioner,</hi> he <hi>useth</hi> us as <hi>just,</hi> and as so judged.—I pass by here all Christ's Justification of us by way of Apology or Plea, and all Justification by Witnesses and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the <hi>constitutive Causes</hi> of our Righteousness, lest I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them whom I would help, by using more Distinctions <hi>(than indeed I can make good, as having no Scripture, but Brain-Conceptions warrant for the same)</hi> than they are willing to learn: But these few are necessary; 1. It is one thing for God to <hi>make us</hi> righteous, by forgiving all our Sins of Commission and Omission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the sake of Christ's Satisfaction and Obedience. 2. It is another thing for God to <hi>esteem</hi> us to be so righteous when he hath first made us so. 3. It is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for God to <hi>sentence</hi> us righteous as the publick Judg, by Jesus Christ. 4. And it is another thing for God to take off all Penalties and Evils, and to give us all the Good which belong to the Righteous, and so execute his own Laws and Sentence. And he that will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish of these senses or sorts of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, shall not dispute with me. And while I am now upon this, I will give the Reader these two Remarks and Counsels: 1.

that we are sincere, or some such like Condition before?

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> It is very doubtful, whether by the Spirit and Grace of Christ they mean no more than <hi>Pelagius</hi> did, <hi>viz.</hi> The outward means of Grace, and the common assistance of our natural Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the use of those Means, without any supernatural Grace or Qualities put into the Soul; but if they do, I demand whether there be any certainty that these Conditions shall be wrought in us? If there be, then the Obedience and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance of a Believer is certain, which they will not grant, nor can that be the proper legal Condition of the Benefit of any Law, which is absolutely promised in the Law it self: if it be absolutely uncertain, whether Christ will work in us the Conditions of Life, then is our Case no better, nor any more of Grace than that of the holy Angels, who were kept in their Integrity, and that according to Election, yet having no Promise that appears to depend on, they stand by their own Obedience, not properly by Grace. <hi>(Tho with submission to better Judgments, I would add, that as they stand by the Grace of Election, so it includes all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gracious Supplies even unto Angels for their standing, they themselves being but Creatures.)</hi> If <hi>Adam</hi> had stood, it must have been by Divine Assistance (for a Creature cannot be independent)

and yet he was under a Covenant of Works, Works being the condition, and assistance uncertain. But if they say, it is certain that Christ will work the Conditions in us if we do our part, <hi>i. e.</hi> if we believe and obey, we shall have some help in it, then is our believing and beginning to obey antecedent to the Grace of Christ, and the condition of more Grace and Perseverance; and so Grace and all the Conditions of Life, as well as Life it self, depend upon the Condition of our Obedience and Diligence, and so the Covenant is still a Covenant of Works, for all that assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance we are like to have in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it. <hi>Lutherus Redivivus,</hi> p. 28, 29, 41, 42.</p>
                           <p>There is <hi>no Guilt</hi> on them that are in <hi>Christ,</hi> so far as they <hi>walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit,</hi> nor no proper <hi>Condemnation</hi> by <hi>Sentence</hi> or <hi>Execution</hi> at all, because their Pardon is renewed by Christ, as they renew their Sins of Infirmity; but not because he <hi>prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> their <hi>need</hi> of any further Pardon.—The <hi>kind</hi> of our present Justification is imperfect, it being but in Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title, and some part of <hi>Execution;</hi> the full and perfect <hi>Sentence</hi> and <hi>Execution</hi> being at the day of Judgment.—I leave them therefore to say <hi>[Christ's Righteousness imputed to us is perfect, therefore we are perfectly just and justified as Christ]</hi> who know not what <hi>Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> here is; nor that <hi>Christ</hi>'s personal Righteousness is not given to us as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors in <hi>it self,</hi> but in the <hi>Effects;</hi> and who know not the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>believing</hi> and blaspheming, and making our selves as so many Christs to our selves, and that know not what need they have of Christ, or of Faith, or Prayer, or of any holy endeavour for any more Pardon, and Righteousness or Justification, than they have already; (q. d. <hi>unless I shall be justified in my own

Baxter'<hi>s Life of Faith,</hi> p. 196, 332.</p>
                           <p>There is a certain <hi>Baxterian,</hi> who ever he be, that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> quotes in his Piece of his Justification, whose sayings follow.—But we are now told by one, that if we should <hi>affirm it an hundred times, (viz.</hi> that we own an <hi>inherent Righteousness)</hi> he could not scarce believe us.—And first, he says, <hi>That inherent Righteousness can on no other account be said to be ours, than that by it we are made righteous, that is the Condition of our Justification re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the new Covenant. This being denied, all inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is denied.</hi>—It is added, <hi>that all Righteousness respects a Law-and a Rule, by which he is to be tried: And he is righteous who hath done all these things which that Law requires by whose Rule he is to be judged,</hi>—But then it will be said, that if it doth not <hi>answer</hi> that Law and Rule whereby we are to be judged, then it is <hi>no Righteousness,</hi> for all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness must answer the Law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is required. And I say it is most true, it is no <hi>perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> it doth not so answer the Rule and Law, as that we can be justified by it, or safely judged on it. But so far as it <hi>answers the Law,</hi> it is a Righteousness, that is, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly so, and therefore is an <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteousness,</hi> which yet giveth the denomination of righteous unto them that have it, both absolutely and comparatively. It is said there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it is <hi>the Law of Grace, or the Gospel from whence we are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated righteous with this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
                              <pb n="327" facs="tcp:94224:178"/>
But that we are by the Gospel denominated <hi>righteous</hi> from any Righteousness that is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Moral Law, will not be proved.—And that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requires all these things entirely and equally, as the <hi>Condition of our Justification before God,</hi> and so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently thereunto, is not yet proved, nor ever will be. It is hence concluded, <hi>That this is our Righteousness, according to the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Law which requires it; by this we are made righteous, that is, not guilty of the non-performance of the Condition required in that Law:</hi> And these things are said <hi>to be very plain,</hi> so no doubt they seemed unto the Author, unto us they are intricate and perplexed. However, I wholly deny <hi>that our Faith, Obedience, and Righteousness consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ours, as wrought by us,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho they are all accepted with God through Jesus Christ, according to the Grace declared in the Gospel, do <hi>perfectly</hi> answer the Commands of the Gospel, requiring them of us, as to matter, manner, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and that therefore it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impossible that they should be the Cause or Condition of our Justification before God: Yet in the Explanation of these things it is added by the same Author, <hi>that our maimed and imperfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is accepted unto Salvation, as if it were every way absolute and perfect, for that so it should be Christ hath merited by his most perfect Righteousness.</hi> But it is Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and not Salvation that alone we discourse about; and that the Works of Obedience or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness have another respect unto Salvation than they have unto Justification, is too plainly and too
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94224:179"/>
often expressed in the Scripture, to be modestly denied. And if this <hi>weak and imperfect Righteousness</hi> of ours be esteemed and accepted as every way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before God, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is because God judgeth it to be perfect, and so declares us to be most just, and justified thereon in his sight, or he judgeth it not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth us to be perfectly righteous in his sight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; neither of these I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose can well be granted: It will therefore be said it is neither of them, but <hi>Christ hath obtained by his compleat and perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Obedience, that this lame and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteousness of ours should be accepted as every way perfect.</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> of Justification, <hi>p.</hi> 327, 328, 329, 330, 331.—</p>
                           <p>Hence it appears how little force there is in that Argument which some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be of so great weight in this Cause. <hi>As every one</hi> (say they) <hi>shall be judged of God at the last day, in the same way and manner, or on the same grounds is he justified of God in this Life: But by Works and not by Faith alone every one shall be judged at the last day; wherefore by Works, and not by Faith alone every one is justified before God in this Life.</hi>

For, 1. It is no where said that we shall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the last day, <hi>ex ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus;</hi> but only that God will render unto Men <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum opera:</hi> But God doth not justify any in this Life <hi>secundum opera,</hi> being justified freely by his Grace, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Works of Righteousness which we have done. And we are every where said to be justified in this Life, <hi>ex fide, per fidem,</hi> but no where <hi>propter fidem;</hi> or that God justifieth us <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum fidem,</hi> by Faith, but not <hi>for our Faith,</hi> nor according to our Faith: And we are not to depart from the Expressions of the Scripture where such a difference is constantly observed. 2. It is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what strange that a Man should be judged at the last day, and justified in this Life <hi>just in the same way and manner,</hi> that is, with respect unto Faith and Works, when the Scripture doth constantly ascribe our Justification before God to Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the last day is said to be according unto Works, without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 224.

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:94224:180"/>
Faith is unavailable, as Faith without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is impossible: Faith seems to compleat all, and in a manner comprehend all.—If you take it <hi>(viz. Jer.</hi> 31. 31, &amp;c.) in this sense (viz. <hi>of the</hi> natural Jews) yet here <hi>(viz.</hi> in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, &amp;c.) is <hi>a Law written in the Heart,</hi> which includes Faith in order to God's being their God, and the remission of their Sins.——Reader, <hi>Note,</hi> 1. There is a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness for which a Man is justified; this is only Christ's Righteousness, this is the Foundation of the Promise, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Blessing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: nothing can add to it, or mingle with it; it's sufficient, and alone suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to satisfy Justice alone for Guilt, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Acceptance and Life. 2. There's to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what the condition of the Person is whom this is promised to: he is one that hath this Grace of true Faith, and exerts it into act. This Grace is also required and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as indispensibly necessary to the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Forgiveness; Christ's Righteousness shall not be imputed to this use, unless we believe: And nothing shall hinder our Title to this Benefit if we do believe in Christ, for the Promise is invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable: And this Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a Conformity to the Rule of the Promise, some call it a subordinate Righteousness, not mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Righteousness <hi>for</hi> which Sin is forgiven, for it's Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness alone for which God justifies us; but it's our answering that Rule by which Christ applieth his Righteousness for our Remission, and a right to Life; and his Promise is the ground of our Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. <hi>Mr.</hi> Dan.

                           <p>Faith and Repentance are Acts of Man, and pre-requisite to Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Therefore as <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Works'</hi> are words of the same sense, so <hi>Works,</hi> even <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>special Grace,</hi> are prerequisite to Justification.</p>

                           <p>By this it is very plain how far a Man must be justified in Judgment by his own Personal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and also how to understand <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. and all the Descriptions of the last Judgment, and the Reasons there assign'd of the Sentence, and what it is to be justified or condemned by our Words, and to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to our Works, or what we have done in obedience or disobedience to the Law of Grace, and what is meant in <hi>James</hi> by being justified by Works, and not by Faith alone: For tho <hi>Christ's Righteousness</hi> is to be then <hi>honoured,</hi> it is not his <hi>part</hi> but <hi>ours,</hi> that is by him to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined</hi> and <hi>judged:</hi> And it is the <hi>Law of Grace</hi> by which we must be judged, which prescribed us the Conditions of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Salvation: The performance of which must therefore be the

Cause of the day to be examined and judged.—To justify a Man's <hi>right to Salvation,</hi> is to justify the <hi>Man</hi> when his Right is the thing tried: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Causes of our <hi>right to Salvation</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Causes of our <hi>Justification.

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Affirmers quite mistake <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> in thinking that it is the Law of Innocency which the words cited by <hi>Paul</hi> describe, when indeed it was <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law of Works, which had Sacrifices and Promises of Pardon, which the other had not. 2. Christ is there said to be the end of all the Law as to its Shadows, Types and conjunct Promises. <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>but Grace and Truth</hi> (that is, the things promised and typified) <hi>came by</hi> Jesus Christ. The confounding of these Laws confoundeth many in these Controversies. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 63.</p>
                           <p>It seemeth strange to some, to find the whole Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all Christ's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and all the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, inculcating <hi>inherent</hi> and <hi>performed</hi> Righteousness as that which must be judged about to Life or Death, and yet to find <hi>Paul</hi> so oft pleading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Justification by Works: But if we will take the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture together, and not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent scraps, the Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is evident.—Man is now sinful and condemned by
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:94224:183"/>
the first Law, and is now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Law of Grace that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giveth Pardon and Life through a Redeemer, to those that <hi>believingly accept the Gift according to its nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by Repentance to turn to God, and live an holy Life in sincerity.</hi> Now God doth through all the Scripture tell us, <hi>That no one shall pass with God for a just Man, or be saved, that will not do this,</hi> but shall be condemned further for refusing it: And thus he that doth Righteousness is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and all shall be judged according to their Works, thus required by the Law of Grace. To deny this, is to deny the scope of the whole Scripture, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: But <hi>Paul</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted against those that taught that the Gentiles must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyted, and keep the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or else they could not be accounted just Men, nor be saved: And he proveth, that the Gentiles being under the Law of Grace, may pass with God for just Men, and be saved, if they <hi>[believingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Gift of Grace accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its nature, and consent by Repentance to turn to God, and live a holy Life in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity]</hi> tho they keep not the Jewish Law: Yea, further, that tho the Jewish Fathers were obliged to keep that Law, it was as it belonged to the Covenant of Grace and of Faith; and that before that Law was, <hi>Abraham</hi> and others were just, and saved by Faith, according to the universal Law
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:94224:183"/>
of Grace; and that the Task of Works according to the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> will of it self make no Man just or salvable, and consequently no other Task of Works, which would make the Reward to be not of Grace, but of Debt, and is opposed to, or separated from Redemption and the free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donation and Donation of the Covenant of Grace.] This is the plain drift of <hi>Paul.</hi>—</p>

                           <p>The Wisdom of Men in the Fall finding these several words <hi>(Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Sanctification, Mortification)</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations run them into Divisions, and separated that which is in one, and cannot be divided in the Possession; for it is one that worketh all these where he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent according to the measure received: And this is the just One, who by Faith lives in the Creature, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him; and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Justifier and Sanctifier of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and the Mortifier of that Nature which is out of the Faith; and one of these is not alone without the rest: For that which sanctifies that mortifies, and the same justifies; and all that know what it is to have these in the Life, know this. I know there are a People who have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to Heaven more than to Holiness; and they, lest they should spoil their carnal Delights, have in their Brain-ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination conceited a

And because the Scripture saith, God justifies the Ungodly through Faith, therefore they conclude themselves justified in their Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness by a fancy which they call Faith, but are without in Christ: for that Faith which lays not hold upon God's Righteousness is not the Faith of Christ, but a dead thing: for so far as any hath the Faith of Christ, so far it reveals God's Righteousness without the Law, from Faith to Faith; by which Righteousness of <hi>God,</hi> the just live, and the unjust die, and so justified, as they are sanctified and mortified, and no further; even as the Righteousness of <hi>God</hi> without the Law is manifest, being wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the Righteousness of <hi>God,</hi> which is by Faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all that believe, without respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons—for the Blood of Christ it washes away the Filth, and so puts off the old Man, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies

dered is no more than this, that as <hi>Adam as Representative of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> was he by whom Sin entred into the World; so Christ was he by whose coming and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience Righteousness had an entrance to the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of many.—Christ's Work was two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, 1. To remit, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, or justify from the imputation of Sins past, such as truly repent and believe. 2. By his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Spirit working in the Hearts of such, to destroy and remove the very nature of Sin, to make an end of it, to finish Transgression pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and to come; the first removes the Guilt, the second the Cause of it.—I grant that Christ's Obedience to Death, was in order to make Men righteous, because it was in the nature of a Sacrifice: In which sense the Just suffered for the Unjust, and whilst we were Sinners Christ died for us. And he justified the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, upon Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; still Repentance brought home the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pardon promulgated in and by that holy Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: thus by the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of one, even to the Death, many come to be made righteous, that is, justified from many Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 70, 71, 72,</p>

Tho Christ died for the ungodly, yet they are not thereby justified whilst unrepentant. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> saith, Repent and receive the remission of Sins. How is this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance wrought, by which as a Condition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny come to be intrusted in that great Pardon? Is the Spirit unconcerned in this? Are we not by Nature the Children of Wrath? Is not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by the Professors of Religion in our times, and the most affected piece of their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness too? If then Repentance be a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this cannot be without the Spirit of Christ work it, then something must be done within of the nature of inward Righteousness, before any Benefit can be received from Christ's Death and Sufferings; this is close to the Point. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 74.</p>

                           <p>The third thing
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:94224:173"/>
proposed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered is, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>good Works their necessity to Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> I suppose there is enough said before to clear us from any Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish in this matter: But if it be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Whether we have not said,</hi> or will not affirm, <hi>That a Man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Works?</hi> I answer, I hope none need, neither ought to take offence, if in this matter we use the plain Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which saith expresly in answer hereunto, <hi>Jam. 2. 24. Ye see then how that by Works a Man is justified, and not by Faith only.</hi> I shall not offer to prove the truth of this saying, since what is said in this Chapter by the Apostle, is sufficient to convince any Man that will read and believe it; I only from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive this one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—If no Man can be justified without Faith, and no <hi>Faith</hi> be <hi>living,</hi> nor yet available to Justification with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, then
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:94224:174"/>
                              <hi>Works</hi> are <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to <hi>Justification:</hi> But the first is true, therefore also the last. For this Truth is so apparent and evident in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that, for the proof of it we might transcribe most of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Gospel. I shall instance a few, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do so clearly assert the thing in question, that they need no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, nor fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And then I shall answer the Objections made to this, which indeed are the Arguments used for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Opinion, <hi>Heb. 12. 14. Mat. 7. 21. Joh. 13. 17. 1 Cor. 7. 19. Rev.</hi> 22. 14. and many more that might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced; from all which I thus argue.—If those only can <hi>enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> that <hi>do the Will of the Father;</hi> if those be accounted only the <hi>wise Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> that do the Sayings of Christ, if no Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations avail but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>keeping</hi> of the <hi>Commandments,</hi> and if they be blessed
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:94224:174"/>
that <hi>do</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> and thereby have right to the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> and entrance through the Gate into the City, then <hi>Works</hi> are absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> and <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.—</hi>But the first is true; and <hi>therefore</hi> also the last. The <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of the <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> is so clear and evident, that I think no Man of sound Reason will call for a proof of it.—But they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that Works are not necessary to Justification: First, because of that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, <hi>Luk. 17. 10. When ye shall have done all these things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, say, We are unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> As to God we are indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, for he needeth nothing, neither can we add any thing unto him; but as to our selves, we are not unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, else it might be said, that it is not profitable for a Man to keep God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is most absurd, and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:94224:175"/>
would contradict Christ's Doctrine throughout. Doth not Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. through all those Beatitudes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Men blessed for their Purity, for their Meekness, for their Peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> And is not then that for which Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth Men bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, profitable to them? Moreover, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 21, 23. doth not Christ pronounce the Men good and faithful Servants, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents? Was not their doing of that then profitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? And <hi>ver.</hi> 30. it is said of him that hid his Talent and did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, <hi>Cast ye the unprofitable Servant into utter Darkness.</hi> If then their not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent made the Man unprofitable, and he was therefore cast into utter Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it will follow by the Rule of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries,</hi> so far at least, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving made the other profitable, seeing if our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries will allow us to believe Christ's
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:94224:175"/>
words, this is made a <hi>Reason,</hi> and so at least a <hi>Cause instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
                           <p n="2">2. They object those Sayings of the Apostle, where he excludes the Deeds of the Law from Justification, as first, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20, 28.—</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> We have shewn already what place we give to <hi>Works,</hi> even to the <hi>best</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap>orks, in <hi>Justification,</hi> and how we ascribe its immediate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Cause to the <hi>Worker</hi> brought forth <hi>in</hi> us, but not to the <hi>Works.</hi> But in Answer to this Objection, I say, there is a great difference betwixt the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and those of <hi>Grace,</hi> or of the Gospel. The first are excluded, the second not, but are necessary: The first are those which are perform'd in Man's own Will, and by his Strength, in a conformity to the outward Law and Letter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:94224:176"/>
are Man's own imperfect Works, or Works of the <hi>Law,</hi> which makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfect: And to this belong all the Ceremonies, Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Washings, and Traditions of the Jews. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond are the Works of the Spirit of Grace <hi>in</hi> the Heart wrought in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the inward and spiritual Law; which Works are not wrought in Man's Will, nor by his Power and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but in and by the Power and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ <hi>in</hi> us, and therefore are <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> in their kind, may be called Christ's Works, for that he is the immediate Author and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them: Such <hi>Works</hi> we affirm <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary</hi> to <hi>Justification,</hi> so that a Man cannot be justified without them, and all <hi>Faith</hi> without them is <hi>dead</hi> and useless, as the Apostle <hi>James</hi> saith. Now that such a distinction is to be admitted, and that the words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the matter of Justification are of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:94224:176"/>
the first kind, will appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the occasion of the Apostle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning this, as well here as throughout in his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where he speaks of this matter, and to this purpose at large; which was this, that whereas many of the Gentiles, that were not of the Race nor Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Flesh, were come to be converted to the Christian Faith, and believe in him; some of those that were of the Jewish Proselytes thought to subject the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and believing Gentiles to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Ceremonies and Observations as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to their Justification. This gave the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> occasion at length in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to the <hi>Romans, Galatians,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to shew the use and tendency of the Law, and of its Works, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinguish them from the Faith of Christ and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness thereof; shewing how the former was ceased
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:94224:177"/>
and became inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, the other remaining, and yet necessary; and that the Works exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Apostle are of this kind of Works of the Law, appears by the whole strain of his Epistle to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> ch. 1, 2, 3, 4. for after in the <hi>4th</hi> Chapter he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth them for their returning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the observation of Days and Times; and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fifth Chapter he sheweth them their Folly, and the evil Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of adhering to the Ceremonies of Circumcision; then he adds, <hi>v. 6. For in Christ Jesus neither Circumcision nor Uncircumcision availeth, but Faith which worketh by Love;</hi> and thus he concludes again, <hi>ch. 6. 15. For in Christ Jesus neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision availeth, nor Uncircumcision, but a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> From which places appeareth that distinction of Works aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, whereof the one is excluded, the other necessary to Justification.—
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:94224:177"/>
Here are then the Works which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, by which <hi>no Man is justified;</hi> but <hi>Faith</hi> which <hi>worketh by Love,</hi> but <hi>the New Creature,</hi> this is that which <hi>availeth,</hi> which is <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> for <hi>Faith</hi> that <hi>worketh by Love</hi> cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Works;</hi> for, as is said in the same fifth Chapter, <hi>v. 22. Love is a work of the Spirit.</hi> Again, the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no ways to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude good Works <hi>(as to our Justification)</hi> and that very plainly, <hi>chap.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. Doth it not hereby appear, 1. How he esteemed Works—How much he ascribeth to them, by which he affirms Life everlasting is reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—I shall instance another Saying,—which our Adversaries also in the blindness of their Minds make use of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us—<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. It is generally granted by all, that <hi>[saved]</hi> is here all one as if it had been said <hi>[justified]</hi>—The first the Works of Righteousness which we have wrought, that is, which we in our first faln Nature, by our own Strength have wrought, our own le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Performances, and therefore may be truly and properly called
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:94224:178"/>
ours.—And that it must needs and ought to be understood, doth appear from the other part, <hi>but by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</hi> seeing Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is a Work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of many good Works, even of all those which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the fruits of the Spirit.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Object. <hi>These may also be called ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wrought in us, and also by us many times, as Instruments.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> It is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than the former: in the first we are yet alive in our natural state, unrenewed, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our selves, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to save our selves by imitating and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the outward Letter of the Law, and so wrestling and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the carnal Mind that is Enmity to God, and in the cursed Will not yet subdued: But in this second we are <hi>crucified with Christ,</hi> we are <hi>dead with him,</hi> have <hi>partaken of the Fellowship of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> are made <hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his Death;</hi> and our first Man, our <hi>old Man with all his Deeds,</hi> as well the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly wicked, as the seemingly righteous,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:94224:178"/>
our legal Endeavours and foolish Wrestlings are all buried and nailed to the Cross of Christ, and so it is no more <hi>we,</hi> but <hi>Christ alive in</hi> us, the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>in</hi> us: so that tho it be <hi>we</hi> in a sense, yet it is according to that of the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. These Works are especially to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Spirit of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Grace of God <hi>in</hi> us, as being immediately thereby acted and led in them, and enabled in them: And this manner of Speech is not strained, but familiar to the Apostles, <hi>Gal. 2. 8. Phil.</hi> 2. 13. So that it appears by this place, that, since the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Regeneration is necessary to Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration comprehends Works, Works are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; and that these Works of the Law that are excluded, are different from these that are necessary and admitted.—</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that <hi>no Works, yea not the Works of Christ in us can have place in Justification, because nothing that is impure can be useful in it, and all the Works wrought in us are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure:</hi> for this they
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94224:179"/>
alledg that saying of the Prophet, <hi>Isa. 64. 6. All our Righteousness are as filthy Rags,</hi> adding this reason, <hi>that, seeing we are impure, so must our Works be, which, tho good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet as performed by us, they receive a tincture of Impurity, even as a clean Water passing through an unclean Pipe is defiled. Answ.</hi> That no impure Works are useful to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is confessed, but that all the Works wrought <hi>in</hi> the Saints are such, is denied. And for Answer to this the former distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will serve; we confess that the first sort of Works above mentioned are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, but not the second; because the first are wrought <hi>in</hi> the unrenewed state, but not the other. And as for that of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> it must relate to the first kind; for, tho he saith <hi>all our Righteousness are as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Rags,</hi> yet that will not comprehend the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ <hi>in</hi> us, but only that which we work <hi>of</hi> and <hi>by</hi> our selves: should we so conclude, then it would follow that we should throw away all Holiness and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, since that which is filthy Rags, and as a menstruous Garment, ought to be thrown away; yea, it would follow, that all the fruits of the Spirit mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. were as filthy Rags; whereas
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:94224:179"/>
on the contrary, some of the Works of the Saints are said to have a <hi>sweet savour in the Nostrils of the Lord,</hi> are said to be an <hi>Ornament of great Price in the sight of God,</hi> are said to <hi>prevail with him,</hi> and to be <hi>acceptable to him,</hi> which filthy Rags and a menstruous Garment cannot be.—As to the other part, that seeing the best of Men are still im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and imperfect, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Works must be so; it is to beg the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and depends upon a Proposition denied.—But, tho we should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Man not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect in all respects, yet will not that hinder, but good and perfect Works in their kind may be brought forth <hi>in</hi> them by the Spirit of Christ; neither doth the Example of Water going through an unclean Pipe hit the matter, because, tho Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be capable to be tinctured with Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet the Spirit of God cannot, whom we assert to be the immediate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of those Works that avail in Justification; and therefore Jesus Christ his Works in his Children are pure and perfect, and he worketh in and through that pure thing of his own forming and creating <hi>in</hi> them. <hi>Mr.</hi> Barclay's <hi>Apology,</hi> p. 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165.</p>

For who but such as either cannot see, or, which is worse, may see and will not, can chuse but understand that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther OUR <hi>good Works</hi> (at least in that sottish and sordid sense, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Papists</hi> hold it) do justify? is one Question, and, whether <hi>good Works</hi> do justify? is another; in which <hi>first</hi> sense of the Papists, when they say OUR <hi>good Works,</hi> whose <hi>good Works</hi> (as they call them) are no better than other Mens own are, whose own merely are all stark naught, I neither do, nor ever did affirm our <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> to come; but in the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>good Works</hi> (meaning on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those of.

And hence is one ground of your so miserable a Mistake, in that ye take (as ye confess your selves) <hi>Justification</hi> in its <hi>meer foreign,</hi> and not in its <hi>near</hi> and <hi>proper signification</hi> (viz.) a <hi>counting,</hi> and not a <hi>making of them just,</hi> who are not so; whereas <hi>justificare</hi> and <hi>justificari</hi> is <hi>justum facere,</hi> and <hi>justum fieri,</hi> to make and to be made <hi>just, properly</hi> and <hi>primarily,</hi> and then consequently, and secondarily, to think and to be thought so; but you fleeing a far off in this and many more Points from <hi>proper Names</hi> into <hi>foreign acceptation,</hi> that you may be as far as may be from such Truths as most torment you, will needs (in this World at least) have the words to justify and be justified, sanctify and be sanctified, to import and sound forth no more than <hi>injustum</hi> &amp; <hi>improbum justum,</hi> and <hi>tantum putare,</hi> &amp; <hi>putari,</hi> &amp; <hi>justificare,</hi> &amp; <hi>sanctificare,</hi> &amp; <hi>ri</hi> in no wise to be <hi>ex injusto, &amp; improbo justum, &amp; sanctum facere &amp; fieri;</hi> as if in this Life God having somewhat else to do, could not well have while to make People just and holy, and therefore (they being also well contented so to be left) did agree to leave them to the liberty of their Lusts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some certain toleration to live in them, and yet to think them just and holy in the mean while notwithstanding; and then hereafter, when Men are more willing to it, and himself a little better and more at leasure to do it, to make them <hi>just</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> by some <hi>Popish Purgatory</hi> in the Life to come. <hi>Mr.</hi> Fisher, <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 170.</p>
                           <p>And indeed all your Grace is one part of it as well as another by such outward <hi>application</hi> and meer <hi>computation</hi> only, and not by any true <hi>real internal application of Christ's Righteousness, Sufferings,</hi> and <hi>Blood to your Souls</hi> and Consciences, to the <hi>purging of them from dead Works to the true serving of the living God:</hi> your <hi>Justification</hi> is by <hi>Imputation</hi> and <hi>outward Applications,</hi> your <hi>Washings, Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Sanctifications, Holiness, Renovations,</hi> and all you have is by such a <hi>meer imputation</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of what is far off you in <hi>Christ's Person</hi> to your selves; so that whatever he is, <hi>in whom is no Sin,</hi> you will <hi>deem and dream</hi> that God <hi>deems</hi> you so to be, upon nothing but a meer <hi>blind Confidence and Conceit</hi> that swim in your Brain that 'tis so, when 'tis no such thing God knows: and so as one, that being at the <hi>North of</hi> Scotland <hi>hungry</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> should in his thoughts only <hi>apply a Garment</hi> or <hi>a mess of Meat</hi> to himself, that's as far off him as the <hi>South of England,</hi> must needs perish for want on't, if it be brought and <hi>applied</hi> no nearer to him than so; so in all your <hi>applications</hi> of Christ, and whatever is in him, who is as far off as <hi>Heaven,</hi> whilst you are but on <hi>Earth,</hi> far enough from thence the Lord knows, must necessarily <hi>faint, famish, perish, pine</hi> and <hi>starve,</hi> till ye come to witness <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Robes</hi> of his <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> within your selves, and <hi>eat his Flesh, and drink his Blood,</hi> and <hi>put him on a little more effectually</hi> than ye do, by all your dead Faith, and your eatings and drinkings of Bread and Wine; for all your <hi>imagined Spirits, Applyings,</hi> and <hi>Imputings,</hi> by which that the <hi>whole World, which doth</hi> already, may, and you together with it, <hi>lie still in Wickedness,</hi> ye are ever <hi>dispelling</hi> and <hi>disputing</hi> all true <hi>inherent Holiness</hi> out of doors: And so being but in a meer airy talk, and vain thought of things, that ye are in them when ye are out of them, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <p>We understand not by <hi>this Justification by Christ,</hi> barely the <hi>good Works even as wrought by the Spirit of Christ,</hi> for they, as Protestants truly affirm, are rather an <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Justification,</hi> than the <hi>Cause</hi> of it: But we understand <hi>the formation of Christ in us, Christ born and brought forth in us,</hi> from which good Works as naturally proceed as Fruit from a fruitful Tree. <hi>(Reader, note it,</hi> i. e. <hi>It is</hi> Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, <hi>the</hi> new Birth, or Change <hi>of our</hi> Nature which is our Righteousness <hi>for</hi> Justification <hi>before God, and not so much its result in</hi> Sanctification <hi>and</hi> good Works.) It is (says he) <hi>this inward Birth in us bringing forth Righteousness and Holiness in us that doth justify us,</hi> which having removed and done away the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:94224:186"/>
contrary Nature and Spirit that did bear Rule, and bring Condemnation, now is in Dominion over all <hi>in</hi> our Hearts.</p>
                           <p>Those then that come to know Christ thus formed <hi>in</hi> them, do enjoy him wholly and undivided, who is <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> RIGHTEOUSNESS, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6. This is to be clothed with Christ, and to have put him on, whom God therefore truly accounted righteous and just.—Tho we place remission of Sins <hi>in the Righteousness and Obedience of Christ performed by him in the Flesh,</hi> as to what pertains to the remote procuring Cause,—and that we hold our selves <hi>formally justified by Christ Jesus formed and brought forth in us,</hi> yet can we not (as some Protestants have unwarily done) <hi>exclude Works from Justification:</hi> for, tho pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly we be not justified <hi>for them,</hi> yet are we justified <hi>in them,</hi> and they are necessary even as <hi>causa sine quâ non,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Cause without which none are justified;</hi> for the denying of this, as it's contrary to the Scriptures Testimony, so it hath brought a great Scandal <hi>(here's the</hi> Baxterian <hi>directly</hi> ut supra) to the Protestant Religion, opened the Mouths of Papists, and made many too secure, while they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be justified without good Works.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, tho it be not so safe to say <hi>they are meritorious,</hi> yet, seeing they are rewarded, many of those called the <hi>Fathers,</hi> have not spared to use the word <hi>[Merit]</hi> which some of us have perhaps also done in a qualified sense, but no ways to infer the Popish Abuses above mentioned.</p>
                           <p>If we had that Notion of <hi>good Works</hi> which most Protestants have, we could freely agree to make them not only not necessary, but reject them as hurtful, <hi>viz. that the best Works, even of the Saints, are defiled and polluted:</hi> for tho we judg so of the best Works performed by Man, endeavouring a Conformity to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Law by his own Strength, and in his own Will, yet we believe that such <hi>Works</hi> as naturally proceed from this spiritual Birth and formation of Christ <hi>in</hi> us, are <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> even as the <hi>Root</hi> from which they come, and therefore God accepts them, justifies us <hi>in them,</hi> and rewards <hi>for</hi> them of his own free Grace.—These following Positions do hence arise.—1. <hi>That the Obedience, Sufferings, and Death of Christ is that by which the Soul obtains remission of Sins, and is the procuring Cause of that Grace, by whose inward workings Christ comes to be formed inwardly, and the Soul to be made conformable unto him, and so just and justified.</hi> And that therefore in respect of this Capacity and Offer of Grace, God is said to be <hi>reconciled,</hi> not as if he were actually reconciled, or did actually justify, or account any just, so long as they remain in their Sins, really impure and unjust. 2. <hi>That it is by this inward Birth of Christ in Man that Man is made just, and therefore so accounted by God:</hi> wherefore to be plain, we are thereby, and not till that be brought forth <hi>in</hi> us, <hi>formally</hi> (if we must use that word) justified in the sight of God; because <hi>Justification</hi> is both more properly and frequently in Scripture taken in its proper signification for making one just, and not reputing one meerly such, and is all one with <hi>Sanctification. 3. That</hi> since <hi>good Works</hi> as naturally follow from this Birth as Heat from Fire, therefore are they of <hi>absolute necessity to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> as <hi>causa sine quâ non,</hi> i. e. tho not as the Cause <hi>for which,</hi> yet as that <hi>in which</hi> we are, and without which we cannot be justified. And tho they be not <hi>meritorious</hi> and draw no Debt upon God, yet he cannot but accept and reward them; for it is contrary to his Nature to deny his own; since they may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in their kind, as proceeding from a pure holy Birth and Root: wherefore their Judgment is false, and against the Truth, that say, that <hi>the holiest Works of</hi>
                              <pb n="344" facs="tcp:94224:187"/>
                              <hi>the Saints are defiled and sinful in the sight of God;</hi> for these good Works are not the Works of the Law excluded by the Apostle from Justification. <hi>Barclay,</hi> ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 143, 144, 145.</p>
                           <p>This would make void the whole practical Doctrine of the Gospel, and make Faith it self needless; for, if Faith and Repentance, and the other Conditions called for throughout the Gospel, be a Qualification upon our part necessary to be performed, then, before this be performed by us, we are either fully reconciled to God, or but in a Capacity of being reconciled to God; he being ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile and justify us, as these Conditions are performed, which latter, if granted, is according to the Truth we profess: <hi>(Here's a Direction for Mr.</hi> Dan. Williams <hi>where to find out</hi> Subscribers <hi>against his next Piece come forth)</hi> and if we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfectly reconciled and justified before these Conditions are performed, (which Conditions are of that nature that they cannot be performed at one time, but are to be done all ones life-time) then can they not be said to be absolutely needful, which is contrary to the express Testimony of Scripture, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all Christians; <hi>for without Faith it is impossible to please God. They that believe not are condemned already, because they believe not in the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God. Except ye repent ye cannot be saved; for if ye live after the Flesh ye shall die.</hi> And of those that were converted, <hi>I will remove your Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick from you, unless ye repent.</hi> Should I mention all the Scriptures that positively and evidently prove this, I might transcribe much of all the doctrinal part of the Bible. <hi>(So says Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>and Mr.</hi> Dan. Williams <hi>in reference to the same point in hand)</hi> for since Christ said, <hi>It is finished,</hi> and did finish <hi>his Work</hi> 1600 Years ago, and upwards, if he so fully perfected Redemption then, and did then actually reconcile every one that is to be saved, not simply opening a door of Mercy for them, offering the Sacrifice of his Body, by which they may obtain remission of their Sins, when they repent, and communicating unto them a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his Grace, by which they may see their Sins, and be able to repent; but really make them to be reputed as just, either before they believe (as say the <hi>Antinomians)</hi> or after they have assented to the Truth of the History of Christ, or are sprinkled with the Baptism of Water, while nevertheless they are actually unjust, so that no part of their Redemption is to be wrought by him now, as to their Reconciliation and Justification, then the whole doctrinal part of the Bible is useless and of no profit: in vain were the Apostles sent forth to preach Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remission of Sins, and in vain do all the Preachers bestow their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, spend their Lungs, and give forth Writings; yea, much more in vain do the People spend their Money which they give them for preaching, seeing it is all but <hi>Actum agere,</hi> but a vain and uneffectual Essay to do that which is already done without them.</p>
                           <p>To pretermit their human Labours, as not worthy the disputing whether they be needful or not, since (as we shall hereafter shew) themselves confess the <hi>best</hi> of them is <hi>sinful;</hi> this also makes void the present Intercession of Christ for Men. What shall become of that great Article of Faith, by which <hi>we affirm that he sits at the right-hand of God, daily making Intercession for us, and for which end the Spirit it self maketh Intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered?</hi> for Christ maketh not Intercession for those that are not in a possibility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is absurd. Our Adversaries will not admit that he prayed for the World at all: And to pray for those that are already reconciled, and perfectly
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:94224:187"/>
justified, is to no purpose: to pray for remission of Sins is yet more needless, if all be remitted, past, present and to come. <hi>(But Friend! hug not a Snake in your Bosom, it is because they were</hi> reconciled, perfectly justified, <hi>and all their Sins, both</hi> past, present, <hi>and</hi> to come, remitted, <hi>that therefore Christ</hi> intercedes <hi>for the</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery <hi>thereof, who came not to do his own, but the</hi> Will <hi>of him that sent him; which Reconciliation, Justification and Remission was from all Eternity irreversibly fixed in the</hi> Purpose <hi>of his</hi> Will <hi>towards</hi> them, <hi>and</hi> present <hi>with</hi> him <hi>for</hi> them; <hi>for it is not the Prayers of the Saints, nor the utmost of the Intercession of Christ, can alter the Mind of God towards a People, whether elect or reprobate, or change their station; therefore Christ is called a</hi> Door, <hi>by which these eternal Privileges are</hi> held and brought forth, <hi>and herein he is not only called</hi> essentially <hi>the Image of the Father, but</hi> manifestatively <hi>the express Character of his Person, whence also he is called the</hi> Word.) Indeed there is not any solid solving of this, but by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging according to the Truth, that Christ by his Death removed the Wrath of God, so far as to obtain remission of Sins for as many as receive that <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> that he communicates unto them, and hath purchased for them by his <hi>Blood;</hi> which, as they believe in, they come to know remission of Sins past, and Power to save them from Sin, and to wipe it away so often as they may fall into it by Unwatchfulness or Weakness, if, applying themselves to this Grace, they truly repent: for <hi>to as many as received him, he gives Power to become the Sons of God.</hi> So none are Sons, none are justified, none reconciled until they thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him <hi>in</hi> that little <hi>Seed in</hi> their Hearts: <hi>And Life eternal is offered to those who by patient continuance in well-doing seek Glory, Honour and Immortality: For if the righteous Man depart from his Righteousness, his Righteousness shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred no more;</hi> and therefore on the other part, none are longer Sons of God, and justified, than they patiently continue in Righteousness and well-doing: And therefore Christ lives always making Intercession, during the day of every Man's Visitation, that they may be converted; and, when Men are in some measure converted, he makes Intercession that they may continue and, go on and not faint, nor go back again. <hi>Mr.</hi> Barclay, <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 146, 147.</p>
                           <p>1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> First, this <hi>[justified]</hi> here understood must needs be <hi>a being really made just,</hi> and not <hi>a being merely imputed such;</hi> else <hi>[sanctified]</hi> and <hi>[washed]</hi> might be reputed a being esteemed so, and not a being really so, and then it overturns the whole intent of the Context: for the Apostle shewing them in the preceding Verses, how the unrighteous <hi>cannot inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> and descending to the several <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Wickedness,</hi> subsumes, that they <hi>were sometimes such, but now are not any more such:</hi> Wherefore as they are now washed and sanctified, so are they justified; for if this Justification were not real, then it might be alledged that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had not forsaken these Evils, but were, tho still they continued in them, notwithstanding justified: which, as in it self it is most absurd, so it lucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently overturneth the very Import and Intent of the place; as if the <hi>Corinthians</hi> turning Christians had not wrought any real Change <hi>in</hi> them, but had only been a belief of some barren Notions which had wrought no alteration in their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Will, or manner of Life. For my own part, I neither see any thing, nor could ever yet hear or read any thing, that with any colour of Reason did evince <hi>[justified]</hi> in this place to be understood any other ways than in its proper and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:94224:188"/>
genuine Interpretation of being <hi>made just.</hi> And for the more clear understanding hereof let it be considered, that this word <hi>[justify]</hi> is derived either from the Substantive <hi>Justice,</hi> or the Adjective <hi>just;</hi> both which words import the Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that true and real <hi>Virtue in the Soul,</hi> as it is in it self, to wit, it signifies really, and not suppositively, that excellent Quality expressed and understood among Men by the word <hi>[Justice]</hi> and the Adjective <hi>[just]</hi> as applied signifies a Man or Woman who is just, that is, in whom this quality of <hi>Justice</hi> is stated; for it would not be only great Impropriety, but also manifest Falsity to call a Man <hi>just,</hi> merely by supposition, especially if he were really unjust. Now this word <hi>[justify]</hi> formed, or from <hi>Justice,</hi> or <hi>just,</hi> doth beyond all question signify a <hi>making just,</hi> it being nothing else but a Composition of the word <hi>facio</hi> and the Adjective <hi>justus,</hi> which is nothing else than <hi>justifico,</hi> i. e. <hi>justum facio,</hi> to make just, and <hi>[justified]</hi> of <hi>justus</hi> and <hi>fio,</hi> as <hi>justus fio,</hi> and <hi>justificatus,</hi> i. e. <hi>justus factus,</hi> I am made just. Thus also is it with Verbs of this kind, as <hi>sanctifico,</hi> from <hi>sanctus</hi> holy, and <hi>facio, honorifico</hi> from <hi>honos</hi> and <hi>facio, sacrifico</hi> from <hi>sacer</hi> and <hi>facio;</hi> all which are still understood of the Subject really and truly endued with that Virtue and Quality from which the Verb is derived: Therefore as none are said to be sanctified that are really unholy, while they are such, so neither can any be truly said to be justified, while they actually remain unjust. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 150, 151.</p>

                              <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. here the Apostle clearly ascribes the immediate Cause of Justification to this inward Work of Regeneration, which is Jesus Christ revealed <hi>in</hi> the Soul, as being that which formally statés us in a Capacity of being reconciled with God <hi>(this is the</hi> Baxterian Placabilis, <hi>or that God is reconcileable)</hi> the washing or Regeneration being that inward Power and Virtue, whereby the Soul is cleansed and clothed with the Righteousness of Christ, so as to be made fit to appear before God.—This Doctrine is manifest from 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Examine your own selves, whether ye be in the Faith; prove your own selves: know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</hi> First, It appears here how earnest the Apostle was that they should know <hi>Christ in them;</hi> so that he presses this Exhortation upon them, and inculcates it three times. 2. He makes the Cause of Reprobation or not-Justification the want of Christ thus revealed and known in the Soul: whereby it necessarily follows by the Rule of <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> where the Parity is alike (as in this case it is evident) that where Christ is inwardly known, there the Persons subjected to him are approved and justified: For there can be nothing more plain than this, that if we must know Christ <hi>in</hi> us, except we be Reprobates or unjustified Persons, that, if we know him in us, we are not Reprobates, and consequently justified ones. Like unto this is that of the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 4. 19. My little Children, of whom I travel in Birth again until Christ be formed in you;</hi> and therefore the Apostle terms this <hi>Christ within the hope of Glory,</hi> Col. 1. 27, 28. Now that which is the hope of Glory can be no other, than that which we immediately and most nearly rely upon for our Justification, and that whereby we are really and truly made just. And as we do not hereby deny, but the original and fundamental Cause of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the Love of God manifested in the appearance of Jesus Christ in the Flesh, who by his Life, Death, Sufferings and Obedience made a way for our Reconciliation, and became a Sacrifice for the remission of Sins that are past, and purchased unto us this <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> from which this Birth arises, and in

which Jesus Christ is inwardly received, formed and brought forth <hi>in</hi> us, in his own pure and holy Image of Righteousness, by which our Souls live unto God, and are clothed with him, and have put him on, even as the Scripture speaks, <hi>Eph. 4. 23, 24. Gal. 3. 27. Rom. 3. 24. 1 Cor. 6. 11. Tit.</hi> 3. 7. So again, recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally we are hereby made partakers of the fulness of his <hi>Merits,</hi> and his cleansing <hi>Blood</hi> is near to wash away every Sin and Infirmity, and to heal all our <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings,</hi> as often as we turn towards him by unfeigned Repentance, and become renewed by his Spirit. <hi>Mr.</hi> Barclay, <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 156, 157.</p>
                           <p>This Doctrine <hi>Luther</hi> and the Protestants then had good reason to deny and oppose, tho many of them ran into another Extream, so as to deny <hi>good Works to be necessary to Justification,</hi> and to preach up <hi>not only remission of Sins,</hi> but Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith alone, without all. Works however good, so that Men do not obtain their Justification according as they are inwardly sanctified and renewed, but are justified merely by believing that Christ died for them; and so some may perfectly be justified tho they be lying in gross Wickedness, as appears by the Example of <hi>David,</hi> whom they say was fully and perfectly justified while he was lying in the gross Sins of Murder and Adultery.</p>
                           <p>Also <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> in the Book cited <hi>p.</hi> 155. saith, <hi>that we are justified by Works in the same kind of Causality, as by Faith, to wit, as being both Causes</hi> sine quâ non, <hi>or Conditions of the new Covenant on our part requisite to Justification.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 195. he saith, It is needless to teach any Scholar who hath read the Writings of Papists, how this Doctrine differs from them. <hi>Mr.</hi> Barclay, <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 139, 166.</p>
                           <p>This hath made them strain and wrest the Scriptures for an <hi>imputative Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> wholly without them, to cover their Impurities; and this hath made them imagine an acceptance with God possible, tho they suppose it impossible ever to obey Christ's Commands. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 177.</p>
                           <p>It may easily be answered by a Retortion to those that press this, from the words of the Lord's-prayer, <hi>forgive us our Debts;</hi> that this militates no less against perfect Justification, than against perfect Sanctification: for, if all the Saints, the least as well as the greatest, be perfectly justified in that very hour wherein they are converted, as our Adversaries will have it, then they have remission of Sins long before they die; may it not then be said unto them, What need have ye to pray for remission of Sin, who are already justified, whose Sins are long ago forgiven, both past and to come? <hi>Mr.</hi> Barclay, <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 183. <hi>To this Society let me bring in my Country-man.</hi>—How strange is it, that from Christ's being a Surety of the New Covenant or Testament, Men should conclude that Christ is a Money-surety of the Covenant of Works, and as such paid all our Covenant-Debts as Debts, and that altogether in kind, and so as we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to pay that Debt, and merit Life by that very Covenant, yea, and damn all that will not say as they say, tho to say so, makes either Christ's Obedience or his Sufferings needless, <hi>all Forgiveness impossible,</hi> all Gospel-terms of application of Christ's Merits unjust, <hi>&amp;c. Mr.</hi> Dan. Williams'<hi>s Man made righteous by Christ's Obedience,</hi> p. 106. I shall conclude with Mr. <hi>Samuel Fisher.</hi>—What a mess of <hi>graceless Grace</hi> is here of <hi>T. D</hi>'s making; here's <hi>Grace</hi> with a witness, almost all manner of <hi>Grace</hi> mentioned as material, and of moment in the matter of <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> but one, which is of so much <hi>use,</hi> that all the rest are in a manner <hi>useless</hi> till it come in, and which makes all the rest <hi>Grace,</hi> so that (to say no more than
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:94224:189"/>
truth) they are no Grace to us before it, or without it, and that <hi>(viz.) Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> while others are <hi>included,</hi> is only and alone <hi>excluded. (This remember, Reader, all along refers unto our material Justification before God)—Poor Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication!</hi> it's set aside, it's thrust out still from entring the Lines of Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among its Fellows. <hi>T. D.</hi> stands against the door, so that if he may rule the roast, Men shall be in favour with God, and (contrary to what <hi>Divines</hi> commonly say, when they say, as they do all, <hi>that</hi> Sanctification <hi>manifests</hi> Justification, and the favour of God) have it manifested too in the Donation of his Son to them, the <hi>imputation of his Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>acceptance of them as righteous in him,</hi> and so consequently a Title to the Inheritance, the <hi>Kingdom, Glory,</hi> and all the Good that Heaven affords to all Eternity; but <hi>Washing, Regeneration, Sanctification, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation by the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Salvation from their Sins,</hi> which Sins deserve the <hi>Wrath,</hi> the <hi>Curse,</hi> and the <hi>Condemnation,</hi> which <hi>Salvation from the Sins</hi> (alias) <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> must be before any well-grounded hope of escaping the <hi>Condemnation, Curse</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> to come can be had: this latter sort of <hi>Grace</hi> is shut out for a Wrangler by the wrangling Contenders against the Truth, who had rather obey Unrighteousness than it, and their Lusts than him they call their Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and must be none of the <hi>Ingredients</hi> among the company of <hi>Causes</hi> of Mens acceptance with God, and being accounted <hi>righteous</hi> by him; but if they be not <hi>righteous and holy,</hi> must be counted to be so without it, and if they be so, must be counted so by that which <hi>resides</hi> in another Person, by which, till it come into themselves, they are not made so, and without it, by the being of which, as in <hi>themselves,</hi> and not as in <hi>another,</hi> they can only <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>The meaning is, not that God in his eternal Decree had ordained Knowledg unto some, and denied it to others, but that the Ministry of the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered to all, some through their Incredulity refused the same, and so their Hearts were justly hardened, as the Apostle saith elsewhere, <hi>That they did put away from them the Word of God, which it was necessary should have been first spoken unto them, and so judged themselves unworthy of everlasting Life,</hi> Acts 13. 46.

                           <p>The Jesuit is driven to borrow an Answer from the old Hereticks the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> for thus they said, <hi>Non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra gratiam disputo (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit Pelagianus) quia libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum arbitrium defendo; si enim hominem creavit Deus, &amp; illi liberum arbitrium do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navit, quicquid homo potest de libero arbitrio, cujus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae debetur, nisi ejus, qui eum condidit cum libero ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrio?</hi> I do not reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Grace <hi>(saith the</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian) while I defend Free-will: for if God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man, and gave him Free-will, whatsoever a Man is able to do by his Free-will, to whose Grace is he indebted, but to his who made him with Free-will? The very same Answer doth the <hi>Jesuit</hi> give us here, that whatsoever a Man doth by virtue of his Free-will, it is by the Gift of God, because Free-will is his Gift: <hi>Et nos istam qua conditi sumus, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam hoc nomine appellatam minimè legerimus, tamen quia gratis data est gratiam fate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, sed ostendimus majorem esse istam, qua Christiani su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> And we also do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the Grace of Creation, whereby we are made, because it is freely given, tho we find it no where called by the name of Grace; but yet there is a greater Grace, and more properly so called, by the which Grace we are made

                           <p>Free-will, they say, is not utterly extinguished, but only abated in Strength, and attenuated: <hi>Bellarm. de grat. lib. 5. cap. 30. Concil. Tridentin. sess. 6. cap.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>They <hi>(the Papists)</hi> say not, that a Man by his Free-will only is able to live well, or to obtain eternal Life; for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proveth at large, that a Man hath no Power of himself, without the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial assistance of Grace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe, <hi>lib. 6. cap.</hi> 2. to prepare himself to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Grace, <hi>cap.</hi> 5. or to love God, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. or to will any thing appertaining to Salvation, without the help of God's Grace, <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>This then is their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That tho the Will of Man be not able of it self only to do any thing in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Actions, yet being aided and assisted by Grace, it may: so that they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute part to Grace, part to Free-will. The first motion and stirring of the Heart, they say, is only of God; and here the Will worketh nothing at all: then it is the part of Free-will to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Grace offered, to give Consent unto it, and to work together with it: <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Concil. sess. 6. cap. 5. can.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Rhemists</hi> also thus define the matter: <hi>Tho our Election, Calling, first coming to God, be not wholly or principally upon our Will or
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:94224:194"/>
Works, yet our willing and working of any good to our Salvation is the secondary Cause;</hi> God's <hi>special Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Grace, Assistance, is the Principal.</hi> Rom. 9. Sect. 4.</p>
                           <p>This then is their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that God's Grace and Man's Free-will do work actively together: as the <hi>Rhemists</hi> note, <hi>The Gentiles, tho they believed specially by God's Grace and Preordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet they believed also by their own Free-will.</hi> Rhem. <hi>Acts 1. 13.

                              <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, That a Man, notwithstanding the first stirring, as also the helping and assisting Grace, absolutely by his Free-will may do well if he will, and not do well if he will not: <hi>Lib. 5. cap. 29. Respons. ad Testim.</hi> 21. Thus the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit</hi> maketh the Will of Man the principal, not the secondary Cause (wherein the <hi>Rhemists</hi> are more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, as we have seen, that make it only the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Cause) for the Will of Man may make Grace frustrate, but Grace cannot make Free-will frustrate by the Jesuit's Doctrine.

                              <hi>Catarinus</hi> maintained in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> that Man without the special help of God, can do no Work which may truly be good, tho mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but sinneth still, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and proceeds exceeding well.—But this Opinion was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sharply impugned by <hi>Soto,</hi> proclaiming it heretical, for inferring that Man had not liberty to do well, nor could obtain his natural end, which was to deny Free-will with the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Man might by that strength of Nature observe every Precept of the Law, in regard of the Substance of the Work, tho not in regard
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:94224:195"/>
of the End, which was enough to avoid Sin. He said there were three sorts of human Actions, one the Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law, which is Sin; another, the Observation thereof, having Charity for the end, which is meritorious and acceptable to God; the third mixt, when the Law is obey'd for the substance of the Precept, which Work is morally good and perfect in its kind, because it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisheth the Law, maketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Work good according to Morality, avoiding by that means all Sin. But he mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated this great Perfection of our Nature, by adding, that it was one thing to take heed of any one particular Sin, and another to beware of all together; and said that a Man might avoid any one, but not all; by the Example of him that had a Vessel with three holes, who could not stop them with two Hands, but could stop which two of them he would, one remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open of necessity. This Doctrine did not satisfy some of the Fathers; for tho it clearly shewed that all Works are not Sins, yet it did not wholly salve Free-will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it will necessarily follow, that it is not free in avoiding all Sin. But <hi>Soto</hi> giving the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of good Works unto these, knew not how to determine whether they were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to Justification. It seemed to him they were in regard of the Goodness of them; and it seemed they were not, considering the Doctrine of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Divines, that the first beginning of Salvation
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:94224:195"/>
proceeds from the Vocation of God. He avoided these straits by a distinction, that they were preparatory afar off, but not nearly, as tho giving a remote preparation to the force of Nature, the first beginning was not taken away from the Grace of God. <hi>History of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>p.</hi> 184, 185.</p>
                           <p>They hold, that when a Man doth his Endeavour, God will not deny him Grace, (there's their congruous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) and think they salve all by saying, this Endeavour must be from Divine Assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but <hi>Pelagius</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that no less than they, and <hi>Augustine,</hi> with other his Opposers, take notice of it; yet because he would have Grace to be given according to Merits (tho by Merits was understood, not that which deserved it, but any thing done by a Sinner, in respect of which Grace is given, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth) they condemn him, as evacuating the Redemption of Christ, and the Grace of God. <hi>Morning Exercise against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> p. 453.</p>

should only be unto the Condemnation in a manner of all, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unto the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of none.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Christ for about four thousand Years, the Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore described was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient unto Salvation; and if such were the Believers out of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Church (as is more than probable from the instance of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> and his Subjects, of <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends, the Sons of <hi>Ishmael, Esau, Ketura,</hi> &amp;c. and of the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> &amp;c.) then the same thing must be judged of some that are as yet out; because ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Phrases of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture favour this Opinion, and none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it. <hi>Acts 10. 34, 35.

For when the Gentiles who have not the Law, by Nature do those things

                           <p>And here the first thing to be enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, <hi>What Law of God the World that heareth not of Christ,</hi> is now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the Rule of Duty and of Judgment.

We can say nothing to the second, without the first.—And we have here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doubt, but, 1. <hi>Whether they are under any Law or none? 2. If any, whether it be the Law of Innocency as made with</hi> Adam, <hi>or the Law of Grace? 3. And if the Law of Grace, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the first or second Edition?</hi> And, 1. It is certain, that <hi>they are under a Law</hi> (and not only under a <hi>Physical
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:94224:194"/>
Government,</hi> as a Ship at Sea, or Brutes are) for else God were not their <hi>Ruler,</hi> and they his <hi>Subjects,</hi> so much as by <hi>Right</hi> and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then they are bound to <hi>no Duty,</hi> nor in hope of any <hi>Reward,</hi> nor in <hi>danger</hi> of any <hi>Punishment</hi> for Disobedience; for <hi>where there is no Law, there's no Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.—</hi>It is certain, that they are <hi>not under the Rule of the Covenant of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency made to</hi> Adam, <hi>or the Law of Innocency, as containing the Precept, premiant and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Parts,</hi> which is the same with the Covenant as <hi>offered.</hi> This I proved before: (Tho I was long ignorant how far that Covenant was repealed, till Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi>'s Papers, which I laboured to confute, did begin to enlighten me.) God now saith not to Man <hi>[I give thee Life on condition thou be perfectly innocent and perfectly obedient:]</hi> Nor doth he say <hi>[I command thee to be perfectly innocent, sinless, and obedient, that thou mayst live:]</hi> for no Man is a Subject capable of such a Command or Promise, being already a Sinner.—If any should think that they are under the <hi>bare preceptive part of the Law of Innocency,</hi> with the <hi>penal part,</hi> without any <hi>Promise,</hi> or <hi>premiant part</hi> or <hi>hope of Life,</hi> this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a mistake.—Because, 1. God hath no such Law, nor never had, which hath no <hi>Promise</hi> or <hi>premiant part,</hi> and is not in a Covenant-form: what he doth by the <hi>Devils</hi> belongeth not to our Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but as to Men, they must be under a Covenant of <hi>Works</hi> or of <hi>Grace.</hi> And it were a hard Conceit to think, that the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:94224:195"/>
far greatest part of Mankind had <hi>never any Means</hi> to use for their Salvation, nor any thing <hi>to do for it,</hi> but were under a <hi>mere Sentence of Despair and Damnation,</hi> as the <hi>Devils</hi> are, without any <hi>offer of help,</hi> or <hi>hope,</hi> and consequently that none of them all are <hi>guilty of refusing any such Mercy,</hi> or neglecting any such <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Duty.</hi> 2. The very nature of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> tells us, That if God commanded any Duty, it is that the Subject may be the <hi>better for it;</hi> and he never saith to any <hi>[obey me perfectly, and thou shalt be never the better for it.]</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Besides, the very <hi>Precept</hi> is not in force in that sense as it stood in the Law of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for so it bound only <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Man to keep his Innocency:</hi> But God saith not, <hi>Keep that which thou hast lost.</hi> Obj. <hi>God is not bound to change his Law if Man sin. Answ.</hi> I answered this before, that God is not the Changer: But the Law will not <hi>continue</hi> to be a <hi>Law,</hi> but by continuing to signify God's <hi>governing Will:</hi> And it cannot so signify his governing Will, when there is <hi>no Subject</hi> to be a <hi>capable terminus;</hi> so that it ceased, <hi>cessante capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate subditi, vel cessante ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino.</hi> To say that the Law still signifieth what <hi>God would have had Man do</hi> while he <hi>was capable,</hi> is true, but that saith no more but that <hi>[it was once a Law, and now is none:]</hi> for so it may do by <hi>the dead,</hi> yea, were they <hi>annihilated;</hi> even tell others what God would have had them do, but this is not a <hi>ruling Act,</hi> but <hi>lex transit in sententiam.</hi> And to say, <hi>that at least the Law bindeth a Sinner to perfect Obe-dience</hi>
                              <pb n="361" facs="tcp:94224:195"/>
                              <hi>for the time to come,</hi> is to say, that it <hi>binds not as the Law of Innocency,</hi> but of some other Law, of which we are enquiring.</p>
                           <p>And it is a clear Truth (before proved) [or ever was, or will be] That God brought <hi>all Mankind in</hi> Adam <hi>under a Law and Covenant</hi> of Grace, founded in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Victory of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Seed:</hi> And his <hi>dealing</hi> with <hi>all Men</hi> ever since doth fully confirm it. And this Law made to Mankind in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> was never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the World, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by a perfecter Edition to those that have the Gospel.</p>
                           <p>Having proved that it is a Law of Grace that all the World is to be <hi>ruled</hi> and <hi>judged</hi> by, it remaineth to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether any of them <hi>that have not the Gospel, do keep the Conditions of this Law,</hi> and so <hi>are justified by it, and saved?</hi> To which I answer, 1. That being a matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> it is not of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance for us to be certain of it, as some imagine: And who can be certain of the Affirmative, unless the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirm it; when if we knew all the World, one Man cannot be certain of another's sincerity? And much less can any be certain of the <hi>Negative,</hi> without Scripture-negation, seeing no Man can know every Man in the World, and every Heart. 2. But it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>probable,</hi> at least, that God would never govern many hundred parts of the World (compared to the <hi>Jews)</hi> before Christ's Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by a Law of Grace, which yet no Person should ever have effectual Grace to
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:94224:196"/>
keep as far as was necessary to his Salvation. <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter's <hi>End of Doctr. Controv.</hi> chap. 16. §. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 28, 29.</p>
                           <p>Obj. <hi>Do you not thus confound the World and the Church? Answ.</hi> No: I ask you, did he confound them before Christ's Incarnation, who thought that more than the Jews were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Certainly no; no more do I now.</p>
                           <p>The word <hi>[Church]</hi> is sometime taken so properly and strictly, as to signify only those that are under the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Peculiarity:</hi> And so the Jews before Christ's Birth, and so Christians since, make up the <hi>Church</hi> (and some few perhaps before the <hi>Jews Covenant):</hi> But some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken more largely for the Kingdom of God, for all that are in a <hi>state of Salvation</hi> under the several Editions of the Law of Grace: And so <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends, and <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> and many others before, and all now that love God and Holiness, Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are of the Church. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly by the <hi>[World]</hi> is meant, 1. All Men as under <hi>the Redeemer's Law of Grace, antecedently to their consent;</hi> and so all the World belongs to <hi>God's Kingdom,</hi> as <hi>subditi obligati. 2. Rebels</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse Consent, and so are of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> by Obligation, but condemnable for Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And these are the <hi>[World]</hi> in the worst sense. 3. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Subjects</hi> under the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of Grace,</hi> who yet were <hi>not Jews,</hi> nor are not in the Covenant of <hi>Peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and are in a <hi>state of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> tho not in the <hi>Church of the Peculiar</hi> (as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

of <hi>Melchisedeck, Shem,</hi> &amp;c.) and so are both in the <hi>Church</hi> and in the <hi>World</hi> in several senses. <hi>Ibid.</hi> §. 35, 36, 37.</p>
                           <p>The reason why we use the word <hi>Condition</hi> is, because it best sutes with Man's relation to God <hi>(or rather, according to our</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor'<hi>s Divinity, creates and gives it a being)</hi> in his present deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with us, as his Subjects in trial for Eternity—and own that all is <hi>of Gift,</hi> tho given in an order sutable to our Condition, as Subjects in a state of Trial—whether the Law be a Rule of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This the Doctor affirms, as I also do, tho he denies any Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or Promise to back God's Law as to the Elect; nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Elect ought to be holy, and will be holy: This the Doctor owns, but he placeth it wholly on the Decree and Christ's Care, <hi>(mark that word!)</hi> denying that God hath required it as indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensibly necessary to our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any Blessing promised to the Elect, and judgeth Christ hath done all for us, and enjoineth nothing on us to do <hi>(not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his own special Operation, wherein the Care of Christ is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently manifested)</hi> in order to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good thing. <hi>Mr.</hi> Dan.

This the Doctor affirms, and I deny, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming this Disposition is altered in our effectual Vocation, and there can be no true coming to Christ for Pardon, and especially for Sanctification without that purpose.—Thou feest what a great change is made on the Heart by effectual calling, and that our Answer to this Call (which lies in a Consent answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this Change in the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) is the means of our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in the offered Grace, which is Christ and his Benefits <hi>(which is quite contrary to</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17.

                           <p>To have some <hi>moral Power</hi> to <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>desire,</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> some moral Good, it seemeth is insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from Man <hi>in via.</hi>—</p>
                           <p>Tho some would have more Power ascribed to <hi>Nature,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers appropriate more to <hi>Grace,</hi> yet in this it is no Controversy how much is to be attributed to God; for both <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and the Powers of both are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally from God. <hi>Mr.</hi> Eaxt. <hi>End of Doctr.

and manages our Natures in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of all Moral Actions; therefore they are the same identically with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, which appears clearly from</hi> what was above recited out of this Author in the same Piece, <hi>p.</hi> 17, 18. That the Quarrel between <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> &amp;c. was mostly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout either <hi>unsearchable things,</hi> which <hi>neither side understood,</hi> or about <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous words, &amp;c.)</hi> and hence he tells us—The word <hi>[moral Power]</hi> signifieth, 1. Sometimes a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>moral Actions,</hi> (and so <hi>natural Power</hi> in Man is also <hi>moral</hi> in some degree.) 2. Sometimes a <hi>holy Disposition,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the <hi>Will,</hi> to such holy <hi>moral Actions,</hi> which is the rectitude of our natural Powers, or the <hi>Health</hi> of them in a saving degree or sort, and is the Gift of Grace since Sin departed. 3. Most frequently I use the word for such a degree of God's helping or healing Influx or Grace, as is short of a habit for prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and facility, but yet puts, the Soul in such a disposition, by which Man can do the Act (and it may come to pass without more Grace whether it do or not) which the Dominicans call <hi>sufficient Grace,</hi> and I rather call <hi>necessary Grace.</hi> 4. Sometimes it is meant (as <hi>causa mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis)</hi> for that which is <hi>Power repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively.</hi>—Otherwise all the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> and the World would be resolved into the necessitating Will and work of God, and so all Faith would be subverted.</p>
                           <p>Therefore Man's Will was such a Faculty as could be a <hi>causa prima</hi> of the <hi>moral Modification,</hi> or Specifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its own Acts; not a <hi>causa prima simpliciter,</hi> but thus, <hi>secundum quid:</hi> for else God must be the <hi>causa prima</hi> of Sin, which is the ill Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of that Act.</p>
                           <p>I know that to Nature the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings of our late Infidels to prove, that every. Act of the Will is as truly necessitated as the Motions of a Clock, do seem plausible and hard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

That it is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous,</hi> that below the happy race of confirmed Spirits, there should be a race of such undetermined <hi>free Agents</hi> left much to their own self-determining Power. 3.

                           <p>He asserts, that the sincerity of saving Grace as saving lieth mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially, not in the bare nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but in the degree; not in the degree considered absolutely in it self, but comparatively as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent against its contrary, that is, when Love adhereth more to God than any other thing, and such like, which he endeavoureth to show both in the infused Habits and in the Acts of saving Grace: <hi>Saints everlasting Rest,</hi>

And we conceive that the Instances, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Similitudes and Scriptures that are adduced by that Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to illustrate and confirm his Opinion, will do no more but this, to wit, shew that when a gracious Person is acting rationally, God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest will be prevalent with him in degree, and that ever it should be so; and that it is most useful for a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's clearness that it be so in a high degree: All which are without question; but they will no ways ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Qualifications mentioned, but rather do presuppose them; as for Example, <hi>p.</hi> 231, 232. he saith, <hi>That sincere Sorrow must be at such a degree that it prevail over our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Sin and love to it, else it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be saving:</hi> altho this be true, yet can any say that this is enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the principal Motive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from which it proceedeth, and by which it's qualified, be considered, as was formerly hinted?

saith, <hi>True Love to the Brethren consisteth in this degree, that it love them above our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Wealth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And</hi> (saith he) <hi>what did the Love of some in Q.</hi> Mary'<hi>s days want but a more intense degree to make it prevail over Love to their Houses, to their Honour, Safety,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that it might be sincere?</hi> Beside this intense degree, there might be wanting a right Principle for bringing forth of Love, and a right account upon which to love them, without which the hazarding of Lives and Estates both for them, had never been accounted sincere Love before God; and with which the giving unto them a Cup of cold Water as in the name of a <hi>Disciple,</hi> is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.

True indeed, all are not sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and made perfect by him, altho this was the end of his coming (that he might finish Transgression, and make an end of Sin) and this was the Will of the Father in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, to wit, our thorow Sanctification) but this is not because all have not a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and manifestation of his Light (or spiritual appearance of him) in themselves, but because all do not believe in and obey this his Appearance. Now that People may attain to what knowledg may be had of God by the inward mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of the Light of his Son (which is a measure of his Spirit) in their Hearts, this is clearly proved by the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 1. 19.

                           <p>Let us then observe, that this Seed of the Kingdom, this saving, supernatural and sufficient Word was really sown in the stony, thorny Ground, and by the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, where it did not profit, but became useless as to these Grounds: It was, I say, the same Seed that was sown in the good Ground. It is then the fear of Persecution, and deceitfulness of Riches (as Christ himself interpreteth the Parable) which hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Seed to grow in the Hearts of many: Not but that in its own nature it is sufficient, being the same with that which groweth up and prospereth <hi>in</hi> the Hearts of those who receive it. So that, tho all are not saved by it, yet there is a Seed of Salvation planted and sown <hi>in</hi> the Hearts of <hi>all,</hi> by God, which would grow up and redeem the Soul, if it were not choaked and hindered. <hi>Mr.</hi> Barclay'<hi>s Apology,</hi> p. 115.—</p>

As the Grace and Light <hi>in all,</hi> is sufficient to save <hi>all,</hi> and, of its own nature, would save <hi>all;</hi> so it strives and wrestles with <hi>all</hi> for to save them: he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists its striving is the cause of his own Condemnation; he that resists it not, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his Salvation; so that in him that is saved, the working is <hi>of the Grace,</hi> and not <hi>of the Man,</hi> and it's a Passiveness rather than an Act; tho afterwards <hi>(i. e. when we are restored unto</hi> Adam'<hi>s state before the Fall)</hi> as Man is wrought upon, there is a Will raised in him, by which he comes to be a Co-worker with the Grace: for, according to that of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, he that made us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, will not save us without us.</hi> So that the first step is not by Man's working, but by his not contrary work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (i. e. <hi>he is so civil, as not to suffer any of his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to disturb the Work, which I take to be no small part of the Work.)</hi> And we believe, that at these singular seasons of every Man's Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above-mentioned, as Man is wholly unable of himself to work with the Grace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he move one step out of the natural Condition, until the Grace lay hold upon him; so it is possible to him to be passive, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist it, as it is also possible for him to resist it: So we say, the Grace of God works in and upon Man's Nature,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:94224:197"/>
which, tho of it self wholly corrupted and defiled, and prone to the evil, yet is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be wrought upon by the Grace of God, even as Iron, tho a hard and cold Metal, of it self may be warm'd and sostned by the heat of the Fire, and Wax melted by the Sun: And as Iron or Wax when removed from the Fire or Sun, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to its former condition of Coldness and Hardness; so Man's Heart, as it resists or retires from the Grace of God, returns to its former condition again. <hi>Mr.</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay, <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 101, 102.—</p>

those that have the literal Knowledg, are not saved by it without this real experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Knowledg; yet those that have the real Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg may be saved without the external.——How many are injured by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, that know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ever there being such a Man in the World, or of his eating the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit?

which comes only on the Children of Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; it being the Power of God as sufficient to the Excuse and Salvation of those from Sin and Wrath that obey the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of it in themselves, as to subject those to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, Rejection, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Wrath, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.

            <p>And as for the <hi>Heathens,</hi> how they have that which is to be known of God (even enough as to their Salvation) manifest by God himself within them, and not only the Wrath of God against all their Ungodliness, but also the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God revealed from Heaven, even by him that speaks from Heaven in their own Hearts; so that they both know God in some measure (tho not liking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the knowledg of him in them, nor glorifying him as God, answerably to what they know of him, their foolish Hearts are darkened, and they given over to Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) and also know the Judgments of God, that the things they do are worthy of Death, as also, that Life and Peace from God should be to them in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and so are condemned, accused, and without Excuse when they sin, as well as cleared, accepted, justified before God within themselves when they do well, by the Work of the Law of God written in their Hearts; by which, tho they have not the Law in Letter, or a literal Copy of it, as Professors have, whom they will judg and be justified before, for all the Professors boasting, if they do the things contained in the Law, as it's written in their Consciences: and much more to this purpose is so clear to them that in the Light, with any solid Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and not in their own benighted Minds, and prejudiced Spirits against the true Light, which the Letter points to, read the first and second Chapter of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> throughout, that all the Objections to the contradicting of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Mr.</hi> Fisher, <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 628.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, <hi>Why, why will ye die? turn, turn your selves and live,</hi> and <hi>work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling;</hi> for I have done my part, a Friends part towards you, I have wrought in you both to will and to do of my free Grace and good pleasure; it wants but your putting that into Act, which I of my free Grace have put into your Power, and your willing and doing accordingly, and your getting up, and trading with your <hi>Talent,</hi> and turning to the Light that I have entrusted you with, and reprove your evil Deeds by; Will ye always resist my holy Spirit when it moves in your Hearts, and be stiff necked and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born? <hi>Turn ye at my Reproof, and I will make known my words to you;</hi> if not, <hi>as I call, and ye refuse, so the time will be, ye shall cry and I will not hear you,</hi> (Now what is it that cries? if it be the Light within as it is saving Grace, the Lord will not refuse to hear it; if it be the Darkness that is within that cries, it is senseless cry, both as to the Justice of God, and the Condition of the Soul; therefore it is no more than the yellings of an awakened, unrenewed natural Conscience, the Quakers universal salutiferous Grace and Christ) <hi>because ye did not chuse the fear of the Lord, would none of my Counsel, set at naught all my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,</hi> which otherwise you should have found to have been the way of Life: I am in Christ reconciling the World to my self, not imputing Trespasses; and I have sent out a Ministry to declare this my Reconciliation to the World, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that is past, if they now do not <hi>ponere obicem,</hi> and abide in Enmity; I am Friends unless they will needs fight on, and fight it out with me to the last, and then they will have the worst on't: I have made him Sin that knew none, that they might be Righteousness, who are yet in their Sins; I have given him a Ransom for all, and he hath offered himself and died for all that were dead in their Sins, and tasted Death for every Man: Now then hear my <hi>Embassadors</hi> that pray you without, as in my Son's stead, who also himself by his Spirit strives with you to the same end within, that ye would be reconciled to God; and having these Promises, and received so much Grace as brings Salvation with it to such as despise it not, receive not this precious Grace of God in vain, but cleanse your selves from all Uncleanness of Flesh and Spirit, perfecting Holiness in the fear of God: <hi>I have drawn you with the Cords of my Love, ye will perish if ye refuse to return. Mr.</hi> S. Fisher, <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 632.</p>
            <p>Acts 10. 34. <hi>Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of Persons: But in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh Righteousness, is accepted of him. Peter</hi> was before liable to that Mistake that the rest of the Jews were in, judging that all were unclean except themselves, and that no Man could be saved, except they were proselyted to their Religion, and circumcised. But God shewed <hi>Peter</hi> otherways in a Vision, and taught him to call nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or unclean; and therefore seeing that God regarded the Prayers of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> who was a stranger to the Law and to Jesus Christ, as to the outward, yet <hi>Peter</hi> saw that God had accepted him: And he is said to fear God before he had this outward Knowledg; therefore <hi>Peter</hi> concludes, that every one that
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:94224:200"/>
in every Nation, without respect of Persons, feareth God and worketh Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, is accepted of him: So he makes the fear of God and the working of Righteousness, and not an Historical Knowledg, the Qualification; they then that have this, where-ever they be, they are saved. Now we have already proved, that to every Man that Grace is given, whereby he may live godlily and righteously; and we see that by this Grace <hi>Cornelius</hi> did so, and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and his Prayers came up for a Memorial before God, before he had this outward Knowledg. Also was not <hi>Job a perfect and upright Man, that feared God and eschewed evil?</hi> Who taught <hi>Job</hi> this? How knew <hi>Job Adam</hi>'s Fall? And from what Scripture learned he that excellent Knowledg he had, and that Faith, by which he knew his <hi>Redeemer lived?</hi> for many make him as old as <hi>Moses;</hi> was not this by an inward Grace <hi>in</hi> the Heart? Was it not that inward Grace that taught <hi>Job</hi> to eschew Evil, and to fear God? and was it not by the workings thereof that he became a just and upright Man? How doth he reprove the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Men, <hi>chap.</hi> 24.? And, after he hath numbred up their Wickedness, doth he not condemn them, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. for <hi>rebelling</hi> against this <hi>Light,</hi> for not knowing the way thereof, nor abiding in the Paths thereof? It appears then <hi>Job</hi> believed that Man had a Light, and that because they rebelled against it; therefore they knew not its Ways, and abode not in its Paths, even as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> who had the Scriptures are said to err, not knowing the Scriptures. And also <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, tho in some things wrong, yet who taught them all those excellent Sayings and Knowledg which they had? Did not God give it them in order to save them, or was it merely to condemn them? Who taught <hi>Elihu</hi> that <hi>the Inspiration of the Almighty giveth Understanding, that the Spirit of God made him, and the Breath of the Almighty gave him Life?</hi> And did not the Lord accept a Sacrifice for them? And who dare say that they are damned? But further, the <hi>Apostle</hi> puts this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy out of doubt; for, if we may believe his plain Assertions, he tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. that the <hi>Heathens did the things contain'd in the Law.</hi> From whence I thus argue: In every Nation he that feareth God, and worketh Righteousness, is accepted: But many of the Heathens feared God, and wrought Righteousness; therefore they were accepted. The <hi>minor</hi> is proved from the Example of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi> But I shall further prove it thus; He that doth the things contained in the Law, feareth God and worketh Righteousness: But the Heathens did the things contained in the Law; therefore they feared God, and wrought Righteousness. Can there be any thing more clear? for, if to do the things contained in the Law be not to fear God and work Righteousness, then what can be said to do so, seeing the Apostle calls the Law <hi>spiritual, holy, just</hi> and <hi>good?</hi> But this appears manifestly by another <hi>medium</hi> taken out of the same Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. so that nothing can be more clear: The words are, <hi>The Doers of the Law shall be justified;</hi> from which I thus argue, without adding any word of my own: The Doers of the Law shall be justified; but the Gentiles do the things contained in the Law. All that know but a Conclusion, do easily see what follows from these express words of the Apostle: And indeed he through that whole Chapter labours, as if he were contending now with our Adversaries, to confirm this Doctrine, <hi>ver. 9, 10, 11. Tribulation and Anguish upon every Soul of Man that doth evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: for there is no respect of Persons with God.</hi> Where the Apostle clearly homologates the Sentence of <hi>Peter</hi> before mentioned, and shews that
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:94224:201"/>
Jew and Gentile, or, as he himself explains in the following Verses, both they that have an outward Law, and they that have none, when they do good shall be justified. And, to put us out of doubt, in the very following Verses he tells us, that <hi>the Doers of the Law are justified,</hi> and that the <hi>Gentiles did</hi> the <hi>Law.</hi> So that, except we think he spake not what he intended, we may safely conclude, that such Gentiles were justified, and did partake of that <hi>Honour, Glory</hi> and <hi>Peace, which comes upon every one that doth good;</hi> even the Gentiles that are without the Law, when they work good, seeing with God there is no respect of Persons: so, as we see that it is not the having of the outward Knowledg that doth save, without the inward, so doth neither the want of it, to such to whom God hath made it impossible, who have the inward, bring to Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: And many that have wanted the outward, have had a knowledg of this inwardly, by virtue of that inward Grace and Light given to <hi>every</hi> Man, working <hi>in</hi> them, by which they forsook Iniquity, and became just and holy, as is above proved, who, tho they knew not the History of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, yet were sensible <hi>in</hi> themselves of the Loss that came by it, feeling their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Sin, and the body of Sin in them; and tho they knew not the coming of Christ, yet were sensible of that inward Power and Salvation which came by him, even before as well as since his appearance in the Flesh: For I question whether these Men can prove, that all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and Fathers before <hi>Moses</hi> had a distinct knowledg either of the one or the other, or that they knew the History of the Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil, and of <hi>Adam</hi>'s eating the forbidden Fruit; far less that Christ should be born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> should be crucified, and treated in the manner he was: For it is justly to be believed that what <hi>Moses</hi> wrote of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of the first Times, was not by Tradition, but by Revelation: yea, we see that not only after the writing of <hi>Moses,</hi> but even of <hi>David,</hi> and all the Prophets who prophesied so much of Christ, how little the <hi>Jews</hi> that were expecting and wishing for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> could thereby discern him when he came; that they crucified him as a Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, not as the <hi>Messiah,</hi> by mistaking concerning him: for <hi>Peter</hi> saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 17. to the Jews, that both <hi>they and their Rulers did it through Ignorance.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>That had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> Yea <hi>Mary</hi> her self, to whom the Angel had spoken, who had laid up all the miraculous things accompanying his Birth <hi>in</hi> her Heart, she did not understand how and when <hi>he disputed with the Doctors in the Temple,</hi> that <hi>he was about his Father's Business.</hi> And the Apostles, that had believed him, conversed daily with him, and saw his Miracles, could not understand neither believe those things which related to his Death, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Resurrection, but were in a certain respect stumbled at them. <hi>Mr.</hi> Barclay'<hi>s Apology,</hi> p. 129, 130, 131, 132. <hi>[This in the whole</hi> substance <hi>of it is the</hi> same <hi>with Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>as the</hi> Reader may observe in both <hi>the three foregoing</hi> Columns, <hi>where in each of them, to make way for an</hi> universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>they stick not to assert, that Salvation may be attained without the</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <hi>of</hi> Christ, <hi>yea, even by a bare attendance unto the</hi> Dictates <hi>of</hi> Nature; <hi>and to fortify this</hi> infernal Dogma <hi>of theirs, would</hi> insinuate, <hi>that the</hi> Patriarchs, <hi>and others out of the</hi> Old <hi>Testament were</hi> so <hi>saved.]</hi>

By all which it is plain, that these four do as one Man withstand this Truth the <hi>Quakers</hi> testify concerning the <hi>general Love and Grace of God in Christ Jesus</hi> to all Mankind, <hi>i. e.</hi> every individual Man in their above-cited Sayings, so far as to give them all any such measure of saving Light, as puts them but into a possibility of Life, if they never so well improve it, and the Universality of a Light in Men, sufficient to save them, or (which is all one) the Sufficiency of the Light to save from Sin, which is asserted by the Quakers to be in some measure given by <hi>Christ</hi> universally to all Men.—I shall therefore address to a little farther Examination of what the Scriptures declare for, and our four Divines, against the Truth of God in these Particulars, whose Oppositions of it are much what from the same grounds, and those no other than the same that are made use of by all personal <hi>Electionists,</hi> to push at that precious Doctrine of the general Love of God to the whole World, in vouchsafing some measure of no less than truly saving Grace universally to all and every Individual in it, or of Light sufficient to lead to Life such as follow it, to each particular Person among Mankind, so that not any perish for want of the Love of God and Christ, or Willingness in God and Christ to have them saved, or of true strivings of their holy Spirit with them, to draw them from the way of Death, or of Light sufficient to lead them out of that Darkness that destroys them, or of Power and saving Grace given them from God to work out their own Salvation, or of Christ the Saviour's dying for them, and offering himself a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som for every one, as well as any one; or of Sufficiency in him to save such as come to God by him, or of true Tender of Life, Peace and Reconciliation with God to him, or of true purpose and intent in God and Christ to receive them to Mercy, on condition of their Repentance, or of space given them to repent in and return, or upon the account of any <hi>particular personal Predestination</hi> or <hi>Reprobation</hi> of them to Condemnation, <hi>per saltum, peremptorily, unalterably,</hi> before they were born, without reference had to Impenitency in Ungodliness foreseen, or upon any such like consideration, as our Divines hold forth, but merely through their own slighting of that Love, resisting of the foresaid Strivings, despising of the Riches of that Grace, Long-suffering and Forbearance, refusing to be led to Repentance by that Light, and by it to come to that Saviour from whom it comes, not turning at the Reproofs of it, not improving the said <hi>Gift of the Power of God, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of the Spirit given to profit withal,</hi> not putting themselves forth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the measure of it in them, but receiving it in vain, not trading with the Talent, but trifling away the acceptable time, the day of God's Salvation, the day given to them, wherein the Lord would hear and succour them, not minding therein the things that make for their Peace, till hid from their eyes: these and such like, as fall out only on Man's part, who remains in the Enmity, when God is in Christ reconciling, not imputing Trespasses to the World, but as the World goes on obstinately therein, destroying themselves (whilst in God still is or was their Help; nevertheless, whether they hear or forbear, live or die, be saved or damned) are the sole Causes of Mens Destruction and Perdition, who perish not at all according to the Will of God, desiring it should be so, if <hi>(salva veritatis, voluntatis, immut abilitatis, &amp; justitiae Gloria,</hi> without violation to his <hi>Justice, Truth, and purely good and immutable Will,</hi> which is, that the godly shall prosper, and the ungodly perish) it may be otherwise, tho yet permitting it so to be when there is no Remedy.

            <p>Therefore he <hi>vouchsafes</hi> to <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every Man,</hi> even those that come to perish,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:94224:202"/>
but that they neglect it, at some time or other, <hi>some measure of saving Grace,</hi> and a <hi>Light sufficient</hi> to lead them to Salvation.—If God did not give at one time or other to all Men such Grace, Liberty and Power, as is sufficient to bring them to Life, if they will chuse the Life, and will improve that Light and Power to the working out of their Salvation, when he bids them, by it, then God could not to all Men tender Life by his Ministers, nor say, <hi>Work out your own Salvation, chuse Life that ye may live, else my Soul shall chuse your greater Destruction,</hi> without mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Men in their Misery, before that time wherein he says, he will only and may justly <hi>mock at their Calamity—</hi>Nay, nor yet without <hi>horrible Cruelty, Absurdity</hi> and <hi>Nonsense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore God hath undoubtedly <hi>vouchsafed a measure of his saving Grace and Power, and a Light sufficient</hi> to lead them to Life, if <hi>they use well, improve, obey, follow that Light, Power, and Grace to all and every Man.</hi> Ibid. p. 624. <hi>[I shall add to this my Countryman's Testimony,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dan.

Such Probabilities are Impossibilities of Salvation.

                           <p>The Pontifician Reasons and Allegations for their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Faith, we find sundry of them set down in the History of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> together with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers unto them, forced from the Canvase of the opposite Parties: some holding that the Opinion of Certainty of Grace was an intolerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy: Others, that that Certainty in its kind was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious. The first of these were for the most part Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans grounding their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Uncertainty upon the Authority of <hi>Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure,</hi> and the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Also upon Reason, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That God would not make Man certain of Grace, lest swelling with Pride, and opinion of himself, he should despise others, as knowing himself to be righteous, and others notorious Sinners.

                           <p>THere are two Reasons why the Quakers are brought in here as Opposers of the Doctrine of Assurance.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. In that they positively, yea furiously hold, that no Man is justified in this World before or in the sight of God, but as he is sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from which State of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification (as they hold) he may yet fall away.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In that no one can (in their Judgment) be assured of the Reality of his Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in this Life, until he arrive <hi>here</hi> at a sinless State of Perfection, unto which they hold Man may come if he be true to the Conduct of the Light within. The former being a downright Lie, and the latter utterly impossible, as by Scripture Assertions, and Examples irresistibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; therefore it is manifest that they are utter Enemies to this Doctrine of Assurance in a sound well bottomed Sense, as is clear from what follows.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>It (viz.</hi> the Light within) <hi>takes away all ground of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,</hi> in that it gives every one ground of Hope and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Assurance, that they may be saved; <hi>neither doth feed any in Security,</hi> in that none are certain how soon their day may expire, and therefore it is a constant Incitement and Provocation, and lively In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, to every Man, to forsake Evil, and close with that which is good.—</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>But that this may be resisted and rejected in both, in which
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:94224:203"/>
then God is said to be resisted and pressed down, and Christ to be again crucified and put to open shame in and among Men;</hi> and to those as thus resist and refuse him, he becomes their Condemnation. Mr. <hi>Barelay</hi>'s <hi>Apology,</hi> &amp;c. p. 91. compare p. 90.</p>
                           <p>As, upon the one hand, they err that affirm that the least degree of true and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace cannot be faln from, so do they err, upon the other hand, that deny any such Stability to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, from which there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a total and final Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 187.</p>
                           <p>For all the Arguments which these alledg, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>there can be no falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> may well be received upon the one part, as of these who have attained to this Stability and Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their Objections solved by this Concession; so upon the other hand the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments alledged from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Thus then the contrary Batterings of our Adversaries, who miss the Truth, do concur the more strongly to establish it, while they are destroying each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But lest this may not seem to satisfy such as judg it <hi>always possible for the best of Men before they die to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> I shall add for the proof of it, some brief Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from some few Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 187, 188.</p>
                           <p>For Man not minding the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:94224:203"/>
                              <hi>Light and Law within in his Heart,</hi> which not only disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sin, but leads out of it, and so being a Stranger to the new Life and Birth that is born of God, which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth his Will, and cannot of its own nature transgress the Commandments of God, doth, I say, in his natural State, look at the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they are without him in the Letter; and finding himself reproved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, is by the Letter killed, but not made alive; so Man finding himself wounded, and not applying himself inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that which can heal, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in his own Will after a Conformity to the Law, as it is without him, which he can never obtain, but finds, the more he wrestles, the more he falleth short. So this is the Jew still, in effect, with his carnal Commandment, with the <hi>Law</hi> without, in the first Covenant-State, which <hi>makes not the Camers thereunto perfect, as pertaining to the Conscience,</hi> Heb. 9. 9. tho they may have here a Notion of Christianity, and external Faith in Christ.

                           <p>True Faith is in the Light of Christ, and in the Word of God, which is that Word of Faith which the Apostles preached, and testified of in their Words and Writings, that it was nigh to Men, even in their Hearts, that there they might both hear, and do it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8. Neither doth any Man either hear or believe in Christ to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any further than as he heeds, hears and believes in that Light and ingrafted Word whereby Christ coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels him in his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, altho he should (as the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> did) hear him speaking to them with audible Voice, or believe (as all unbelieving <hi>Christians</hi> do) the whole History of him according to the Flesh: so then Faith unto Life coming by Hearing, and Hearing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Life being of that Light and Word of God, which is nigh in the Heart, which is the Word of both Faith and Life, the Apostles Speeches were in vain, if there were not such a Light and Word within to be believed in, to the hearing and believing in which the Apostles were sent to turn Men.

            <p>I shall transcribe what is to go cross under these three Columns of the Doctrine of Assurance out of Mr. <hi>Burton</hi>'s Christian Bulwark, and the rather because he takes notice not only of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>'s bare Rejection of the same, but its crafty Method and End therein, not far unlike some others this day: wherefore it is that I desire the Reader's Patience to pass by my Prolixity, till he has read it over, and impartially, that he would compare the same with our Baxterian Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matists in their process upon this point.—The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> being in general an Enemy to the Certainty of Faith, which giveth a true Believer an Assurance of his Salvation; and withal considering how evident both Scriptures and Fathers were in this point, so strongly propugned and maintained by <hi>Luther;</hi> and, Thirdly, the Council it self in the Canvase of this Point, while it was in Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or rather in Contention, being divided into contrary Parties and Sides, some holding for Certainty, as <hi>Catarinus,</hi> and others for Uncertainty, as <hi>Vega</hi> and others, as the History of the same Council doth notably discover: Therefore it became the politick Spirit of the Council to use all cautelous Circumspection in the definite concluding of this Point, contriving it under such umbratilous and sub-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure terms, as that they might seem neither grosly to oppose the open Truth, nor yet displease that Party of the Council that seemed to incline to the Truth's side, nor yet leave <hi>Luther</hi> uncondemned for defending the Truth, nor yet betray their own Cause, which was to advance the Uncertainty of Roman Catholick Faith: Uncertainty being the very hint which gave occasion to the Serpent boldly to insult, and so to overthrow Mankind. For when <hi>Eve</hi> said, <hi>Lest ye die;</hi> the Serpent finding her staggering, takes the advantage and strikes her with a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right blow to the ground, <hi>Ye shall not die at all</hi>—Concil. Trid. Sess. 6. cap. 9. <hi>Quamvis necessarium sit credere, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Altho it be necessary to believe, that Sins neither are, nor ever were remitted, but freely by divine Mercy for Christ; yet no Man boasting of Confidence and Certainty of the Remission of his Sins, and therewith wholly resting, ought to say, that his Sins are or have been remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: seeing this vain Confidence, void of all Piety, both may be amongst Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Schismaticks, yea and is now in these our days, and is preached with great Contention against the Catholick Church. But neither is that to be affirmed, that they who are truly justified, ought without any doubting at all to conclude with themselves, that they are justified, and that none is absolved and justified from Sins but he that certainly believeth that he is absolved and justified: and that in this sole Faith, Absolution and Justification consisteth, as if a Man not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving this, should doubt of the Promises of God, and of the efficacy of Christ's Death and Resurrection. For as no godly Man ought to doubt of the Mercy of God, of the Merit of Christ, and of the Power and Efficacy of the Sacraments, so every Man while he looketh upon himself, and his own proper Infirmity and Indisposition, may be afraid and fearful of his own Grace: seeing no Man can know by the Certainty of Faith, wherein there may not lie some Error, that he hath obtained the Grace of God.—Now I desire the Christian judicious Reader to observe the sundry Passages, and as it were the several Threds of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. First, like the painted Whore she sets a fair Face or Preface upon the Matter, as attributing Remission of Sins to God's Mercy for Christ, <hi>(as our Baxterians do this day)</hi> which every one must necessarily believe (she could say no less, tho in the upshot of the matter, she would have Men to believe nothing less) but in the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:94224:207"/>
next place she comes with a by-blow, and condemns the Confidence and Assurance of Faith, under the terms of Boasting. And therefore prefixeth this Title before the Chapter, <hi>Contra inanem Haereticorum fiduciam;</hi> Against the vain Confidence of Hereticks: A notable pack of Cunning, well beseeming the Mystery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They do not go bluntly to work, to beat down-right that Confidence and certain Assurance which is in a true justifying Faith; but slily they wound it, as <hi>Joab</hi> did <hi>Abner,</hi> under the fifth Rib, as being none but him that vainly boasteth and braggeth of the Assurance of his Justification. Indeed, if this Assurance were nothing else but a vain Confidence and Boasting, they say something. But while they join this Certainty and Assurance of Faith with vain Boasting, they plainly discover their masked Hypocrisy, by mixing and confounding the pure Gold of Faith with Man's Dross, as if they were both one, to be faithfully assured and vainly confident. But this Assurance, whatsoever it is, it must be in Hereticks and Schismaticks, Catholicks must have nothing to do with it, as being a vain Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; yet vain as it is they confess it to be a great and vehement Enemy to the Catholick Church, to wit, the Roman Catholick Church. In which Church none must so certainly believe the Remission of his Sins, as to exclude all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, especially in regard of his own Indisposition and Infirmity, being fearful of his own Grace: and no marvel if such be full of fearful Doubtings, that build their Salvation and Justification upon their inherent Grace. But the Conclusion is peremptory, just like the Serpent, in the third of <hi>Genesis,</hi> beginning smoothly, but ending roughly, like the Southern Wind, <hi>Ye shall not die at all.</hi> So <hi>Trent</hi>'s Conclusion is, that no Man can know by the Certainty of Faith, whether he have the Grace of God, or no—.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Si quis dixerit, &amp;c.</hi> If any shall say, that it is necessary for every Man, for the attaining the Remission of Sins, to believe certainly, and without any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own Infirmity and Indisposition, that his Sins are remitted; let him be accursed—.</p>
            <p>Note here, another by-blow at the Certainty of Faith, but seeming to be laid upon the Shoulders of humane Frailty and Indisposition: as if Remission of Sins dependeth upon our own Strength and Disposition. But I marvel why the <hi>Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> so much distrust their own Indisposition, about the Certainty of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they so much dignify their natural Disposition <hi>(the Baxterian Prerequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites)</hi> unto Justification, save only that (for the love of their worldly Pomp, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Profit, one special prop whereof is their Uncertainty, causing the simple seduced People to rest wholly upon their Priest, Pope and Purgatory, as the last Sanctuary of their troubled Souls) they are not disposed to give God the Glory, and to seal to themselves the Comfort of Justification by the Certainty of Faith, which Certainty of Faith they must needs extremely hate, when to disgrace it, they are fain to disparage their own Strength and Disposition, which otherwise they do so much deify and adore. And as if Man's Disposition in the State of Grace, being accompanied and assisted with Grace, came short of that Disposition which goes before Grace, and as if Man's Disposition were not as able to confirm him in Grace, as to prepare him unto Grace. But we will not envy them their Indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to assurance of Grace, no more than we admire that Grace of theirs which can give no solid Comfort and Assurance to the Soul and Conscience—.</p>
            <p>But let us hear what <hi>Trent</hi> further saith, <hi>Can. 14. Si quis dixerit, hominem à peccatis absolvi, &amp;c.</hi> If any shall say, that a Man is absolved and justified from
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:94224:207"/>
Sins, in that respect that he certainly believeth he is absolved and justified; or that none is truly justified, but he that believeth he is justified <hi>[the Baxterian Mask still]</hi> and that Absolution and Justification is perfected by this sole Faith; let him be accursed.—Note here that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> differeth not one Hairs breadth from denying Faith it self to be absolutely necessary to Justification, as we shall more plainly discover her Mind herein hereafter.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Can. 15. Si quis dixerit, hominem renatum &amp; justificatum, &amp;c.</hi> If any shall say, that a Man regenerate and justified is bound by Faith to believe, that he is certainly in the number of the Predestinate, let him be accursed. And to conclude, the <hi>16th Canon</hi> is also annexed as a Blade in this Reed, <hi>Si quis magnum illud, &amp;c.</hi> If any shall say, by an absolute and infallible Certainty, that he shall certainly have that great Gift of Perseverance unto the end, except he shall know this by special Revelation, let him be accursed.—Thus have we set down the whole Mystery of <hi>Pontifician</hi> Uncertainty of Faith in gross, as we find it engrossed in the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> For the further unfolding whereof, let us consult the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Commentaries of the Council.—But first, observe we here what a deal of pains they have bestowed about this one point of Uncertainty, and partly for the Reasons formerly alledged in the beginning of this Chapter: but principally do they impugn this Bulwark of the Certainty of Faith, because it is a main Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to all their humane Inventions, wherewith, as so many Rags, they have patched up their meritorious <hi>Capuchin Garment</hi> of Justification. As the learned. <hi>Chemnitius</hi> hath well observed in his <hi>Examen de fide Justif.</hi> upon this point, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Nec sanè nullae sunt causae, &amp;c.</hi> Nor is it without cause (saith he) that the <hi>Pontificians</hi> do eagerly contend for the maintenance of their Uncertainty: for they well perceive, that the whole Negotiation of <hi>Pontifician Merchandize</hi> is sustained by this means. For the Conscience seeking some certain and firm Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation when it hears that Faith it self, even when it apprehendeth Christ the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, ought to doubt of the Remission of Sins, it begins to devise a mass of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, <hi>(as others of their Works)</hi> as Vows, Pilgrimages, Invocations of Saints, Pardons, Dispensations, Croisadoes, Bulls, Masses, and a thousand such like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all but untempered Mortar, to build their Castle of Uncertainty in the Air. The Conscience in this case being like the unclean Spirit in the Gospel, which seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rest, and finding none in the wavering Uncertainty of <hi>Pontifician</hi> Faith, taketh unto himself seven other Spirits worse than himself, and so the Conscience becomes more unclean, more unsettled than it was before <hi>(thus the Neonomian Garment of Justification</hi> is <hi>parte per pale</hi> the <hi>Rightcousness of Christ, conditional Prerequisites, and good Works if they hold out to the end)</hi>—Now in the further laying open of this Mystery of Uncertainty, if we should follow the infinite Perplexities and Windings which we find in their most authentick Commentaries upon this Point, we should tread an endless Maze, as tracing them in their Uncertainties. <hi>Vega</hi> writes a large Commentary upon the forecited ninth Chapter of this Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> And <hi>Soto</hi> spends four large Chapters upon it. No marvel to see Men wander wide in a Wilderness of Uncertainty. But we will deal with them as the Prophet saith concerning the wild Ass; <hi>Jer. 2. 24. A wild Ass used to the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that snuffeth up the Wind at her pleasure, in her occasion who can turn her away? All they that seek her, will not weary themselves, in her Month they shall find her.</hi> So these <hi>Pontificians,</hi> wandring in the wild disconsolate Desart of Doubtfulness and Distrust, snuffing up the Wind of vain Opinions at their pleasure, cannot be
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:94224:208"/>
averted from their Aberrations; and for a Man to pursue them by the foot, were to weary himself: he shall easily find them out in their Month, when and where they disburden themselves of the fruit they travelled withal. We will therefore only touch those weighty Reasons which they bring for the establishing of their Uncertainty.—<hi>Soto</hi> hath reserved and marshalled this point of Uncertainty, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Arguments of it, in the latter end of his third and last Book, <hi>de Natura &amp; Gratia,</hi> as being his Roman <hi>Triarii</hi> to help at a dead lift. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the main Doctrine of Justification hath such an inseparable relation to this point of Certainty, as this being denyed and removed, the whole Doctrine of Faith falleth to the ground. And therefore coming to this point, we may well apply this Proverb, <hi>Ad Triarios jam res rediit:</hi> The matter comes now to be tried by the <hi>Triarii,</hi> in whom resided the main shock, dint and upshot of the Battel. As <hi>Soto</hi> saith, <hi>Sentio ego pro mea exiguitate ingenii, &amp;c.</hi> I am of opinion, according to the slenderness of my Capacity, that if there were no other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we are not justified by Faith alone, than that hence it would follow that a Man is certain he is in a state of Grace, we should for this only cause deny Justification by sole Faith: such is the Evidence (saith he) that Faith makes no Man certain of his Salvation. <hi>Et tamen adversarii, &amp;c.</hi> And yet the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (saith he) by their perverse Argumentation, do even hence especially reason and conclude, that we are justified by Faith alone, because otherwise no Man were sure of his Justification: for such a strong Evidence do they take it, that every one ought to be certain of his Salvation. Thus <hi>Soto.</hi> And on the other side <hi>Luther</hi> saith, <hi>Etiamsi nihil praeterea peccatum fuisset in doctrina pontificia, &amp;c.</hi> Altho there had been no other fault in the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Doctrine, than that they taught, that we ought to stagger and waver, misdeeming and doubting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins, of Grace and our Salvation, yet we had just cause to separate our selves from that infidel and misbelieving Church. So he <hi>(tho Mr.</hi> Baxter, ut su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prà, <hi>condemns him and all others for so saying.)—</hi>The case therefore standing thus, between Certainty and Uncertainty, in the matter of Salvation, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon depends the winning and losing of the field; it concerns both sides to be no less sollicitous of the well-managing of their Forces, if not much more than the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> and their opposite Enemies the <hi>Albanians:</hi> when both sides resolved and concluded to pawn their perpetual Liberty and State to each other, upon the success of one Conflict between three Twin-brethren called <hi>Horatii,</hi> on the one side, and other three Twin-brethren called <hi>Curatii,</hi> on the other.—First therefore let us take a view of the State and Strength of the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. To omit their many Distributions of Certitude, as either in regard of the Object, or of the Subject, or some Divine, or some Moral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein both <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> and <hi>Vega</hi> do infinitely confound themselves; take we notice first in general, what kind of Certitude they admit, and allow of, and what they reject and disallow. The Certitudes or Certainties which they allow of, are these: first, a Certitude of Catholick Faith; to wit, a general Faith concerning the Truth of all things revealed in the Word of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Certitude they call a firm and certain Assent (tho obscure) to the general Truth of God's Word; and this they call the Certitude, in regard of the Object, the Assent whereof cannot be deceived: so that they confess a certain general Certainty. And this is sutable and proportionable to that kind of Faith which they hold, namely a general Faith. So that their general Certainty stands upon very good Reason, for how
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:94224:208"/>
can their Certainty be any other but general, when their Faith is no other but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral? for as he said, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>As the Man is, so is his Strength:</hi> so as the Faith is, such is the strength of it. Certitude therefore being the Property of Faith (as we shall shew hereafter) then Faith being general, the Certitude thereof can be no other than general. Secondly, They do also seem to admit of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain particular Certainty of Faith, but with such Limitation. as they make it to be a most uncertain Certainty, such as may be either true or false. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>Vega</hi> defining Certainty to be a certain Assent void of all doubting, whose proper Object is Truth, hereupon he thus inferreth; <hi>Itaque licet certi nequeant, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore (saith he) tho none can properly be said to be certain of their Grace, but those that certainly and truly believe that they are in the State of Grace; yet we may, and ought to affirm, that all they do certainly assent they are in a State of Grace, who without all doubt of fear do perswade themselves hereof, whether their Opinion herein be true or false. <hi>Et nonnunquam, &amp;c.</hi> And oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (saith he) Philosophers and Divines do so abuse these terms, as that they affirm, that all that have a certain assent of any thing, are absolutely and simply perswaded thereof. <hi>Quamobrem, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore the Fathers (to wit, of <hi>Trent)</hi> in this ninth Chapter, doubted not to say, that Hereticks and Schismaticks do boast of the Certainty of the Remission of their Sins, when notwithstanding they certainly knew, that that Certainty was rather a most vain Perswasion of their Justification. And so <hi>Vega</hi> concludes, <hi>neque dubium, &amp;c.</hi> Nor do we doubt, but that we may say in plain terms, that the Hereticks of our time have not an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Grace or Justification, but a Certainty. Note here (judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that the <hi>Pontificians</hi> (as our <hi>Baxterians)</hi> do allow of a certain uncertain particular Certainty of Faith, namely, such as may be either true or false. They might better have said just nothing; saving that they cautelously put this Clause by way of Prevention, that if a particular Certainty of Faith be never so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly proved, yet it may prove at hap-hazard, either true or false. And this <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> would demonstrate by a Distinction, saying, There is a twofold Certainty, <hi>per se,</hi> or <hi>quoad nos:</hi> either a Certainty in regard of the Truth it self believed, or in respect of our Apprehension, which may be deceived, according to the Council's own Text—with these Limitations do the <hi>Pontificians</hi> confine their allowance of the Certainty of Justification. 1. It is only general, not special or particular. 2. If particular, there be any, they say it may be true or false. 3. This special Certainty is given to none, but by special Revelation, and that to some special choice Persons; as the blessed Virgin and the Apostles. 4. Just Men may have some conjectural Signs and probable Opinions of their Justification. 5. If any had this special Certainty, then certainly St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> a Privilege, which not even the holy and faithful Martyrs are capable of without special Revelation, saith <hi>Vega.</hi> His Reason is, because even Hereticks may be Martyrs, and constantly die for Christ. This is the State of <hi>Pontifician</hi> Doctrine about Certainty and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Faith in Justification. Mr. <hi>Burton</hi>'s <hi>Christian Bulwark,</hi> chap. 14. part of it.</p>

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:94224:211"/>
And as they may fall from Grace, so the wicked (he must needs mean the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates as opposite to the Elect, for else all Men by Nature are wicked, and there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as the Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) the wicked (saith <hi>Vega)</hi> may be received into Grace as the Predestinate may fall from Grace.

                           <p>THis might be evidenced by many Reasons. 1. It is not saving Faith which is not operative to these effects. It ceaseth to be <hi>true (tho it was once so, by its ceasing to be so)</hi> whenever it wholly fails of <hi>purifying the Heart, and working of Love.</hi> Many affirm, that all Graces are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally in Faith, as in their Principle such must grant, that as Faith justifies us first in receiving and relying on Christ, so it continues to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify us by continuing those Acts, and exerting it self in those other Operations, which are essential to its Nature. And thus some expound <hi>James</hi> 2. 24. 2. Obedience, good Works and Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>preserve</hi> us from those <hi>contrary Evils</hi> which do sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Men to Condemnation: <hi>I keep my Body under, lest by any means, when I have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to others I my self be a Cast-away,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 27. 3. The Gospel-Constitution doth by its Promises and Threatnings make persevering Holiness, Obedience and good Works, the <hi>necessary way</hi> to Heaven. These are not only a natural, but a moral Meetness for Heaven.—The Gospel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution contains Promises and Threatnings, which affect all of us, as a Rule of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Misery: By these God governs Men, and Mens Hopes or Fears should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by these, as their Rule. Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> not observing this, <hi>(poor Man! it seems he had not attained to our Neonomian Holiness)</hi> hath run into those

Mistakes which open a door to all Licentiousness, tho he intended it not.

                           <p>Whether God doth require any more of any Sinners for Salvation, than that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ, repent of Sin, persevere in true Holiness, sincere Obedience, or good Works internal and external; and if we do so can we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish? and doth not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise secure Life upon doing these?—If any Sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, and repent not, hath Christ ever promised to
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:94224:210"/>
save him? Will any Decree, or the Merits of Christ secure him? Again, if any penitent Believer shall apostatize, prove ungodly and unfruitful, hate God, or neglect to love God and his Neighbour whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall this Man be saved? Hath not Christ deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the contrary? <hi>(even against this once penitent Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)</hi> will his first Faith save him? A Resolution of these two things, according to the very scope of the Word, will decide the main of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy. These assert the Rule of Christ's rectoral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributions, and the Decree comes not in opposition to the Methods of his Government, by which we are to govern our Hopes and Fears. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 124, 125.</p>
                           <p>Should they that are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Christ apostatize from Faith, they would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forfeit and lose this Union.

But the Apostle expresly adds <hi>[and of a good Conscience]</hi> which shews it was real; neither can it be supposed, that Men could truly attain a <hi>good Conscience,</hi> without the Operation of God's <hi>saving Grace,</hi> far less that a good Conscience doth consist with a seeming false and hypocritical Faith. Again, these Places of the Apostle being spoken by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, clearly import that these Attainments they had faln from, were good and real, not false and deceitful, else he would not have regretted their falling from them. And so he saith positively, <hi>they tasted of the heavenly Gift, and were made Partakers of the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. not that they seemed to be so, which sheweth this Objection is very frivolous.</p>

               <hi>I shall conclude this</hi> ninth and last Head, <hi>as running cross the three Columns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with some Observations out of Dr.</hi> Owen'<hi>s second Volume upon the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and recited</hi> verbatim, <hi>partly out of his Exercitations and Exposition in the same; unto which I shall add his Explication of the Parable of the Pharisee and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican—together with some Notes out of his piece of Apostacy.</hi>—The Doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Priesthood</hi> and Sacrifice of the Lord Christ, hath in all ages, by the Craft
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:94224:212"/>
and Malice of <hi>Satan,</hi> been either directly opposed, or variously corrupted; for it contains the principal Foundation of the Faith, and Consolation of the Church, which are by him chiefly maligned, it is known in how many things, and by how many ways it hath been obscured and depraved in the <hi>Papacy;</hi> sundry of them we have occasion to deal about, in our Exposition on many Passages of the <hi>Epistle.</hi> For they have not so much directly opposed the Truth of the Doctrine, as <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing</hi> the use and benefit of the thing it self unto the Church, they have substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted various false and superstitious Observances to effect the end whereunto this <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ and his holy Discharge thereof are alone of God designed. These therefore I shall no otherwise consider, but as their Opinions and Practices occur occasionally unto us, either in these <hi>Exercitations,</hi> or in the <hi>Exposition</hi> ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But there are a Generation of Men whom the Craft of <hi>Satan</hi> hath stirred up in this and the foregoing Age, who have made it a great part of their preposterous and pernicious Endeavours in and about Religion, to overthrow this whole <hi>Office</hi> of the Lord Christ, and the efficacy of the Sacrifice of himself depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This they have attempted with much Subtilty and Diligence, introducing a <hi>metaphorical</hi> or imaginary <hi>Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in their room: so robbing the Church of its principal Treasure, they pretend to supply the end of it with their own Fancies. They are the <hi>Socinians</hi> whom I intend. And there are more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons than one, why I could not omit a strict Examination of their Reasonings and Objections against this great part of the Mystery of the Gospel. The Reputation of Parts, Industry and Learning, which the bold Curiosity of some hath given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, makes it necessary, at least upon unavoidable occasions, to obviate the Insinuation of their Poison, which that opens a way for. Besides, even among our selves they are not a few, who embrace and do endeavour to propagate their Opinions. And the same Course, with their faces seeming to look another way, is steered by the <hi>Quakers</hi> who have at last openly espoused almost all their pernicious Tenents, altho in some things as yet they obscure their Sentiments in cloudy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, as wanting Will or Skill to make a more perspicuous Declaration of them. And there are others also pretending to more Sobriety than those before mentioned, who do yet think that these Doctrines concerning the <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation</hi> of Christ are, if not unintelligible by us, yet not of any great necessity to be insisted on, for of that Esteem are the Mysteries of the Gospel grown to be with some, with many among us. <hi>Exercitat.</hi> p. 2, 3.—Now <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> have both of them respect unto Truth. Where they are attained, there Truth it self doth dwell. In the due <hi>Consideration</hi> of the Lord Christ are these Treasures opened unto us. And altho we may not <hi>at once</hi> clearly and fully discern them, yet we are in the proper <hi>way</hi> to know them and possess them. There is not the least <hi>Line</hi> of Truth, how <hi>far</hi> soever it may be extended, and how <hi>small</hi> soever it may at length appear, but the Springs of it lie in the Person of Christ: And then we learn it aright, when we learn it in the <hi>Spring,</hi> or <hi>as it is in him,</hi> Eph. 4. 21. which when we have done, we may safely trace it down, and follow it unto its utmost extent. But he that looks on <hi>Gospel-Truths,</hi> as <hi>Sporades,</hi> as scattered up and down independently one of another, who sees not the Root, Center and Knot of them in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> it is most probable, that when he goes about to gather them for his use, he will also take up things quite of another nature. They say, that all <hi>moral Virtues</hi> are knit up in one, that is <hi>Righteousness,</hi> so that he who hath that, hath all the rest, at least radically and virtually. This I know, that
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:94224:212"/>
all spiritual Truths are knit up and centred in him who is the Truth. And they who have <hi>learned him,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 20. have with him received the <hi>Seeds of all Truth,</hi> which being watered and attended, as they ought, will in due time flourish into all their proper Branches and Fruits; for <hi>all things are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into one Head in him,</hi> Eph. 1. 10.—The right Performance of this Duty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livens, excites and acts all those Graces and gracious Affections which are effectual to preserve us in the Truth, and to keep us from Decays in our Profession. The Lord Christ being the proper Object of them, and this <hi>Consideration</hi> consisting in the application of the Faculties of our Souls unto that Object, by a due exercise of those Graces, they must needs be <hi>increased</hi> and augmented thereby, as all Grace grows and thrives in and by its Exercise, and ordinarily not otherwise. And when any Grace is so <hi>applied</hi> unto Christ, as spiritually to <hi>touch</hi> him, Virtue goes forth from him for its strengthning. The neglect then also hereof, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity produce the contrary effect, <hi>John</hi> 15. 5, 6.—Thus in particular is <hi>Faith</hi> increased, for according as the <hi>Object</hi> of it is cleared, manifested, represented, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and desirable unto the Soul, so is Faith it self excited and stirred up, and strengthned. Now this is no otherwise done but when the Soul is enabled graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to ponder on the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of Christ. There it finds all that is <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> unto it to make it happy and blessed, to procure Pardon, Peace, Righteousness and Glory for it. This Faith receives, and is improved by it; so the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Having Boldness and Liberty given us in the Gospel, to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and behold</hi> by Faith the Glory of Christ, we are thereby <hi>transformed</hi> into his Likeness and Image, namely by an increase of Faith, whereby we grow up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him who is the Head. And this brings along with it an increase in all other Graces, whereby we are preserved in the Profession and Practice of the Truth.—By this means also a Fountain of <hi>godly Sorrow</hi> is opened in the Hearts of Believers, which is a precious Grace, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. The consideration of the Lord Christ, as <hi>pierced</hi> for us, or by us, will melt and humble the Soul, or it will never yield unto any Ordinance of God.—The <hi>Spouse</hi> in like-manner in the <hi>Canticles</hi> giving an account of her great and incomparable <hi>Love</hi> unto her <hi>Beloved,</hi> manifests that it arose from the exact <hi>Consideration</hi> that she had taken of his Person, and all that belonged thereunto, <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11. The like may be said of all other Graces, and by these we must be preserved or utterly fail.—We may see here the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>why so many turn aside, and fall off from the Truth and Ways of the Gospel.</hi> They have given over a <hi>due Consideration</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> his Person, Offices and Mediation, and so have lost the means of their Preservation. They have been <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of him, not seeing a <hi>Form or Loveliness</hi> in him for which he should be desired; what a sad instance have we hereof in those poor deluded Creatures, who neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, pretend to find all <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> within themselves? This is their <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> the beginning of their Transgression. For when Men have neglected the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, is it any wonder if they despise his Ways and Ordinances, as is their manner? Indeed the Ordinances of the Gospel, its Worship and Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have no Excellency, no Beauty in them but what ariseth from their relation unto the Person and Offices of Christ; and if they are neglected, these must needs be burdensom and grievous. And as it is in vain <hi>to draw Men unto the Embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them,</hi> who know him not, who are not acquainted with him, seeing they appear unto them the most grievous and intolerable of all things that can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on them; so they who, on any account, cease to consider him by Faith, as
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:94224:213"/>
he is proposed unto them in the Gospel, cannot long abide in their Observation. Give such Men the advantages of Liberty, and keeping up a <hi>Reputation of Profession</hi> without them, which they suppose a new singular Opinion will furnish them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and they will quickly cast them off as a <hi>Burden</hi> not to be born. And as it is with <hi>Gospel-Worship,</hi> so it is with all the <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> or important Truths that we are to believe. The <hi>Center</hi> and <hi>Knot</hi> of them all is in the Person of Christ. If they are once loosed from thence, if their <hi>Union</hi> in him be dissolved; if Men no more endeavour to learn the <hi>Truth, as it is in Jesus,</hi> or to acquaint themselves with the Will of God, as he hath <hi>gathered all things unto an head</hi> in him, they <hi>scatter</hi> as it were of their own accord from their Minds, so that it may be they retain no one of them; or, if they do so, yet not in a right manner, so as to have an experience of the Power of them in Obedience. This is the cause of the <hi>Apostacies</hi> amongst us; Christ is neglected, not considered, not improved. A <hi>Light within,</hi> or a <hi>formal Worship without,</hi> are enthroned in his stead, and thence all sorts of <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi> do on their own accord ensue: deal with any whom you see to neglect his <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Truths,</hi> and you will find this to be the state of things with them, they have left off to value and esteem the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> or they had never any Acquaintance with him. And in vain is it to dispute with Men about the <hi>Streams,</hi> whilst they despise the <hi>Fountain.</hi> The Apostle gives us a <hi>three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Miscarriage</hi> in Religion; <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. (1.) A pretence of a <hi>voluntary</hi> uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Humility,</hi> a <hi>pretended Mortification,</hi> indeed a bare covering of base and filthy Pride. (2.) A <hi>worshipping of Angels,</hi> an instance to express all false self-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Worship. And, (3.) <hi>Curiosity in vain Speculations,</hi> or Mens <hi>intruding</hi> themselves into the things <hi>which they have not seen,</hi> setting out things with <hi>swelling Words of Vanity, wherewith</hi> in truth they have no acquaintance, <hi>whereof</hi> they have no experience. And all these, saith he, <hi>v.</hi> 19. proceed from hence, that <hi>they hold not the Head,</hi> they have let go the Lord Christ, from whom all Truths are to be derived, and consequently all Truth it self. Here lies the Spring of our <hi>frequent Apostacies.</hi> Again, we may hereby examine and try our selves: Do we at any time find the Ways, Institutions or Ordinances of Christ <hi>grievous or burdensom</hi> unto us? Do we find a secret dislike of them, or not that delight in them which we have formerly enjoyed? If we search into the <hi>Root of our Distempers,</hi> we shall find that our Hearts and Spirits have not been exercised with that <hi>Consideration</hi> of the Person and Office of Christ which our Duty calls for. We have not been kept in a constant <hi>Adoration</hi> of his Majesty, <hi>Admiration</hi> of his Excellency, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> in his Beauty, <hi>Joy</hi> in his Undertaking, <hi>holy Thoughtfulness</hi> of his whole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation. This hath betrayed us into our <hi>Lukewarmness</hi> and Indifferency, and made us <hi>faint and weary</hi> in his ways. Hence also all Endeavours for a <hi>Recovery</hi> from such a frame, that regard only the particular <hi>Instances</hi> that we are sensible of, are <hi>languid</hi> and successless. He that finds himself faint in, and weary of any of the ways of Christ, or any Duties of Obedience unto him, or that discovers an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuation of any of the Truths of the Gospel as to their Use and Importance, and thinks to recover himself, and retrieve his Spirit only by applying himself unto that <hi>Particular</hi> wherein he is sensible of his failure, will <hi>labour in the fire,</hi> and to no purpose: It may be that after some days, or months, or years, he will find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more at a loss than ever, and that because altho he <hi>striveth,</hi> yet he <hi>striveth not lawfully.</hi> If we would recover our selves, we must go to the source and beginning of our decays.—This tends directly unto our Instructions in these <hi>perilous
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:94224:213"/>
days,</hi> such as the latter days are foretold to be. All means that ever the Devil made use of from the Foundation of the World, to <hi>draw off or deter</hi> Men from Gospel-Obedience, are at this day displayed. The World smiles upon <hi>Apostates,</hi> and promiseth them a plentiful Supply of such things as the corrupt Nature of Man esteems desirable. <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>false Worship,</hi> with Temptations from them, spread themselves with Wings of <hi>glorious Pretences</hi> over the, face of the whole Earth. <hi>Trials, Troubles, Storms, Persecutions,</hi> attend and threaten on every hand: and he only that endureth unto the end shall be saved. He that like <hi>Jonah is a sleep</hi> in this Tempest, is at the door of Ruin; he that is <hi>secure</hi> in himself from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is in the greatest danger <hi>of falling</hi> by Security. What then shall we do, what means shall we use for our Preservation?

Victory. He <hi>deserves</hi> it, you <hi>need</hi> it, let it not be omitted.—This will give direction unto them who are called unto the work of <hi>teaching others.</hi> The Person and Offices of Christ are the things which principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are to insist upon. For that which is the <hi>chiefest Object</hi> of the Churches Faith, ought to be the <hi>chiefest Subject</hi> of our Preaching. So <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> that in his preaching, <hi>Christ was evidently crucified before their Eyes,</hi> Gal. 3. 1. He proposed <hi>Christ crucified</hi> unto their Consideration, <hi>determining,</hi> as he speaks in another place, <hi>to know nothing amongst them, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</hi> For if the <hi>Consideration of Christ</hi> be such an important Duty in <hi>Believers,</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the due <hi>Proposal</hi> of him unto their <hi>Consideration</hi> is no less in <hi>Preachers.</hi> Christ alone is to be preached <hi>absolutely,</hi> and all other Truths as they begin, end, and <hi>center</hi> in him. To propose the Lord Christ amiable, desirable, useful, and every way worthy of Acceptation, is the great Duty of the Dispensers of the Gospel. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> on the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Vol. 2. p. 23, 24, 25, 26.—Our Apostle tells us, that the <hi>preaching of the Cross was Foolishness to them that perished,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 18. And they perished merely on that account: It was Foolishness unto them, they liked not the Mystery of it, they saw no Wisdom in it. And this he did with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as is manifest in that place. To confirm this, I shall instance in some of the principal <hi>Heads</hi> of the Doctrine of the Gospel, and shew how Unbelief prevails with Men to <hi>dislike</hi> them, to <hi>reject</hi> them, and to look on them as <hi>Folly.</hi> And the first is this; <hi>That Jesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>poor and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible as he was in the World, generally esteemed by the Men of those days where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he lived, to be a Seducer, a Glutton, a Blasphemer, a turbulent Person, hated of God and Man, being taken as a Thief, and hanged upon a Tree, and so slain by the consent of the World, Jews and Gentiles, as a Malefactor, was the Son of God, the Saviour of the World, and is both Lord and Christ.</hi> This is the beginning of the Gospel, which the Apostle preached to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Acts 2. 22, 23, 24. <hi>Ye Men of</hi> Israel, <hi>hear these words, Jesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>a Man approved of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you by Miracles, and Wonders, and Signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye your selves also know: Him being delivered by the determinate Counsel and Fore-knowledg of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and

slain; whom God hath raised up:</hi> that is, this <hi>Jesus of Nazareth</hi> which we preach, him whom you <hi>remember</hi> well enough, he was among you but the other day, and preached unto you, and wrought Signs and Miracles among you. And you may further remember him by an infallible Token; for with <hi>wicked hands you crucified and slew him.</hi> Well! and what of this <hi>Jesus</hi> whom <hi>we slew and crucified?</hi> Why saith the Apostle, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Let all the House of</hi> Israel <hi>know assuredly that God hath made him both Lord and Christ,</hi> ver. 36. <hi>Him,</hi> who is that, an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the eternal Word? A Dispensation of Grace appearing in him; the sight of God in Man? No, no, but <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>That same Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus whom ye crucified:</hi> That same Man whom about <hi>eight weeks</hi> ago you crucified, him hath he <hi>made both Lord and Christ,</hi> or in his Resurrection and Exaltation declared so to be. And this the Holy Ghost lays a sure Foundation of in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of his <hi>Incarnation</hi> and Birth. The Angel tells <hi>Mary</hi> his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, <hi>the Infant that was wrapped in swadling Clouts, and placed in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> To this purpose do the Apostles declare themselves again, <hi>Acts 3. 13, 14, 15. The God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and of</hi> Isaac, <hi>and of</hi> Jacob, <hi>the God of our Fathers hath glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Son Jesus, whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of</hi> Pilat, <hi>when he was determined to let him go: But ye denied the holy one, and the just, and desired a Murderer to be granted unto you, and killed the Prince of Life, whom God hath raised from the dead.</hi> Still they direct them to the Man whom they saw, and knew, and dealt wickedly and injuriously withal. And this Man, he tells them, this Christ, must be received in the Heavens, until the <hi>restitution of all things,</hi> when he shall come again, <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20, 21. so himself lays this as the Foundation of all his Preaching; <hi>John 8. 24. If</hi> (saith he) <hi>ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your Sins;</hi> that I <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> that speak unto you, and converse with you, am the Messiah, the Saviour of the World, you shall die and perish for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; this I say is one, and one of the first <hi>fundamental Principles</hi> of the Gospel; and I shall a little manifest how <hi>Unbelief dislikes</hi> this Principle, and by that <hi>Dislike</hi> prevails with Men unto an <hi>Apostacy</hi> from the Gospel it self.—I might insist upon the great instance hereof in the <hi>Nation of the Jews</hi> unto whom he was sent first, and in an especial manner; but I have done this at large in the first part of our <hi>Prolegomena</hi> unto this Work, whereunto I refer the <hi>Reader;</hi> only we may mind how this was fore expressed concerning them by the Prophet, <hi>Isa. 53. 2. He hath no Form nor Comeliness, and when we shall see him, there is no Beauty that we should desire him.</hi> They could not see or discern any thing in him for which they should receive him, or believe in him, as to the <hi>end</hi> for which he was sent of God. As <hi>Hiram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> when he saw the Cities which <hi>Solomon</hi> had given him, they <hi>displeased</hi> him, and he called them <hi>Cabul,</hi> and so he rejected them, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:94224:214"/>
12. 13. So did the <hi>Jews</hi> when they came to see the Lord Christ, they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with him, and reproaching him with many opprobrious terms utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him, under the Power of which Unbelief they yet reject him. I might also insist on the <hi>Pagans</hi> of old, who derided the <hi>crucified God of the Christians.</hi> But I will leave them under the <hi>Conquest</hi> which the Gospel obtained against them. Mention also might be made of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> and other antient <hi>Hereticks</hi> with their endless <hi>Genealogies</hi> and <hi>Fables,</hi> making him to be only an <hi>appearance of a Man;</hi> and tho himself said he was a Man, and his Friends said he was a Man, and that God himself said he was a Man, and that he sent forth his Son, <hi>made of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made under the Law,</hi> tho he lived and died a Man, yet they would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg him so to be. But these are long since gone off the stage, altho we have yet to do with their Offspring, under several Forms and Shapes. The <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi> Figment also of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> springing from the same Root, utterly overthrowing the <hi>humane Nature</hi> of Christ and our Salvation wrought therein, might be on this account remarked. And so also might the Imagination of the <hi>Mennonites,</hi> who will not grant that the Man of whom we speak took Flesh of the Substance of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> but that his Flesh was spiritual, as they speak, brought from Heaven, and only passing through the <hi>Womb of the Virgin,</hi> that he might appear to be a Man. And so said some of old, concerning whom <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> says, that according to their opinion, <hi>Maria non filium gestabat in utero sed hospitem: Mary</hi> bare not her Son in her Womb, but a Guest; for they utterly dislike it, that one Partaker of Flesh and Blood, like our selves, should be this Son of God. And therefore this <hi>Figment</hi> which overthrows the Covenant of God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the Promises of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that he should be of his Seed, and of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> at once rejecting the <hi>whole old Testament,</hi> and turning the Stories of the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of Christ, recorded to manifest the Faithfulness of God in his Promises, into Fables, must be exalted in the room and place of that Truth which is so fully, so frequently asserted in the Gospel, and which is the prime Foundation of all our Profession. All these <hi>Oppositions</hi> unto, and <hi>Apostacies</hi> from the Gospel, sprang from this especial Cause, or the dislike of Unbelief against this Principle of its Mystery and Doctrine. But I shall particularly instance in <hi>two sorts of Persons</hi> that are of nearer Concernment unto us than any of these.—And the <hi>first</hi> is of them they call <hi>Quakers.</hi> It is strange to think into how many <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Shapes</hi> they have turned themselves, to darken the <hi>Counsel of God</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to hide their own apprehension from the Light. At their beginning in the World they made (many of them) no Scruple plainly to affirm, that all that is spoken concerning Christ, was a mere <hi>Dispensation of God,</hi> and an appearance of the <hi>Light;</hi> but as for such a Man as we have described, they had no regard of him. This at first served their turns, and they intended no more <hi>by Christ,</hi> but that which they call the <hi>Light of God</hi> within them. But what shall we say unto these things? If all the Testimonies that we have given unto the Man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, if all that is spoken of him in the Gospel, all that he did, all that he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which he now doth in Heaven by Intercession, what he shall do at the day of Judgment, all that is required of us towards him, in Faith, Love, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, be not enough to prove him a real individual Man, we may certainly be all of us in a mistake as to what we our selves are in this World, we may be all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations, who have hitherto taken our selves to be the <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> of Men. But it is some while since they seem to have forsaken this Imagination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:94224:215"/>
driven from it by the common Expostulations of every ordinary Christian, <hi>what do you think of Jesus that died at</hi> Jerusalem? They have begun in words to acknowledg his Person, but yet continue strangely to obscure their Thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, and to confound it or the Presence of God in and with him, with their own pretended Light. And whence doth this arise? It is merely from the secret <hi>Dislike</hi> that <hi>Unbelief</hi> hath of this Mystery of God. Hence they cannot see that <hi>Form and Comeliness</hi> in him for which he should be desired.—Again, others there are who grant, that all we have spoken concerning the humane Nature of Christ is true: That he was so <hi>born,</hi> that he so <hi>died,</hi> and that he was so a Man as we have declared. And this Man, say they, was justly called, and is so the <hi>Son of Son,</hi> because God employed and exalted him unto all Power in Heaven and Earth. But that he should be the <hi>eternal Son</hi> of God, that the eternal Word should be made Flesh, that a <hi>divine Person</hi> should receive the <hi>humane Nature</hi> into <hi>Subsistence</hi> with it self, this they utterly reject. This is the way of the <hi>Socinians.</hi> The Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies being so many, so plain, so <hi>uncontroulable,</hi> that are given in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto this Truth, what is it that carrys Men to advance a Contradiction unto them, to their own Ruin? Why <hi>Unbelief</hi> doth not like this Mystery of <hi>God manifested in the Flesh,</hi> this insensibly alienates the Soul from it; and what Men pretend to receive by the Conduct of Reason and Argument, is indeed nothing but <hi>Prejudices</hi> imposed on their Minds by the Power of Unbelief.—<hi>Secondly,</hi> Another main fundamental Principle of the Gospel is, <hi>That by the Obedience unto God, Death, and Bloodshedding of this same Jesus, who was crucified and slain, is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Forgiveness of Sins, Deliverance from the Wrath to come, Righteousness, and Acceptation with God to be obtained, and by him only.</hi>—The other <hi>Proposition</hi> respected the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, this doth his <hi>Mediation,</hi> and this in the second place was insisted on in the preaching of the Gospel. That this was the sum of the Doctrine of the Scriptures concerning him, himself taught his Disciples, <hi>Luke 24. 45, 46, 47. Then opened he their Understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoveth Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and that Repentance and Remission of Sins should be preached in his Name.</hi> And this the Apostles jointly express exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively unto all other Mediums as to the end proposed; <hi>Acts 4. 12. There is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other, for there is none other Name under Heaven given amongst Men whereby we must be saved.</hi>—The great Inquiry of Men in the World, convinced of an immortal Condition, is that which we have expressed, <hi>Acts 16. 30. What must we do to be saved?</hi> This lies in their Thoughts more or less all their days, and is rolled in their Hearts under that severe Notion; <hi>Isa. 33. 15. Who among us shall dwell with that devouring Fire? Who among us shall inhabit with everlasting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi> And of this Inquiry there are two Parts. 1. How they may obtain <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of Sin;</hi> Mich. 6. 6. <hi>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow my self before the High God? Shall I come before him with Burnt-offerings, and Calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of Rams, or ten thousands of Rivers of Oyl? Shall I give my First-born for my Transgression, the Fruit of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the Sin of my Soul?</hi> When a real Sense of the Guilt of Sin is by any means brought upon the Soul, it is vehement and urgent, and will give them in whom it is, no Rest, until they can fix on some way of Relief. 2. What they shall do for a <hi>Righteousness,</hi> upon the account whereof they may obtain <hi>Acceptance</hi> with God, for it is not enough that Men be one way or other <hi>acquitted</hi> from Sin, but they
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:94224:215"/>
must be <hi>righteous</hi> also. In this case, the <hi>Jews</hi> sought for <hi>Righteousness as it were by the Works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9. 32. For a <hi>Righteousness</hi> they knew they must have, and <hi>being ignorant of the Righteousness of God, they went about to establish their own Righteousness,</hi> Rom. 10. 3.—Now this Head of the Gospel that we mentioned is a direct <hi>Answer</hi> unto these <hi>two Questions.</hi> For in answer to the first, it declares, that by this Jesus Christ alone is Forgiveness and Remission of Sins to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>In him we have Redemption through his Blood, the Forgiveness of Sin,</hi> Eph. 1. 7. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12, 13, 14. This was, as the Gospel declares, the Design of God the Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. and of his own Love and good Will, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. And this the Apostles preached, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>amongst the chiefest things</hi> of their Message to the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3. And to the second, it answers, that by the Obedience and Sufferings of Christ alone, is the <hi>Righteousness</hi> inquired after to be obtained. <hi>For by his Obedience,</hi> the obedience of <hi>one,</hi> are <hi>many made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5. 19. For not only by him is preached unto us the Forgiveness of Sins, but by him <hi>all that believe are justified,</hi> Acts 13. 38, 39. See <hi>Phil. 3. 8, 9. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30.——This is another important part of the <hi>Mystery of the Gospel,</hi> and that which Unbelief greatly <hi>dislikes,</hi> that is, it is apt to beget in the Soul a dislike of it. And a great instance we have in the World of its Power and Efficacy to draw Men off from the Gospel. For <hi>Unbelief</hi> in this matter is the real Foundation of the whole <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</hi> They cannot rest in Christ alone for Righteousness and Forgiveness of Sins. Hence hath sprung their <hi>Sacrifice of the Mass</hi> for the quick and dead; hence their <hi>Indulgences</hi> from the Treasures of the Church; hence their <hi>Penances</hi> and Works satisfactory for Sin; hence their <hi>Purgatory,</hi> religious Houses, Pilgrimages, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Saints and Angels, Confessions and Absolutions, with the Remainder of their Abominations. <hi>(Hence let me add, arises also the</hi> Baxterian Prerequisites, Conditions <hi>and</hi> Preparatives <hi>to</hi> Justification <hi>before God, and the continuation of that State in its dependance upon our Retention of and Perseverance in these Prerequisites, Conditions and Preparatives; hence from a t acit Unbelief also of the fulness of the Satisfaction of Christ, Sins</hi> past, present, <hi>and to</hi> come, <hi>are not at once pardoned, but gradually;</hi> i. e. <hi>as we commit them, believe and repent, so they are remitted; grounding our Acquitment from an offended Justice, the righteous Demands of a broken Law, twitches of Conscience, Accusations of Men and Devils, upon the progress of an inherent Righteousness).</hi> All these things spring from no other Root but this, namely, that from the Power of their <hi>Unbelief</hi> Men think it a foolish thing to look for Pardon and Righteousness solely from another, and not to trust to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in any thing. And the reason why they have multiplied Instances to the same purpose is, because they can indeed find Rest and Satisfaction in none other, and do therefore <hi>please</hi> and <hi>deceive</hi> their Souls with this Variety. And what is it that hath driven a company of poor deluded Souls amongst our selves, to trust unto a fancied <hi>Light within them,</hi> and a <hi>feigned Perfection</hi> in their ways? They cannot think it wise, prudent, safe, they like it not, to rest, to trust for their All upon one who lived and died so long ago. Men make sundry Pretences, use diverse Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings and Pleas for their turning aside unto their crooked Paths, endeavour by all means possible to justify themselves; but the <hi>bottom</hi> of all lies here, that this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Cross is Foolishness</hi> unto them, and they are under the Power of their <hi>Unbelief</hi> which dislikes the Mysteries of it.—<hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another Principle of the Mystery is, <hi>That the way and means whereby Forgiveness of Sin, Righteousness and Acceptance with God for Sinners, is attained by this Jesus Christ, is, that by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:94224:216"/>
of himself, his Death and Bloodshedding, with the Punishment for Sin which he voluntarily underwent, God was atoned, his Justice satisfied, and his Law fulfilled, and that because he in his insinite Wisdom and Soveraignty, with the Will and Consent of Christ himself, to charge all the Sins of all the Elect upon him, and to accept of his Obedience for them, he undertaking to be their Surety and Redeemer.</hi> To clear this Principle the Gospel teacheth, (1.) That notwithstanding all that was visibly done unto <hi>Jesus</hi> by the <hi>Jews</hi> and others, yet the <hi>Hand and Counsel of God</hi> was in the whole business, designing him thereunto. See <hi>Acts 2. 22, 23. Rom.</hi> 3. 2. (2.) That his own <hi>merciful and gracious Goodness</hi> concurred herein. However the <hi>Jews</hi> seemed to hale him up and down as a <hi>Malefactor,</hi> and violently to slay him, yet if his own <hi>Will</hi> had not been in the Work, unto another end than what they had in design, they had had <hi>no Power over him,</hi> John 10. 18. But he came on fet purpose to lay down his Life a <hi>Ransom,</hi> Mat. 20. 28. and to offer himself a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Sinners, which he performed accordingly, <hi>Eph. 5. 2. Gal. 2. 20. Rev. 1. 5. Heb.</hi> 1. 3. (3.) That the <hi>end</hi> of all this, was that which we before laid down, namely; that <hi>he might be made Sin for us, that we might become the Righteousness of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. So also, <hi>Gal. 3. 13. Isa. 53. 4, 5, 6, 10. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. And this Principle also <hi>Unbelief</hi> riseth up with great <hi>Power and Efficacy</hi> against in many, and that on sundry accounts: For, 1. That God should comply as it were, and have <hi>an hand in that Work</hi> for any end of his, wherein <hi>Satan</hi> and Men as <hi>wicked as over the Sun shone upon,</hi> did execute the Fulness of their Rage and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, and for which he afterwards utterly and miserably destroyed those Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, is <hi>Folly</hi> to some. Some turned the whole story into an <hi>Allegory;</hi> some said, it was acted only in shew and appearance, and not in Reality and Truth: Some, that he was conveyed away, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> crucified in his stead, with sundry other such foolish Abominations. 2. Some of late refusing to see the <hi>Wisdom, Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God in this matter, in bringing about his own Counsels, and doing his own Work, notwithstanding the Interposition of the Sins of the worst of Men, deny that God <hi>determined any thing</hi> therein; but left it wholly unto the Liberty of the <hi>Jews,</hi> on the determination of whose Wills the whole Work of Salvation was suspended. 3. Some reject the whole matter it self. That the <hi>just</hi> should suffer for the <hi>unjust,</hi> the <hi>innocent</hi> undergo the Punishment due to the <hi>guilty;</hi> that one should sin, and another <hi>suffer;</hi> that he whom God loved above all, should undergo his Wrath for them and their <hi>Deliverance,</hi> whom he had grounds of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to hate and destroy, is a foolish thing unto them. This all the <hi>Socinians</hi> in the World despise, and it is rejected by the <hi>Quakers</hi> amongst our selves, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously corrupted by the <hi>Papists</hi> and others. <hi>(Who these</hi> others <hi>are, I suppose the Reader may safely by this time a day, without the help of a Spirit of Prophecy, guess at).</hi> And there is none of all these but will plead Reasons and <hi>Arguments</hi> for their Opinions. But this that we insist on is the true and real ground of their Miscarriages. They are under the Power of that Unbelief, which acts it self by a <hi>Dislike</hi> of the Mysteries of the Gospel. Pretend what they will, it is <hi>Unbelief</hi> alone that is the cause of their <hi>Apostacy.</hi> I might instance in other Principles of the like nature and importance, but I should dwell too long on this <hi>Digression.</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen, Ibid.</hi> p. 124, 125, 126, 127, 128.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. That the design of our Saviour herein was to represent <hi>the way of our Justification before God,</hi> is evident, (1.) From the Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given of the Persons whom he reflected on; <hi>ver. 9. They were such as trusted
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:94224:216"/>
in themselves that they were righteous,</hi> or that they had a personal Righteousness of their own before God. (2.) From the general Rule wherewith he confirms the Judgment he had given concerning the Persons described: <hi>Every one that exalteth himself shall be abased,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>And he that abaseth himself shall be exalted.</hi> As this is applied unto the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> and the Prayer that is ascribed unto him, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares plainly, that every <hi>Plea of our own Works,</hi> as unto our Justification before God, under any consideration, is a <hi>Self-exaltation</hi> which God despiseth; and as applied unto the <hi>Publican,</hi> that a <hi>Sense of Sin</hi> is the only Preparation on our part for acceptance with him on Believing.—Wherefore both the Persons are represented <hi>as seeking to be justified,</hi> for so our Saviour expresseth the issue of their Address un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for that purpose; <hi>the one was justified,</hi> the other was not. The <hi>Plea of the Pharisee</hi> unto this end consists of two Parts: (1.) That he had <hi>fulfilled the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> whereon he might be justified. He makes no mention of any <hi>Merit (no more than our Baxterians)</hi> either of Congruity or Condignity. Only whereas there were two Parts of God's Covenant then with the Church, the one with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>moral,</hi> the other with respect unto the <hi>ceremonial Law,</hi> he pleads the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Condition of it in both Parts, which he sheweth in instances of both kinds, only he adds the way that he took to further him in this Obedience, somewhat beyond what was injoined, namely, <hi>that he fasted twice in the Week.</hi> For when Men begin to <hi>seek for Righteousness,</hi> and Justification by Works, they quickly think their best Reserve lies <hi>in doing something extraordinary</hi> more than other Men, and more indeed than is required of them. This brought forth all the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical Austerities</hi> in the Papacy. Nor can it be said, that all this signified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, because he was an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> and a Boaster; for it will be replied, that it should seem all are so who <hi>seek for Justification by Works:</hi> for our Saviour only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents <hi>one</hi> that doth so; neither are these things laid in the <hi>Bar</hi> against his Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but only <hi>that he exalted himself in trusting unto his own Righteousness.</hi> (2.) In an Ascription of all that he did unto God: <hi>God, I thank thee.</hi> Altho he did all this, yet he owned <hi>the Aid and Assistance of God</hi> by his Grace in it all. He esteemed himself much to <hi>differ</hi> from other Men, but ascribed it not unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that so he did. All the Righteousness and Holiness which he laid claim unto, he ascribed unto the Benignity and Goodness of God. Wherefore he neither pleaded any <hi>Merit</hi> in his Works, nor any <hi>Works</hi> performed in his <hi>own strength,</hi> without the aid of Grace. All that he pretends is, that by the <hi>Grace of God he had fulfilled the Condition of the Covenant,</hi> and thereon expected to be justified. And whatever Words Men shall be pleased to make use of in their vocal Prayers, God interprets their Minds according to what they trust in, as unto their Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before him. And if some Men will be true unto their own Principles, <hi>(you may guess who the</hi> Doctor <hi>means)</hi> this is the Prayers which <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> they ought to make.—If it be said, that it is charged on this <hi>Pharisee,</hi> that he <hi>trusted in himself,</hi> and <hi>despised others,</hi> for which he was rejected: I answer, (1.) This Charge respects not the Mind of the Person, but the Genius and Tendency of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Perswasion of Justification by Works includes in it a <hi>Contempt of other Men</hi> (as that they are unstudied, ignorant, and illogical) for if <hi>Abraham</hi> had been justified by Works, he should have had whereof to glory. (2.) Those whom he despised were such as placed their whole Trust in <hi>Grace and Mercy,</hi> as this <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. (Poor Dr.</hi> Crisp <hi>and others, well meaning Men, but grievous Antinomians).</hi> It were to be wished, that all others of the same Mind did not so also.—The Issue
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:94224:217"/>
is with this Person, <hi>that he was not justified,</hi> neither shall any one ever be so on the account of his own personal Righteousness. For our Saviour hath told us, <hi>that when we have done all,</hi> that is, when we have the Testimony of our Consciences unto the Integrity of our Obedience, instead of pleading it unto our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we should say, that is, really judg and profess that we are <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants,</hi> Luke 17. 10. As the Apostle speaks, <hi>I know nothing by my self, yet am I not thereby justified,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 4. And he that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and hath nothing to trust unto but <hi>his Service,</hi> will be cast out of the Presence of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 30. Wherefore on the best of our Obedience to confess our selves <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is to confess, that after all in our selves we deserve to be cast out of the Presence of God.—In opposition hereunto the State and Prayer of the <hi>Publican</hi> under the same design of seeking Justification before God, are expressed. And the outward Acts of <hi>his Person</hi> are mentioned as representing, and expressive of the inward Frame of his Mind. <hi>He stood afar off,</hi> he did not so <hi>much as lift up his Eyes, he smote upon his Breast.</hi> All of them represent a Person <hi>desponding,</hi> yea <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing</hi> in himself. This is the Nature, this is the Effect of that <hi>Conviction of Sin</hi> which we before asserted to be antecedently necessary unto Justification. Displi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, Sorrow, sense of Danger, fear of Wrath, all are present with him. In brief he declares himself <hi>guilty before God,</hi> and his Mouth stopped, as unto any Apology or Excuse. And his Prayer is a sincere Application of his Soul unto sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace and Mercy, for a deliverance out of the Condition wherein he was by reason of the Guilt of Sin. And in the use of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there is respect had unto a <hi>Propitiation.</hi>—Some make a weak Attempt from hence, to prove that Justification consists wholly in the <hi>Remission of Sin,</hi> because on the Prayer of the <hi>Publican</hi> for Mercy and Pardon, he is said to be justified, but there is no force in this Argument. For, (1.) <hi>The whole Nature of Justification</hi> is not here declared, but only what is required on our part thereunto. The respect of it unto the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Christ</hi> was not yet expresly to be brought to light, as was shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. (2.) Altho the <hi>Publican</hi> makes his Address unto God, under a deep Sense of the <hi>Guilt of Sin,</hi> yet he prays not for the <hi>bare Pardon of Sin,</hi> but for all that sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Mercy or Grace God provided for Sinners. (3.) <hi>The term of Justification</hi> must have the same Sense, when applied unto the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> as when applied unto the <hi>Publican.</hi> And if the meaning of it, with respect unto the <hi>Publican,</hi> be, that he was pardoned, then hath it the same Sense with respect unto the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> he was not pardoned, but he came on no such Errand: He came to be <hi>justified,</hi> not pardoned, nor doth he make the least mention of his Sin, or any Sense of it. Wherefore altho <hi>the Pardon of Sin</hi> be included in Justification, yet to <hi>justify</hi> in this place hath respect unto a <hi>Righteousness,</hi> whereon Man is declared just and righteous, wrapt up on the part of the <hi>Publican</hi> in the sovereign producing Cause, <hi>the Mercy of God.</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen of Justification,</hi> p. 435, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>There is a piece of Dr.</hi> Owen'<hi>s, entituled,</hi> The Nature of Apostacy, <hi>&amp;c. which I could freely recommend to the Reader's diligent, sober and weighty Consideration, as being of the most pertinent use in this day, next unto the Scriptures themselves, as any Book I know extant, out of which with some Passages I shall conclude this part of the Work—.</hi>

            <p>As unto those things which are <hi>contrary unto Reason as corrupted,</hi> these they (viz. <hi>the Socinians)</hi> deprave and wrest unto a compliance therewithal: so they deal with the Doctrine of the <hi>Attributes of God,</hi> of his <hi>eternal Decrees,</hi> of the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:94224:217"/>
               <hi>Office and Mediation of Christ,</hi> of <hi>Justification</hi> by his Righteousness, of the <hi>Power and Efficacy of the Grace</hi> of the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> in the Conversion of Sinners.—The <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of these Principles is greatly diffused in the World. For hence it is that all those Doctrines of the Gospel which have any thing of <hi>spiritual Mystery</hi> in them, which are constituent Principles of, or do any way belong unto the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and so not absolutely reconcileable unto Reason as corrupt and carnal, are by many so laden with Contempt and Scorn, that it is sufficient to expose any Man unto the Contumelies of ignorant, irrational and foolish, who dares to avow them. Such are the Doctrines of <hi>eternal Predestination,</hi> of the <hi>total Corruption of the Nature of Man</hi> as unto spiritual things by the Fall, of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Efficacy of the Grace of God</hi> in the Conversion of Sinners, of the <hi>Nature and Necessity of Regeneration,</hi> of <hi>Union</hi> with Christ, of <hi>Justification</hi> by the imputation of his <hi>Righteousness,</hi> of the Nature of internal inherent Righteousness or <hi>Evangelical Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> of the necessity of continual Supplies of the Spirit in <hi>actual Grace</hi> unto all Duties of Obedience, of the <hi>Power of the Holy Ghost</hi> evidencing the divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures in and by themselves, with sundry others. Many can see no Reason for the admittance of these things, or they cannot see the reason of them; and therefore altho they are fully and plainly declared in the Scriptures, yet are they (by no small Generation among us) so derided and exploded, as that the very Names of them are grown into Contempt. But why all this <hi>Scorn,</hi> all this Severity? Men may do well to consider, that not long since all the <hi>Prelates of England</hi> owned these Doctrines as <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> which now they so deride. And altho they are not obliged by any divine Precept to be of the same Judgment with them because it was theirs, yet it may be they are under some Obligation from the <hi>Laws of the Land</hi> not to renounce the antient Doctrines of the Church, and are certainly bound by the Laws of Christian Modesty and Sobriety, not to vilify and scorn the Doctrines they owned, and all that do profess them.—<hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Righteousness of God,</hi> hath been another Spring of this Apostacy. This the Apostle expresly declares to be the Reason why Men <hi>go about to establish a Righteousness of their own:</hi> Rom. 10. 3. <hi>Being ignorant of the Righteousness of God, and going about to establish their own Righteousness, they have not submitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Righteousness of God.</hi> And this he speaks of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that the best of them, who followed after Righteousness, and <hi>sought</hi> it as <hi>it were by the Works of the Law;</hi> Rom. 9. 31, 32. Of all Men they thought themselves most knowing of the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God, for they made <hi>their boast of God, and knew</hi> (as they thought and professed) <hi>his Will, and approved the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the Law, and were confident that they themselves were Guides of the Blind, and the Light of them that are in Darkness, Instru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rs of the Foolish, and Teachers of Babes, having the Form of Knowledg and of the Truth in the Law, Rom.</hi> 2. 17, 18, 19, 20. Yet these Men <hi>submitted not</hi> to the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God, but went about to <hi>establish</hi> their own <hi>Righteousness,</hi> because they were ignorant of the Righteousness of God. And wheresoever this Ignorance is, Men will do so.—Take the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God in any Sense wherein it is mentioned in the Scripture, and this Event will follow upon the Ignorance thereof. For it must be either the Righteousness that is <hi>in him,</hi> or the Righteousness he requires <hi>of us</hi> in the Law, or the Righteousness he hath provided <hi>for us</hi> in the Gospel. Consider it any of these ways, and the Ignorance of it is that which countenanceth Men in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking themselves unto a Righteousness of their own, yea unavoidably casteth them
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:94224:218"/>
upon it. For,—a right understanding of the <hi>infinite Purity,</hi> the glorious <hi>essential Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, of his absolute <hi>eternal Righteousness,</hi> as the Lord and Judg of all, will teach Men what Apprehensions they ought to have of any thing done <hi>in</hi> them or <hi>by</hi> them; <hi>Heb. 12. 29. Heb. 1. 13. Exod. 34. 7. Rom. 1. 32. Josh.</hi> 24. 19. Whilst the dread and terror of the Excellency of this Holiness and Righteousness is before Men, they will not easily betake themselves, and their Trust into a Righteousness of their own. There are two sorts of Persons that the Scripture represents under an Apprehension of this Righteousness of God. The first are <hi>convinced guilty Sinners,</hi> and the other <hi>humble holy Believers;</hi> and what Thoughts of themselves each sort is thereon filled withal, it doth declare. For the former sort we have an instance in <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3. 10. in <hi>others,</hi> Isa. 33. 14. as also <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 7. The sum is, they can think of nothing, have no other Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their Minds, but how either they may <hi>fly</hi> from him, and <hi>hide</hi> themselves, or feign to themselves impossible ways of <hi>Atonement,</hi> or be swallowed up in Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Despair. Send them in this Condition unto a Righteousness of their own, and they will easily understand you do but reproach their Misery. And for the other sort, or <hi>humble holy Believers,</hi> we may see also how on this occasion they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press themselves in this matter; <hi>Job 4. 17, 18, 19. ch. 9. 2. Psal. 130. 3. Psal.</hi> 143. 6. They all jointly acknowledg, that such is the glorious Holiness and Righteousness of God, such is the Imperfection of our Righteousness and Impurity of our Works, that there is no appearance or standing before him on their account. It is the want of a due Meditation hereof, that hath produced the many presumptuous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the World concerning the <hi>Justification</hi> of Sinners. The Scripture speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Justification, directs us to conceive it <hi>in the sight of God,</hi> Psal. 130. 2. or <hi>before him,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. Teaching us, that in this matter we should set our selves as in the presence and under the eye of this Holy God, and then consider on what <hi>ground</hi> we may <hi>stand</hi> before him. But where Men are <hi>ignorant of this Righteousness of God,</hi> when they have secret Thoughts that he is <hi>altogether such an one as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks; that is, one who is either not so holy in himself as is pretended, or one who doth not require a <hi>Sutableness</hi> in us unto his Holiness, but is little concerned in our Duties, less in our Sins; is it any wonder if Men think they can of themselves do that which is satisfactory unto him, and so <hi>go about to establish their own Righteousness?</hi> And this way even in <hi>Teaching</hi> have some betaken themselves unto. They endeavour to satisfy their Disciples, that there is no such <hi>Severity</hi> in God against <hi>Sin</hi> as some pretend, no such <hi>Holiness</hi> in his Nature as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to infer an Indignation against every Sin; that they are but vain Frights and needless Disquietments which either their own Consciences or the Preaching of some Men do put them unto. And if they can prevail to be credited herein, there is no doubt but that those whom they so perswade will be pleased with their own Righteousness; but whether God in this matter of <hi>Justification</hi> will be pleased with it or no, is not so easy to be determined.—</p>
            <p>☞ And hence it is, that all Opinions of a <hi>Self-Righteousness</hi> or <hi>Justification by Works,</hi> have always produced Licentiousness of Life, tho they who assert it clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously pretend to the contrary. <hi>(As the</hi> Baxterians <hi>have done, and especially Mr.</hi> Dan. Williams <hi>of late has revived the same virulent Charge against the Doctrine of Free Grace in his</hi> Gospel-Truth stated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 113. Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> says he, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving this, (i. e. <hi>his conditional Motives and Prerequisites)</hi> hath run into those Mistakes which open a door to all Licentiousness) so when a Righteousness of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:94224:218"/>
Works was absolutely enthroned in the <hi>Papacy</hi> before the Reformation, the Lives of the Generality of Men were flagitiously wicked, and most of the <hi>good Works</hi> that were performed amongst them were but <hi>Barterings</hi> with God and Conscience for horrible Vices and Impieties. Accordingly also unto the growth of the same Opinion in its various degrees among us, is the progress also of all sorts of Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Licentiousness of Life. And if the Masters of these Opinions would but open their eyes, they would see, that whereas they assert their <hi>Justification by Works</hi> under a pretence of a necessity so to do, for the maintenance of Holiness and Righteousness among Men, that Unholiness, Unrighteousness, Intemperance of Life, and all Abominations do grow upon them, such as were not heard of in former days among them who made any profession of Religion. And the Reason hereof is, because the very same Notions of God which will allow Men to suppose that they may be <hi>justified</hi> in his sight by their own Duties, will also accommodate their Lusts with several Apprehensions that he will not be so severe against their Sins as is supposed. However this is plain in matter of Fact, that the opinion of Self-Righteousness and Loosness of Conversation in the practice of Sin, have gone together generally from the days of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to this present season. And as this proud Conceit receives daily Advancement in several degrees, under various Pretences, it is to be feared the World will be more and more filled with the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fruits thereof. It is Grace and the Doctrine of it, as well as its Power, that must put a stop to Sin. He that drives Men into a Righteousness of their own at one door, opens another unto their Sins. And all that we have got hitherto by fierce Disputations about <hi>Justification</hi> as it were by <hi>Works,</hi> is only that the Faith of some hath been weakned, the Peace of Multitudes disquieted, Differences en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, without the least evidence of Holiness improved, or the Vices of Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them. And it will not be granted, that the strictest Professors in these days (whether they have imbibed these Opinions or no) do in real Holiness and Fruitfulness of Life exceed those of the foregoing Age, who firmly and without Hesitation trusted unto the Lord Christ alone, for Life, Righteousness and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—As this <hi>Apostacy</hi> is yet in its <hi>Progress,</hi> so what will be its <hi>Event,</hi> what it will arise unto, is altogether uncertain. God can put a stop unto it when he pleaseth, as he hath in his holy Purposes fixed Bounds unto it which it shall not pass. But in the mean time being greatly provoked by the <hi>Ingratitude</hi> of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World, no Man knows how long he may suspend those more powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and more extraordinary Effects of his Word and Spirit, which are needful unto the <hi>healing of the Nations,</hi> and without which they will not be <hi>cured.</hi> I hope for better things, and pray for better things, but I have no certain ground of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that this Apostacy shall not grow, until in one instance or other of it, it swallow up all visible Profession. The whole World, so far as I know of, (I mean these Parts of it) may become <hi>Papal</hi> again, or be so corrupted in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and profane in their Lives, as that it is no great matter what their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Religion be. Two things I do know or believe, namely, (1.) That <hi>the Foundation of God standeth sure, having this Seal, God knoweth who are his:</hi> His Elect that truly fear him, and diligently serve him, shall be preserved from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing eternally, and every thing that necessarily leads thereunto. (2.) That God hath appointed a time and season wherein he will not only put a stop unto this defection from the Gospel, but an end also. He will one day execute the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance that he hath written and recorded on the Throne, Power and Kingdom of
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:94224:219"/>
the <hi>Antichristian Apostacy,</hi> and in one day shall the Plagues of <hi>Babylon</hi> come upon her. And <hi>he will again turn to the People a pure Language, that they all may call on the Name of the Lord, to serve him with one Consent,</hi> Zeph. 3. 9, 10. He will again <hi>revive</hi> the Beauty of his <hi>Worship,</hi> and the Glory of <hi>Holiness</hi> in the Earth. But in the mean time what things may come unto, I know not. Those who pretend to a clear Inspection into <hi>future things,</hi> may not do amiss strictly to examine the <hi>grounds</hi> whereon they proceed. For many have been made ashamed of their Predictions, that within such and such a time the <hi>Yoke of</hi> Babylon <hi>should be broken.</hi> This is all I say, (and I say it only for my self) I know no Assurance that can be given on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible grounds, that the <hi>Apostacy</hi> which we are treating of, shall not one way or other, in one instance or other, become again to be <hi>Catholick,</hi> and prevail against all open visible Profession of the Purity and Power of <hi>Gospel-Worship</hi> and <hi>Holiness.</hi> Now if this be not so unto others, yet unto my self it ought to be a warning, how I may be thought <hi>worthy to escape,</hi> and to <hi>stand before the Son of Man.</hi> And I am sure there is so much danger of it at least, as to deserve the Consideration of all who take care of their eternal Salvation. For if things should come to such a pass, they are not many, they are but very few who will be entirely preserved. The most will one way or other suffer Loss. And it is not an easy thing to be found among the number of the <hi>few</hi> in such a season. Can we think Men careless in holy Duties, cold in Zeal, lukewarm in Love, barren in good Works, cleaving to the World, and conformable to it, low in their Light, dubious in their State, useless in the World, fearful of Trials, will be of this Number? They are wofully deceived who are pleased with such Apprehensions; other Principles, other Ways, Courses and Practices, will be required in them who shall be hidden and safeguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that day. Dr. <hi>Owen of Apostacy,</hi> p. 297, 300, 301, 302, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 533, 534, 535, 536.</p>
            <p>It is not either against Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or for Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> or any of their distinct, particular Judgments (merely as such) that these my Quotations on all hands are brought in, but to let the Reader see who it is that speaks the Language of Christ, and who of Antichrist.</p>
            <p>Therefore to obviate the <hi>Neonomian</hi> Charge of Absurdities <hi>(because not concord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Reason)</hi> as cast upon the <hi>Protestant</hi> scriptural Doctrine of Christian Faith, Religion and Experience, I shall recite Mr. <hi>Herbert Palmer</hi>'s Character of a Christian in Paradoxes, who was an antient worthy <hi>Presbyterian Puritan,</hi> and yet an Abhorrer of <hi>Baxterianism,</hi> which is another Paradox amongst some, tho not all of them.</p>
            <p>1. A Christian is one who believes things which his Reason cannot comprehend. 2. Who hopes for that which neither he nor any Man alive ever saw. 3. Who <hi>labours</hi> for that he knows he can never <hi>attain.</hi> 4. Yet in the issue, his <hi>Belief</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not to have been false; his <hi>Hope</hi> makes him not ashamed, his Labour is not in vain. 5. He believes three to be one, and one to be three; a Father not to be elder than his Son, and the Son to be equal with the Father, and one proceeding from both to be fully equal to both. 6. He believes in one <hi>Nature</hi> three <hi>Persons,</hi> and in one <hi>Person</hi> two <hi>Natures.</hi> 7. He believes a <hi>Virgin</hi> to have been a <hi>Mother,</hi> and her <hi>Son</hi> to be her <hi>Maker.</hi> 8. He believes him to be born <hi>in time,</hi> who was from <hi>everlasting;</hi> and to be shut up in a narrow room, whom Heaven and Earth could never contain. 9. He believes him to have been a weak Child carried in Arms, who is the <hi>Almighty;</hi> and him to have <hi>died</hi> who only hath Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:94224:219"/>
in himself. 10. He believes the God of all Grace, to have been angry with one who never offended him; and the God that hates all Sin, to be reconciled to himself, tho sinning continually, and never making, or being able to make Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. 11. He believes the most just God to have punished a most innocent Person, and to have justified himself, tho a most ungodly Sinner. 12. He believes himself freely pardoned, and yet that a sufficient Satisfaction was paid for him. 13. He believes himself to be precious in God's sight, yet he loaths himself in his own sight. 14. He dares not justify himself even in those things wherein he knows no fault in himself: yet he believes God accepts even those Services wherein himself is able to find many faults. 15. He praiseth God for his Justice, and fears him for his Mercies. 16. He is so ashamed that he dares not open his Mouth before God, yet comes with boldness to God, and asks any thing he needs. 17. He is so humble as to acknowledg himself to deserve nothing but evil, yet so confident as to believe God means him all good. 18. He is one that fears always, and yet is as bold as a Lion. 19. He is often sorrowful, yet always rejoicing: often complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet always giving of Thanks. 20. He is most lowly minded, yet the greatest Aspirer; most contented, yet ever craving. 21. He bears a lofty Spirit in a mean Condition, and when he is aloft, thinks meanly of himself. 22. He is rich in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and poor in the midst of Riches. 23. He believes all the World to be his, yet dares take nothing without special leave. 24. He covenants with God for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet looks for the greatest Reward. 25. He loses his Life and gains by it, and even while he loses he saves it. 26. He lives not to himself, yet of all others is most wise for himself. 27. He denies himself often, yet no Man that most pleases himself loves himself so well. 28. He is the most reproached and most honoured. 29. He hath the most Afflictions and the most Comfort. 30. The more Injuries his Enemies do to him, the more advantage he gets by them. 31. The more he himself forsakes of worldly things, the more he enjoys of them. 32. He is most temperate of all Men, yet fares most deliciously. 33. He lends and gives most freely, yet is the greatest Usurer. 34. He is meek towards all Men, yet unexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Men. 35. He is the best Child, Brother, Husband, Friend, yet hates Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, and Wife and Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 36. He loves all Men as himself, yet hates some Men with perfect Hatred. 37. He desires to have more Grace than any hath in the World, yet he is truly sorry when he sees any Man have less than himself. 38. He knows no Man after the Flesh, yet gives to all Men their due respects. 39. He knows if he pleases Men, he is not the Servant of Christ, yet for Christ's sake he pleases all Men in all things. 40. He is a Peace-maker, yet continually fighting, and an irreconcilable Enemy. 41. He believes him to be worse than an Infidel that provides not for his Family, yet he himself lives and dies without Care. 42. He is severe to his Children, because he loves them: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favorable to his Enemies, revenges himself upon them. 43. He accounts all his Inferiours his Fellows, yet stands strictly upon his Authority. 44. He believes the Angels to be more excellent Creatures than himself, and yet counts them his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. 45. He believes he receives many good turns by their means, yet he never prays their Assistance, nor craves their Prayers, nor offers them Thanks, which yet he doth not disdain to do to the meanest Christian. 46. He believes himself a King, how mean soever he be; and how great soever he be, that he is not too good to be Servant to the poorest Saint. 47. He is often in Prison, yet always at liberty, and a Freeman tho a Servant. 48. He receives not Honour from Men,

yet highly prizes a good Name. 49. He believes God hath bidden every Man that doth him any good to do so, yet he of any Man is the most thankful to them that do ought for him. 50. He would lay down his Life to save the Soul of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, yet will not venture upon one Sin to save his Life that hath saved his. 51. He swears to his own hindrance, and changes not, yet knows that his Mouth cannot tie him to Sin. 52. He believes Christ to have no need of any thing he doth, yet makes account he relieves Christ in all his Deeds of Charity. 53. He knows he can do nothing of himself, yet labours to work out his own Salvation. 54. He confesses he can do nothing, yet as truly professes he can do all things. 55. He knows that Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the Kingdom of God, yet believes he shall go to Heaven Body and Soul. 56. He trembles at God's Word, yet counts it sweeter to him than the Honey and the Honey-comb, and dearer than thousands of Gold and Silver. 57. He believes that God will never damn him; and yet he fears him for being able to cast him into Hell. 58. He knows he shall not be saved by his Works, and yet doth all the good Works he can, and believes he shall not be saved without them. 59. He knows God's Providence orders all things, yet he is so diligent in his business, as if he were to cut out his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. 60. He believes before-hand God hath purposed what shall be, and that nothing can make him alter his purpose, yet prays and endeavours as if he would force God to satisfy him however. 61. He prays and labours for what he believes God means to give him; and the more assured he is, the more earnest. 62. He prays for that he knoweth he shall not obtain, and yet gives not over. 63. He prays and labours for that which he knows he may be no less happy without. 64. He prays withal his Heart not to be led into Temptation, yet rejoices when he is fallen into it. 65. He believes his Prayers to be heard, even when they are denied, and gives Thanks for that which he prayed against. 66. He hath within him the Flesh and the Spirit, yet is not a double minded Man. 67. He is often led away Captive by the Law of Sin, yet it never gets the Dominion over him. 68. He cannot sin, yet he can do nothing without Sin. 69. He can do nothing against his Will, yet he doth what he would not. 70. He wavers and doubts, and yet obtains; he is often tossed and shaken, and yet like Mount <hi>Zion.</hi> 71. He is a Serpent and a Dove, a Lamb and a Lion, a Reed and a Cedar. 72. He is sometimes so troubled, that he thinks nothing is true in Religion; and yet if he did think so, he could not be at all troubled. 73. He thinks sometimes God hath no Mercy for him, and yet resolves to die in the pursuit of it. 74. He believes like <hi>Abraham</hi> in Hope, and against Hope: And tho he can never answer God's Logick, yet with the Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> he hopes to prevail with the Rhetorick of Importunity. 75. He wrestles with God and prevails; and tho yielding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unworthy the least Blessing he enjoys already, yet <hi>Jacob-</hi>like, will not let God go without a new Blessing. 76. He sometimes thinks himself to have no Grace at all, and yet how poor and afflicted soever he be besides, he would not change Conditions with the most prosperous upon Earth that is a manifest Worldling. 77. He thinks sometimes the Ordinances of God do him no good at all, and yet he would rather part with his Life than be deprived of them. 78. He was born dead, and yet so, as it had been Murder to have taken his Life away. 79. When Life was first put into him, is commonly unknown; and with some, not until they had learned to speak, and were even grown up to the stature of a Man; and with others, not till they were ready to drop into their Graves for age. 80. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:94224:220"/>
he begins to live he is ever dying; and tho he have an eternal Life begun in him, yet he makes account he hath a Death to pass through. 81. He counts Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murder a most heinous Sin, yet he is continually busied in crucifying his Flesh, and putting to Death his earthly Members. 82. He believes that his Soul and Body shall be as full of Glory as theirs that have more, and not more full than theirs that have less. 83. He lives invisibly to those that see him, and those that know him best do but guess at him; yet they sometimes see further into him, and judg more truly of him than himself doth. 84. The World did sometimes count him a Saint, when God counted him an Hypocrite; and after, when the World branded him for an Hypocrite, God owned him for a Saint. 85. In fine, his Death makes not an end of him; his Soul which was created for his Body, and is not to be perfected without his Body, is more happy when it is separated from it, than it was all the while it was united to it; and his Body, tho torn in pieces, burnt to Ashes, ground to Powder, turned into Rottenness, shall be no loser. His <hi>Advocate,</hi> his <hi>Surety</hi> shall be his <hi>Judg,</hi> his mortal part shall become immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and what was sown in Corruption shall be raised in Incorruption and Glory; and his spiritual part, tho it had a beginning shall have no end, and himself a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Creature shall be possessed of an infinite Happiness. <hi>Amen.</hi> Mr. <hi>Herbert Palmer</hi> B. D. Master of <hi>Queen's College, Cambridg, in his Memorials of Godliness and Christianity,</hi> p. 53, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> lays down, not only as the Trial and Exercise of a Christian's Faith, but also the Support and Evidence thereof, as being the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and Marrow of his practical walking and conversing together with that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which arises therefrom with God, and also his Conversation in and with the World, is that, as being Paradoxisms or Contradictions to Flesh and Blood, for which the Papist as such, Baxterian as such, and Quaker as such, do therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, yea vilify with Scorn. Thus what Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> and all other Believers took and take to have been and to be the Glory of God's Covenant Dispensatiòn in all Generations more or less towards his People as including therein the very Mystery of Godliness, and the secret Testimony of his distinguishing Love towards them, they convert into the black Characters of Absurdities, Irrationalities, the Spring and Principle of all Licentiousness, the Test and Evidence of Antinomianism, and in sum the very Farrago of mysterious Nonsense, as our Pseudo-reverend Author <hi>D. Williams</hi> terms it, in that most famously infamous last piece of his that I have seen, which prefac'd the Report of his late Neonomian Virtues, Prerequisites and Qualifications unto his Country and Countrymen. Whence let me tell thee, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, had the Orthodox Presbyterian Party but dealt with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and strenuously, openly and nakedly, without soothing and self-exalting Phrases and Titles, which tended but to puff him up, whose Doctrines were most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disapproved and abhorred by them, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> has done with Mr. <hi>John Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> in his Treatise of Perseverance, and that notwithstanding his congregational disciplinary Judgment, whereof as I am informed he was as to Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this Baxterian Divinity with its speckled Wings, possibly <hi>ad captum huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> would not have dilated it self, so to the impoisoning of the Nation, heartning and hardning of our Enemies [from whose Tents we have lately heard his accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory Commendation resounding] and sadning of the Hearts of many thousands in our <hi>Israel,</hi> if not to the distracting of the Minds and Spirits of many upright, plain and simple hearted ones, as it is to be feared it has done.—But <hi>tho Offences
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:94224:221"/>
must come, yet wo will be to them through whom they do come.</hi>—But before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to obviate the measures of some, who through Ignorance of Mind, or Supine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Spirit, or especially Heart-craftiness and practical Deceitfulness of such, who holding the Truth in Unrighteousness, may insinuate that these Authors above mentioned are wronged by discerpting Sentences, or by dwelling upon some casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inadvertent Expressions of theirs, let such know that I am ready (God assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to make it evidently appear that the whole scope and tendency of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity in the full Body and Substance thereof, is to evert the whole Mass of the Protestant Christian Religion as epitomiz'd in the nine Heads of the Introduction; and for this end let but the industrious and judicious Reader take but the fairest and most seemingly orthodox of their Notions, and trace it faithfully up unto its radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spring, Origin and Dependance, as held by themselves, still pursuing it to its designed Station and Office, together with the practical Use and inferential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences and Effects thereof upon the Minds of the Children of Men; and without either the help of a precarious Subscription, or the lifeless Engine of artificial Heads of Union, I question not in the least the Coalescency of his Judgment with me herein; for Persons and their Profession are not to be determined upon, either as to their Orthodoxy or Sincerity upon occasional Excursions that may drop either from their Pens or Mouths, or Failures in walking, but by the Scope of the one, and the Course of the other, which is to be attended unto, if ever we would make a right Judgment concerning them. And tho some amongst us begin to alleviate the force of former Charges, and the suspectedly foreseen present ones against the Baxterian Doctrine, by saying that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Errors were but of late, and the Offspring of his Dotage, yet if this be the Rule that even his own Friends and Well-wishers would have us follow in our Determination of his Ability in things of this nature, especially comparing his former Works with his later, together with the same Oppositions made then unto them by eminent and orthodox Writers, and what has been of late also done by others, I must needs say by Consequence that he never was in the things of Religion truly a <hi>compos mentis</hi> one; for his <hi>end of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal Controversies</hi> is but an Abridgment of his <hi>Methodus Theologiae,</hi> and his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate of Justification</hi> but a Transcript of his <hi>Life of Faith,</hi> together with the grounds upon which the whole, or at leastwise the main part of his <hi>Saints ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Rest</hi> does depend, and all this weighed with the early opposition he made unto Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> because of the Truths that he held, as may be seen in the Doctor's Appendix unto his Treatise against Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> that rank <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphite.</hi> You will never come thorowly to apprehend some Authors <hi>(as one well observes)</hi> so much by what they hold, as by what they oppose. Therefore to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the fond Conceptions that some have entertained, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodoxy should arise from a crazed Superannuatedness, let the Reader have his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course unto the close of his Preface unto his Breviate of Justification; his Words are, <q>This Week an honest, judicious, moderate Friend (that is more a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter than a Dissenter, as far as I can judg, sent me the Notes which I answer in the latter end, as partly his own and partly others, which (not as opposing them, but as tending to elucidate the whole Cause) I here adjoin, tho all or most here said, is said elsewhere before <hi>[Mark that Reader]</hi> which I mention, lest you think that I took all for his own Opinion which he cited out of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> who himself reformed much of his former Judgment about Doctrine and Government before he died.</q>—Now for my share I cannot guess or imagine
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:94224:221"/>
upon what account it is that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> so confidently asserts <hi>this</hi> of the <hi>Doctor,</hi> unless it be from a surreptitiously designed affixing of a Preface of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s to Mr. <hi>Samuel Clark</hi>'s Annotations upon the New Testament, which in the Doctrine of Justification absolutely lie opposite unto, nay fundamentally evert all the Doctor's Pleadings and Arguments for the same, in the whole Course of his Controversies upon that Point. Now compare what the Doctor is brought in to say for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, with the Exposition it self of those Places especially that treat of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as <hi>Rom. 10. 3, 4. Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. together with Mr. <hi>Clark</hi>'s References therein unto other places: <q>It may not be expected that I should be able to pass any judgment on all the particular Expositions of all places which he gives; but this I must say, that to the best of my Understanding, he <hi>(viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Clark)</hi> has made his choice of the especial Sense which he gives of the Word in all places, with great Diligence and Judgment. And it is evident that in the whole, he has so carefully and constantly attended unto the Analogy of Faith, as that the Reader may safely trust to him, without fear of being led into the Snare of any Error or unsound Opinion.</q>—Now, I say, compare this with the Annotations as to the above-mentioned Places in Scripture, and thou wilt find that in the matter of Justification, it is neither more nor less than what both the Papist, Baxterian, and Quaker do hold; but that there was a Craft in it, <hi>(according to the subtle prevaricating Practices of these Men)</hi> appears from the date of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s and that of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Preface unto the same, the former's being in <hi>Febr.</hi> 14. 1682/3. and the latter's in <hi>Aug.</hi> 22. 1683. Now whatever Annotations were put into the <hi>Doctor's</hi> hands I know not, but I dare be confident he never did knowingly recommend these to the Reader. For do but bring the Doctor's Expositions of those places in Scripture, which refer unto a Righteousness for Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and sute them with Mr. <hi>Clark</hi>'s <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the very self-same Texts, and thou wilt find their Consonancy therein to be as much as is between God and the Devil, Christ and Antichrist, Heaven and Hell, Light and Darkness, Grace and Sin, yea Salvation and Damnation; and that the Difference does not lie only in Words, as some confidently assert, but in their essential Nature, formal Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, together with that Use and Tendency that a Believer ought by Faith to make an Improvement of, in his non-peradventure-Walkings with God. Now can it be supposed that the Doctor would say, that Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> in his Annotations did <hi>so carefully and constantly attend unto the Analogy of Faith, as that the Reader may safely trust to him, without fear of being led into the Snare of any Error or unsound Opinion;</hi> I say, can this be said of him in reference to the Doctrine of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who elsewhere speaks of such that had imbraced the same, in Mr. <hi>Clark</hi>'s own verbal Sense, That <hi>if our Gospel be hid, it is hid unto them that are lost?

And herein I must give the Reader a Caution against their subtle Proceedings; for amongst us here they have been long since and of late, under a pretence of Charity unto Souls, a dispersing their rotten Authors by way of free Gift, and partly through the hands of some inadvertent upright ones, both in <hi>London</hi> and in the Country, have endeavoured the same, yet through Mercy in some measure prevented, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

and too much effectually by those who have discovered their Rottenness in, or at least their Indifferency for the Truth, in their warping from or lukewarm Unconcernedness for the same.

            <p>Now let any one of a common competent Judgment <hi>(but ordinarily conversant with Dr.</hi> Owen'<hi>s Writings)</hi> speak, whether he can suppose that such an one's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to Mr. <hi>Clark</hi>'s Annotations was honestly or justly obtained, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether he that had pleaded so often, so excellently, and so indefatigably against this <hi>Papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Baxterian</hi> and <hi>Quakeristical</hi> way of Justification, both as to its Matter and Form, should be induced, tho but upon a transient or cursory Perusal <hi>(especially considering his Aptitude and Skill in things of this nature)</hi> of the said Annotations, to recommend them as being safe and sound unto the Reader's view, which is that he calls <hi>ut supra,</hi> no less than the Foundation of Papacy, is that which I highly question, as also that Preface of his prefixed unto Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi>'s piece against Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> and that for several Reasons which may be produced if occasion offer it self. But this is the manner of them, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his Appendix unto his <hi>Salus Electorum, &amp;c.</hi> takes notice of, how some had abused Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi>'s <hi>Imprimatur</hi> unto some of Mr. <hi>Joshua Sprigg</hi>'s Works, which were passable by affixing it unto others of the same Author which were fulsom and rotten, <hi>p.</hi> 329. 330.</p>
            <p>Now this Annotator may boast of his Attainments in procuring Prefaces to shelter himself in, as a manumissive <hi>Imprimatur</hi> from two of so different a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Doctrine of Justification as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> were, as he who in the Parliament time thought to secure himself from the Distast and Violence that might arise from his adhering unto either one or the other of the both Parties concerned in those civil Broils, who meeting with one that had loaded both his Shoulders with a parcel of Puddings to make his test of Persons thereby, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first he met with, <hi>who he was for?</hi> replyed, for the King: upon which he told him he was an honest fellow, and gave him one; the next he met with upon the same question put to him, answered, he was for the Parliament, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon received the same Character and Pudding-reward; but this same third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on, in a pursuit of the same question put unto him, said he was both for King and Parliament, which procured him the Honour of being a cunning Knave, and the reward of a <hi>couple</hi> of Puddings to boot.</p>
            <p>Note, <hi>Reader,</hi> That as a Believer's Life and Conversation in the distinct, sincere, and analogical Lines thereof, is an exact <hi>Acrostick</hi> and Propension drawn from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Letter in the Name, Person, and Offices of Jesus Christ, and Attributes of God in him, as so many Beams coming forth and shining thorow him, as <hi>the Son of Righteousness,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 2, 3. <hi>Ye are our Epistle writton in our Hearts, known and read of all Men.

But we all with open face beholding as in a Glass the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> So in his very Heart and Nature, as well as personal Covenant Station before the Lord, he is but one interwoven <hi>Anagram</hi> with him, either as to the Justification of him, in the latter Sense, by a bare imputed, yet real tho external Righteousness; and also Qualification of the former, <hi>i. e. his Nature,</hi> in its assimilative Principle or Seed, Disposition and material effects, and that by Creation thorow Infusion and Renovation, which we call Regeneration. In the one respect he is <hi>the Lord our Righteousness, and he shall be called the Lord our Righteousness,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. ch. 33. 16. This refers to their <hi>personal Justification,</hi> or legal and actually federal Union with Jesus Christ. In the other respect, he is our <hi>Sanctification</hi> or Holiness, and they are his also: 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is</hi> made unto us—<hi>Sanctification</hi>—compare with <hi>Isa. 62. 9. But they that have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, shall eat it, and praise the Lord; and they that have brought it together, shall drink it in the</hi> Courts <hi>of</hi> my Holiness, <hi>ch. 63. 18. The</hi> People <hi>of</hi> thy Holiness <hi>have possessed it but a little while</hi>—which bespeaks and imports a likeness of Nature unto him, from its Spring and Effects: 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 17. He that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit:</hi> compare with 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 4. whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promises, that by those ye might be</hi> Partakers <hi>of the</hi> divine Nature—. <hi>Herein</hi> lies not only the Mystery of divine Wisdom in contriving or forecasting, but also the subjective distinct personal matter of that Mystery in the conjoint mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual respective Interest that fall in betwixt Christ and his Members, whereby they become in time [as arising from an eternal, solidly stated Fountain in and with him, and God through him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 15, 16.] one compleat, actual and visibly mystical Body with him as their Head: 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 12. For as the Body is one, and hath many Members, and all the Members of that one Body, being many, are one Body: so also is Christ.</hi> Compare <hi>Eph. 1. 22, 23. And hath put all things under his Feet, and gave him to be the</hi> Head <hi>over all things to the</hi> Church, <hi>which is his Body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</hi> Ch. 4. 12, 13, 15, 16. <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body</hi> of Christ, <hi>till we all come in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledg of the Son of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> a perfect Man, <hi>unto the measure of the</hi> Stature <hi>of the</hi> Fulness <hi>of Christ. But speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth in Love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the</hi> Head, <hi>even Christ,—from whom</hi> the whole Body <hi>fitly joined together and compacted by that which every Joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the Body, unto the edifying of it self in Love.</hi> Thus in an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crostick</hi> Sense, Christ is the Spring, Fountain-head, or communicative Root of the Regeneration and Sanctification of the Church, together with the Image of Christ, who is the express Character of the Father, arising from the same, whence she is said to be begotten after the likeness of God. Thus also in an <hi>Anagrammatical</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, by a Transposition of Letters, their mutual personal Covenant-Station and commutative Charge of Sin and Righteousness is held forth, and their external and legally stated relation unto each other in one mystical Body, whereof he is the Head, and she in him as her representative Head covered with the Robe of his Righteousness for her Justification; whence it is said that she is built upon a Rock, put into a Cleft thereof, the Lord her Pavilion, Covering and Ark; and in both these this great Mystery is typified by <hi>Eve</hi>'s being taken out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s side, so
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:94224:224"/>
the Church is look'd upon as taken out of the Side of Christ even by Blood and Water, which the Spirit testifies unto, in the Hearts of Believers; 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 8.</p>
            <p>The whole of this, as to the main Bulk thereof, might be further illustrated from <hi>Solomon</hi> in his judicial Proceedings with the two Harlots, who was at least therein an <hi>allusive</hi> Type of Christ, and that in the divine Attribute of his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which typical relation the said <hi>Solomon</hi> more especially manifested in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercititious and discriminative Discovery thereof, by the manner of his Progress in Judgment concerning the Infant, about whom the Contest grew between the two Harlots, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether of them both had, for none but one could have a just Propriety in him: this he decided from their own Mouths, and formed the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium</hi> of his Sentence in his Determination of the Matter under Debate from their own Pleadings, Resolutions and Conclusions, namely, that she and only she, must of natural and moral, and consequently legal necessity, be reckoned upon as the true Mother of the Child, who would rather part with him entirely, together with all her Interest in him, <hi>unless she had him both whole and alive.</hi> Thus it will go with all the Professors of Christianity sooner or later; for each Party crys out, lo here, lo there is Christ, we are the Temple, Church, and Reformation in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, not so much espousing Christ and his Interest in the whole Substance and living Efficacy thereof, as seeking by what they partially and remotely own of him, that he therefore should espouse them, their Cause, Interest and Faction, or humanely compacted Designs, together with their worldly, carnal, self-justiciary, and prerequisite Reserves therein: this is the very shelter of <hi>Paganism</hi> in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> which if once removed, would soon appear in its proper Colours, the wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Umbrage of Superstition, and the vertiginous Lethargy that hath beset and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen too many Churches that pretend highly to Reformation this day, namely the adapting of scriptural Names and Terms to either Persons wholly ignorant of the same, or to things that have no Affinity indeed with, but are utterly foreign unto them. But Christ will not be so served by Men, no more than <hi>Solomon</hi> his Type would be gull'd by the bold and yet false Pretences of the Harlot; for the Apostle is expresly distinct in both these, that it is a <hi>whole</hi> and a <hi>living</hi> Christ, for the ends designed of God in order unto Salvation, we must attend unto, <hi>i. e.</hi> a whole Christ for Righteousness as personally wrought out by him in his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the preceptive and sanction part of the moral Law excluding all other predisposing and subordinate Righteousness to Justification, and a living Christ, or Christ dwelling in the Soul by his Spirit, Word and Grace, for Regeneration unto Sanctification: <hi>Acts 13. 38, 39. Rom. 10. 4. 1 Cor. 1. 30. ch. 15. 55. Gal. 5. 2. ch. 4. 19. ch. 2. 20. Acts 5. 31. Phil. 1. 21. Col.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
            <p>Study but the Arguments of our <hi>old Reformers</hi> against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in vindication of their Separation from her, together with their distinct Pleadings in subserviency unto the same, in several <hi>polemical</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> Treatises of theirs, as also their present Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> those of <hi>Lambeth</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> for the Doctrines of Justification and Regeneration both as to Matter, Order and Use, and thou wilt soon find not only what ground the Enemy has got upon us in our too apparent Apostacy in the general from the Truth and Zeal for it, but also his Subtilty to return upon us by a parcel of new Schematists through the Trap-door of a seeming Nonconformity.

And because ye are Sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</hi> And notwithstanding their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Acts of Rebellion, this relation between God and his adopted ones, which is a legal choice, tho originated in Grace, of them in Christ, they being adoptedly chosen in him by the Father, and upon the valuable Considerations of Christ's standing in their room and stead in the Transactions between the Father and the Son, this as commencing from Eternity will also terminate in Eternity; yet he knows how and when to make of an unwilling a willing People, and in pursuance of this their Privilege Christ, like the good Shepherd, will not lose one of them, but rather than fail in bringing any of them unto an actual Fruition of the Benefits of so distinguishing a State, he will drive them gently, bear them up in his Arms, yea carry them upon his Shoulders, and protect them, as he has done in all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, against all the liers in wait, ravening Wolves, and deceitful Teachers, that would rob or befool them of so inestimable a Treasure and Inheritance.

Separate any one of these Heads from the rest of them, either in their direct lineal Dependance each upon other, or their opposite and yet mutual Covenant Station by way of Commutation, as they irreversibly stand related the one of the other, and that both in a civil and spiritual Acceptation, and you will soon overthrow the very grounds of Justice in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For Justice has no regard in this case, to either a Love or Hatred of any Person, but puts <hi>that</hi> Law in execution against such who are charg'd with the matter of the Breach thereof; otherwise how shall it pass sentence? or upon whom? what must be the Rule of its Proceedings herein? and what is the Punishment it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns unto? since do but take a Sinner by Imputation, and if he do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and undergo personally and identically the same, that the real Criminal in his own Person lies obnoxious unto, what does he do for him? But say they, by his Obedience to a peculiar mediatorial Law, an equipollent Satisfaction is provided; but this is no proper Satisfaction unto either a broken peculiar Law, or injured Justice, but an ungrounded hellish vacating of the one, and an impudent bribing of the other. And do but observe those that are, either wholly or partially, or hesitantly against this undeniable and fundamental Truth of a Transimputation of Sin and Righteousness, and you will find that at the very bottom of such a Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al there lies à secret rejection of both Covenants indeed, properly such in their genuine nature or kind, as originated in a personal Contract with others in and by one peculiar personal Head. As that the Covenant of Works is not a peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moral Covenant, so as to include in its preceptive Prohibition given of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Adam,</hi> in that particular or singular Restriction of his, <hi>viz. not to eat of such a Tree,</hi> or <hi>he should die,</hi> even that very Obedience of his, and all his Posterity in him, as had a relation to that Law afterwards held forth in its literal Edition, Discovery, and Promulgation in the Decalogue or ten Commandments, but that it is some peculiar and entire in it self Law of Innocency, which indeed is in the design thereof by these Men but a mere diverting blind; for tho it is true, that the Covenant of Works was made with <hi>Adam</hi> when in a State of Innocency, but that the Law whereon this Covenant was founded, respected only <hi>Adam,</hi> and merely that Tree, and not the whole of pure Mankind in him, and the Perfection of their nature in him also, which is the Original of what was afterwards at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> given forth but in Words, tho in Power, and formerly concreated with him, is a damnable Heresy, striking at the principal Engagement of Christ in the Covenant of Grace as the representative Head of all the Elect of God in him, and therein: wherefore it is that they conceive it as impossible that we should have a relation unto <hi>Adam</hi> in a federal Sense, as his Covenant respects the moral Law, or the Law that was concreated with his nature, that that was not the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and Bounds of God's Covenant with him, as comprehended within that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical Prohibition of God, but a certain Law of Innocency peculiar unto himself, upon the breach whereof he so discomposed the Faculties of his Soul, and defati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the Members of his Body, that all his Posterity as begotten by and spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:94224:225"/>
from such a corrupt Fountain, must be defiled and depraved thereby; but what is all this to the purpose? Reader, do but narrowly observe it, and thou wilt soon find both the Weakness and Treachery of such a Sentiment: its Weakness will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from hence, that if <hi>Adam</hi>'s Perfection in a State of Innocency lay in the suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly created frame of his Spirit unto that Law, which was the Substance of that Covenant, then the Rebellion that seized his Person upon the breach of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Law thereof, must be the same which he transferred unto all descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him. But the Law of Innocency, as they say, being a Law peculiar unto <hi>Adam,</hi> as not having any reference unto the moral Law, against which it is that an obstinate Enmity, the very Minds of all his Posterity are naturally and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly set, was that only Law which <hi>Adam</hi> broke, and therefore must of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence infuse into his succeeding Generation a Nature depraved by his breach of a Law peculiar unto himself, as carries in them a rebellious Frame against such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law, that <hi>Adam</hi> never broke, heard of, was made under or conformable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. This seems strange that a corrupted Spring should immit into its Streams that Corruption which it never was tainted with: Its Treachery lies in this, that if it be granted that <hi>Adam</hi>'s breach of the Covenant of Works lay in a breach of the moral Law, even by that his single Act of Transgression, then all his Posterity, as covenanted with in him, must fall under that Charge, being born under that Covenant and Law, and not under an universal Law, as a Covenant of Grace, which they would intrude upon us from the former Supposition: and hence they know that Righteousness unto Justification out of this State of Condemnation must spring from the Obedience of one who is able to perform it, unto that very Law which the Elect in <hi>Adam</hi> had personally, by way of Federacy, broken; which, I say, if once admitted of, as they well perceive, would totally overthrow them and their Cause: but the fifth Chapter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as well as other innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable places in Scripture, will so stick in their Teeth and Consciences, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them uneasy in their pretended Peace, as the fifty third Chapter of <hi>Isaiah</hi> did that Jew, who said he could deal well enough with the Christians, if it were but expunged the Scripture. The sum and substance whereof in short is this; That to remove and destroy any Thoughts of a real and forensick Act of God in Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Justification by Sin and Righteousness in an external material Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either the one or the other, they labour to prove <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant to have a Law peculiar unto himself, and that Christ carries on the execution of his Trust in the Covenant of Grace, by fulfilling a Law proper unto himself, in which his People have no concern any further than that by the meritorious Effects thereof they are justified by the Law of Faith, or the Righteousness of Regeneration; and thus they blind their Readers, dealing with them as <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was used, first had his eyes put out, and then was led Captive to <hi>Babylon;</hi> so that the moral Law betwixt these two peculiar Laws of both <hi>Adams,</hi> like a Dish between two Joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stools, falls to the ground, whilst he that is saved gets to Heaven by some geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical <hi>hocus-pocus</hi> Conditions; and he that is damned, is damned with saving Grace, and for want of an improvement of it.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that so many blundering Hurricanes issue forth in their absurd and hellish Consequences from the <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Tents, as of old roaring in the midst of the Congregations, and thereby setting up their Ensigns as evident To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and Signs of their Purposes, that with the Axes and Hammers of their carnal tho but forced Arguments and Reasonings, would break down the carved Work
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:94224:226"/>
of the Temple, even the stated Effects of an infinite contriving Wisdom, running through the whole of the Covenant of Grace, and that as equally respecting in the full Dimensions thereof, the Glory of an unspeakable righteous God and holy Law, as well as the Safety and Salvation of a wretched Sinner; <hi>Psal. 74. 4, 5, 6, 7. Eph. 3. 8, 9, 10, 11. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 29, 30, 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arminianism</hi> and <hi>Socinianism</hi> are the two grand Pillars upon which the Gates of Hell it self in its Power and Policy do hang and turn, and <hi>into which,</hi> as originated in them alone, every individual, scattered, and less apparent, as well as more discernedly open Heresy, maugre all the Subterfuges that Men betake themselves unto, will one day be resolved and cast: for they are so much the harder to be rooted our of the Nature of Man, by how much if we consider, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created with him, not only as an Appendix unto his State of Innocency, but as part of his Perfection therein; and tho the terms of <hi>Arminianism</hi> and <hi>Socinianism</hi> were not then in being, yet the Substance and Matter of them, not as a Sin, but federal Qualification in a positive and negative Sense, was both then and there.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Arminianism</hi> was the positive Perfection of <hi>Adam</hi> in his State of Innocency: for tho it was of mere Grace that the infinite God and Creator of a Worm should condescend to enter into Covenant immediately with such an one, but yet to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate him to answer the future Conditions thereof, with a Power of Volibility, was no small addition unto this Grace; nay it was the very Beauty of his Creation, as to his federal Station, that God did not only lay before him a Covenant, and offer'd, yea did enter into the same with him, but adapted his Nature with a Principle of Possibility to close with, and answer it in the Ends and Demands thereof: This self-Power in him, I say, as arising from his created Ability to do the Will of God, no Man can say was his Sin, tho his Forfeiture of it was; but for any one to hold, that it is there since the Fall, where it is not, or that it is in any of the Posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> either by Nature or common and universal Grace, is in plain terms to give both God and his Word the Lie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Socinianism,</hi> passively considered, was part of this Perfection in <hi>Adam</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent State or Condition, and that in a negative or indirect Acceptation. For that God essentially so, should in the Person of the Son, assume our Nature into Union with himself, for the ends for which it was to be assumed, would not only have been unnatural and nauseous unto the Sanity of his Reason in such a State, wherein the whole of his Faculties, as suted unto the Tenure of that Covenant, he was then under, did lie, but obstructive of its Perfection (being a spiritual Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and not congenial with his natural Light and Knowledg in the very Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Kind of it) in that Obedience he was to give unto, and thereupon his Fellowship with God raising in him a Rivalship of Headship-Emulation, and such Distractions of Mind as would have been wholly inconsistent with, yea resistent of that calm State and Frame he was in, by which he was fitted for his Duty; for his Reason, tho wholly and compleatly so, would have been darkned and disturbed rather than refreshed and strengthned, in its proper and limited Service, by such a Knowledg that was neither the Spring, Exercise or Ends of the same; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as great an Imperfection in an useless, supererogative Superfluity of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, as there is in a defect of that which is true, God neither creating nor reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing in vain.</p>
            <p>This double-branch'd Perfection in <hi>Adam</hi> is that which Man naturally inclines unto; for Nature as such, not as defiled, would from its own Propensity return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:94224:226"/>
it self for Refuge, upon this or the other emergent appearance of an onset or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and from thence produces all those seemingly rational and plausible Arguments against the divine Mysteries of the Covenant of Grace. Nay, let me further add, The most virulent and deceitful Oppositions that have ever assaulted the Church in perverting, polluting, and undermining the very Foundation of the Gospel it self, have sprung from this bottom, even from this propense Innateness in Man to arm himself from those remaining Sparks of these primitive Principles of Reason, against the same; and tho these were once the sanctified, preparative Qualifications of <hi>Adam</hi> unto his Obedience in the Nature of it, and as adequated unto the <hi>then</hi> Covenant: but now to revive that which was a Perfection in its Place and Office then, is to turn out the Covenant of Grace, and to reintroduce <hi>that</hi> of Works in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the room of the same. Hence it is that the Faith and Obedience of the first Covenant may be called <hi>natural,</hi> and that of the second <hi>supernatural,</hi> as springing from the different Heads of each Covenant; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. not that it was natural to <hi>Adam</hi> as a <hi>rational</hi> Creature, <hi>i. e.</hi> that I mean barely as such: but,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is natural as concreated with him, for upon his very <hi>Being</hi> in Nature it was natural with <hi>that</hi> Being; and therefore unrenewed Nature unto this very day, as we find it, upon all Convictions even to those of a Death-bed Relation, retires for its Peace unto <hi>this</hi> conditional Prerequisite, tho still owning of Christ, yet that is no farther than as Sin and Guilt pursues the said Convictions, and impeaches the Soul of an Imperfection, that therefrom attends the best of its Duties; so that it is a Covenant of Works they would be justified and acquitted by, tho by a Covenant of Grace Christ is relied upon as a meritorious Introducer of such a Covenant of Works, as to their Failures therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is natural, as suted to or connatural with the Covenant he was to be brought under, wherein the Goodness of God towards the perfecting of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in such a State doth appear, otherwise he could not have been a Subject capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being covenanted with, not purely as to his rational Faculties, nakedly considered as such, for therein he might have had a perfect Creation in Essence, and yet have been an utter Stranger to the Faith of that Covenant; for God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Faith, or no Obedience can properly be given unto him, or accepted of by him; and sutable to the Covenant we are under or taken into, such will our Faith be. This is comprehended in the above recited bold Assertion of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Method. Theol.</hi> Part 3. p. 307. <hi>In quantum sincerè obediens, &amp;c. As far as any one is sincerely obedient, so far he sinneth not; and as far as he sinneth not, so far he neither needs nor is capable of Remission. Therefore Christ's Righteousness so far is not imputed unto him for Remission.</hi> Two things exceedingly gravel them in this Point, 1. That an inherent Holiness, tho it should be entirely perfect both as to kind and degrees in this World, as truly as it is compleatly consummated without spot in Glory hereafter, yet that none of this either in part or in whole, in this or the World to come, is the Ground-matter, Form or Motive on which it is that God proceeds in the personal Justification of a Sinner. 2. That therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Maxim, If there be Sincerity in our Obedience, which of course must take in the whole of the Principle and Fruits of the new Creature in Disposition and Practice, whence then needs there a Christ, Remission of Sins by him, or a personal Justification <hi>in</hi> his, that is, Christ's <hi>own</hi> Righteousness before God? Whereas Christ is called the Door, or the Entrance into a certain Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:94224:227"/>
now a Door or our passing through it into an House, does not give us a Title unto the House (it and all that belongs unto it is either ours before, or upon what grounds may we determine them so to be?) but it makes way without any legal Obstructions to take a free and full possession of that which was of Right as well as of Grace or Gift our own before: from whence these Questions will follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether a Believer in this his sinful mortal State stands justified before God in a Righteousness exactly corresponding both in Kind, Parts and Degrees with his own, <hi>i. e.</hi> God's Righteousness, and that in the infinite as well as unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nature thereof, according to the Revelation he has made of the same in the whole of his Law towards Mankind in general, and which remains upon them as such, wholly and unabrogated? For this is that Righteousness of God which the Scripture speaks of; we know of no other than even that which is of the Law, that self-same Righteousness delivered at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the same in the Kernel thereof that <hi>Adam</hi> received. This is that Righteousness which is materially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed of God unto the Justification or Condemnation of a Sinner, in the former Acceptation by a representative Head, High Priest and Sacrifice wrought out for Salvation; in the latter by an immediate Discovery of the same, and charge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as to its Demands between God and the Sinner, without any Vacation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of it, either to save or condemn by any intermediate and alleviating Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Whether this Righteousness becomes the believing Sinners Righteousness <hi>for</hi> Faith, or whether it was not his before he believed, whereupon it was given unto him to believe, and that by Faith he receives it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Whether the principal Design as part of the proper and chief Nature of Faith, is to justify it self as a subjective Grace, or the Person in whom it is, and that from its renewing effects, tho taking in the Merits of another in subserviency unto the same; or whether it does not lead forth the Soul in all its regenerated Parts [nothing else but as such of Man being able to follow it] to rely upon a Righteousness in the full essential matter of the same wholly from without it self, to stand in, as in a Robe or Garment, for its truly and unquestionably justified State before God? From all which I would advise the Reader to be much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with his own Heart, and therein that he be not a Stranger unto the true Nature and Method of the Oppositions the unregenerate Part within him makes unto the genuine Workings of the Spirit in the new Creature: for his, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit's special Office and Engagement is to take of the Truth as it is in Jesus, and shew it unto such where he is at work; and accordingly and therefrom as sutable unto such a discovery does he form and carry on the new Birth in the Soul; <hi>John 16. 13, 14. Eph. 4. 21. Gal.</hi> 3. that Chapter throughout, compare with <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 19. This treble Advantage will arise therefrom, besides various other of its concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Appendixes, as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou wilt thereby come to understand the Secret of God's Covenant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in and emerging it self by that little Spring-head Appearance thereof in the first Promise (which must conjointly respect the same Law that was broken in Paradise, with what was afterwards decaloguised in the ten Commandments; or for what was it or any other Promise given, if it does not extend it self to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Sinner from the damning charge of any Law?) made unto our federal, fallen representative Head, the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and dilating it self thereby in the wide Rivers of several more extensive, expatiated, enlarged and repeated Promises,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:94224:227"/>
till it issue, as we find all along in the Scripture, in the divine, immense, unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomable, and boundless Ocean of eternal, infinite, and unspeakably efficacious Love, Wisdom, Grace and Power, and all this as centring the Soul with God in Christ; for put case thou wert brought into the very Perfection of <hi>Adam</hi>'s State before the Fall, yet even therein thou wouldst be in the very Frame and Set-form of thy Spirit, an absolute Stranger, yea an entire Enemy unto this Covenant: Therefore it is not purely thy debauched or immoral Part, properly such, from which Reason it self, or the Light of Nature calls for a Reformation, but thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, reformed, and more moralized Acquirements that will appear to be the greatest Obstructer, if rested in, of thy discerning into and adhering unto this great Mystery. This is abundantly testified unto throughout the four Evangelists by those that came unto Christ and those that refused him, together with the terms upon which both the one and the other were so moved to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou wilt know thereby how to discern into and dispute against the very Strength and Policy of all thine Adversaries, or the Enemies of the Truth, and also be made capable from thine own inward Experience in this thy Christian War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare to engage and with Success to encounter them not only in their gross Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto Truth in the Body of it, but also in every part thereof, and that as to the crafty, more minute, particular, and more latent Method they take to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the same: for any Argument against the Truth, tho never so artificially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven, is but the Fruit of Unbelief's Dexterity, which cannot be opposed but by Faith, and the more observantly and exactly thou dost, through the Grace of God, discern its being conquered by Faith in thy self, the more arm'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd thou wilt be to defeat the external Onsets thereof from others. And indeed all the Enforcements and seemingly strong Arguments that are brought forth, even at this day, against the Truth, are but the Issues of refined Reason, and that as bearing a relation unto the first Covenant-Constitution; but as they oppose the Mysteries of the second Covenant-Frame, they are but the pure, genuine, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Offspring of a reigning Unbelief.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thou wilt be the more enabled thereby to teach and to strengthen others, and to become a Glory therein unto God in thy Generation, as holding forth in thy Spirit and Conversation the whole of this Covenant, and therein the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God himself, [whereof his Image does consist] as graphically impressed, and distinctly characterized upon the Faculties of thy Soul; whereby thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comest the living Epistle of Jesus Christ seen and read of all Men, to the utter confounding of those that would asperse the Doctrines of the said Covenant, as an inlet unto Licentiousness, and a judicial walking and practical Testimony against such, who whilst they are loading the same with such lying Calumnies, and putid Reproaches, yet indeed in the carnal Frame of their Spirits, a deceitful Method in their Treatises, and wretched loosness in their Lives and Practices (far incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with that Holiness they seem to cry up, to the everting of it in its Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or continued Spring, Matter and Effects, as to the Reality of the same) they visibly, as a just Judgment from God upon them, fall into that Dirt together with their Doctrines, that they would cast upon others and the Truth withal. Whence weigh but these following Questions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether the blessed Jesus, God-man, stands differently [tho not in the least separately from] related unto his Church, as <hi>representative</hi> Head thereof, from what he does as Mediator?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:94224:228"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Whether the State of a Man's Person in God's Act of Justification takes not place in a <hi>legal</hi> way of Precedency of that Act of his, in Sanctification, or the Renovation of our Natures, either in part or in whole?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Whether the Righteousness of Justification be the same either materially or personally, and for the same Uses with that Righteousness which flows from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, Renovation and Sanctification?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 4. How is it that we come to know this our justified State, and whether we lose it or no, and that upon what grounds as to the original, meritorious, mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, efficient, and (as some say) transformingly effectual Causes thereof, both in their Order and subservient Dependance upon each other, and that as irreversibly stated by an everlasting Covenant; and what thereupon are the Reasons we have to conclude our Interest therein, in this our supposed Knowledg of the same? If these three Heads be but distinctly handled, and genuinely attended unto, we shall find this our <hi>Neonomian</hi> or <hi>Baxterian</hi> Body of Divinity, to prove but a mere <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>'s Image, whose first appearance or uppermost Manifestation is like fine Gold, and yet by attending upon it, as we see, waxes worse and worse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending still into baser and baser Metals, till the whole Fabrick thereof, even to its Foundation, issue in a rotten, commixed, deceitful and Soul-destructive Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destal, undermined, broken and shattered to pieces by one Stone cut out without hands, or that little Worm <hi>Jacob</hi> corroding into the very Bowels and Vitals of this <hi>Babylonish</hi> Dragon.</p>
            <p>So that would but these our Adversaries fairly and above board argue the Points under present Consideration, and that from Scripture and Reason, so far as the latter is capable of being a faithful Handmaid unto the former, and that without a discerpted adulterating of sound Authors from their Design in what they quote of them on the one hand, or determining on the other hand upon the Judgments of others, as if Orthodox, from occasional Sentences or Expressions subtilly vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonding themselves by an outward seeming dress from that which indeed they real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon in the scope of their rotten Divinity, their Followers in their Numbers would soon be reduced to a Correspondency with the Soundness of their Articles: and herein I may boldly say, without a Spirit of Prophecy, that I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt nor question but there are such who will give them the meeting in this Cause (with a Christian Defiance to their Numbers, Qualities, Qualifications, and their Attempts thereby) even in his and his only Name, who will be Wisdom to the foolish, Strength to the weak, Clothing to the naked, and Grace to the Beggar, so as to lay them heaps upon heaps, and that from their own Arguments taken out of their own uncircumcised <hi>Philistine</hi> Tents, even the Jaw-bone of an Ass, which God will in his due time so cleave asunder [by his unravelling of all their Treacheries] as that it shall become a real, sutable, succouring Relief and Refreshment unto all the tried and yet faithful, yea resolutely unwearied Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants in his Cause: nay, it will certainly appear, that that which they seem most to trust unto, will prove their final Overthrow, even as <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword, of which <hi>David</hi> says from an Experience he had of it, <hi>That there was none like it;</hi> and indeed there is not a more effectual way to overcome an Enemy, than by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming him so, as to engage him with his own Weapon. Hence take this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Antidote against Unbelief:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To know that the more we are convinced of our natural Inability to believe, is one of the greatest Engines (tho otherwise designed and managed by God in
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:94224:228"/>
his Elect) whereby Unbelief would step and thrust in, support and set up it self, by working the Soul into such Discouragements, as that therefore it ceases labouring after a true Knowledg of it in its kind, together with its renewing Efficacy, and the Advantages arising therefrom; the nature of Unbelief being to convert spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Remedies into spiritual Maladies, it is the Unhealthiness or bad Concoction, as the Cause thereof in the Soul, turning that which in it self is Food for Life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Humours for Death; <hi>Lam. 3. 18, 19, 20, 21. Hos. 13. 9. Mat. 25. 24, 25, 26, 27. John 16. 9, 10. 2 Cor. 12. 9, 10. Psal. 56. 3. Isa. 50. 10. 2 Cor. 2. 15, 16. ch. 3. 5. Psal. 87. 7. Isa.</hi> 1. 5. compare <hi>ch. 40. 29. Phil. 4. 13. 2 Kings</hi> 6. 33. compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29. Hence it is that a Supposition of an easy Attainment unto Faith is the very strong hold and vital fort of Unbelief, which never disturbs the securely confident or carnally bold Pretender, such I mean who can sleep in the whole Skin of that Faith, Repentance and Holiness, that precedes a Life-begetting Union between Christ and the Soul; and yet from such an old Covenant Preparation it can and will naturally make use of the Merits of another, were it but for its own Preservation, Man by Nature being as prone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what purely arises from Nature, as he is to wish and endeavour with all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the compassing of his own Salvation, <hi>Isa. 50. 11. ch. 57. 10. Hos. 7. 9, 10, 11. ch. 10. 1. ch. 14. 8, 9. John</hi> 15. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or severed from me, <hi>i. e.</hi> as <hi>disunited unto me, you can do nothing:</hi> If our Believing be not here excluded, then I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Faith is the Fruit of Union. It is one thing to perswade our selves that we do believe, for fear of Condemnation, and another thing to be perswaded by Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to receive that Salvation, which was ours, and <hi>as</hi> ours, antecedent unto our received Ability in the Act of Believing, or the discerning, coming, receiving, applying and establishing Operation of the Spirit in our Souls. Unbelief indeed as damning, or insensibly locking the Soul up in a State of Condemnation, is Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, or a false Faith. And it is not so much a Deliverance from Hell, or this or the other thing that is even dreadful and intolerable unto Nature it self, that a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly convinced Soul labours after, but into what it is that he is translated by his Convictions, what are the grounds of his hopes of Deliverance thereupon, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so what the nature and matter of his Fellowship with God is, as a Consequence thereof. For I may hear that he that believes and repents not, shall be damned, which is very true, and therefrom betake my self to a Duty of Believing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, when alas, I consider not whence this Faith and Repentance does arise, what it is that Faith leads me to lay hold of, how to improve the same, and for what ends: All which in their own very Nature and Tenure, as to their Place and Office, carry along with them their particular distinct Testimonies, from the abiding, transforming, and renewing Seals of their Author: And yet all this is in reference unto a Truth, as mine, independant upon my Faith and Repentance, formerly so, yea from Eternity such as was fixed upon by God for me; for it is not any, or all of Man's natural Endowments, or acquired Attainments, yea created Grace it self, that can in the least give a Being unto Truth, or my relation unto and interest in it, tho Time and the special Operations of the Spirit, are the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune, conveying and efficient means of my discerning, laying hold of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what was designed me by an eternal Contract; since it is clear that tho Faith in me is the <hi>Root</hi> of my Love towards God, yet Faith as a Gift from God unto me is a <hi>Fruit</hi> of his Love towards me. In short, the very way that God takes to work out Unbelief, is that whereby the Devil endeavours to bring it in;

for Sin, as Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> says in his <hi>Church Militant,</hi> dogs the Church: This is the ground on which the Mystery of Iniquity in the <hi>Papist, Baxterian,</hi> and <hi>Quaker</hi> is bottom'd, whose Convictions reach no further, and that the Devil is willing they should do, than to a condemning of sinful and natural Self, still with this <hi>Proviso</hi> of setting up in the room thereof (by the unscriptural help of the Merits of Christ, which they vainly imagine will give it its <hi>Imprimatur)</hi> a religious Self, or created Righteousness for their standing and justifying acceptance with and before God; and this makes it their Idol, their Table becomes their Snare with a <hi>mors in olla.</hi> Hence it is that our grand Enemies Engines, Instruments, Emissaries and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who love to transform themselves <hi>ad instar Domini Patrisque suorum,</hi> into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Light, act the same part with him herein; for they go along with those very Convictions which condemn for Sin, and all Inability in our selves to work out our own Remedy, which in it self so far is true and of the Lord; but when this self-abasement issues in a self-retirement for Peace and Establishment, and that upon the recommendation and remote Support of another's Righteousness, in the bare Merits, as excluding the imputed matter thereof, it is but the unclean Spirit entring into, taking and keeping possession of the swept and garnished House with seven other Spirits more unclean than himself, whose end thereby becomes worse than his beginning; <hi>Job 37. 5, 6, 7. God thundereth marvellously with his Voice, great things doth he, which we cannot comprehend—For he saith to the Snow, Be thou on the Earth; likewise to the small Rain, and to the great Rain of his Strength—He sealeth up the hand of every Man, that all Men may know his Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To labour after a more thorow discerning into, which it is of the Faculties and Passions of our Souls, that this Sin of Unbelief mostly engages, as to a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and maintaining of its Life and Interest thereby; whereby it is indeed that we may be enabled from a Knowledg of the same, to perceive in what it is that our master Sin or Lust, as an Obstacle unto the lively and experimental Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faith, doth lie, which will appear to be the principal Seat, most fostering Reserve, cherishing Matter, and as such sheltering Retirement. of Unbelief; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3, 4, 5, 6. For tho the Apostle charges the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ch. 12. 1. <hi>to lay aside every weight, and the Sin which doth so easily beset us,</hi> yet observe but the Context both before and after, and you will find that his main design therein was against the Sin of Unbelief, as discovering it self by this or the other particular Lust yielded unto, and this according unto that which more naturally would beset us: for as any and every Lust is cherished radically by Unbelief, so there is in that Body Politick of Satan's, for its preservation and the keeping of its Charter and Corporation, a <hi>return</hi> or <hi>refunding</hi> of that which any Lust <hi>(as an out-lier or ranger)</hi> has gain'd by its Reception, Entertainment, and Gratification, together with its Preys and Spoils upon the Evidences even of a Believer's Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to the maintaining of its grand Stock, Magazine or Storehouse, and thereby the Support and Relief of its own Foundation, which is Unbelief, as knowing that the Superstructure of a Body of Sin can no more stand without it, than a House without a Basis, and also that a Basis or Foundation will be but an useless dead thing without a Building upon it. In fine, They supply and keep up each other, as the Ocean and Rivers do; what the one emits or sends out into the other, the same other refunds and returns into it, as its Origine and Spring from whence it came.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:94224:229"/>
3. To perceive distinctly how it is, and whence also it is, that this Sin of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief came in, as that any of the Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> should be as a matter of Fact on them personally charged with the same, all of them being by Nature born Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, or as going astray from the Womb, and also therefrom naturally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or defiled, <hi>viz.</hi> from a representative standing in one Covenant-Head as such, for its Imputation; and from a natural Fountain, Spring-conveying Head of the same in this federal Relation, as to its infused and inherent Reign and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Its contrary therefore must be diligently and indefatigably pressed after, for the charge of it must be first removed before ever the Power of it can be broken, even by such a Faith as objectively presents unto us a Head, whereby Salvation is not only as compleatly wrought out for us, but as commensurately as our Misery was transferred over unto us in the Matter and Effects thereof; wherein there must be a full Correspondence, and that in the exact change of our State, and effectual Renovation of our Nature, or Unbelief will retain such a footing in the Soul, as will keep it in a staggering posture, render the Promises but as a Bank-Office, no fixing or fastning upon any one of them, for want of Union with him, in this federal Headship-Sense, in whom they all are, upon which indeed our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in any of them is founded: This is the Faith of God's Elect, from which there is a Promise of never falling away, but that they in whom it is shall be kept or preserved through the same, by the Power of God, as in a Garison, unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. See that thou hast Truth in the real kind, and just or methodical Order of it; for God has not only an House, but this House has a Form, of whose Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges none shall be made Partakers, but such as are previously unto their <hi>Fruition of them,</hi> taken into the said House. It is the Son must make us free, if ever we be freed indeed, either from the Charge or Dominion of Sin; first in Christ, then a new Creature, and not till then: and he that hath the Son first, hath Life after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; which quite overthrows the Tables or Fables of our Neonomian Mony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers, with all their Trumperies, Bag and Baggage of Prerequisites, Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Causa sine quâ nons;</hi> their first, second, and final Justification; their univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal and peculiar Covenant of Grace; their particular, impersonal and invisible E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; their Christless ineffectual Redemption; their insufficiently efficacious, and their inefficaciously sufficient Mint of Grace; their Dark-lanthorn casually pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, and contingently geometrical Articles of Assurance and Perseverance, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the rest of those their <hi>Babylonish</hi> Vessels they would introduce into and intrude upon the House and Temple of the Lord; and thereupon their Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Leap in the dark, when upon the brink of Eternity, whereof they are never, as they say so much, as doctrinally cleared till their predisposing Graces and subordinate Righteousness have pass'd the final test of the last day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Make this Truth thine own, by labouring after its experimental influencing Authority upon the inward and outward Man; nothing of this nature can be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to be ours in a comfortable witnessing Sense, but what we are cast into the Substance and Mould of, <hi>Rom. 6. 17. Whereto ye were delivered.</hi> This is done instrumentally by the effectual subjective Operation of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. and tends to keep the Soul steady in, and for the Truth; and by how much they are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated the one with the other, by so much it is impossible for such to act against the Truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. whence will follow;</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:94224:230"/>
3. That this Truth so received in its theoretick or doctrinal Matter and Form, and its renewing or transforming Efficacy, will stand by thee in the greatest of thy Trials, Exigencies and Straits, yea even at an hour of Dissolution, when like a Child of Light thou shalt walk safely and immovably, through the Valley of the shadow of Death, unto the Mansions of eternal Glory: <hi>John 14. 1, 2, 3, 4. Let not your Heart be troubled, ye believe in God, believe also in me—In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's House are many Mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you: I go to prepare a place for you—And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my self, that where I am there ye may be also—And whither I go, ye know, and the way ye know.</hi> Job 13. 15. <hi>Tho he slay me, yet I will trust in him—</hi>Isa. 50. 10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the Voice of his Servant, that walketh in Darkness, and hath no Light? Let him trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>Behold, all ye that kindle a Fire, that compass your selves about with Sparks; walk in the Light of your Fire, and in the Sparks that ye have kindled: This shall ye have of mine hand, ye shall lie down in Sorrow.</hi> John 9. 39. <hi>And Jesus said, For Judgment I am come into this World, that they which see not, might see; and that they which see, might be made blind.</hi> It is the Record of God concerning his Son, that is the Foundation of our Peace, and accordingly the Spring whereby he conveys the methodizing Testimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto the Soul: Against which, either in whole or in part, whoever sets himself, is not in the Apostle's Sense so much as to be entertained in our Houses, much less subscribed unto in their Antichristian Principles and Practices; and he that is not as ready to spend even his Heart's Blood, as well as Ink in defence of this Cause, is not worthy to make a profession of it: 1 <hi>John 5. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. This is he that came by Water and Blood, even Jesus Christ; not by Water only, but by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Blood; and it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is Truth.—For there are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.—And there are three that bear witness in Earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Blood, and these three agree in one.—If we receive the witness of Men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God, which he hath testified of his Son—He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God, hath made him a Liar, because he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son.—And this is the Record, that God hath given to us eternal Life: and this Life is in his Son.—He that hath the Son hath Life; and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not Life.</hi> Compare 2 Epist. V. 10, 11. <hi>If there come any unto you, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not into your House, neither bid him God speed—for he that biddeth him God speed, is Partaker of his evil Deeds.</hi>
