            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Speech delivered in the CASTLE-CHAMBER concerning the Oath of SUPREMACIE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat the danger of the <hi>Law</hi> is, for refusing this <hi>Oath,</hi> hath beene sufficiently opened by my Lords the <hi>Iudges;</hi> and the <hi>qualitie</hi> and <hi>quantitie</hi> of that offence hath been aggravated to the full by those that have spoken after them. The part which is most proper for me to deale in, is the information of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> touching the truth and equitie of the matters contained in the <hi>Oath:</hi> which I also have made choice the rather to insist upon, because both the forme of the <hi>Oath</hi> it selfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth herein a full resolution of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19567:3"/>
(as appeareth by those words in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning thereof; <hi>I doe utterly testifie and declare in my conscience,</hi> &amp;c.) and the persons that stand here to be censured for refusing the same, have alledged nothing in their owne defence but only the simple plea of <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this point therefore may bee cleared, and all needlesse scruples removed out of mens minds: two maine branches there bee of this <hi>Oath,</hi> which require speciall conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The one <hi>positive:</hi> acknowledging the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the governement of these Realmes, in all causes whatsoever, to rest in the Kings Highnesse onely. The other <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi> renouncing all iurisdictions and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of any forreine Prince or Prelate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Maiesties dominions.</p>
            <p>For the better understanding of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, we are in the first place to call unto our remembrance that exhortation of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Per. 2. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Submit your selves unto every ordinance of man for the Lords sake: whether it bee unto the King, as having the preheminence; or unto Governours, as unto them that are sent by him, for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evill doers, and for the praise of them that doe well.</hi> By this we are taught to respect the King, not as <hi>the only governour</hi> of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19567:3"/>
simply (for wee see there bee other <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> placed under him) but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as him that <hi>excelleth,</hi> and hath the preeminence over the rest, that is to say, (according to the tenure of the <hi>Oath)</hi> as him that is <hi>the onely su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour</hi> of his Realmes. Vpon which ground we may safely build this conclusion; that whatsoever power is incident unto the King by vertue of his place, must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be in him <hi>supreme:</hi> there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so contrary to the nature of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as to have another superiour power to over-rule it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qui Rex est, Regem (Maxime) non habeat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>second</hi> place wee are to consider, that God for the better settling of piety and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty among men, and the repressing of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse and other vices, hath established two distinct powers upon earth: the one of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> committed to the Church; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Sword,</hi> committed to the Civill Magistrate. That of the <hi>Keyes</hi> is ordained to worke upon the inner man; having imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate relation to the <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 20. 23.</note> 
               <hi>remitting</hi> or <hi>retaining</hi> of sins. That of the <hi>Sword</hi> is appointed to work upon the outward man; yeelding protection to the obedient, and inflicting externall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19567:4"/>
upon the rebellious and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. By the former, the spirituall officers of the Church of Christ are inabled to <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Tim. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>governe well,</hi> to <note n="d" place="margin">Tit. 2. 15.</note> 
               <hi>speak</hi> and <hi>exhort</hi> and <hi>rebuke</hi> with all <hi>authoritie,</hi> to <note n="e" place="margin">Matth. 16. 19. &amp; 18. 18.</note> 
               <hi>loose</hi> such as are penitent, to commit others unto the Lords prison, untill their amendment, or to binde them over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the iudgment of the great day, if they shal persist in their wilfulnesse and obstinacie. By the other, Princes have an imperious power assigned by God unto them, for the defence of such as doe well, and executing <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note> 
               <hi>revenge</hi> and <hi>wrath</hi> upon such as doe evill; whether <note n="g" place="margin">Ezra 7. 26.</note> by <hi>death,</hi> or <hi>banishment,</hi> or <hi>confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goods,</hi> or <hi>imprisonment,</hi> according to the qualitie of the offence.</p>
            <p>When St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that had the <hi>Keyes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him, made bold to draw the <hi>Sword;</hi> he was commanded to <note n="h" place="margin">Matt. 26. 52.</note> put it up, as a weapon that he had no authoritie to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle withall. And on the other side, when <hi>Vzziah</hi> the King would venture upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Priests office, it was said unto him; <note n="i" place="margin">2. Chr. 26. 18.</note> 
               <hi>It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, but to the Priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burne incense.</hi> Let this therefore be our second conclusion:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19567:4"/>
that the power of the <hi>Sword</hi> and of the <hi>Keyes</hi> are two distinct ordinances of God; and that the Prince hath no more authoritie to enter upon the execution of any part of the Priests function, than the Priest hath to intrude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any part of the office of the Prince.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place we are to observe, that the power of the <hi>civill sword,</hi> (the <hi>supreme</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging wherof belongeth to the King alone) is not to bee restrained unto <hi>temporall</hi> causes only; but is by Gods ordinance to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded likewise unto <hi>all Spirituall or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call things and causes.</hi> that as the spirituall Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Church doe exercise their kinde of governement, in bringing men unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not of the duties of the <hi>first</hi> Table a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone (which concerneth piety and the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous service which man is bound to performe unto his Creator) but also of the <hi>second</hi> (which respecteth morall honesty, and the offices that man doth owe unto man:) so the civill Magistrate is to use his authority also in redressing the abuses committed against the <hi>first</hi> Table, aswell as against the <hi>second,</hi> that is to say, aswell in punishing of an <hi>heretick,</hi> or an <hi>idolater,</hi> or a <hi>blasphemer,</hi> as of a <hi>thiefe,</hi> or a <hi>murtherer,</hi> or a <hi>traytor;</hi> and in providing by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19567:5"/>
all good meanes, that such as live under his government <note n="k" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> may leade a quiet and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life in all <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>honesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And howsoever by this meanes we make both <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Priest</hi> to bee in their severall places <hi>Custodes utriusque tabulae,</hi> Keepers of both Gods tables: yet do we not hereby any way confound both of their offices together. for though the <hi>matter</hi> wherein their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is exercised may be the same; yet is the <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of governing therein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies different. the one reaching to the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> man onely, the other to the <hi>inward:</hi> the one binding or loosing the <hi>soule,</hi> the other laying hold on the <hi>body</hi> and the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereunto: the one having speciall reference to the iudgement of the <hi>world to come,</hi> the other respecting the present retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or loosing of some of the comforts of <hi>this life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there is such a <note n="*" place="margin">As on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, that a <hi>spirituall or ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </note> 
               <hi>civill government</hi> as this in <hi>causes spirituall or Ecclesiasticall,</hi> no man of iudgement can deny. For must not <hi>Heresie</hi> (for example) bee acknowledged to be a cause meerly <hi>spirituall</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall?</hi> and yet by what power is an <hi>Hereticke</hi> put to death? The officers of the Church have no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19567:5"/>
authority to take away the life of any man: it must be done therefore <hi>per brachium secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare;</hi> and consequently it must bee yeelded without contradiction, that the temporall Magistrate doth exercise therein a part of his <hi>civill government,</hi> in punishing a crime that is of it owne nature <hi>spirituall</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here it will be said. The words of the <hi>Oath</hi> being generall; that the King is <hi>the only supreme governour of this Realme and of all other his highnesse dominions and countries:</hi> how may it appeare that the power of the <hi>civill sword</hi> only is meant by that government, and that the power of the <hi>Keyes</hi> is not comprehended therein? I answere: <hi>first,</hi> that where a civill Magistrate is affirmed to bee <hi>the governour of his owne dominions and countryes;</hi> by common intendement this must needs be understood of a <hi>civill governement,</hi> and may in no reason be extended to that which is meerely of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde. <hi>Secondly</hi> I say, that where an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguitie is conceived to bee in any part of an <hi>Oath;</hi> it ought to bee taken according to the understanding of him for whose satisfaction the <hi>Oath</hi> was ministred. Now in this case it hath been sufficiently declared by publick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that no other thing is meant by the

               <hi>governement</hi> here mentioned; but that of the <hi>civill sword</hi> onely.</p>
            <p>For in the booke of <hi>Articles</hi> agreed upon by the Archbishops &amp; Bishops &amp; the whole Clergie in the Convocation holden at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>anno</hi> 1562. thus we read. <hi>Where we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Queenes Majesty the chiefe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (by which titles wee understand the minds of some slanderous folkes to be offended:) we give not to our Princes the ministring either of Gods Word or of the Sacraments (the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by Elizabeth our Queene doth most plainly testifie:) but that onely prerogative which we see to have beene given al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to all godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himselfe, that is, that they should rule all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and degrees committed to their Charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiasticall or Temporall, and restraine with the Civill sword the stubborne and evill doers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be here objected that the authority of the <hi>Convocation</hi> is not a sufficient ground for the expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which was enacted in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:</hi> I answer, that these <hi>Articles</hi> stand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed not onely by the Royall assent of the Prince, (for the establishing of whose <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> the Oath was framed) but also by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19567:6"/>
Act of <hi>Parliament;</hi> which is to be found among the statutes in the thirteenth yeare of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> chap. 12. Seeing therfore the makers of the Law have full authority to expound the Law; and they have sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifested, that by the <hi>supreme government</hi> given to the Prince they understand that kind of government only which is exercised <hi>with the Civill sword:</hi> I conclude, that nothing can be more plaine than this; that without all scruple of conscience, the <hi>Kings Majesty</hi> may be acknowledged in this sense to bee <hi>the only supreme governour of all his Highnesse domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and countries, as well in all spirituall or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall things or causes as temporall.</hi> And so have I cleered the <hi>first</hi> maine branch of the <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now unto the <hi>second;</hi> which is propounded <hi>negatively:</hi> that <hi>no forrein Prince, Person, Prelate, State or Potentate, hath or ought to have any jurisdiction, power, superiority, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence or authority, Ecclesiasticall or spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all within this Realme.</hi> The forreiner that challengeth this <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> or <hi>spirituall</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction over us, is the <hi>Bishop of Rome:</hi> and the title whereby he claimeth this power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, is the same whereby he claimeth it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

the whole world; because he is S. <hi>Peters</hi> successor, forsooth. And indeed, if S. <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe had beene now alive, I should freely confesse, that hee ought to have spirituall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and superioritie within this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But so would I say also, if S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> S. <hi>Bartholmew,</hi> S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> or any of the other <hi>Apostles</hi> had beene alive. For I know that their commission was verie large; to <note n="l" place="margin">Mark. 16. 15.</note> 
               <hi>goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the world, and to preach the Gospel unto every creature.</hi> so that in what part of the world soever they lived, they could not bee said to be out of their charge; their <hi>Apostleship</hi> being a kind of an <hi>Universall Bishoprick.</hi> If therefore the Bishop of Rome can prove himselfe to bee one of this ranke: the Oath must be amended; and wee must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that hee hath Ecclesiasticall authoritie within this Realme.</p>
            <p>True it is, that our Lawyers in their Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bookes by the name of the <hi>Apostle</hi> do usually designe the <hi>Pope.</hi> But if they had examined his title to that <hi>Apostleship,</hi> as they would try an ordinary mans title to a piece of land: they might easily have found a number of flawes and maine defects therein. For <hi>first</hi> it would be enquired, whether the <hi>Apostleship</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:19567:7"/>
was not ordained by our Saviour Christ as a speciall Commission; which being perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall onely, was to determine with the death of the first <hi>Apostles.</hi> For howsoever at their first entry into the execution of this commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, we finde that <note n="m" place="margin">Acts 1. 25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>Matthias</hi> was admitted to the <hi>Apostleship</hi> in the roome of <hi>Iudas:</hi> yet afterwards when <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of <hi>Iohn</hi> was slaine by <hi>Herod,</hi> wee doe not reade that any other was substituted in his place. Nay we know that the Apostles generally left no successors in this kinde: neither did any of the Bishops (he of Rome only excepted) that sate in those famous Churches, wherein the <hi>Apostles</hi> exercised their ministery, challenge an <hi>Apostleship</hi> or an <hi>Universall Bishoprick,</hi> by vertue of that succession.</p>
            <p>It would <hi>secondly</hi> therefore bee inquired, what sound evidence they can produce, to shew that <hi>one</hi> of the company was to hold the <hi>Apostleshipp</hi> as it were in <hi>fee,</hi> for him and his successors for ever; and that the other <hi>eleven</hi> should hold the same for terme of life only. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if this state of perperuity was to be cast upon one: how came it to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. <hi>Peter,</hi> rather than upon S. <hi>Iohn;</hi> who outlived all the rest of his fellowes, and so as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19567:8"/>
a <hi>surviving feoffee</hi> had the fairest right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same in himself &amp; his successors for ever? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if that state were wholly set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled upon S. <hi>Peter:</hi> seeing the Romanists themselves acknowledge that he was Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> before he was Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> we require them to shew, why so great an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance as this, should descend unto the <hi>yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> brother (as it were by <hi>Burrough-english)</hi> rather than to the <hi>elder,</hi> (according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner of descents.) Especially seeing <hi>Rome</hi> hath little else to alledge for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, but only that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified in it: which was a very slender reason to move the Apostle so to respect it. Seeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the grounds of this great claime of the Bishop of Rome appeare to be so vaine and frivolous: I may safely conclude, that he <hi>ought to have no Ecclesiasticall or spirituall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority within this Realme;</hi> which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall point contained in the second part of the <hi>Oath.</hi>

Wherein your zeale to the maintenance of our just and lawfull power, defended with so much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and reason, deserves our Princely and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thankes; which we doe by this our letter unto you, and so bid you farewell. </hi>
