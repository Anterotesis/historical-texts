            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SUCH AN
ACCOUNT
Of the following
BOOK,
Sent with it to a
FRIEND;
As may ſerve inſtead of a
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TO convince you, Sir, how
much more I am concern'd
to have you think, I can Obey well,
than Write well; I venture to
ſend you the <hi>Account,</hi> (as imperfect
and unpoliſh'd as it is) that you
are pleas'd to command <hi>Of the laſt
Hours of Theodora.</hi> But I muſt beg
your leave to accompany it with
another <hi>Account</hi> (though but a ſhort
one) how I came to meddle with
<pb facs="tcp:98345:3"/>
this Subject; and why what I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
you about it, is ſo much
Maim'd, and has no more Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
            <p>Having had occaſion many years
ago to turn over a Martyrology,
and ſome other Books, that related
to the Sufferings of the Primitive
Chriſtians; I chanc'd to light on
thoſe of a Virgin, who, though (to
my wonder) ſhe was left unnam'd
by the other Writers that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
her, ſeem'd plainly to be
the ſame, that is by one of them
expreſly call'd <hi>Theodora:</hi> I own, I
was not a little affected, at the
reading of ſuch moving and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
adventures as hers: and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſtory to be related, by the
Author that nam'd both her and
her Lover, not only very ſuccinctly
and imperfectly, but very dully
too; I found my ſelf tempted ſo
to enlarge this Story, as that it
might be contriv'd into a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
voluminous Romance: But
<pb facs="tcp:98345:3"/>
upon ſecond thoughts, it appeared
incongruous to turn a Martyr into
a Nymph or an Amazon: And I
conſider'd too, that (to omit what
elſe might be objected againſt that
ſort of Compoſures) <hi>as</hi> true Pearls
are Cordials and Antidotes, which
counterfeit ones, how fine ſoever
they may appear, are not; <hi>ſo</hi> True
Examples do arm and fortify the
mind far more efficaciouſly, than
Imaginary or Fictious ones can do;
and the fabulous labours of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
and Exploits of <hi>Arthur</hi> of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
will never make men aſpire
to Heroick Vertue half ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as the real Examples of
Courage and Gallantry afforded by
<hi>Jonathan Caeſar,</hi> or the <hi>Black Prince.</hi>
But yet, thinking it great pity,
that ſo ſhining a Vertue as <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s
ſhould prove Exemplary, but
to her own time, and to one City;
and remembring, that ſoon after
the Age which ſhe Ennobl'd, it
was counted among the Primitive
Chriſtians an act of Piety, to build
<pb facs="tcp:98345:4"/>
fair Monuments, upon the formerly
abject Graves of the Martyrs; to repay,
by Honours done to their
Memories, the indignities and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces
they had ſuffer'd in their
Perſons; I thought fit to try, if I
could reſcue from more unskilful
Hands than even mine, a ſtory that
abundantly deſerv'd to be well
told.</p>
            <p>But upon further thoughts, I ſoon
foreſaw, that this Task was not
more worthy to be undertaken, than
it would prove difficult to be well
perform'd: For the Martyrologiſt
having allow'd ſcarce one whole
Page, to a Relation, that perhaps
merited a Volume, had left ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Chaſms, and ſo many neceſſary
things unmentioned, that I plainly
perceiv'd, I wanted a far greater
number of Circumſtances, than that
he had ſupply'd me with to make
up ſo maim'd a ſtory tolerably
compleat. And as the Relation
deny'd me matter enough to work
<pb facs="tcp:98345:4"/>
upon, ſo the nature of the Subject
refus'd moſt of thoſe Imbelliſhments
which in other Themes, where
young Gallants and fair Ladies are
the chief Actors, are wont to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the deficiences of the matter.
Beſides, my task was not near ſo
eaſie as it would have been, if I
had been only to recite the Intrigues
of an Amour, with the liberty
to feig ſurprizing adventures,
to adorn the Hiſtorical part
of the account, and to make a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſpeak as Paſſionately as I
could, and his Miſtreſs as Kindly
as the indulgenteſt laws of decency
would permit. But I was to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Chriſtian and pious Lover,
who was to contain the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of his Flame within the
narrow bounds of his Religion;
and a Virgin, who, being as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and diſcreet as handſom,
and as devout as either, was to
own an high Eſteem for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Lover, and an uncommon
Gratitude to a tranſcendent Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
<pb facs="tcp:98345:5"/>
without intrenching either
upon her Vertue, or her Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs.
And I perceiv'd the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of my Task would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſ'd,
by that of Reconciling
<hi>Theodora</hi>'s Scrupulouſneſs to the
humours of ſome young Perſons
of Quality of either Sex, who were
earneſt to engage my Pen on this
occaſion, and would expect that
I ſhould make <hi>Theodora</hi> more kind,
than I thought her great Piety
and ſtrict Modeſty would permit.
But for all this; the eſteem I had
for the fair Martyrs Excellencies,
and the compliance I had for thoſe
that deſir'd to receive an account
of ſo rare a Perſons actions and
Sufferings, made me reſolve to
try what I could do. Which I
adventur'd upon with the leſs
Reluctancy, becauſe, though I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd
it a kind of Profaneneſs,
to transform a piece of Martyrology
into a Romance; yet I thought it
allowable enough, where a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
was written ſo conciſely, and
<pb facs="tcp:98345:5"/>
left ſo unperfect, as That I had to
deſcant upon; to make ſuch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
of Circumſtances, as were
not improbable in the nature of
the thing, and were little leſs than
neceſſary to the clearneſs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireneſs
of the Story, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
connection of the parts it
ſhould conſiſt of. I ſuppos'd too,
that I needed not ſcruple, to lend
Speeches to the Perſons I brought
upon the Stage, provided they were
ſuitable to the Speakers, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions;
ſince I was warranted by
the Examples of <hi>Livy, Plutarch,</hi>
and other Grave and Judicious
Hiſtorians, who make no ſcruple
to give us ſet Orations, of their
own framing, and ſometimes put
them into the mouths of Generals
at the head of their Armies, juſt
going to give Battel: though at ſuch
times the hurry and diſtraction that
both they and their Auditors muſt
be in, muſt make it very unlikely,
either that they ſhould make ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
Speeches, or their Hearers
<pb facs="tcp:98345:6"/>
mind and remember them well
enough to repeat them to the
Hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>Encourag'd by theſe Liberties,
which I thought I might juſtly
allow my ſelf: I drew up, as well
as I could, what you have been
told I wrote about <hi>Theodora.</hi> This I
thought fit to divide into two parts;
in the firſt whereof, (which was
leſs remote from being Romantick)
I gave ſomewhat at large the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters
of them both. I mention'd
the riſe and progreſs of <hi>Didymus</hi>'s
Love; the degeneracy of the then
Chriſtians, which provok'd Divine
Providence, to expoſe them to a
very Bloody Perſecution: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
how <hi>Theodora</hi> being involv'd
in it, was brought before the
<hi>Preſident</hi> of <hi>Antioch;</hi> how ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
own'd her Religion before
him, anſwer'd His Arguments,
and reſiſted both his Promiſes, and
his Menaces; how thereupon the
Judge doom'd her either to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb facs="tcp:98345:6"/>
or to be proſtituted in the
the publick <hi>Stews.</hi> How ſhe, after
an eager Debate in her own mind,
refuſing to offer ſacrifice, was, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
her ſilence) led away
to the infamous place; how being
ſhut up there alone in a Room,
ſhe employ'd the little time, that
was granted her to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe would yet burn Incenſe
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Idols, in fervent
Prayer to the true God, for a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
of her Purity, not her Life;
in order whereunto, ſhe deſign'd
and hop'd by Reſiſtance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies
to provoke her firſt Aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
to become her Murderer, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than her Raviſher.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the chief Contents
of the firſt Book. Thoſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
were more Hiſtorical; and
conſiſted of an account of the laſt
hours of her Life, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of thoſe Sufferings that ended
in her and <hi>Didymus</hi>'s glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.
This piece having been
<pb facs="tcp:98345:7"/>
perus'd by thoſe for whoſe ſake
I wrote it; was ſo fortunate, that
it having, without my leave, been
ventur'd into ſeveral hands, as a
Book of a nameleſs and unknown
Author, it was lucky enough to
be, by ſome indulgent Readers,
attributed to One, and by ſome to
Another, of the two Perſons, that
were at that time counted the
beſt writers of diſguis'd Hiſtories.
But among the many Hands it
paſs'd through, it ſeems it fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome, out of which a great
part of the looſe ſheets, (which
were not bound in a Book, but
only tack'd together) were not
to be retriev'd: whether it were
by the negligence, or the contempt,
that ſome had of ſo unpoliſh'd a
Work; or whether there were
ſome fatality in the Buſineſs, that
<hi>Theodoras</hi> Sufferings ſhould outlive
her, and her Story be as ill us'd
as her Perſon had been. This loſs,
(if it can deſerve that name) I did
not much regret: Since I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:98345:7"/>
not to make the loſt Papers
publick, and had receiv'd much
greater approbation and thanks
than they merited, from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſons they were deſign'd
for. But after I had for many
years worn out, not only the ſenſe,
but the memory of this loſs: It
was made more troubleſom to me,
than ever it was at firſt, by the
earneſt ſolicitations of ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Perſons, that had a great power
over me, and ſome of them the
repute of great Judges of this
kind of Compoſures. For having
ſeen ſeveral Sheets, that I acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
lighted on, in tumbling over
ſome long neglected Papers; they
oblig'd me to cauſe thoſe old rude
ſheets to be tranſcrib'd. And tho'
almoſt all the firſt Book was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(upon which account, I could
not be remov'd from my Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not to trouble my ſelf about
it) yet there was ſo much of the
Second Book, but in parts no
way Coherent, little by little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triev'd,
<pb facs="tcp:98345:8"/>
that a pretence was affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to preſs me to repair thoſe
Breaches, and reſtore out of my
memory, or otherwiſe, a piece,
which they would needs perſwade
me might do ſome good, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
Vertue Amiable, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
Piety to a ſort of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that are much more affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſhining Examples, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical
Expreſſions, than by
dry Precepts, and grave Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>If ſome of your more ſcrupulous
Friends ſhall object, that I have
mention'd <hi>Theodoras</hi> Beauty more
often and advantagouſly, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
her Lovers Paſſion more
Pathetically, than the ſubject of
the ſtory exacted, and the truth
requir'd in Hiſtory would war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
I ſhall not altogether deny
the Charge: Being rather content
to have it thought, that a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
heated fancy tranſported
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Pen, ſomewhat beyond the
<pb facs="tcp:98345:8"/>
narrow bounds of Hiſtory, than
that ſo Pious a perſon as <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
did not keep both his Flame,
and the Expreſſions of it, within
the limits of Reaſon and Religion.
But though I pretend not to juſtifie,
all that has been ſaid in the ſtrain
of an Encomiaſt, or a Lover, yet
I hop'd that I may much Extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
if not Excuſe it, by repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch things as theſe.</p>
            <p>That I have been careful, that
<hi>Theodora</hi> ſhould not be made to
do, or ſay, any thing, that, the
great Obligations ſhe had to her
Reſcuer conſider'd, do intrench ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon her Piety, or her Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
or ſo much as upon her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'dneſs.</p>
            <p>That as for <hi>Didymus;</hi> I might
ſay, that probably he thought,
thoſe Celebrations that would have
been Flattery to another Lady,
were but Juſtice to a Perſon ſo
Extraordinary, and ſo accompliſh'd
<pb facs="tcp:98345:9"/>
as his Miſtreſs; and that he thought
it allowable, not to ſuppreſs the
chaſt effects of a Paſſion, that
has not only been incident to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,
but perhaps help'd to make
them ſuch. But I will rather ſay,
that thoſe only are like to find
much fault with his Expreſſions,
<hi>who</hi> conſider not how free they
are from any degree of Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Immodeſty: And <hi>who</hi> are
not accuſtomed to the reading
of Stories, where Lovers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd,
and made to Praiſe and
Complement in a far more Bold
and Romantick way, than I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
my ſelf in the following
Paper. In which, all the Defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
wherewith <hi>Irene</hi> as well as
<hi>Didymus</hi> treat <hi>Theodora,</hi> may be
be accounted for by this; That I
remember'd to have, in ſome
Author or other, found Mention
made of a Perſon about <hi>Diocleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s
time, Whom I took for our
Martyr, that was intimated to be
of high Quality, if not a <hi>Princeſs.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98345:9"/>
which Title I had without ſcruple
given Her, If I had been half as
ſure that ſhe Was a <hi>Princeſs,</hi> as
that ſhe Deſerv'd to be One.</p>
            <p>That perhaps I was not unwilling,
both to ſhew the Perſons I wrote
for, that One might have glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Idea</hi>'s of Beauty, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dazl'd by them; and alſo to
convince them, that high Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and paſſionate expreſſions, are
no certain Marks of His being really
<hi>Smitten</hi> (to ſpeak in a Lovers
Phraſe) that can Imploy them;
ſince I retain'd my wonted freedom
of mind, while I was Writing; and
preſented them by the mouth of
<hi>Didymus,</hi> but what Fancy, not Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
indited.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I was induc'd to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
my ſelf a more faſhionable
Stile, than would perhaps be ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to a meer Sermon, or Book of
Divinity, becauſe I fear'd, that the
Youthful Perſons of Quality of both
<pb facs="tcp:98345:10"/>
Sexes, that I was chiefly to regard,
would ſcarce be ſufficiently affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by unfortunate Vertue, if the
interweaving of paſſages relating to
Beauty and Love, did not help
to make the Tragical ſtory, Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and the Excellent Sufferers Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Amiable.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that in ſome
of the diſcourſes of the two Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
there are Paſſages that argue
more Knowledge, than is likely to
have been found in Lay Perſons no
Elder than they. I anſwer, that
ſuch Diſcourſes indeed were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſtrange, if they were aſcrib'd
to a young Gallant, and a younger
Lady, of Our degenerate Times;
wherein ſo many Perſons of that
ſort, make Diverſion their grand
Buſineſs; and, having as little Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
as Concern to mind any thing,
but their Pleaſures and petty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
think it their Priviledge to
know little of Religion, and leave
to meaner People the ſtudy of
<pb facs="tcp:98345:10"/>
things Serious and Uſeful. But,
<hi>though</hi> among this ſort of Perſons, it
were ſo difficult to find many that
would Emulate ſuch Knowledge
and Vertue as ſhin'd in <hi>Theodora,</hi>
that I fear they would not ſo much
as believe them; <hi>yet</hi> among better
qualify'd Judges, the lately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
objection will be of no great
force, if it be conſider'd, that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymus</hi>
and <hi>Theodora</hi> liv'd in the
Primitive and devout times of
the Church, and in the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
when the Chriſtian Religion
was as diligently Taught by Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Divines, as frequently Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by Arguments, and violently
aſſaulted by Perſecutions. Upon
which ſcores, the zealous Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
of Martyrdom, many of which
obtain'd the Crown of it, even in
their greener Age, were early and
skilfully inſtructed in the truths
of their own Religion, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with good Arguments, both
to Defend It, and Confute the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Opinions and Impious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
<pb facs="tcp:98345:11"/>
of their Heathen Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Nor is it any wonder, that
they ſhould think That Religion
worth Studying, that they thought
worth Dying for. I will not here
examine, whether the Ignorance
wont to be imputed to Women,
be Their fault, or that of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers,
and whether it is any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
want of Capacity, or rather
want of Inſtruction, that keeps
moſt of them from Knowledge,
though This regards not Sexes. But
without inquiry, whether it be
not our Intereſt, or our Envy, that
Makes Women what we are wont
to decry them for Being; I ſhall
not ſcruple to own, that I have
ſometimes had the honour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with Ladys, that convinc'd
me, That, to attain to a great
proficiency in Knowledge, 'tis not
neceſſary to be a Doctor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or ſo much as a Man, ſince
they diſcours'd of Divine things,
with no leſs Wit than Piety. And
to return to our Martyr, if we
<pb facs="tcp:98345:11"/>
may judge by the Effects, we may
reaſonably ſuppoſe, that our Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
Parents not only thought it
their Duty, but took much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
to Cultivate ſo excellent and
promiſing a Subject as their fair
Daughter. Since great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Nature and general Grace
ſhould rather Invite, than Excuſe,
Improvements by Education; as
even the <hi>Garden of Eden,</hi> though
an admirably fertile Soil, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God's own Hands, was
not ſo left to itſelf, but that <hi>Adam</hi>
was appointed to dreſs it, and to
keep it. And if the Diſcourſes of
our Martyrs are ſometimes leſs
ſhort than they might have been
made; I hope it may be ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
that I was not unwilling, to
lay hold now and then of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
afforded me by ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to ſhew, that Romantick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are not, as too many Perſons
of Quality think them, the Only
ones, that may be treated of in a
Gentleman-like ſtile; and that even
<pb facs="tcp:98345:12"/>
ſome noble Queſtions in Divinity,
and ſome of the ſeverer Dictates
of the Chriſtian Morals, may be
diſcours'd of, without the harſhneſs
of the School Terms, or the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
plainneſs of ſome better
Meant, than Pen'd, Books of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
and Devotion.</p>
            <p>'Tis like Sir, you will think it
ſtrange, that I make ſo Pious a
Perſon as <hi>Theodora,</hi> offer her Breaſt
to <hi>Didymus</hi>'s Sword, and by ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
him to Kill her, tempt him
to an Action, which would make
<hi>her</hi> guilty of a Murder, and make
<hi>him</hi> greatly acceſſory to it. But
poſſibly her Action would not
appear very ſtrange, if we were
not too enclinable to eſtimate the
Affairs of Paſt Times, and Remote
Regions, by the Opinions and Cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes
of our own Age and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys.
For, what ever we now juſtly
think of the ſinfulneſs of Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Mans ſelf, whether immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
or otherwiſe, yet I muſt not
<pb facs="tcp:98345:12"/>
deny, but that divers of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Chriſtians thought it not
Criminal, when it was neceſſary
for the preſervation of Chaſtity.
And, if I much miſremember not,
St. <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf, where he ſpeaks
of the unlawfulneſs of Self-deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
intimates, that he excepts
the Caſe of an inevitable danger
of a Rape. But my chief anſwer
is, that having found the Virgin
Martyrs propoſal expreſly deliver'd
by the Author I was to follow, I
judg'd it the part of an Hiſtorian
not to ſuppreſs it; which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
I the rather declin'd
to do, becauſe <hi>Theodoras</hi> offer was
a noble evincement, both of her
Gratitude and her Generoſity. And
therefore, inſtead of Omitting ſo
conſiderable an Action of hers, I
choſe rather to Set my thoughts
a work, to find a plauſible Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
for it. Which whether I
have happily done, by ſupplying
her with the Example of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
who, though he would not
<pb facs="tcp:98345:13"/>
caſt Himſelf into the Sea, yet ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Others to caſt him, (and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt bound him) I muſt leave
You to judge.</p>
            <p>I freely confeſs, Sir, that, if the
following Piece had been written
by One, that I were fond of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring,
I could my ſelf find enough
in it to Criticize upon; and
ſhould object againſt it, beſides
the want of Uniformity through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
That if judg'd of by the ſtrict
Rules of Art, it ought to paſs for
an Irregular Piece. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall not wonder, if Nicer
Criticks, and more vers'd in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
Compoſures than I pretend
to be, ſhall find fault with this
Artleſs one of mine. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
that the following Papers
met with, from the Perſons for
whom they were chiefly written,
affords me the Conſolation deri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vable
from the ingenious ſaying
of that excellent Wit, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
<hi>He had rather the Diſhes
<pb facs="tcp:98345:13"/>
ſerv'd up at his Treat, ſhould pleaſe
the Gueſts, than the Cooks.</hi> And I
might ſay too, that ſome of the
Paſſages that may meet with
Cenſure, would perhaps eſcape it;
if in writing this Book many
years agoe, I had not had ſome
Aims, that I then thought more
fit to be Purſu'd, than I now do
to be Declar'd. Yet I will not
here diſſemble, that I know it may
be thought by ſome, that this
Paper ſhould have conſiſted leſs
of Converſations, and more of
Narratives. But I choſe the way
of Writing I have employ'd, <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
becauſe the Authors I met with
furniſh'd me with ſo very few
matters of Fact, that if I would
have confin'd my ſelf to Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
I muſt have compriz'd this
piece in a very few Pages, and
have finiſh'd it preſently after I
had begun it: And <hi>partly</hi> too, (and
indeed much more) becauſe (as
I lately began to intimate) my
chief deſign was not ſo much, to
<pb facs="tcp:98345:14"/>
perform the Office of a meer Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian,
as to take Riſes from the
ſeveral Circumſtances I ſhould
relate, to convey unperceivedly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the minds of thoſe young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Quality for whom I wrote,
Sentiments of true Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
And theſe I thought would
not ſo happily gain admittance and
entertainment, if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
in a Scholar like-Diſcourſe, or
aprofeſs'd Book of devotion, as when
they were taken, not from common
places but from the Nature of the
Things and Perſons Introduc'd; and
without formality Inſtill'd by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
diſcourſes of a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and fair Lady, for whom the
Beauty and the Merit aſcrib'd to the
Speakers, had given the Hearers as
great Eſteem and Kindneſs. And I
ſhall not ſcruple to own, that I, who
who value time above moſt other
things, did not think it worth the
expence of mine, to give my ſelf
the trouble of Writing a Book, only
to give others a Divertiſement in
<pb facs="tcp:98345:14"/>
Reading it. And whilſt I was
Converſing with ſuch Excellent
Company, as our noble Martyrs,
and Meditating on ſuch Serious
Subjects, as are Death, and the
Worth of that Heavenly Religion
for whoſe ſake They deſpis'd It;
I found my ſelf Incited, and
thought my ſelf Oblig'd, to aim
leſs at the Pleaſing of ſome few
Nice Exactors of Regularity, than
to Poſſeſs many Readers with high
and noble Sentiments of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, and the ſublime
Dictates of it; and thereby both
Elevate their minds to a generous
Contempt of all they can loſe and
ſuffer for it, and Fill them with
bright <hi>Idea</hi>'s of Heroick Vertue,
and of the much brighter Glories
that will Crown it. By ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
I was induc'd not to
omit ſome Paſſages that ſeem'd
likely to further the main Ends I
purſu'd, though I foreſaw, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſome rigid Judges would ſay,
that they might have been ſpar'd.
<pb facs="tcp:98345:15"/>
For <hi>as</hi> I writ not a Romance,
wherein Authors are wont to aim
no higher, than to Delight the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Readers, and Eſcape the Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ones, by making their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures
Diverting and Regular;
<hi>ſo</hi> I preſum'd that to employ a
more Uſeful, though leſs Faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namble
way of Writing, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
for Me, who ought <hi>to</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
in ſuch a piece as This, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to propoſe Patterns of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
than Models of Skill or Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
and <hi>to</hi> think it more Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful,
if the Readers ſhall upon
peruſing it, Imitate our excellent
Martyrs Piety, than if they ſhould
only Applaud their Hiſtory. Which

It is not to be doubted, but that,
<hi>Didymus</hi> was not long kept a ſtranger
to the barbarous uſage ſhe had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
That of ſo illuſtrious a Lady
could not but make a great noiſe,
and reach a multitude of ears; and
eſpecially thoſe of ſo concern'd a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as <hi>Didymus:</hi> The wounds of
Lovers tender hearts, giving them
oftentimes ſecret Preſages of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching

of being able, by feeling of pain, to

as affect not unhurt men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Didymus</hi> therefore being quickly
too much aſcertain'd of the unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
News of the diſtreſs of his fair
Miſtreſs, was too generous a Lover
to deliberate, whether he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his life for her reſcue: His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
being only about the means,
how to make ſo difficult an attempt
a proſperous one. In order to this,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98345:17"/>
he happily finds out one of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Guards, that were placed
about the infamous Houſe, to which
<hi>Theodora</hi> was condemned: Who

<hi>Septimius,</hi> ſaies he, I cannot but
look upon it as one of the chief advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
I have obtain'd by venturing
my Life in the Roman Camps, that I
had the happineſs to be acquainted
with you there, and to be a ſpectator
of your Gallantry; which did not
only then raiſe me to a deſire of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating

a requeſt to you, that none but a
gallant Perſon ought to be entruſted
with, or would eaſily grant. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Didymus,</hi> replies the Roman,
When I accompanied you in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98345:18"/>
our propitious Eagles, I found
ſo great a contentment in your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and ſo ſtrong a ſpur to
Glory, in your examples, that I look'd
upon the advantage of having been
your fellow Soldier, as preferable to
the honour of Leading the moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Troops I may at any time
Command. And I ſhall think all
the hazards I then expos'd my ſelf
to, abundantly rewarded, if any
power they have procured me, may
enable me to do you ſervice. Tell
me then frankly, in what caſe, and
after what manner, you would have
it employ'd for you; and as I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
my ſelf, that ſo vertuous a
Friend as <hi>Dydimus,</hi> will deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is juſt, ſo he may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
himſelf, not to be refus'd
any ſervice, that is but Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>Our Lover embolden'd by ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
a declaration, firſt made
him a very grateful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for it, and then proceeded to ſay,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98345:18"/>
If you have ever had the happineſs
to be acquainted with <hi>Theodora,</hi> or
ſo much as to have ſeen her, 'twould
be needleſs, as well as improper, for
me to offer at giving you a Character
of her, which you muſt needs think
injurious to her. But if you have
not, the ſhortneſs of the time will
only permit me to aſſure you, that
not only ſhe has given me thoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of her Excellencies, that I
never had, nor ever thought my ſelf
capable of having, for any of her
Sex; but that in other Perſons
ſtrangely indiſpos'd to admit ſuch
impreſſions, ſhe has often excited
ſuch wonder and ſuch flames, as very
rarely have been produced in other
men, and perhaps, more rarely been
merited by other women.</p>
               <p>This admirable Perſon, for exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
among other vertues, that of
an invincible Conſtancy, to her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and refuſing to Sacrifice to
<hi>Venus, Flora,</hi> and ſome other of thoſe
Deities, whom her Perfections might,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98345:19"/>
though her Religion did not, exempt
from adoring; is by your ſavage Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
condemn'd to be expos'd to the
publick Luſt: And a Party of thoſe
gallant Roman Soldiers, that uſe to be
ſo gloriouſly led on by you, to win Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
conquer Kingdoms, and enlarge
at once the Fame and Limits of the
Empire, are now employ'd to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
innocent Virgins, and defend
their brutiſh Raviſhers. You may
eaſily gueſs by this, continues he,
that my requeſt is like to prove an
earneſt one; that you would pleaſe
to treat with ſome of thoſe ſoldiers
of yours, in whom you think you
have the greateſt Intereſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them to aſſiſt me in reſcuing
<hi>Theodora</hi> out of ſo infamous a Priſon,
and accept from me greater recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
for doing a handſom action,
than they can expect from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,
for doing a barbarous one;
I hope I need not tell you, in the
haſt this affair requires, that all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
care will be taken to keep you
from being endanger'd by <hi>Theodoras</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98345:19"/>
deliverance, nor will I add how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible
an Obligation you will lay
on me, to heighten my gratitude to
ſome proportion to your Favours;
becauſe I know it muſt neceſſarily
fall ſhort of them, and are due to a
perſon that loves to do gallant Actions
for their own ſake, and had rather
have great debts of gratitude, remain
due to him, than paid to him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall only mind you, that the
time is ſo ſhort, that if your aſſiſtance
be not as quick as obliging, I fear
'twill be as ineffectual. I ſhall quicken
you only by aſſuring you, that when
you act for the accompliſh'd <hi>Theodora,</hi>
you act for a perſon that has a Right
to all that Beauty and Vertue can give
one a Title to.</p>
               <p>With the ſame freedom, replies <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timius,</hi>
with which you have own'd
to me your Religion, I declare to
you, that mine is that of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and my Anceſtors; and that I
worſhip thoſe propitious Deities, that
have made the Romans the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98345:20"/>
of the World, and rewarded
thoſe that adored them with an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Monarchy; but though I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
approve ſo triumphant a
Religion, yet I confeſs to you, that I
do not like the waies that the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
takes to propogate it: ſuch cruel
methods being apt to make the world
ſuſpect, that our beſt Argument is
Force: And whilſt the Perſecutors
think it a glorious thing to ſee the
Temples fill'd at any rate; I had
rather ſee in them fewer but ſincere
Votaries, than have them throng'd
with ſuch puſillanimous Diſſemblers,
as would not come in, unleſs they
were Scar'd in, thither. And, though
Terrors and Torments work ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
upon the weaker ſort of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
yet the more reſolute do ſo often
deſpiſe them, that our Perſecutions
convert not thoſe unhappy perſons,
but frequently ſtagger many of our
own; and I confeſs freely to you,
<hi>Didymus,</hi> that all the Chriſtians Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
work leſs with me, than
our inhumane manner of confuting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98345:20"/>
them. But I do not only diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
but deteſt, this infamous
Practice of our Preſident; which
makes him looſe not the reſpect only
and the pitty, but the common Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
we owe to Women, and
think to do the Goddeſſes a ſervice,
by disfiguring their faireſt Images
here below, with the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Blemiſhes. I cannot bring my
ſelf to imagine, that ſuch gentle Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
can like ſuch barbarous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers,
who not only immolate to
them the lives of men, but what is
far more precious, the Vertue and
Honour of Women; for if I could
believe they like ſuch Sacrifices, I
ſhould think them unworthy any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
at all. You will eaſily there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Didymus,</hi> credit me, that I was
abſent when my ſoldiers were put by
the inſolent Judge, upon ſo mean an
employment. He durſt not have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to have obtruded it upon them,
had I been there; or if he had, I had
dared to uſe him as his inſolence had
deſerved. But without looſing time
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98345:21"/>
in paſſionate Expoſtulations, about
things made remedileſs, by being
paſt, let us ſpeedily apply our ſelves
to the reſcue of <hi>Theodora.</hi> For, though
I have heard ſtrange things of her,
and ſuch as made me think Fame a
great Flatterer, if not a frontleſs Liar,
yet I believe the Reports about <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
as I believe the Delphick Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
now that I find ſo undeniable
a Teſtimony of her merit, as her
being your Miſtreſs. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without delay, prepare ſome
Soldiers to aſſiſt you in her Reſcue,
and I cannot doubt the ſucceſs in an
attempt made to ſerve a diſtreſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and a generous Friend. If there
be occaſion, you need not doubt of
my more openly appearing for you.
For how highly ſoever ſuch an action
may provoke the Preſident, or even
the Emperour, I hope to let you ſee,
that you have truſted a Roman, a
perſon that had rather be the object,
than the miniſter of their Cruelties,
and would not be acceſſary to ſuch
a miſemployment of Abſolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98345:21"/>
to be made a Sharer in it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Septimius</hi> had ended theſe
words, he did, to prevent thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
he ſaw <hi>Didymus</hi> was
about to make him, take that gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Youth by the hand; and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him towards the place, where he
expected to find the Soldiers he moſt
confided in, he entertain'd him in the
way about the hopefulleſt Expedients
for the compaſſing of his admirable
Miſtreſſes Reſcue. And having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ſent for the two perſons, he
thought likelieſt to be prevail'd on,
to a convenient place, near to that
to which they had brought <hi>Theodora;</hi>
he brieflly, but pathetically, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, how much the brave
<hi>Didymus</hi> was his friend, and how
much he deſerv'd to be ſo, enflam'd
them with an indignation at the
ſavage Preſidents diſgracing them,
by ſo infamous an employment, as
they were now about; and then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
them of rewards from <hi>Dydimus,</hi>
ſuitable to the liberality of ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98345:22"/>
a Perſon: After which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
himſelf, to give <hi>Didymus</hi> a
ſhort account, how far he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
he left the reſt to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
by him; who prompted by
his native liberality, and his high
concern, did not ſtay to cheapen his
Miſtreſſes Liberty, but with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
Paſſion of a Lover, proffer'd them
more than even <hi>Septimius</hi>'s promiſes
gave them reaſon to expect: Nor
would he have declin'd to embrace
any Articles of Agreement, they could
have propos'd, though the parting
with his Life had been one, ſo <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doras</hi>
Deliverance were another.</p>
               <p>The ſence theſe ſoldiers had of the
affront put on them, by the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
joyn'd with the Ambition they
had to pleaſe their lov'd Commander,
and the gratitude his friends profus'd
Bounty had newly oblig'd them to;
made them quickly accommodate
<hi>Didymus</hi> with a military Habit, and
prepare ſome of their Comrades to
allow him the firſt admittance into
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98345:22"/>
her Chamber; partly by ſharing
ſome of the newly receiv'd Preſents
among them, and probably by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
him to them, when thus
prepar'd, as a perſon who having
been paſſionately in love with <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
and been ſcornfully ſlighted by
her, was deſirous at any rate, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
at once his appetite and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
And by this means, before
that ſhort time was expir'd, that had
been as an Act of Grace, allow'd
the diſconſolate Virgin, to deliberate
whether ſhe would yet comply with
the Judge; an entrance into her
Chamber was permitted to her
Lover; who (in order not only to
his preſent but further Deſign) had
purpoſely cloſed the vizor of his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met;
upon which ſcore, not being
knowable by his fair Miſtreſs, he
met with from her the reception we
have formerly related.</p>

            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98345:23"/>
               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>THough, in the ſad Condition
wherein our diſguis'd Lover,
found his deſolate Miſtreſs, her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and her fears, did ſomewhat
cloud her Beauty, yet they could not
hinder her looks from being ſo charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; majeſtick, as to create leſs pitty
than reſpect. Wherefore with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
wherein this was as viſible
as he could make it, he told her,
without approaching too near; Do
not, Madam, I beſeech you, add to
your other troubles, the apprehenſion,
that becauſe I appear in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of a Raviſher, I come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a Rape: <hi>Theodora</hi> is ſo great an
ornament to the Chriſtian Religion,
and her Purity is an ornament ſo dear
to <hi>Theodora,</hi> that Heaven will not
permit, either that <hi>Antioch</hi> ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98345:23"/>
be rob'd of one, or ſhe of the other.
And therefore, that Providence which
you have ſo generouſly truſted, has
ſent me to your reſcue, which after
the care I have taken to diſpoſe
things without doors, 'twill not be
difficult to compaſs, if you pleaſe to
make uſe of the Military Habit I have
brought hither, diſguiſe and convey
your ſelf hence. Nor need you
be ſolicitous, what will become of
me, for I am under the ſame care of
the ſame Providence, that now juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
your reliance on it, by providing
for your eſcape: And I that found
means to come in hither, may be
ſuccesful in attempting a Retreat, or
if I ſhould not ſucceed in it, I ſhall
not miſs the joy of paying my Duty,
where I had the moſt deſire and
cauſe to do it; and ſhall leave the
world with the ſatisfaction of having
highly oblig'd it, by the preſervation
of the moſt accompliſh'd Perſon in it.
And Madam, (continues <hi>Didymus)</hi> that
you may not doubt the willingneſs
or the intentions wherewith this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98345:24"/>
is made you, be pleas'd to know
that it comes from the now fortunate
<hi>Didymus,</hi> who juſtly thinks that in
aſpiring to your acceptance of it, he
does leſs proffer a ſervice, than beg a
favour, that will not only be a full
Recompence, but a high Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The name of <hi>Didymus,</hi> and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
ſo ſuitable to it, made by him
that aſſum'd it, ſoon diſſipated the
diſmal apprehenſions his habit, and
her circumſtances had given her:
She knew ſo well his Courage, his
Vertue, and his Love, that nothing
unlawful or mean, was to be fear'd;
but the boldeſt things, if they were
as noble as hazardous, might juſtly
be expected, from him: So that this
attempt did perhaps as much oblige
her, as it ſurpris'd her. Wherefore,
as ſoon as ſhe had recompos'd her
lately diſorder'd thoughts, ſhe told
him, with looks ſerene enough to let
him ſee how much ſhe truſted him;
This action, generous <hi>Didymus,</hi> is of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98345:24"/>
a nature ſo extraordinary, that my
ingratitude would be ſo too, if my
ſenſe of it were not. To own and
reſcue a perſecuted and affronted
Maid, and to do it with more hazard
than you need run in the Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to purchaſe Fame and Honours,
in an action ſo diſintereſſed, and ſo
unexampled, that I want words to
celebrate it, as well as merit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it, and power to requite it. But
I admire ſo rare an effect of Vertue,
(continues ſhe) can conſent to the
deſtruction of its Author. No, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Didymus,</hi> 'tis enough that the
vertues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> be treated as
crimes by the <hi>Romans:</hi> They muſt
not meet the like uſage from <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odora;</hi>
ſhe muſt not purchaſe a life,
that ſhe values as little her ſelf as
others have cauſe to do, at ſo high a
rate, as your partial Charity perſuades
you to ſet upon it. For even thoſe
that do now moſt pitty me, would
repine at the preſervation of my life,
if it ſhould coſt that of a Heroe. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,
if I ſhould deſignedly be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98345:25"/>
acceſſory to ſo great a Loſs: Which
accompanied with a publick Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and my own Reproaches for
my Ingratitude, would certainly
make that Life a Burden to me, that
at ſo dear a rate you would preſerve
as a Bleſſing. But—</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Theodora</hi> was going to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
when her griev'd Lover, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that if ſhe did ſo, ſhe might
make ſome Declaration unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Wiſhes, thought fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to prevent it, by ſaying to
her with a profound reſpect. Ah,
Madam, do not make your miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Compaſſion more cruel to me,
than the ſeverity of the <hi>Romans</hi>
themſelves, which we <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
juſtly Tax, can poſſibly be. For
they will but in a few moments take
away that Life, which you would at
once protract and render Miſerable.
Do not, I beſeech you, Madam,
(continues he) think my ſervices
Meritorious, becauſe they are paid
you in this place, and in your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98345:25"/>
Condition. No, Madam,
<hi>Theodora</hi> has Prerogatives enough,
to make many leſs unworthy
(though not more zealous) than
I, ambitious to ſerve her, in what
Circumſtances ſoever Providence
ſhall think fit to place her. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the <hi>Romans,</hi> that worſhip For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and Victory as Goddeſſes, and
find their Proſperity the powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
Argument to ſupport and ſpread
their Religion, may think of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
embrac'd for Conſcience ſake:
ſure we <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that adore a
Crucified Saviour, who, as he <hi>took
upon him the form of a Servant,</hi> was
put to Death between two Thieves,
as a Slave and a Malefactor too; ought
not to let any Perſecutions, or Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
leſſen our Veneration or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for thoſe that chuſe to Suffer for
him, and imitate as well as own
him, whatever it coſt them. Nor,
Madam, (purſues <hi>Didymus)</hi> needs
your having been brought to this
place, make you think your ſelf at
all diſhonour'd, in the Opinions of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98345:26"/>
thoſe that can make juſt Eſtimates of
things. They look on Sufferers for
truth with His undeceiveable Eyes,
that, by one of the Pen-men he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd,
having mention'd thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that for Religions ſake were <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd,
Deſtitute, Tormented, Affronted</hi>
forc'd in the Skins of Beaſts, to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
like them in Deſarts, and lodge
in Dens; Honours them with this
Character and Teſtimony, more
glorious than all the Panegyricks of
Orators, and Laurels of Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
That <hi>the World was not worthy
of them.</hi> And ſuch Judges will
think <hi>Venus</hi> an Infamous Courtezan,
though the <hi>Romans</hi> adore her in
their Temples; and will not think
<hi>Theodora</hi> the leſs excellent Perſon,
for having been condemn'd on the
ſcore of Vertue to a Scandalous place.
Honour were a mean thing, and not
worthy to have its loſs much fear'd,
or regretted; if we could forfeit it
without having forſaken Vertue; and
much more, if we could be depriv'd
of it for having cloſely follow'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98345:26"/>
Her. Nothing can blemiſh true
Reputation, that cannot be declin'd
without manifeſt injury to Religion,
which juſtifies our Acting whatever
it impoſes. The Angels themſelves
that were ſent to <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſcrupl'd
leſs to go even thither, then to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
him that made it their duty to
do ſo, nor were polluted by entering
into that abominable place; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
attempted by the brutiſh Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters
of it, carried thence the
Angelical Purity wherewith they
came thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Didymus</hi> thought fit to ſay what
has been repeated, that he might
Conſole ſo chaſt a Virgin as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
who had ſtill enjoy'd, as well
as merited, a ſpotleſs Reputation;
by aſſuring her, that the barbarous
Affront ſhe had been expos'd to, for
Conſtancy to her Religion, had not,
among unbyaſs'd Judges, leſſen'd
the high Eſteem her former Life had
juſtly given them of her Vertue.
But he would not diſcourſe long of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98345:27"/>
a Subject ſo Nice; that 'twas diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
not only to inſiſt on it, but ſo
much as to mention it, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uneaſie to ſo tender a Modeſty as
hers he was ſpeaking to. Upon
which account, paſſing on to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Argument, he told her, Theſe
things I have mention'd, Madam,
to let you ſee, how little I can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to merit by the Circumſtances
of the duty I pay you; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
how little you need ſcruple
to accept of my further Service,
without which my paſt Endeavours
will be uſeleſs to us both. And give
me leave to own to you, Madam,
that 'twas not without much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as well as ſurprize, that I heard
the incomparable <hi>Theodora</hi>'s Merit ſo
much injur'd, as to have the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
of my Life put into the
Ballance with that of hers, nay, and
made to Preponderate. Alas, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
there are Legions, that as well
as I dare expoſe their Lives to the
greateſt hazards, and run greater
dangers for ſome deſpicable pay, or a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98345:27"/>
ſew worthleſs Leaves, than I do to
ſerve my Religion, and the faireſt
Profeſſor of it. Every day affords
thouſands of ſuch Men as I: Elſe
the <hi>Roman</hi> Camps would not be ſo
frequently Recruited, and thoſe
Numbers that fall in Breaches, or
in Battels, would not have their
Rooms ſo ambitiouſly ſupplied, by
Men that ſee them do ſo. But ſuch
Perſons as attain to be both the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of their Religion, and the
Honour of their Sex, muſt be ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and are ſo Rare, that 'tis
not every Age that produces ſo much
as one of them. Such Exemplary
Ladies, do as well improve as eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the times and places they live in:
The reſpect and love Men have for
them, makes their good Counſels
very perſuaſive; the lovelineſs of
their Perſons is ſo diffus'd to their
Actions, as, by making Men forward
to take them for Examples, adds to
to their Vertues, both a great Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and a powerful Influence. That
<hi>Theodora</hi> is not only one of that ſmall
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98345:28"/>
Number, but eminent in it; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but her Preſence, could keep
it from being uneaſie for me to
evince. But, Madam, (continues
he) though in ſuch Circumſtances
as mine, your ſcrupulous Modeſty
may keep Men ſilent, yet it ought
not to keep them from being Juſt.
Your profound Humility may draw
a Curtain, that may hide your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
from your Eyes; but in the
Eyes of others, it cannot but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their Number, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
add to their Luſtre. You need
not therefore, Madam, (purſues he)
ſcruple to receive the Service I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to do you, upon an injurious
apprehenſion, that 'tis above Reward;
whilſt indeed it pretends not to any
at all, except the Satisfaction and
Honour, that will be inſeparable
from the performance it ſelf. Here
<hi>Didymus</hi> paus'd for ſome moments;
being ſenſible, how difficult a task
he was entering upon: Since 'twas,
without prejudicing his Love, to
own to his Miſtreſs her ſelf, that he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98345:28"/>
did not ſerve her upon the ſcore of
That. But however; the ſincerity of
his affection, and the great deſire he
had to make his perſuaſions preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
haſten'd him to prevent her
Anſwer, by thus proſecuting his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe:
'Tis true, Madam, that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doras</hi>
perfections did not miſs in me,
to have the operation that they are
wont to have, upon thoſe that enjoy
the opportunities of conſidering them:
and if ſhe had been in a diſtreſs greater
than that ſhe is now in, though her
Religion had not at all contributed
to bring her into it, I ſhould joyfully
have expos'd my ſelf, to a greater
hazard than I now run, to reſcue her
from it. But, Madam, that is not
our caſe; for that which now brings
me hither, is none of thoſe ſentiments,
that if I were poſſeſſor of a Crown,
would bring me to lay that and my
ſelf at your feet, and think my ſelf
more happy in your acceptance of it,
than in all the advantages and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
that could belong to it. For,
Madam, the reſolution that led me
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98345:29"/>
hither, was not inſpir'd by the fair,
but by the devout and vertuous <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora.</hi>
If ſhe had no Charms, but
thoſe that cannot be ſeen with bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Eyes, or if her viſible Beauty
were but moderate, or none at all; her
Exemplary Piety and Unſhaken Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
ſhining in ſuch extraordinary
Expreſſions of them, as ſhe has this
day given, would make me think my
ſelf unworthy of Life, if I ſhould ſtick
at hazarding it to ſave ſo precious a
one, as hers, and what I knew ſhe
would far more unwillingly looſe;
and thereby do ſome right to Divine
Providence, which, by ſo unexampled
a reliance on it, was thought in ſome
ſort engag'd to anſwer ſo uncommon
and entire a Truſt. After what ſhe
did for Chriſt, I did not think I could
do enough for her, if I did leſs than I
have endeavour'd to do. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Madam, (concludes he) I hope
as well as beg, that you will no longer
ſcruple to accept of that reſcue, that
Providence offers you, by an unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
and moſt wlling hand, but will
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98345:29"/>
to make uſe of this Military Garment
(at which words <hi>Dydimus</hi> with great
reſpect, pointed at His) and allow
my endeavours, by procuring your
ſafety, to ſecure my happineſs.</p>
               <p>To this moving Speech, the fair
perſon, that 'twas addreſs'd to, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
this calm Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Though the handſom and obliging
things you have been pleas'd to ſay,
Generous <hi>Didymus,</hi> have made all
the impreſſions on me that they ought
to have; yet I muſt, with your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
freely tell you, that they natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
afford an inference, quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to what you would conclude
from them; ſince, by diſcovering more
and more of your Gallantry &amp; Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
they let me ſtill further ſee, how
much the World would looſe, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
depriv'd of ſo much Vertue, and
how unexcuſable I, above all others,
ſhould be, if I ſhould be willingly
acceſſory to that loſs. Your too too
exceſſive Complements, I muſt not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98345:30"/>
pretend to anſwer; ſince 'twould be
too great a reflection on <hi>Your</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well as <hi>Mine,</hi> to think you
meant them for any thing more than
what I have call'd them. But in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the ſerious part of your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
I ſhall tell you, that, if I
had proceeded in what I was going
to ſay to you, when you interrupted
me, I had, perhaps, prevented ſome
of the things you have ſaid, by free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainting you (as I now mean
to do) with the ſtate of my Caſe,
and the intentions it ſuggeſted to
me. When the inhumane <hi>Preſident</hi>
(continues <hi>Theodora)</hi> had condemn'd
me, either to offer Sacrifice in an
Idol Temple, or be led away to this
infamous place; I was in ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
and agony as can hardly be
conceiv'd, eſpecially by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that is not of my Sex; for
Death it ſelf was thought too mild
an evil, to be one of thoſe, among
which I was condemn'd to make my
choice. On the one ſide; the infamy of
this deteſtable place was that which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98345:30"/>
I could not think on, without the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
horror and indignation: and
not only my Sex and Breeding, but
even the Dictates of more than one
Vertue, (Modeſty and Chaſtity) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
to highten my abhorrence of
it. But on the other ſide; I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
that I did not vow Obedience
to God with any exceptions or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves;
that I was both a Diſciple
and a Worſhipper of a Perſecuted
and Affronted Redeemer, for whom
(though there were not an infinite
Inequality between our Conditions)
I could not ſuffer more, than he had
already ſuffer'd for my ſake; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not only <hi>endur'd the Croſs,</hi> but
<hi>deſpis'd the Shame,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi>
inſolent Malice, and the <hi>Romans</hi>
Barbarous Cuſtom, had annexed to
it. And I thought that, perhaps,
Providence had led me into this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
to give me an Opportunity of
ſhewing, that I could do more
than die for Chriſt. But I muſt not
now trouble you, with the various
thoughts that diſtracted my Mind
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98345:31"/>
on this diſmal occaſion; on which
all that I could ſay, to thoſe that
rudely preſs'd me to give a poſitive
anſwer, was, that of the things
they propos'd, I plainly ſaw that
both were to be refus'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I could make choice of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But ſince I would make no
Election for my ſelf, their Malice
ſoon made one for me, of this deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
place. I was ſo confounded,
and as it were ſtunn'd, at the firſt
ſteps they forc'd me to take towards
it, that I ſcarce knew what to think,
or what I did; ſave that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered,
that Idolatry was in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Books repreſented as a moſt
odious, though Spiritual, Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that Apoſtacy would be my
own Crime, whereas the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of refuſing it, could make
me but the Object of anothers:
And remembring my ſelf to be a
Daughter of him, that againſt Hope
believed in Hope, to follow <hi>God's
Call,</hi> I did like him, <hi>Obey, not knowing
whither I went:</hi> Yet having this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98345:31"/>
that I acted according to
the Dictates of a well inform'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
ſo that, whatever the way
might prove, I need not fear to be
miſled by cloſely following an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Guide.</p>
               <p>Here the Chaſt Virgins words
were a little interrupted by the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tears, and the inevitable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure,
that were produc'd by
the ſad remembrance of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs'd
Condition ſhe was recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But having, as ſoon as ſhe was
able ſuppreſs'd, thoſe viſible effects of
her vertuous Grief, ſhe thus purſu'd
her Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Revolving theſe and the like
thoughts in my Mind, I arriv'd at
this infamous place. And being for
a while left alone in this Room, to
try whether yet I could be brought
to change my Mind; the nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of what I was to endure,
making it look more hideous to me,
than, till then, I thought 'twas poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98345:32"/>
for any thing to appear, made
me preſently think of flying for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
to the dark Sanctuary of Death;
and by diſpatching my ſelf drown
in my yet untainted Blood, both my
own diſmal fears, and my Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
brutiſh hopes. But then there
came into my mind, what I had been
often taught, and, whilſt I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd,
judg'd rational to believe,
of the unlawfulneſs of Killing ones
ſelf, upon any account whatſoever.
I conſider'd, that God, who made
our Love unto our ſelves, the ſtandard
of the affection we owe our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
in forbidding us to deſtroy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
Life, muſt be ſuppos'd much
more to prohibit us that violence
againſt our own. And if Fratricide
be juſtly liſted amongſt the blackeſt
Crimes, becauſe of that Relation the
ſlaughter'd perſons have to thoſe
that Kill them; how Criminal upon
that ſcore muſt be the Murder of our
ſelves, where the Relation is not
nearer, only becauſe 'tis too near, to
be properly any at all? The Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98345:32"/>
Author and abſolute Lord of
our Lives, having thought fit to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
us here in his Service, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
without violating our Duty to
him, deſert it until we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
his Errand, which is, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
him by our Lives; till loyalty
to his Truth, or his Commands,
convince us, that we may better
glorifie him by our Deaths. Such
Conſiderations as theſe would, I
hope, have reſtrain'd me from end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Life with a Crime; but the
thoughts of it were quickly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
by my remembering that in
this place, I was deſtitute of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to act it with. Wherefore
remembring that <hi>Daniel</hi> had been
preſerv'd, though not <hi>from</hi> the Lyons
Den, yet <hi>in</hi> it; and his three Friends
were not deliver'd from the Fiery
Furnace, till they had been caſt into
it; and having learned by thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
that no Succours can come
too late, that God deſigns for our
Reſcue, I betook my ſelf to Prayer,
as the moſt hopeful, as well as the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98345:33"/>
moſt innocent courſe, I could take;
and with an ardency, heighten'd with
the extremity of my Diſtreſs, I was
beſeeching God, though with the
loſs of my Life, to preſerve a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that by his Grace had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
kept unblemiſh'd, when your
unexpected entrance brought me a
return of thoſe Prayers, I had yet
ſcarce utter'd. Judge then, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Didymus</hi> (ſubjoyns <hi>Theodora)</hi>
by the Condition I was in, how
much I muſt think my ſelf Oblig'd,
by ſo brave and ſeaſonable an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to deliver me out of it.</p>
               <p>To ſerve ſo bright a Vertue, lodg'd
in ſo noble a Shrine, I thought, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(ſays <hi>Didymus,</hi> Interrupting
her) to be as much my Duty, as
to have found an Opportunity to do
it, is my Happineſs: and if you
pleaſe to permit me, as I now hope
you will, the Honour and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of compleating my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to deliver you; I ſhall much
more value my ſelf, upon the having
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98345:33"/>
paid you that Service (though it be
more proportionate to my power,
than to my deſires) than if I had
reſcued a <hi>Roman</hi> General, or for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
attempts, been made one my
ſelf.</p>
               <p>When Thanks are purchas'd by
Merit, replys <hi>Theodora,</hi> to diſclaim
a right to them, does not forfeit it,
but encreaſe it; nor need you make
me any new Profeſſions, ſince after
the Teſtimonies you have given me
already of your Vertues, and your
Friendſhip, I ſhould make my ſelf
unworthy of them, if I doubted of
their Reality, or Greatneſs. Yes;
<hi>Didymus,</hi> I believe what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
of the Diſintereſtedneſs of your
proceedings in the Reſcue of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of no greater Merit, than I can
pretend to: Since the Circumſtances
of your Attempt, make it appear
too generous to let me ſuſpect, that
the Aim of it was other than noble
too. And indeed, after what you
have done (continues She) it would
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98345:34"/>
ill become me to ſcruple to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
oblig'd by you, and therefore
I ſhall venture to make you a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
as ſoon as I ſhall have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
you with the Reaſons, 'tis
grounded on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Didymus</hi> being ſurpriz'd at this
welcom Declaration, was going
with Tranſports to aſſure Her, he
could deny her nothing, nor obey
her in any thing without Joy; when
ſhe prevented him, by thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Diſcourſe. You know, my
Generous Deliverer, that Virgins have
ſo great and clear a Right to keep
themſelves ſuch, againſt all outward
Aſſaults; that Monarchs themſelves
(whoſe Force is not to be by force
oppos'd, when it tends but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of our Lives) may be forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
reſiſted, when they ſtrive to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Violence to our Chaſtity. Since
then, an untainted Purity is a Jewel,
that the Poſſeſſors are allowed to
preſerve and defend, even by uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ways, if others will not ſerve;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98345:34"/>
and ſuch as would in other Caſes be
unwarrantable: Though I do not,
as I lately told you, think it lawful,
as many do, to ſecure Virginity by
Self-Murder; yet I cannot diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their Opinion, that allow a
Virgin in caſe of Extremity, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
that Death from anothers
hand, that ſhe is forbidden to give
her ſelf, with her own; ſince in ſuch
a Calamitous Condition, Heaven, by
debarring her all other ways of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
from Defilement, ſeems to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of this. And the Scripture
informs us, that though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Jonas</hi> held it unlawful to drown
himſelf, yet he perſuaded
thoſe that Sail'd with him,<note place="margin">Jonah 1. 12.</note>
to caſt him bound into
the Sea, when neither they nor he
expected he could out-live many
Minutes (as indeed 'twas not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Miracle that he did.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
purſues <hi>Theodora,</hi> if you will
perfect what you have ſo Obligingly
begun, you muſt lend me your Arm
and Sword, to free me by a ſpeedy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98345:35"/>
Death, from miſchiefs much greater
than it. The <hi>Romans</hi> will eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that my reſiſtance and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
tranſported you to a Revenge,
at which the barbarous uſage I have
receiv'd at their hands, makes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
they will be much offended:
The grant of my requeſt will not
hinder you from being, what you are
pleas'd to think a Title, <hi>Theodoras</hi>
Deliverer. For, in the eſtimation of
Equitable Judges, as well as in Hers,
'twill ſuffice to give you a right to
that Title, That you have deliver'd
her from her geateſt Calamity and
Danger. Nor will the good office I
deſire, be inconſiſtent with my obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Honour of Martyrdom:
St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, becauſe his bold
Zeal for the Laws of Religion, gave
the firſt riſe to thoſe Perſecutions that
terminated in his Death, is juſtly
reckon'd among Martyrs, though he
was privately beheaded in his Priſon,
at the ſolicitation of a Curtezan:
and if one willingly ſuffers death for
the Truth, or the Intereſt of Religion,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98345:35"/>
there needs not a Scaffold or a Stake,
and a publick Executioner, to make
ſuch a perſon a Martyr. And ſince
the Perſecutions that now make ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
of the Church, are like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
long; and ſince I am reſolv'd,
by Gods aſſiſtance, never to avoid
them, by any either unlawful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſom
way: the Eſcape you would
perſuade me to, would but for a
while delay thoſe Sufferings I ought
not to ſhun, and would make them
much leſs acceptable, by my having
endeavor'd to avoid them; eſpecially by
an action ſo mean, if not criminal too,
as to conſent to the loſs of an excellent
Perſon, that moſt generouſly expos'd
himſelf for my ſafety. Deny me not
therefore, concludes <hi>Theodora,</hi> with
Tears in her Eyes, the laſt requeſt I
ſhall ever make you; but by ſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Sword here, (at which
words ſhe pointed with bluſhes, at
her fair and innocent Breaſt) be
pleas'd, by one quick and charitable
Stroke, to perfect my deliverance,
without making me Stain it with the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98345:36"/>
Blood of my deliverer; free us both
from eminent Danger, <hi>me</hi> of being
Diſhonour'd, and <hi>you</hi> of being Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;
and by the ſame Act of
Friendſhip, ſecure me the Coronet
of Virginity, and procure me the
Crown of Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>Great was the Surpriſe, and greater
was the Trouble, wherewith <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
heard the concluſion of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe:
In anſwer to which, as ſoon
as his aſtoniſhment would permit him
to ſpeak; Ah Madam, ſays he, what
have you ever ſeen in the unfortunate
<hi>Didymus,</hi> that could tempt you to make
him ſo ſtrange a propoſition. That
I, whoſe Errand hither was to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
my Life in your Service, ſhould
my ſelf deſtroy the admirable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
I came to Reſcue; and that
<hi>Didymus</hi> ſhould imbrue his guilty
Hands in <hi>Theodora</hi>'s innocent Blood,
to ſave one drop of which, He
would gladly ſhed all his own. As
your Piety deſerves to be the Pattern
of more than one Age, ſo I doubt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98345:36"/>
not, but that in times very remote
from ours, your Memory will ſhine
as bright, as your Vertue and your
Eyes do now; and then, how hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Monſter muſt I appear to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
that will look upon me as
one, that could in a trice, paſs from
pretending to be your Deliverer, to be
really your Murderer; and this for
no other Reaſon, than that you
were pleas'd to manifeſt a great
concern for my Preſervation? And
pardon me, Madam, (continues
<hi>Didymus)</hi> if I tell you, that your
Generoſity makes you forget ſome
of your other Vertues, and even of
the Dictates of the Religion you
have hitherto adorn'd; Since your
Commands, if obey'd, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
me to commit a Crime, and
make you your ſelf, more than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory
to it. For, Madam, ſince
you acknowledg Self-Murder to be
unlawful, how can your Commands
give me a right to take from you, a
Life, that you have not power to
diſpoſe of? and what Excuſe can I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98345:37"/>
have, without ſo much as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of acting under Authority, to
deſtroy an Innocent Perſon? For,
Madam, ſince I am to declare, why
I preſume to do the thing in the
World I would leaſt be put upon, to
diſobey <hi>Theodora;</hi> give me leave to tell
you, that, ſhould I execute what you
require, the Action would not be
excuſable in either of us. For <hi>as
Adam</hi> ſinn'd in doing a forbidden
thing, though ſhe that prevail'd
with him to do it, <hi>Was firſt in the
Tranſgreſſion;</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
was torn in pieces by a Lion,
though he did what he was ſeduc'd
to, by the perſuaſions of a Prophet:
<hi>So</hi> the Scripture clearly condemns
<hi>David</hi> of Murder, becauſe he kill'd
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ria,</hi> though not with his own hand,
yet with the <hi>Sword of the Children
of Ammon:</hi> And the Scripture tells
us too, that God plagu'd the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
as the Text expreſſes it, <hi>They
made the Calf, that</hi> Aaron <hi>made.</hi>
And indeed, by whatever Hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98345:37"/>
Blood is ſhed, the Guilt of
it will light upon the Perſon that
procur'd it to be ſpilt. And to this
I muſt add, That ſince <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are
in ſome caſes, not only permitted,
but Exhorted, if not Commanded,
<hi>To lay down their Lives for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
The high value and concern,
I juſtly have for yours, makes me
conclude, that this is certainly one
of thoſe Caſes, and conſequently,
that I may lawfully offer you a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which you, perhaps, cannot
lawfully refuſe: Since Providence
has left you no other Innocent way,
than the acceptance of it, to eſcape
your preſent danger. And the guilt of
Self-Murder may, for ought I know,
be Contracted, not only by a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Act, but by an Inflexible refuſal
of the proffer'd means of Safety.
Pardon me, I beſeech you, Madam,
purſues <hi>Didymus,</hi> if the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
I have for ſuch a Perſon as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
has Extorted from me, a greater
plainneſs of Speech, than my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Reſpect for Her would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98345:38"/>
me, upon any other occaſion.
And becauſe I perceive that, that
which makes you moſt ſcruple to
grant my humble Requeſt, is, That
your Superlative Generoſity, and
what your Humility perſuades you
to think Gratitude, make you ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
for the preſervation of a Life,
hazarded for your ſake; I muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, Madam, that your Inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
will no way make proviſion
for my ſafety. For, if I ſhould be
Condemn'd by your cruel Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
to leave you expos'd to the
barbarous and defiling rudeneſs of
thoſe Brutiſh Satyrs, that impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
wait without, the regret and
ſhame, of having mis'd the Honour
of <hi>Theodora</hi>'s Reſcue, will give me
far greater Torments, than the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
can, for having effected it.
And I muſt add on this Occaſion,
Madam, (continues he, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome change of Colour and
Voice) that ſome Sentiments (which
though I think not this a fit time or
place to name, have been much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98345:38"/>
and Heightned, by what I
have this day had opportunity to
obſerve) have ſo faſt tied my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
to your Welfare, that the
preſence of my Soul is ſcarce more
neceſſary to my Life, than your
Safety is. Nor fancy, Madam, that
the belief I own of the unlawfulneſs
of Self-Murder, will ſecure my Life:
for there are other ways, to procure
Death to him that's weary of Life,
than his own Sword, or a draught
of Poyſon; ſince Paſſion alone,
when rais'd to a competent degree,
may do the office of either of thoſe.
And ſince Joy it ſelf, though the
moſt pleaſing and friendly of the
Paſſions, has by its Exceſs, prov'd
deſtructive of Mens Lives; why may
not Grief, and Shame, and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which are Paſſions more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and very unfriendly to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
be able to produce as fatal
Effects? And to ſhew you, Madam,
(continues <hi>Didymus)</hi> how much
reaſon I have to think, that your
Condition diſpenſes me from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98345:39"/>
the Dictates of your Generoſity,
let me.—But, before <hi>Didymus</hi>
had annex'd his Reaſons, a Noiſe
made without, gave him a hot
Allarm, and made him fear, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of ſome that waited without,
would not laſt very much longer;
and therefore addreſſing himſelf to
<hi>Theodora,</hi> with a Countenance as
Petitioning as his Words, and Eyes,
in which his Courage could ſcarce
repreſs the Tears: How long, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſays he, will you upon ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Scruples, neglect an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
whoſe Omiſſion will be Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable.
And how can you juſtifie
to God, the ſlighting the means His
Providence preſents you, of eaſily
ſecuring your Safety. Ah, Madam,
then (concludes <hi>Didymus)</hi> by one
quick and neceſſary Reſolve, regain
your Liberty, preſerve your Honour,
and ſecure your Life. But if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that has relation to your ſelf
alone will move you, be pleas'd to
reward the Services I have Eſſay'd
to do you, with the implor'd grant
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98345:39"/>
of your own Safety; and permit me
for this once, rather to Serve you
than Obey you. Nor need your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Solicitude for me, hinder, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard
your Reſolution: The World
will not blame a Spotleſs Virgin, for
doing what is neceſſary to keep Her
ſelf ſuch; nor look upon it as a part
of Ingratitude, to grant, to one that
has done his beſt to ſerve Her, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
that he is ſo ambitious
of, as to venture his Life to obtain it
at her Hands. In ſhort, Madam, for
the time allows me not a long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
if your Cruelty will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to prevent your Death;
Grief, and other Paſſions, will not
allow me to ſurvive it: And then,
(ſuppoſing I ſhould fail of making
retreat) would it not be a much
more happy Fate, that the conſtant
<hi>Didymus</hi> ſhould Die, for having ſav'd
the matchleſs <hi>Theodora,</hi> than for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
loſt Her?</p>

her, was grounded upon a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Error. And the noiſe that
had been made, in the outward room,
alarming her, at leaſt as much as it
had done him, let her ſee ſhe had no
further time left her to deliberate.
And therefore, being prevail'd with,
by ſupplications, made in ſo perſuaſive
a way, that it appear'd a far leſs
cruelty, even towards him, to accept,
than finally to refuſe, his offer: She
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98345:40"/>
firſt made her Bluſhes, and her ſilence
intimate her conſent, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
it more expreſly, by raiſing him,
and taking out of his hand what he
preſented to her. And to his joy
(which his foreſight that his ſucceſs
would be fatal to him, could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from being very great) ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from him inſtruction how to
put it on, and permitted him (though
not without ſtrange diſorder in her
mind and looks) to aſſiſt her: For as
it was abſolutely neceſſary to do it;
ſo he did it with all imaginable
care, to diſtreſs ſo nice a Modeſty, as
little as was poſſible: And therefore,
as ſoon as ever he had done that, with
all the reſpect and decency the place
and occaſion would by any means
permit, all that could be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, he left her to do herſelf,
withdrawing to a part of the room,
whence he could not ſee her. Which
Retreat he was induc'd to make, not
only out of civility and reſpect, but
perchance becauſe the dangers that
threat'n internal Chaſtity, have this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98345:41"/>
peculiar fate, that uſually thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are moſt careful to ſhun them,
that are the moſt reſolv'd, and the
beſt able, to ſurmount them.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the mutual Exchange of
their habits had made it decent for
them to diſcourſe together, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
Virgin, with Cheeks cover'd
with Bluſhes, and with looks ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging,
that they alone would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd
<hi>Didymus</hi> for any leſs ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
than that ſhe now receiv'd, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing
herſelf to her Benefactor;
If your Reaſons, ſaies ſhe, had not
convinc'd me, that I could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a crime free my ſelf from my
wretched Condition by death, and if
yet death were not the only way, by
which, if I decline your generous prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
I can poſſibly ſhun, what I far
more apprehend than death, diſhonor;
I ſhould not leave you in a danger,
wherein only your concern for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and for me, has engag'd you.
But I doubt not the ſame Charity,
that put you upon making me your
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98345:41"/>
generous proffer, and preſſing me not
to decline it, will make you pardon
a fault, to which your own Reaſons
and Importunity have made you
highly acceſſory; eſpecially ſince I
know you think a tenderneſs of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and an abhorrence of all Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to be things ſo allowable in a
Virgin, as very much extenuate, if
not juſtifie, what they require of her.
And indeed I ſhall do you but right,
when I thankfully acknowledge, that
in this whole tranſaction about my
Reſcue, your carriage has been ſuch,
as would leave me no doubt, if ever I
had been ſo unjuſt as to have any, of
the purity &amp; diſintereſtedneſs of your
intentions, by which I am not a
little confirm'd in the opinion I have
alwaies had, That Vertue may inſpire
as Noble and as Hazardous Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes,
as Paſſion can. I know that
in this daies work, you aim'd at high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Retributions than could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from one in my Condition.
But yet I think my ſelf oblig'd to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, That your Heroick Acts of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98345:42"/>
Vertue and Friendſhip, have not been
exercis'd towards a Perſon inſenſible
of them; but that your Merit, and
your Favors, have produc'd all the
eſteem and other Sentiments, which
they ought to produce, in a Perſon,
that is not altogether incapable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
and value them. And if the
Pray'rs of a diſconſolate Virgin, then
ſav'd by you, when all the reſt of the
World had abandon'd her, can have
any intereſt at the Throne of Grace;
they will obtain for you, Bleſſings as
great as your generoſity to me has
been; and not leſs laſting, than my
Senſe of it will be; and you will,
during a long protracted life, either
be allow'd quietly to enjoy the Glory,
your many meritorious Hazards of
it have purchas'd, or elſe be enabled
to find a happineſs in your very Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
by vertue of thoſe peculiar
Conſolations that are reſerv'd for a
perſecuted Condition; as anciently
Manna was vouchſafed the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
only whilſt they were Exiles in the
Wilderneſs. The quick ſucceſs God
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98345:42"/>
has been pleas'd to grant my Pray'rs
for my own deliverance, lets me not
deſpair to find him propitious, to
thoſe I ſhall with no leſs ardency put
up for yours: But if your Charity
ſhould expoſe you to further danger,
I ſolemnly promiſe you, that you
ſhall find, I have been inſtructed, as
well as oblig'd, by your generoſity,
and would not have left you expos'd
for my ſake, that I might ſhun any
danger that had threat'ned but my
life.</p>
               <p>And now the mournful Virgin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bid her accompliſh'd Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
a farewel, which probably
enough would prove the laſt; by a
manifeſt change in her countenance,
and the tone of her voice, and by the
multitude of tears that fell from her
fair Eyes, convinc'd him no leſs of
the trouble ſhe was in upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
than any verbal expreſſions
could do it; though ſhe ſaid to him,
in a moſt obliging manner, Farewel
my Generous Deliverer; and may
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98345:43"/>
that God, who ſees with what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy
I conſent to your danger,
free you happily from it, and richly
recompenſe that noble Charity that
led you into it. I hope we ſhall yet
ſee one another again upon Earth. I
am confident we ſhall meet joyfully
in Heaven; by which I muſt confeſs
my ſelf very highly favour'd, not only
in my Deliverance, but in the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it; ſince God makes me not
beholden for my Reſcue to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
perſon, but is pleas'd ſo to order
it, that I receive the greateſt of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Benefits, from the moſt Generous
of men.</p>
               <p>Madam, replies the much troubled
<hi>Didymus,</hi> your own unequal'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and the operation they
have had on me, make me ſo much
yours, that your wiſhing me happy,
does more towards the making me
ſo, than your humility will allow
you to be aware of. You have too
much Merit, Madam, to let the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
I have paid you, have a title to
any; and what I have had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98345:43"/>
to perform, is but what was
every brave man in <hi>Antioch</hi>'s duty to
endeavor. But if your Goodneſs will
needs make you think, that my poor
Services ſhould have another (for
they can ſcarce have a greater) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
than you have already
given them, by ſuffering them to cont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to your ſafety; and if you will
vouchſafe to allow the memory of
him that did them, a room in your
thoughts, (which is the happieſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it can aſpire to upon earth:) I
humbly beg your faithful ſervants
Image may be look'd on without any
troubleſom degree of pity; ſince his
condition will then need none, and
the Idea would very much miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Original, if <hi>it</hi> ſhould diſquiet
her, whom <hi>he</hi> never approach'd, but
to ſerve Her. 'Tis ſuitable, Madam,
to this frame of mind, that for <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doras</hi>
ſake I muſt now deny my ſelf ſo
much, as to haſten her departure,
leaſt ſome croſs accident ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it: At which words, looking on
her with a countenance that all his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98345:44"/>
Courage could not keep from a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernable
Change: Farewel, ſaid he,
incomparable <hi>Theodora,</hi> may you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
long the Ornament and the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of your Sex: And ſince we ſee
that ſome Fruits may be as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in Honey, as others in Brine
and Vinegar, may the height of your
Vertue be kept up, but the objects of
it ſo chang'd, that by a ſettled Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
you may henceforth haveoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to exerciſe your moderation
and your gratitude, inſtead of your
courage and your patience. Once
more Farewel, concludes he, unequal'd
<hi>Theodora;</hi> and may you live but with
as much Contentment, as if I ſuffer
for you, I ſhall die with Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Though theſe moving Expreſſions,
and the accent wherewith they were
deliver'd, did very ſenſibly touch a
perſon ſo well natur'd and grateful
as <hi>Theodora;</hi> yet ſhe thought the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
return ſhe could then make to
her Lover's diſcourſe, was, preſently
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98345:44"/>
to follow the advice he was ſo earneſt
to have her ſpeedily embrace. And
therefore, bidding him farewel only by
a look, wherein high degrees of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and gratitude were plainly ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
ſhe immediately diſpos'd herſelf
to quit that diſmal place: Which
then afforded a noble inſtance, how
little a great mind can be hindred
from diſcloſing it ſelf to be ſo, by the
Stage 'tis oblig'd to act upon. For
whilſt in divers of the ſtately Temples
of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Whores, (ſuch as <hi>Venus</hi>
and <hi>Flora,)</hi> and Raviſhers, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers,
(ſuch as <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars)</hi>
were ſolemnly ador'd; in an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Scene, dedicated to publick Luſt
and Violence; the ſtricteſt Chaſtity
was exercis'd, and Martyrdom it ſelf
was contended for.</p>
               <p>Having once ventur'd into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
room, That Providence, to
which ſhe had in ſuch diſcouraging
Circumſtances truſted her Virgin
Purity, would not leave the reſcue
of it, incompleat; but whilſt the wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98345:45"/>
Ruffians were eagerly contending,
who ſhould ſucceed the perſon they
took by the Habit to be <hi>Didymus,</hi> (and
whoſe face they did not wonder to
ſee muffled, preſently after ſo ſavage
an action as they ſuppos'd him to
have committed) brought her ſafely
out of that infamous Place. Whence,
by the leaſt frequented Paſſages ſhe
knew, ſhe was was quickly convey'd
to the houſe of her dear Friend <hi>Irene,</hi>
which happen'd to be nearer than
her own.</p>
               <p>There to avoid ſuſpicion, ſome of
her friends and relations were met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to lament her Captivity, and
join in Prayer to him that alone
could deliver her, to be directed by
God how they might (if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
contribute to her reſcue. But,
though their Prayers were probably
made with more zeal than hope, they
were not a little alarm'd, when look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out to ſee who knock'd at the
door, they ſaw, as they thought, a
Soldier, who would not have been
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98345:45"/>
quickly let in, if <hi>Irene</hi> had not preſum'd
it to be <hi>Didymus,</hi> who was coming to
offer his Service to his captivated Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.
But 'tis not eaſie to expreſs the
wonder and the joy, with which they
ſoon diſcover'd that this was not <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doras</hi>
Lover, but herſelf; whoſe
Beauty and her military Dreſs, would
have made her, had the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards
diſcover'd her, paſs for their <hi>Pallas.</hi>
Nor was ſuch a Habit, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
for a Virgin, unſuitable to
a Great, as well as Chaſt Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>But though her preſence never
needed the endearment of a Surpriſe,
yet the unexpectedneſs of it at that
time and place, added to the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports
it produc'd; eſpecially in <hi>Irene:</hi>
Who after a thouſand gratulations
and careſſes, at length begg'd in the
name of the impatient Company, to
know how the bleſſing they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in her freedom, was procur'd. To
which reaſonable requeſt ſhe anſwer'd,
by making a ſhort but faithful Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98345:46"/>
of what had occur'd ſince the
time ſhe was cited before the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
till ſhe came to take Sanctuary
among them; piouſly concluding,
that, as what ſhe had done not misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a Chriſtian, was altogether
by the aſſiſtance of Divine Grace, ſo
the ſuccour ſhe receiv'd to bring her
out of danger was by the Conduct
of Divine Providence, which in her
delivery made uſe of the high vertue
and generoſity of <hi>Didymus.</hi> This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
made the Company firſt return
Thanks and Praiſes to the Divine
Goodneſs, which were followed
by the celebrations of the happy
Inſtrument of it: every one, as it
were by turns, endeavouring to vye,
who ſhould moſt commend ſo ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
&amp; diſintereſſed a Lover. Nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
did <hi>Theodora</hi> her ſelf, inwardly
diſſent from that gratefull company.
For, though her modeſty and reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
kept her from declaring her Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as others did theirs; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
that was becauſe She thought,
that having given a Candid account
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98345:46"/>
of his deportment, her Narrative had
made her praiſes needleſs, the Hiſtory
it ſelf being indeed a Panegyric.</p>
               <p>After the Companies curioſity was
ſomewhat ſatisfied by what <hi>Theodora</hi>
had told them, and both <hi>Irene</hi> and
ſhe had made a requeſt to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that knew <hi>Dydimus</hi> well, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to bring them ſpeedy notice
of what had happened to him, or
was like to befall him: The two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Ladies retir'd to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Irene.</hi> There the pious <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odora,</hi>
having devoutly paid her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Thanks and Praiſe, for her
almoſt miraculous Deliverance, to the
Divine Author of it; ſhe was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
by her Friend, with Cloaths
befitting her Sex. Nor was it difficult
for <hi>Irene,</hi> (though on ſo ſudden an
occaſion) to furniſh her with a Habit
ſhe liked for beſides, that a Perſon
ſo ſhap'd and faſhioned as <hi>Theodora,</hi>
could make almoſt any dreſs Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
ſhe us'd to pity the mean vanity
of thoſe Ladies, that could be either
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98345:47"/>
Ambitious or Proud of what they
muſt owe to a Taylor or a Dreſſer,
and affected to be taken notice of,
not ſo much for what they are, as
for what they wear: And therefore,
tho' ſhe did not ſcrupulouſly decline
faſhionable Clothes becauſe they
were ſo; yet all the Ornaments that
paſs'd the limits of the modeſteſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
ſhe alwayes as little valu'd,
as ſhe needed them.</p>

               <p>BEfore this rare Couple return'd
to the reſt of the Company,
<hi>Irenes</hi> kindneſs for <hi>Didymus</hi> made her
think, ſhe ought not to looſe this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
of doing good offices to
her abſent Friend. And therefore
having (as ſhe eaſily might) brought
the diſcourſe to fall upon his late per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances;
I hope, Madam, ſayes
ſhe to <hi>Theodora,</hi> you are now ſatisfi'd,
that the Character I gave you of the
greatneſs of my Couſins Vertue, and
the Ardency of his Flame, was dictated
more by his Merit than my Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
I were very ungrateful, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Theodora,</hi> if I did not willingly
acknowledge his Generoſity to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
extraordinary, and that, as he
could not oblige me more highly
than he has done, ſo it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98345:48"/>
that he ſhould do it more hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly.</p>
               <p>I know, Madam, ſaith <hi>Irene,</hi> that
<hi>Theodora</hi> may freely chooſe among all
the illuſtrious Youth of <hi>Antioch,</hi> what
perſon ſhe would pleaſe to make hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py:
And, without conſidering her
leſs obvious, though more admirable,
Perfections; far leſs Beauty than ſhe
is Miſtreſs of, has in our times, given
the Poſſeſſors a ſhare in the Imperial
Throne, and perhaps too, plac'd them
upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Altars. But yet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
ſhe, ſince I have the honour to
know you too well, not to be confident,
that you value Piety and Vertue, and
a Flame regulated and excited by
them, above thoſe outward advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which weaker Spirits are influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd
by; I think I may preſume
to ſay; that I know not any perſon
in <hi>Antioch,</hi> to whom the fair <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
may with leſs Condeſcenſion
vouchſafe a Share in her Favour, than
to him, that had the happineſs to
give her ſo clear a proof, of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
the purity, and the diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtedneſs
of his Flame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:98345:48"/>
If I had not, reply's <hi>Theodora</hi> with
a ſomewhat diſſatisfy'd look, been
much ſurpriſed at the begining of
your Diſcourſe; I had immediately
ſtop'd you there: And lamented my
infelicity, that <hi>Irene,</hi> whom I
thought my ſelf happy in having for
my Friend, allows her ſelf what is ſo
repugnant to true friendſhip, as flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
is. I could, continues <hi>Theodora</hi>
without pauſing for fear of being pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vented;
eaſily, and with the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of many of the beſt Judges in
<hi>Antioch,</hi> return the fair <hi>Irene</hi> her own
Complements, if I thought fit to
imitate what I cannot approve.
And to Speak ſeriouſly, continues
She, neither you nor I, nor any of
our Sex, ought to think Skin-deep
Beauty as great a Bleſſing, as 'tis an
applauded one. For without our
fault, and in Spight of our care to
preſerve it, a Thouſand accidents
may, and time certainly will, ruine
the Lovelieſt Faces; and perhaps to
that degree, as not in the remains to
leave it credible that ever they were
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98345:49"/>
hanſom. 'Tis true that thoſe vain
Men, whoſe Paſſion maſters their
reaſon, are wont (for the moſt part
with deſigns we ought not to be
proud of) to Speak extravagant
things, and too often even prophane
Ones, of the beauties they profeſs
to adore. But though they really
meant (which they very ſeldom
do) all they ſay, in praiſe of thoſe
they repreſent as Goddeſſes; yet
I think a conſidering perſon will
ſcarce be very proud of receiving
that Title, from thoſe who can think
that a few Colours and Features
luckily mingled, are ſufficient to
make a Deity. An uncommon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Beauty, adds ſhe, expoſes
the owner to extraordinary troubles,
from the Envy of thoſe that want it,
and the Importunities of thoſe that
court it. And, without as much
caution and watchfulneſs as turn it
into a trouble, it too often proves a
ſtrong Temptation to thoſe that
admire it, and a dangerous Snare
to thoſe that poſſeſs it. And if I
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98345:49"/>
had the vanity to think, what you
would perſuade me to believe, I
ſhould yet take Beauty in a woman,
to be like a rich Perfume; which
though it be a thing very grateful in
moſt companies, and perhaps (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at firſt) very delightful to the
wearer, yet does often diſcompoſe,
not only ſtrangers ſhe chances to
converſe with, but the beſt Friend
ſhe has; and not ſeldom does miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
even to herſelf, by diſordering
her head, or caſting her into fits of
the mother. I beg your pardon,
Dear Madam, ſays the fair <hi>Irene,</hi>
with ſomewhat of ſadneſs in her
looks, that whilſt I had ſo much
Beauty in my eye and thoughts, I
forgot, that it was in <hi>Theodora</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
with a far greater and
ſcrupulous Humility; and I did not
apprehend that I could be thought
guilty of Flattery, ſo near to a witneſs
(at which words ſhe pointed to a
Looking-Glaſs, that hung up in the
Room) ready to juſtifie more than
I had occaſion to ſay. I will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98345:50"/>
acknowledge with you, that
the amiableneſs diſcoverable by the
Eyes of every gazer, is a thing far
leſs deſirable than deſired: And
procures the poſſeſſors more praiſe,
than it brings them happineſs. And
for my part, adds ſhe, if I had the
weakneſs to beleive my ſelf Miſtreſs
of what the folly of ſome had made
them flatter me with, yet I ſhould
not be over much pleas'd with a
Quality, that would add to thoſe
harms my frailty makes me guilty
of, thoſe which I never intended;
and makes Ladies ſo miſchievous,
to thoſe that moſt love them, that
even when they do not rob men of
their Innocency, they deprive them
of their Quiet. I confeſs therefore,
Madam, (continues <hi>Irene)</hi> that it
was injurious to inſiſt upon the
praiſes of a face, when, how little
ſoever it can be Match'd in its own
kind, 'tis accompanied with Several
Beauties of a much nobler kind.
But that which induc'd me to
ſpeak as I did, was, to let the fair
<hi>Theodora</hi> ſee, that I was juſtly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98345:50"/>
how great a thing I begg'd
for my Friend; when I implor'd
for him an intereſt in Her Favour.
And I do the leſs deſpair of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of your Goodneſs, both to
him and me, becauſe I beg them
for an abſent friend, who is not in
a condition to ſpeak for himſelf;
and who, as I perceiv'd by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
Relation you were pleas'd
to make, of his Carriage towards
you, declin'd making you any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
when his Services were ſo
happy as not to be uſeleſs to you.
His ſilence, anſwers <hi>Theodora,</hi> in
ſuch circumſtances, had more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
on me, than his paſſionateſt
ſolicitations would have produc'd.
But the thing, I preſume, you aim
at, for him, is of that moment to
me, that I cannot think fit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
of it, till we can do ſo with
more calmneſs and leiſure, than
we can at this time expect. You
know, <hi>Irene,</hi> that I have ſtill look'd
upon Marriage as one of the moſt
important Actions of Life: And,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98345:51"/>
though I think they have too mean
a notion of Happineſs and Miſery,
who imagine, that one Creature
can make either of them the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of another; yet I think, that
not only the dictates of diſcretion,
but thoſe of ſincerity and chaſtity,
oblige a woman to have a great
care, not to enter into ſo near and
indiſſoluble a Relation, upon any
grounds, that are not like to laſt as
long as it, (and conſequently, as
our lives:) And therefore, a woman
that reſolves to be what ſhe ſhould
be, when a wife, ought to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
much upon a Choice ſhe can
probably make but once; and not
needleſly venture to embarque her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on a Sea ſo infamous for fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Shipwracks, only becauſe ſhe
is offer'd a fine Ship to make the
long Voyage with. But, continues
the baſhful Virgin, (not without
ſome little diſorder in her looks)
ſince my dear <hi>Irene</hi> will needs make
uſe of the priviledge ſhe has, to
know more of my thoughts than
I would diſcloſe to any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſon
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98345:51"/>
in the world; our friendſhip
prevails with me to tell her, that
if I were altogether at my own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſal,
and could be induc'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſuch a change of condition, as
I have alwayes been averſe from; I
ſhould be more influenc'd in my
choice by the ſhining Vertues and
Extraordinary Services of <hi>Didymus,</hi>
than by all the Advantages that
either Titles, or Riches, or Dignities,
could give any of his Rivals. But,
my Dear <hi>Irene,</hi> (adds ſhe) we live
in ſuch times, and I, for my own
particular, am beſet with ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
that 'twere not only
very unreaſonable, but wildly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
for me to encreaſe my
Commerce with the World.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>Irene,</hi> continues ſhe, in my
opinion, a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> does not deſerve
to be happy, and a true one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think he is happy, whilſt the
Church of Chriſt is miſerable: At
leaſt, as far as outward Calamities
can make it. When I ſee the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98345:52"/>
over-run with Idolaters and
Perſecutors; when I ſee Raviſhers
and Whores, ador'd inſtately Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and the only Worſhippers of
the True God driven into Corners,
and purſu'd even thither; when I
ſee ſuch as God is pleas'd
to declare <hi>the World not to
be worthy of,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 38.</note> treated by
men as perſons not worthy to live in
the World; but daily expell'd out of
it, with ignominy and torments:
When I ſay, (adds <hi>Theodora,</hi>
with tears in her Eyes,) I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the general Deſolation of the
Church, and that I am like and
willing to be, not a meer Spectator,
but a ſuffering Actor, in this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy;
I cannot, in the midſt of Her
Sighs and Groans, liſten to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
Complements of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
think of reliſhing any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
that deſcends not from
a place too high for Perſecution to
reach. In theſe Sentiments, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins
ſhe, I am warranted, by no
leſs Authority that than of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98345:52"/>
who, though not unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to the Marriage State,
diſadviſes thoſe women that are
free, from entering into it, at leaſt
during the preſent diſtreſs; though
that were in his time, very much
inferiour to thoſe ſtraits we are
now reduc'd to. Yet, Madam,
ſayes <hi>Irene,</hi> thoſe expreſſions of
Friendſhip, that a Conjugal Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
invites, are not only made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
by it, but commendable;
and are as real duties of Piety, and
Vertue, as divers of the more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
Exerciſes of Religion. I
do not contradict that, replies <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
but look upon that very thing,
as a diſſwaſive, from the ſtate of
life, you would recommend. For,
if I could think fit, to enter into it, it
ſhould be with a reſolution, to do all
that becomes me in it. And in ſuch
a calamitous Time as we live in, I
could not do that, without coming
far more than I now am, within the
worlds reach; ſince I ſhould think
it my duty, and perhaps be engag'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98345:53"/>
upon another account, to have ſuch
apprehenſions for a near friends
danger, as my own would be unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of giving me. And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
I now enjoy, in a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to quit the world without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
would be deſtroy'd, or at
leaſt allay'd, by an uneaſineſs to
part with, what duty and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would, perhaps, too much faſten
me to. Here <hi>Irene</hi> was going to
interrupt her by an anſwer; when
her fair friend prevented her, by
thus continuing her diſcourſe: And
to me it ſeems very conſiderable,
that the Apoſtle I lately mentiond,
clearly enough intimates, that to
perſevere in a Virgin-State, in times
of Perſecution, gives thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it, the great advantage of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God more undiſtractedly; and
conſequently of being more entirely
and uninterruptedly imploy'd, in the
direct Contemplation and Services,
of an Object ſo Sublime, that our
mind cannot divert to another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſtooping to an inferiour one.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98345:53"/>
And though it be true, that the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a Relation, may rightfully
challenge a part of an engag'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
time and care; yet I ſee not
why one that has no need, ſhould
enter into a Relation, that would
make thoſe diſtracting Duties ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Irene</hi> found it ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to anſwer <hi>Theodoras</hi> Reaſons,
yet her kindneſs to her abſent friend,
made her unwilling to loſe the
opportunity their privacy gave her,
to make one attempt more in his
favour: Which ſhe did, by ſaying
to his excellent Miſtreſs; But ſhall
not the as faithful as unhappy <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymus,</hi>
be allow'd to hope, <hi>that</hi> if
once thoſe diſmal Clouds that pour
down ſhow'rs of Blood, ſhall be
happily blown over, he may have
a particular ſhare in the publick joy
and Tranquility; <hi>that</hi> his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
ſhal end with the Perſecutions
of the Church; <hi>that</hi> thoſe fatal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,
that are ſo deſtructive to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98345:54"/>
his happineſs, may ceaſe with their
occaſion; <hi>that Theodoras</hi> Severity
will not out live the <hi>Roman</hi> Cruelty;
and <hi>that</hi> her heart will not be the
laſt place, where the Emperours
cruel Edicts will continue to have a
fatal Operation.</p>
               <p>Alas <hi>Irene,</hi> ſays <hi>Theodora,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
troubled to be ſo preſs'd; how
unſeaſonably do you now diſcourſe
to me, about things relating to a
time, to which very probably my
life will never reach. For, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joines
She, to deal clearly with you;
I am ſo far from flattering my ſelf,
with an Expectation of thoſe Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon
dayes I wiſh you may live to
ſee, that I ſhall not be ſurpriz'd, if
this day prove the laſt I ſhall Spend
in this World. And if before Night,
I paſs thence into another; where
the frailty and Mortality, upon
which Marriage was founded, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
that condition of Life will have
no Place; but will be Succeded by
an Angelical State, where our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98345:54"/>
Friendſhips, as well as our Perſons,
will be Transfigur'd, and made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
more Perfect than they
can be here below.</p>

                  <hi>THeodora</hi> had Scarce made an
end of ſaying this, when her
Converſation with her fair Friend
was Interrupted, by the notice that
was given them of, the arrival of a
Gentleman of their Religion, who
brought ſome News that it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
them to know. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement
ſoon brought back
theſe two Excellent Ladies to the
reſt of the Company; to which this
Intelligent and Inquiſitive Perſon
was going to give an account, which
the Sadnes of his Looks prepar'd
them to find an unwelcom one.
However; they liſten'd to him with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98345:55"/>
great attention, as well as Concern:
and He after a ſhort Preamble,
briefly acquainted them with ſome
particulars, that will hereafter be
more fully related. But that which
he himſelf ſeem'd moſt mov'd at
the mention of, and which moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
his hearers, was this;
That when the Preſident had notice
of <hi>Theodora's</hi> eſcape, though there
wanted not ſome Generous Men,
that endeavour'd by ſeverall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to diſwade him from proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her any further; Yet he was
ſo far from being prevail'd with, to
Comply with ſo reaſonable a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he ſolemnly Proteſted,
that if ever he could get this Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
(as he was pleas'd to call,
that admirable Perſon) once more
into his power, he would never
ſtrive again to reclaim her by the
fear of Infamy, (a thing which,
ſaid he, I perceiv'd She deſpis'd)
but by the terrour of death; Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
as he added, that She would
not fly from an Altar, to a Scaffold,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98345:55"/>
a Stake; and reſolving, in caſe She
were inflexible, to Sacrifice her to
the indignation of thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cens'd
Deity's She had ſo Obſtinately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd.</p>
               <p>The former part of this Diſcourſe,
which related to <hi>Didymus,</hi> his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Miſtreſs heard not, with
out ſuch inward Commotions, that
in Spight of the Calmneſs and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs
of her temper, they clearly
enough diſclos'd themſelves in her
face, by ſeveral Changes of Colour,
which thoſe that had lately admir'd
the greatneſs of her Courage, could
not but aſcribe to that of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for her diſtreſſed Lover. But
when the Relator had concluded
that part of his Narrative, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
regarded her ſelf, tho' it
fill'd all the Auditors with grief
and terrour, <hi>Theodora</hi> ſeem'd to
have gain'd a new life; Since in her
looks, the viſible tokens of a deep
ſadneſs, were ſucceeded by no leſs
manifeſt Signs of joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:98345:56"/>
While the reſt of thoſe to whom
the Melancholy account was given,
were entertaining one another
with the reflections they made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; <hi>Irene</hi> having drawn her fair
friend aſide, was impatient to learn
the cauſe of that pleaſing change,
ſhe had obſerv'd in her looks.</p>
               <p>Whilſt, anſwers <hi>Theodora,</hi> I was
liſtening to the report of the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Danger, which the Generous
<hi>Didymus</hi> was Expos'd to for my
Sake, I could not but be Extreamly
Troubled, to find my Self reſtrain'd
from attempting his Reſcue, by the
manifeſs: Danger, of being by the
Barbarous Preſident ſent back to
the infamous place, whence your
vertuous friend had ventur'd ſo
much to free me: But now that
the Judge, by a Solemn Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
has tyed up his own hands
from tempting me, by ſo juſtifiable
a fear as that of Infamy; 'twas no
wonder, my Looks diſclos'd ſome
Tokens of a joy, grounded upon ſo
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98345:56"/>
welcom an opportunity to exerciſe
my Gratitude Without hazarding
my Honour.</p>
               <p>What? <hi>Theodora!</hi> ſaith <hi>Ierene,</hi>
as it were Thunder-ſtruck with
this unexpected anſwer; do you
put <hi>ſo</hi> ſmall a value upon that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Deliverance, that ſcarce an
hour ago you did ſo devoutly and
deſervedly give Thanks for, <hi>that</hi>
you will ſo ſoon ruſh into greater
dangers, than thoſe that requir'd
little leſs than a miracle to reſcue
you from them?</p>
               <p>I hope, replies calmly <hi>Theodora,</hi>
that I ſhall never forget, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a deep ſenſe remember, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
reſcue you ſpeak of. But I
take the moſt gracious part of that
Deliverance, to conſiſt in my being
reſcu'd from Diſhonour; and think
it would be much leſs obliging than
it is, if it debar'd me from the ſureſt
and directeſt ways to Glory; and if,
to preſerve my external Purity, it did
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98345:57"/>
condemn me to Ingratitude, towards
the meritorious Inſtrument of that
Preſervation.</p>
               <p>Our Lives, ſaith <hi>Irene,</hi> being
truſted to us, as well as vouchſaf'd
us, by God; are not ſo much at
our own diſpoſal, that 'tis allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for us to part with them, as
we think fit: And 'tis poſſible for
us to abandon them, not only when
we do directly and violently rid our
ſelves of them, but when we do
thoſe things, whoſe natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is an untimely Death.</p>
               <p>I believe with you, ſaith <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
that our Lives are to be
reckon'd among thoſe Goods that
we are entruſted with, rather as
Stewards than unaccountable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors;
and acknowledge too,
that certain actions, that do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
may yet criminally, tend to
their deſtruction. But I do not
think the care of our Lives is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to us, as that of our Souls
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98345:57"/>
is, with ſo indiſpenſable an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to keep them; that it can
never upon any terms whatſoever,
be lawful for us to looſe them. For,
I think Life to be a Talent, which
is indeed to be carefully husbanded
and preſerv'd; but is committed
to us, not ſo much to keep ſafe,
as to negotiate with; and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
to us in order to a condition
better than it ſelf. And therefore,
if Religion, or Vertue, require any
thing at our hands, which cannot
be perform'd without endangering,
or even looſing our Lives, in that
caſe to venture them, or to part with
them, is a duty; and conſequently
at leaſt a juſtifiable action: And this
purſues <hi>Theodora,</hi> I take to be my
caſe; who am ſummon'd by Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
to a juſt Promiſe, and by
Gratitude to an extraordinary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor,
to endeavour the ſaving
of an innocent Perſon, who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
on my account, and has
brought himſelf into a great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
only for having moſt obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98345:58"/>
Reſcu'd me from a greater.</p>
               <p>But what, replies <hi>Irene,</hi> if the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
you deſign, is far more likely
to deſtroy you, than to ſave <hi>Didymus?</hi>
For the barbarous Judge, is ſo
much an Enemy to all Chriſtians,
as ſuch, and ſo much incens'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
You, for your Eſcape, and
Him for having been the Author of
it; that the Cruelty of that inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
man, will make him gladly
deſtroy you both, as far as humane
pow'r and rage can do it. And ſo,
without preſerving to the Church
of <hi>Antioch,</hi> one of its Ornaments,
you will deprive it of another, and
a greater; by denying it the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
it might receive, by ſo laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Exemplary a Vertue, as
may juſtly be expected in a perſon
ſo pious, and ſo young, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Experience, anſwers <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
that this very day has afforded
me, forbids me to diſtruſt Divine
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98345:58"/>
Providence; and keeps me from
deſpairing to find my endeavors to
reſcue your Kinſman, ſuccesful; if
the Moſt Wiſe and Good, as well
as Abſolute Diſpoſer, of Events,
ſhall not think it leſs our advantage,
to be repriev'd than crown'd. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preſuming therefore, to foreſee
Events, 'tis my part to do what
God has vouchſafed to put into my
power: and 'tis not my duty to
reſcue <hi>Didymus,</hi> but it is to attempt
it; and thereby acquit my ſelf as
far as I am able, of what I owe to
my promiſe, and my gratitude. If
I had the vanity to think, adds ſhe,
that in a perſon of my Sex and
Frailties, ſuch a Church as that of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> could be much concern'd;
I ſhould think too, that the attempt
I am about to make, were the beſt
way to make my life ſomewhat
ſignificant. For, whereas our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Adverſaries are ſo blinded with
Prejudices, that they look upon
all we do or ſuffer for Chriſtianity,
as the effects of a kind of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98345:59"/>
Frenzy, that ſeizes us, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports
us, whenever the Articles of
our Faith are contended for: My
expoſing my ſelf to their fury, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than be wanting to the dictates
of Gratitude, which they, as well
as we, look on as a Moral Vertue,
may help to convince them, that
our love to Vertue is general, and
more diſintereſted, than they
thought it: Since Chriſtians can
venture and part with their Lives,
as well to ſhun Ingratitude, as to
reſiſt Idolatry.</p>
               <p>This gratitude, (replies <hi>Irene)</hi>
whoſe exceſs gives you and us, ſo
much trouble, is a relative thing;
and Benefits or Services receiv'd,
ought to be requited by Actions,
that are acceptable to thoſe, they
are deſign'd to gratify; but ſure,
not by ſuch, as we know will be
unwelcome to them. And therefore,
(continues ſhe) the faithfuleſt, and
moſt diſintereſted of your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
will be far more unhappy,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98345:59"/>
than the <hi>Roman</hi> Cruelty can make
him, <hi>if</hi> what he has done, doth not
convince you, that he can never
look upon any thing, as a favour
or retribution to him, that ſhall
deſtroy, or ſo much as endanger,
his adored Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>I were very unworthy, (rejoins
<hi>Theodora)</hi> if I did not think <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
capable of the higheſt Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that generoſity and friendſhip
can inſpire. But he is too juſt, to
forbid thoſe he loves, to aſpire to
ſome ſhare of thoſe noble Quality's;
upon whoſe account, I am to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
not ſo much what his Vertue
will reliſh, as what his condition
requires; there being a ſort of
Debts, to which mine to him belong,
that ought to be the more carefully
paid, the more frankly they are
remitted.</p>
               <p>The ſorrowful <hi>Irene,</hi> being exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
troubled, to ſee her endeavours
unſucceſsful, on an occaſion, upon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98345:60"/>
which of all others, ſhe moſt wiſh'd
to find them prevalent, was promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by her grief, to bring her Eyes
to the aſſiſtance of her Tongue;
and weeping, ſaid to her inflexible
Miſtreſs; If, Madam, you will not
have any compaſſion for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Theodora,</hi> at leaſt take ſome
pity upon the diſconſolate <hi>Irene;</hi>
and if her <hi>Arguments</hi> cannot move
you, be not at leaſt inexorable to
her <hi>Fears.</hi> You have, (continues
ſhe) vouchſaf'd me the honour of
your friendſhip, and the happineſs
of your converſation; and by both
theſe bleſſings, have given me ſo
much eſteem and kindneſs, for ſo
great a Benefactor, that if you deny
me, what I now implore, you will
turn the nobleſt parts of my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
upon Earth, into inſtruments
of my Infelicity; ſince, in a World
depriv'd of <hi>Theodora,</hi> the deſolate
<hi>Irene,</hi> will Languiſh, rather than
Live, if ſhe ſhould be able to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
ſo great a Loſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:98345:60"/>
                  <hi>Theodora,</hi> whoſe Reſolution and
good Nature were both of them
extraordinary, though ſhe had
courage enough to ſupport calmly
her own perſonal Sufferings, yet
ſhe had tenderneſs enough to be
very ſenſible of thoſe of her Friends.
And the moving expreſſions of the
ſorrowful <hi>Irene,</hi> together with the
Tears that accompany'd them,
made ſuch an impreſſion on her,
that though, having foreſeen this
Storm, it did not ſurprize her, yet
it did much diſtreſs her, and let her;
ſee, how many uneaſie Victories ſhe
was to gain, before ſhe could trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly
compleat that days work.
And though after a ſhort, but
ſharp, Conflict, between her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and her Reſolution, the latter
of them prevail'd, yet, 'twas not
without ſome Reluctancy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
that ſhe was able to return
this Anſwer. Ah, dear <hi>Irene,</hi> do
not exerciſe ſo much Cruelty your
ſelf, whilſt you reproach me for
being Cruel; and do not add to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98345:61"/>
the great affliction of parting with
ſuch a Friend as <hi>Irene,</hi> that of ſeeing
her ſo much troubled on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and of ſeeing myſelf neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to the uneaſie Task of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Requeſt of hers. If what I
owe to my Religion, and to your
generous Couſin, would ſuffer me
upon any terms, to alter the Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
it prompted me to; the delara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your deſire to have me do
it, would have made all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
you employ'd to perſwade
me to it, unneceſſary. 'Tis true,
that among Vertuous Friends, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
may challenge much, but not
to the prejudice of Conſcience and
Reputation. I hope our Friendſhip
is not, and am ſure it ought not to
be, barely a mutual fondneſs of
two young Virgins; but that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
had a gteater ſhare in making
and continuing it, than Sympathy
and Inclination had. And 'tis but
juſt, that a friendſhip, grounded
chiefly upon Vertue, ſhould be
govern'd and regulated by it. Per-Permit
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98345:61"/>
me therefore (purſues ſhe)
with that freedom and plainneſs,
that our Friendſhip allows, to put
you in mind, that in the ſtraits
wherein Providence has now pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
us, it calls upon us to conſider,
not only that we are <hi>Friends,</hi> but,
that we are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> too; who
ought in reaſon, as well for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
as our departed Friends,
to liſten to the Apoſtle of
us <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſs 4. 13.</note> who forbids
us, upon the removal of
thoſe we love, to give <hi>up our ſelves to
Sorrow, as thoſe that have no hope.</hi>
Indeed, if we were <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that
believe the Soul as mortal, as the
Body; or ſuch other Pagans, as
bury in the Graves of their Friends,
the hopes, or at leaſt the confidence,
of meeting them again: we could
ſcarce too bitterly deplore a Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that would certainly, or at
leaſt for ought we knew, prove an
Eternal one. But having, through
the goodneſs of God been embracers
of the Goſpel, and enabled, though
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98345:62"/>
but imperfectly, yet ſincerely, to
live according to its Dictates, and
be ready to die for its defence; the
ſame Grace may keep us from fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the time of our ſeparation
will be laſting enough, to bear any
conſiderable proportion to that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which will be allow'd us to
enjoy each others Company in.
And give me leave to tell you, <hi>Irene,</hi>
that I cannot rejoice at any expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
even of your kindneſs, that are
injurious to your Piety, and bring
your love of me, into a competition
with that, which ought to be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrallel'd
as its Object is. They
love a Creature too much, that
think it too good to be parted with,
for the Creators ſervice. 'Tis a
high injury to him, to think we
can loſe any thing for him, that he
cannot make us a rich amends for.
And I muſt not conceal my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that a Chriſtian diſparages both
himſelf and his profeſſion, if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
that any loſs can make him
unhappy, while he poſſeſſes the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98345:62"/>
favour of God. Wherefore, my
deareſt <hi>Irene,</hi> (concludes She) let
your Friendſhip alleviate <hi>my</hi> Grief,
by ſhewing me how handſomly
you bear <hi>your own;</hi> and prefer, I
beſeech you, upon this ſad occaſion,
the Exerciſe of the more <hi>generous,</hi>
to That of the more <hi>tender,</hi> Effects
of Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>Alas, Madam, ſays the diſtreſs'd
<hi>Irene,</hi> all the fine things you ſay to
comfort me, produce in me, an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
quite contrary to that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
by them; ſince they do but
the more diſcover the Excellency
and Kindneſs of the incomparable
Perſon I am going to be depriv'd
of; after whoſe company, I ſhall
find that of the reſt of the World,
too inſipid, ſo much as to divert
me: and therefore, if you will not
grant me the Bleſſing of Living
with you, at leaſt do not deny me
the ſatisfaction of Dying with you.
For, though Martyrdom be very
formidable to a frail Woman, yet
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98345:63"/>
Heaven is more deſirable to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;
and I ſhall not fear to take a
Scaffold or a Stake in my way, when
I travel to ſuch a Place, as That, in
ſuch Company as yours.</p>
               <p>You know, (replies <hi>Theodora)</hi>
as well I, that our Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to ſuffer Martyrdom,
when we are oblig'd to do it; but
forbidsus to thruſt ourſelves unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
upon ſo fatal and difficult
a work: The Apoſtles themſelves,
whoſe peculiar Office it was, to be
the Heralds and Champions of the
Goſpel, were commanded, when
they were perſecuted in one City,
to fly into another; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one of the moſt couragious of
them, to avoid needleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
dangers,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 25.</note> fled
to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus;</hi>
though to do ſo,
He was fain to be let down from
the wall of this Place in a Basket.
And 'tis but reaſonable, we ſhould
not, without a manifeſt Call of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98345:63"/>
venture upon a Conflict,
in which we do ſo much depend
upon extraordinary Aſſiſtances for
the Victory, that the ſame bold
Diſciple, that ſo confidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
our Saviour, that He would
die for Him, was in an hour or
two, the firſt that renounc'd him.
An inſpir'd Teacher, who was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
to be, as He afterwards
prov'd, a Martyr, reckons it to be
the Gift of God, not only to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Chriſt, but to Suffer for
that Belief. If (continues She) our
Conditions were exchang'd, and
<hi>Irene,</hi> inſtead of me, were by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence ſingl'd out for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom;
I ſhould not envy Her the
Glory, of letting many of both Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
ſee, that Chriſtianity can
elevate the Courage of a Woman,
to a degree that they think appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to Men. I would employ
my Prayers rather to obtain of
Heaven, a divine Support of Her
Reſolution, than an inglorious
Change of It. And imitating that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98345:64"/>
well natur'd <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> who, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
willingly but gladly, parted with
his dear <hi>Eſter,</hi> when She went
from Him to a Throne; I ſhould
be more ſatisfied with <hi>Irene's</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
than with Her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
And if I did not prefer Her
Happineſs to my Own, it would
be, becauſe indeed I ſhould look
upon them ſo united, that I ſhould
find Mine in Hers. Let me then
(ſays <hi>Theodora)</hi> conjure you, by all
Our paſt and future Friendſhip, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to congratulate, than lament,
the Remove I am going to make.
And be not troubled, that One
whom you have been pleas'd ſo
much to Love, is call'd to be early
happy. In ſuch hazardous times as
theſe, you know not how ſoon a
Perſecutor's Sword may ſend you
after Her. And at moſt, this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Life is too ſhort, to let our Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
be very long. And in the
mean time, the comfortable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of an unchangeable ſtate, of
whoſe Bleſſedneſs the renewed Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98345:64"/>
of each other, will make a
Part, and not the greateſt neither;
may Conſole you for the abſence of
a Perſon, that in the <hi>interim</hi> will be
happy enough to wiſh You where
She <hi>is,</hi> upon much juſter grounds
than you can wiſh Her where She
<hi>was.</hi> Let it then (concludes <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
with weeping eyes,) be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
proof of my Eſteem and Love
of <hi>Irene,</hi> that I part from Her with
Tears, when I am going to a Place,
where the Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
aſſure us,<note place="margin">Rev. 7. 17.</note> that <hi>all

               <p>THough theſe Reaſonings were
ſuch, as <hi>Irene</hi> knew not well
how to anſwer, yet, being uncapable
of acquieſcing in any Diſcourſe, that
inferr'd it to be her duty; to part
with <hi>Theodora;</hi> ſhe reſolv'd to try,
whether the perſwaſions of the
company, (which ſhe knew, would
be very forward to aſſiſt her) would
not be more prevalent, than hers
had been: And that ſeem'd an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
very. friendly to her deſign,
that juſt then happen'd, by the
arrival of an intelligent Gentleman,
whom ſhe had a while before em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
to learn News of her Friend;
and who, on that ſcore, had been a
curious and heedful Spectator, of
all that had paſs'd, at the preſidents,
in relation to <hi>Didymus,</hi> and was
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98345:65"/>
come to bring <hi>Irene</hi> an account of
it. To hear this, ſhe and her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
Friend were deſir'd to rejoin
the reſt of the company: To which,
the high and juſt eſteem they all
had of ſo brave a Gentleman, as
<hi>Didymus,</hi> gave an impatient deſire
to be inform'd of his Adventures.
To ſatisfie this Curioſity, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
that was to do it, did, after
a ſhort pauſe, make them the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Narrative.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe this company needs not
be informed by me, of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to the generous <hi>Didymus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the time, that the excellent
<hi>Theodora</hi> was condemn'd to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
place, and that wherein he
had the happineſs, of helping her
to make an eſcape out of it. And
therefore without waſting any of
that little time, whereof, I fear, we
may have but too great need, I ſhall
proceed to inform you, that when
this aſtoniſhment, occaſion'd by this
Surprize, of finding a Young man
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98345:66"/>
in the eſcap'd Virgins Room, was
a little over, and they had cloath'd
<hi>Didymus</hi> in a habit more decent, to
appear in, before a publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
they led him away to the Judge:
to whom ſome of them related,
maliciouſly enough, what had paſs'd
earneſtly begging Juſtice of him,
againſt a Perſon, who (they ſaid)
could not but be a Chriſtian; and
who was not content, to be himſelf
an Offender againſt the Laws, but
had dared to reſcue another Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
from the Puniſhment to which
they had doom'd her.</p>
               <p>Againſt this Charge, the undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Didymus</hi> being ask'd, what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
he had to make, addreſſing
himſelf to the Judge, made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
anſwer. I ſtand accus'd of
a twofold Crime, of being a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
and of <hi>Theodora</hi>'s Reſcue:
And though I cannot ſo ſoon have
forgot, how heinous my Accuſers
have endeavour'd to make them
appear, yet, inſtead of denying either
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98345:66"/>
of them, I ſhall own, that I glory
in both.</p>
               <p>As for Chriſtianity, in an Age, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is ſo cruelly Perſecuted, I would
not have embraced the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it, but that I was reſolv'd,
if there were occaſion, to ſuffer for
it. And therefore I ſhall neither
deny what they call a Crime, nor
make an Apology for it, nor depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
any <hi>Infliction,</hi> (for ſo I
call it, rather than <hi>Puniſhment,</hi>
which ſtill ſuppoſes a fault) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it can expoſe me. Nor could I,
without being wanting to the duty
of Humanity, refuſe my aſſiſtance,
to preſerve the purity of ſo noble a
Shrine of Chaſtity, as the Savage
deſigners of a Rape on <hi>Theodora,</hi>
were going barbarouſly to violate.
And the inward ſatisfaction of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done what became me on ſuch
occaſions, will ſupport me under
any Sufferings, that ſhall be drawn
upon me, but by my Loyalty to
perſecuted Truth, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
of diſtreſs'd Vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:98345:67"/>
The experience I have had, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
the <hi>Preſident)</hi> of the effects
of thoſe deſperate Errours, you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<hi>Religion,</hi> makes me inclinable
enough, to think, that you, as well as
many others of your wild Sect,
have both Madneſs and Impiety
enough, to put off the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as well as the other common
ſentiments, of Human Nature, and
fear <hi>Death,</hi> as little as you do the
<hi>Gods.</hi> But ſince you pretend to be
more vertuous Men, and obedient
Subjects, than others; pray tell me,
what you can ſay, for your reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Malefactor, out of the hands
of thoſe Miniſters of Juſtice, that
were going to Execute the ſentence
of Condemnation upon her.</p>
               <p>If, (replies <hi>Didymus)</hi> the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
you ſpeak of, had doom'd her
but to Death; though I ſhould moſt
gladly have ſuffer'd it in her ſtead,
yet I had deplor'd your Cruelty,
without attempting to defeat it.
But I confeſs, I could not without
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98345:67"/>
Indignation, as well as Grief, ſee
ſuch a perſon as <hi>Theodora,</hi> who for
her Beauty, Vertue, and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
is juſtly admir'd by all
that know her, and look'd upon as
the honour of her Sex; moſt injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
condemn'd to ſo infamous and
barbarous an uſage, as were unfit
for the meaneſt and deſpicableſt of
Creatures, that belong to the Sex,
(whereof ſhe is the Ornament.)
And conſidering with my ſelf, that
Chaſtity in Women, and eſpecially
in Virgins, is ſo much a Vertue,
and their right to preſerve it, ſo
confes'dly inhaerent, that all Nations
agree, in aſcribing to them a right
to defend it, without reſerve, againſt
whoſoever attempts to deprive them
of it; I concluded, that to help a
diſtreſſed Virgin to preſerve ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
a right, was to defeat
Raviſhers, rather than to oppoſe
Magiſtrates, and not commit a
Crime, but hinder the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one. Nor could I think, that
'twas againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Judges I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98345:68"/>
acted when I oppos'd Perſons, whom
their Savage deſign made me look
upon as the worſt ſort of <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
And I did not doubt Sir, (continues
<hi>Didymus)</hi> that in your own Breaſt,
when calmer thoughts ſhall come
there, to ſucceed thoſe that lately
poſſeſs'd it, I ſhall be abſolv'd from
an action, which kept you from
diſhonouring your ſelf as much, as
the execution of your Sentence
would have defil'd <hi>Theodora;</hi> and
kept you innocent as to Act, from
what would have made you Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
for ever, not only of the
faireſt half of Mankind, but of all
thoſe of our Sex, that retain any
Sparks either of Vertue, or good
Nature.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Theodora,</hi> (replies the <hi>Preſident)</hi>
were not a Beauty, and one of your
obſtinate Sect, I doubt you would
never, for her ſake, have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
upon ſo deſperate an Attempt,
as makes you, not more Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
than Obnoxious, to the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:98345:68"/>
I ſee not, Sir, (rejoins <hi>Didmuys)</hi>
why it ſhould be a diſparagement
to <hi>Theodora</hi>'s Beauty, or to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
I have receiv'd of it, that
all that it has engaged me to do,
has been, with the utmoſt hazard of
my Life, To reſcue her Purity, and
deny my ſelf, in the firſt place, the
advantages I endeavour'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
others of. But the Charms
of her Mind, needed not thoſe of
her Face, to make me attempt to
preſerve her. I have often in
Camps contended, not without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
enough, with my victorious
fellow-Soldiers, to keep them from
violating the Chaſtity of Captives,
who had neither Beauty to Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
others, nor any thing elſe to
engage me in their Quarrel, except
their being innocent and diſtreſſed
Women. But <hi>Theodora;</hi> ſetting
her Beauty and Birth aſide, has been
ſo eminent, for all the good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Excellencies that can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
a Perſon of her Sex, and
eſpecially, for her Chaſtity, that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98345:69"/>
my Heart would have reproach'd
mefor, not prizing Vertue enough,
if I had declin'd ſo happy an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
to expreſs the veneration I
paid ſo ſhining a one, as Hers. But,
(purſues <hi>Didymus)</hi> I would not by
what I have ſaid, be thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that my Religion had a ſhare
in the attempt I made to ſerve a
Perſon, that did ſo much adorn it,
and was ſo loyal to it. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Doctrine, among many other
excellent things, that it preſcribes
to its embracers, teaches them, that
in ſome caſes, among which ours
is compriz'd, they <hi>Ought
to lay down their Lives for
one another.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John, 3. 16.</note> But Sir,
(concludes <hi>Didymus)</hi> you may be
pleas'd to take notice, that what I
acted, was according to the Rules
of it too. For I did not oppoſe the
Execution of your cruel Sentence,
by force, but only prevented it by
an innocent Stratagem, whereby
my ends were obtain'd without
Bloodſhed or Violence; no Mans
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98345:69"/>
Life having been ſo much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd,
except my own; which
I never thought my ſelf bound to
preſerve from any Danger, that
Piety or Humanity ſummon'd me
to undertake.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Preſident</hi> could not
but be ſenſible, that <hi>Didymus</hi> had
ſaid more for himſelf, than was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
yet, that he might not be
thought to be ſatisfied with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of a Perſon, whom he meant
to condemn, he told him; I do not
think it ſtrange, that thoſe who
dare call the very Worſhip of the
Gods, <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and
and that which all Men but your
ſelves call Impiety, <hi>Religion,</hi> ſhould
ſtile <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;
Loyalty</hi> to the Truth. But
how induſtriouſly ſoever you ſtrive,
not only to cloak a Criminal action,
but transform it into a Vertuous
one; I can eaſily, through all its
diſguiſes, percieve the diſobedience
and refractorineſs to Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98345:70"/>
that is ſo contagious, and
ſo ſpred among the embracers of
your Sect; that Princes have no
other way, but your Ruine, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their own Safety, which would
be quickly endanger'd, if your
power and numbers were half as
great, as the diſloyalty of your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Practices.</p>
               <p>To be a Sufferer for my Religion,
(anſwers <hi>Didymus)</hi> is that, which
I ſhall not ſo properly ſubmit to,
with Reſignation, as Embrace, with
with Joy. But to find my Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſufferer with me, if not for
me; and to ſee Chriſtianity made a
State Crime, while it ſeverely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
and condemns all Crimes,
and none more expreſly, than diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the juſt commands of
Magiſtrates; is that, which, I confeſs,
do's not a little trouble me. And
therefore, Sir, I hope you will allow
a Perſon, that is much more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to keep his Religion than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
from being endanger'd by this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98345:70"/>
Accuſation; to give you a righter
apprehenſion, than our Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
have done, of the innocenteſt,
as well as the trueſt, Religion in
the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though</hi> for my part, (continues
<hi>Didymus)</hi> I think, that the liberty
of ſerving God, by ſuch ways as
are not repugnant to the Light, or
Laws of Nature, or the welfare of
civil Society's, is the common
right of Mankind, and cannot be
denied Man, without Injuſtice; <hi>yet</hi>
I do not now plead for it: and you
are more concern'd to look to that,
than I. For if you make me ſuffer,
for the innocent uſe of that Right,
which God and Nature have granted
unto all men; I ſhall but undergo
a Tranſient Puniſhment, but you
will expoſe your ſelf, to an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and (which is worſe) to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
one. No Perſons in the
World, can pay more Obedience
to the Laws of their Superiours,
than Chriſtians do. We that can
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98345:71"/>
ſhed the Enemies Blood, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
our own, as freely, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
as ſuccesfully, as any Soldiers
in your Armies, ſuffer you to ſhed
ours, as tamely as any ſheep you
have in your folds. And ſure, we
are very unhappy, as well as you
very incredulous, that thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
of Loyalty and Obedience,
that are not more viſibly written in
our Books, than frequently ſign'd
with our Blood, cannot gain
Credit with you; nor our death it
ſelf convince you, when the wounds
that we quietly ſuffer to pierce our
Breaſts, would open you Windows
into our hearts, if ſome had not a
greater mind to peirce them, than
to know them. But the ſame juſt
care we have to obey Authority,
what rate ſoever the ſubmiſſions
coſt us, forbids us to do thoſe things,
for the refuſal whereof, Authority
condemns us. For God being, as
the only Creator, ſo the Supreme
Governor of man, his Laws are
thoſe of the trueſt Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98345:71"/>
and Princes themſelves being
his Subjects, and but his Lieutenants
upon Earth; to decline their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
when ever they prove re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
unto his, is not ſo much an
Act of diſobedience to the Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
power, as of Loyalty to the
ſupreme and univerſal Sovereign.
And in ſuch caſes we are no more
Rebels againſt the Emperor, when
we prefer the performance of Gods
Laws, to a compliance with His,
than we ſhould be, in caſe we ſhould
diſobey the orders of the Governour
of the Province we live in, if they
ſhould prove repugnant to thoſe of
<hi>Auguſtus.</hi> And even in theſe caſes;
if we cannot yeild an <hi>active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to the commands of the civil
Sovereign, we do not refuſs him,
the utmoſt we can conſent to, which
is <hi>paſſive obedience:</hi> and when our
conſciences permit us not to do, thoſe
to us unlawful things, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
they enjoin us to ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtedly,
whatever penalty's he
pleaſes to impoſe. And give me
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98345:72"/>
leave Sir, to add, (ſo <hi>Dydimus</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues)
that we are ſo far, from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Religion a Cloak to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of preſent advantages, that you
daily ſee us renounce them all, and
our lives to boot, to maintain our
Loyalty to our Maker, without
hopes of being recompens'd, but in
another World; and even there we
cannot expect any, but by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a Judge, whom none can
either bribe or deceive, and who is
more ſevere to crimes, than any

I will not tell you, purſues
<hi>Dydimus,</hi> that on the other ſide, the
aſſurance we have of the ineſtimable
rewards laid up in heaven, for Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to God and his Truths, and
the internal applauſes of a good
conſcience, are things of ſo eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and ſatisfying a nature, that
our Religion can make the hearts it
poſſeſſes, not only deteſt the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe Subjects, that aſpire to
Earthly Crowns, but perhaps, pitty
the condition of thoſe Princes, that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98345:72"/>
poſſeſs them. But I dare, Sir, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow,
that the harmleſneſs of our
Principles, is not more legible in
our Profeſſion, than in our Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Sufferings. For the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is ſo great, that
[in your Cities, your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<note place="margin">Tertul.</note> your Courts of Juſtice,
your Camps, and all places
of Publick Reſort, except your
Temples, they are not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
but numerous;] and your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
as well as your Armies,
have been ſufficiently convinc'd,
they know as well how to Kill, as
Dye; ſo that 'tis only becauſe we
will not forfeit our Innocence, by a
forbidden way of defending it, that
we are expos'd to ſuch cruel Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
for it. And I doubt not but
equitable Eſtimators of things will
conclude, that our calmly ſubmiting
to ſuch inhuman Uſages, ſufficiently
ſhews, that we do not deſerve
them.</p>

The Judge, diſcerning ſtill more
clearly, that his diſcourſes made
much leſs impreſſions upon <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
than thoſe of <hi>Didymus</hi> did upon
the Hearers; reſolv'd to break off
this kind of Converſation, and with
a ſtern Countenance, told the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
that 'twas high time for
him to remember, that he was a
Judge, and not a Prieſt; and that
therefore, though his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
had hitherto invited him to
employ Perſuaſions, yet now their
unſuccesfulneſs oblig'd him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
poſitively, that he was ſure
the gods, that he and the world
worſhipp'd, were the true ones; and
that if <hi>Didymus</hi> did not forthwith
acknowledge them to be ſo, by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
to them, he ſhould quickly
feel their power, by being put to a
death, his obſtinacy made him both
deſerve, and appear fond of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Didymus,</hi> without ſeeming to be
at all mov'd at this rough Language,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98345:73"/>
calmly, as well as reſolutely, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd.</p>
               <p>Tho' Sir, I am moſt ready, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I am call'd to it, to Suffer for
my Religion, yet I would not be
thought to expoſe my ſelf, for an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
Denial, to hear and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what may be objected againſt
it. We <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whatever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
may be miſimputed to us,
are not ſo fond of Sufferings, or of
our own Conceits, as not to be
more willing to have them brought
to the Bar; than to be condemn'd
there for them: And perſecuted
Opinions are things, which, as we do
not renounce, ſo we do not embrace,
for their being ſuch. Nor are we
ſo blind and wilful, as to reject clear
Arguments, that would both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
us and reſcue us too, if any
ſuch could be propos'd, by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracers
of your Religion.</p>
               <p>This I ſay, Sir, continues <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
not to contradict what you
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98345:74"/>
were ſaying, of your being not a
Prieſt but a Judge; but to clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
from the imputation of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy,
and declare, that if we
could ſee Reaſons on your ſide, fitted
to deliver us from Error, and from
death, we would not be ſo mad, or ſo
perverſe, as to chuſe rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Life, than embrace Truth.
But pardon me, Sir, (ſubjoyns he)
if I think, that, though you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd
by the Supreme Power,
to be a Judge for Life and Death,
yet you are not conſtituted by the
Supreme Verity, a Judge of Truth
and Falſhood. And therefore, I take
your owning to worſhip many
Gods, who, by their very being many
Deities, are ſufficiently proved not
tobe true ones; for a Declaration
of <hi>your</hi> Opinion, not a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that it ought to be <hi>mine</hi> too.
If you preſs us with Arguments,
we are ready to anſwer yours, and
offer you ours: But when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of them, you employ Threats,
we do not think it proper to argue
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98345:74"/>
againſt them, but to deſpiſe them;
ſince 'tis not our Reaſon that they
Aſſault, but our Conſtancy. And
therefore, give me leave to tell you,
Sir, concludes <hi>Didymus,</hi> that the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion can ſo fortifie and
elevate the Mind, and place it ſo
much above the reach of a Political
Jurisdiction, that I ſhall ſuffer your
Sentence with far leſs trouble, than
you will ſoon or late feel, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of your having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
it; and you will not find
it in the power of all your executed
threats, to ruine either my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
or ſo much as my Joy.</p>
               <p>The Judge, enrag'd, to ſee his
Power thus deſpis'd, and as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
it, affronted, by a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner;
declar'd, he would defer no
longer than one hour (which ſpace
he allow'd him to repent his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
in,) to pronounce againſt him
the fatal Sentence, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to be immediately led to the
place, where 'twas to be executed;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98345:75"/>
towards which he himſelf intended
to follow at ſome diſtance: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were to feed his cruel Eyes
with a Spectacle, whoſe tragical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
his revenge would make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to him; or to prevent any
Tumult or Diſorders, that the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of <hi>Didymus,</hi> and the eſteem
and pity it had excited in the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

               <p>AS ſoon as the Gentleman, that
made the paſt Diſcourſe, had
ended it, the juſt Idea it form'd in
the minds of the hearers, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the two Ladies, of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Piety and heroick Courage
of <hi>Didymus,</hi> made ſuch an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the grateful &amp; compaſſionate
<hi>Theodora,</hi> as exceedingly heightned
her reſolution to reſcue him, if it
were poſſible, and haſt'ned her to
begin immediately to attempt it. In
order to which, having obſerv'd
that the hearers liſten'd ſo atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to what the Relator ſaid, that
they then minded nothing elſe, ſhe
took that nick of time to withdraw
herſelf ſilently, into another room;
and by a pair of back ſtairs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
herſelf out of the houſe:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98345:76"/>
Whence by indirect wayes, (for fear
of being overtaken in the ſhorteſt,)
ſhe went with as much haſt and
gladneſs, to an almoſt certain death,
as others are wont to ſhun and
eſcape it with; leaving <hi>Irene</hi> and
her other friends, no leſs amaz'd
than troubl'd, when ſometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
they perceiv'd her miſſing,
and found all the diligence they
employ'd to retrieve her, fruitleſs.
For, <hi>Theodora,</hi> fearing ſhe could
not long eſcape the diligence of her
Purſuers, unleſs ſhe haſten'd to a
place, where ſhe juſtly thought they
would not follow her; delay'd not
to go directly towards the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that ſhe was told attended the
<hi>Preſident,</hi> in the affairs that were
tranſacting in his Court. Among
theſe Attendants, ſhe had not ſtaid
long, before ſhe deſcry'd her brave
Lover, under a ſtrict and rude
Guard; but with a look ſo manly,
and ſo ſerene, as ſhew'd, that he
deſerv'd another uſage; and was
not in the leaſt daunted nor diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98345:76"/>
by that he met with. This
moving Sight, ſo affected the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
&amp; compaſſionate <hi>Theodora,</hi> that
tho' in ſo publick place and manner,
ſhe could with leſs reluctancy dye
for <hi>Didymus,</hi> than ſhe could plead for
him; yet her gratitude ſurmounting
her baſhfulneſs, after ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
within herſelf, ſhe made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Tribunal; to which ſhe
found a more eaſie paſſage than ſhe
expected. For, the advantagiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her ſhape and ſtature, and
gracefulneſs of her motions, eaſily
produc'd for her, ſuch Sentiments, in
the admiring by-ſtanders, as made
them with great reſpect, give her
way, &amp; let her, without diſturbance,
paſs on to the Bar. She had but a very
little while ſtaid there, before the
<hi>Preſident</hi> was mov'd, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of thoſe whom Curioſity and
Wonder invited to gaze on the fair
ſtranger, to caſt his eyes on Her;
and notwithſtanding the unlikeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
that ſhe ſhould appear there,
without having been Forcibly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98345:77"/>
brought thither; as ſoon as, out of
reſpect to his Dignity, ſhe had lifted
up her Veil, he diſcern'd that it was
ſhe, by a ſort of Beauty ſo peculiar,
as was not eaſily either to be met
with in others, or to be forgotten by
any that had ever ſeen it.</p>
               <p>But, though the Judge were
thus ſurpriz'd at her preſence, yet
he little leſs admir'd her Courage,
than her Beauty, when, with a
Face, wherein the Bluſhes of her
Cheeks, and the Aſſuredneſs of her
Looks, equally diſcover'd her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
and her Fearleſneſs, ſhe told
him: I know, Sir, that 'tis a very
unuſual thing, for a Perſon of my
Sex and Religion, to come to this
Place unſent for. But I hope you
will be pleas'd to conſider, that,
as the <hi>Action</hi> is extraordinary, the
<hi>Occaſion</hi> of it is ſo too. For both
Juſtice, the Virtue that you ſit here
to diſtribute; and Gratititude, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the higheſt Obligations,
engage me to appear before you,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98345:77"/>
on the behalf of that brave Priſoner,
(at which words ſhe pointed at <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymus,)</hi>
and preſent you the Object,
on which you may inflict with
Legal Juſtice, what you cannot
make him ſuffer, without being
tax'd of Cruelty. For ſuppoſing a
Debt to be due to the Law, yet it
would be more Severe than Juſt,
to proſecute the Security, now the
Principal offers to pay the Debt.
He may well be look'd upon as my
Hoſtage, whom I now come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem:
And 'tis not, Sir, your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
to decline the Exchange,
ſince by it you will preſerve a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
whoſe Courage, ingag'd by
his Gratitude, may do ſignal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in the Roman Army. And
ſince my Eſcape was all his Crime,
I beſeech you, let my ſurrender of
<hi>my ſelf,</hi> obtain <hi>his</hi> abſolution.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Theodora</hi> paus'd a while,
partly to recover from the Diſorder,
ſo unuſual and difficult an Effort of
her Modeſty had put her into; and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98345:78"/>
partly, to obſerve the Judges Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
upon his hearing what
ſhe had ſaid, and to take meaſures
thence in what ſhe was further to
ſpeak. The <hi>Preſident</hi> in the mean
time continued ſilent, whether the
longer to hear the muſick of her
Voice, or becauſe ſo many Charms,
as Nature had crouded in her Face,
and ſo much ſadneſs, as her concern
for her <hi>Lover</hi> had diſplay'd in her
Looks, had ſomewhat mollify'd
him, as they might have done a
Tiger. Whereupon the fair <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant,</hi>
hoping that his not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
her, proceeded from ſome
relenting Thoughts, reſumes her
Diſcourſe, in theſe terms. But if,
Sir, to procure the diſmiſſion of this
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> your Juſtice had need
to be ſeconded by your Clemency,
perhaps you never had, nor never
will have, an Object whoſe merit
may ſo well warrant the fulleſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of it. For his Life, ever ſince
he bore Arms, has been imploy'd
in the Service of his Princes, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98345:78"/>
fearleſsly hazarded for their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And the Action for which he is
now in trouble, is ſo Heroick, and
ſo diſintereſſed an one of Courage
and Compaſſion, that in it he could
ſcarce have any other motive, than
the Greatneſs of his <hi>Generoſity,</hi> nor
other End, than the Exerciſe
of it. Nor need you fear, that
your Clemency on this occaſion
ſhould introduce a bad Example;
for this of <hi>Didymus</hi> is never like to
be imitated, nor can be ſo, but by
Perſons too virtuous to be Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.
And if ſuch Actions be
Criminal, at leaſt 'tis unlikely they
will grow common Crimes. And
here <hi>Theodora,</hi> perceiving that the
impatient <hi>Didymus</hi> (now come
again to himſelf, after the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
ſurprize this Adventure
gave him) was upon the point to
interrupt her, ſhe thus prevents
him. And you, brave <hi>Didymus,</hi>
forbear to oppoſe the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my juſt Deſires. The
courſe that I now take, is the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98345:79"/>
only that I could take, to evidence
my Gratitude, and to let you ſee,
that you have not exercis'd the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
Acts of Generoſity and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
towards a Perſon inſenſible
of the Dictates of thoſe Vertues.
I could not (continues ſhe) but be
glad to be reſcu'd from the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny
of a Rape, but I did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be robb'd of the Glory of
Suffering for Chriſt; which is alſo
the only means left me to evince,
that I Declin'd Diſhonor, and not
Death, and never meant ſo much
to diſoblige the World, as for the
ſake of an inſignificant Maid, to
deprive it of one of the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of Men. You have left your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
but one way to encreaſe your
paſt favours, which is, to allow
me the only real Expreſſion I can
make of my ſenſe of them, &amp; that in
ſuch a way, as can, at moſt, but make
ſome little Diminution of them,
without pretending to make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
for them. If therefore (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
ſhe) you will compleat the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98345:79"/>
Obligation you have laid on me, by
preſerving to me the Coronet of
Virginity, you muſt not oppoſe my
obtaining the Crown of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Didymus</hi> had need of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
that he paid his admirable
Miſtreſs, to keep him thus long,
from interrupting a Diſcourſe, that
tended ſo little to his ſatisfaction;
and therefore ſhe had no ſooner put
a period to it, than (with a deep
ſigh) he told her; Ceaſe, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
ceaſe, to plead for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of Life, that you are almoſt
as cruel to <hi>me,</hi> in thus endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to preſerve, as you are, in thus
hazarding <hi>your own.</hi> And if I durſt
not hope for, from the <hi>Preſident,</hi>
more than I ſee I muſt on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
expect from <hi>You;</hi> I ſhould think
my ſelf as perfectly wretched, as
(whatever your Intentions be) your
proceedings are unkind. But I am
confident, our unbyas'd Judge is
too impartial, not to diſcern in your
Diſcourſe, that the exceſs of your
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98345:80"/>
Goodneſs, has had the chief inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in the management of your
Plea; the caſe about which <hi>we</hi> differ,
being in itſelf ſo clear, that alone
to ſtate it, is ſufficient to Plead it
on <hi>my</hi> Behalf. For, I entic'd you to
eſcape out of Priſon, and then, at
my own peril, facilitated to you the
means of doing ſo: You leave me
behind, as a Pawn to the Laws,
and theſe finding me in your room,
make their great Miniſter, before
whoſe Tribunal we ſtand, doom
<hi>me,</hi> for <hi>your</hi> Offence, to the Death
deſign'd for your Puniſhment:
Which ſince I joyfully proffer my
ſelf to ſuffer for you; or rather,
ſince you ſuffer it in me your Proxy;
the illuſtrious <hi>Preſident</hi> is too well
acquainted with his Office, to need
to be told, that, at leaſt in Equity,
the <hi>Surety</hi>'s Payment, diſcharges
the <hi>Principal</hi> from the Debt; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
when he not only proffers
the Payment, but moſt earneſtly
deſires the acceptance of It, as a
great advantage to him. I hope
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98345:80"/>
then, Great Sir, ſays he, (turning
himſelf to the <hi>Preſident,</hi> with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Reſpect to that he had ſhew'd
him before,) that you will accept
of <hi>my</hi> Life, inſtead of <hi>hers,</hi> who
deſerves a long and happy one;
and that, when my Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
ſhall be pronounc'd, and
gladly acquieſc'd in, it may Free
her, I am Condemn'd for. The
love of Self-preſervation is ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that it cannot be made Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
without affronting Nature, and
puniſhing as well what Men <hi>are,</hi>
as what they <hi>do:</hi> And the love of
Purity and Honour does ſo much
become a Chaſt Virgin, that the
natural conſequences of it are too
Commendable, to be fit to be made
Penal. 'Tis I, who having deſpis'd
Dangers that I might eaſily have
avoided, when 'twas Queſtion to
do an illegal thing, do yet glory in
the Crime, that am the juſt and
proper Object of the rigour of your
Laws: And her Years are yet ſo
tender, and her Diſpoſition ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98345:81"/>
that ſince, if ſhe have err'd, it
was by my perſuaſions, if ſhe be to
be puniſh'd, it ſhould be in my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
All that ſhe has ſince alledg'd
to appropriate my guilt, or involve
herſelf in it, will, I hope, by a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Magiſtrate be look'd on, as it is
indeed, as an argument of her gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
and not of her crime. And
the <hi>Romans</hi> are too much friends to
gallantry, to puniſh in a Lady, that
Vertue, that they applaud and
crown even in Soldiers.</p>
               <p>But now, continues <hi>Diydmus,</hi> I
muſt addreſs my ſelf to you, O
<hi>Theodora:</hi> And muſt complain of,
or at leaſt deplore, my infelicity;
that after I had done and ſuffer'd,
all that I could, though 'twas much
leſs than I would, For the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of ſo dear a Life as yours; you
come now to hazard it, to make
mine end with ſorrow. But grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you ſhould prevail, in the no
leſs unwelcom than generous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
you are pleas'd to make;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98345:81"/>
how cruel were you, to envy me at
once, the two higheſt Honors, that
my Ambition aſpir'd to; the Glory
of Martyrdom, and that of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doras</hi>
Reſcue? Had I as many lives,
as you have vertues, I ſhould eſteem
them all but a cheap ranſom for a
few hours of yours: So unlikely I
am, and ought to be, to be either
capable or deſirous, of being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
by your ſuffering for my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And therefore, Madam, if
you think my little Services deſerve
ſome recompence; ſince my higheſt
contentments on earth, terminate
in your happineſs, there is no other
way left you to reward them, but
the care of your own preſervation:
It being the only return that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
or deſire of my Services, that
you will not, by your inflexibleneſs,
finally make them fruitleſs; but
be content to live for his ſake, that
will rejoyce to dye for yours.</p>
               <p>All the while this noble Diſpute
laſted, the Judge was, though not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98345:82"/>
an unconcern'd, yet a ſilent Hearer
of it: The ſtrange novelty of the
conteſt, and no leſs extraordinary
generoſity and gracefulneſs of the
Contenders, having given him an
attention, that kept him from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
them. But when their
debate had proceeded thus far; his
ſtern nature, whoſe actings had been
but ſuſpended by his curioſity,
prompted him to tell the generous
Couple; I know not what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
makes you plead, as if
each of you were the others only
Judge, and had the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of condemning or abſolving
you; and I were only an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
auditor, or at leaſt, ſate here
to ratifie the Sentence you ſhall
agree upon, between your ſelves.
But you will quickly find, to your
coſt, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, and
Magiſtrates, are not to be trifled
with.</p>
               <p>Great Sir, replies <hi>Didymus,</hi> you
much miſapprehend our Conduct,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98345:82"/>
if you think your ſelf ſlighted by it:
For, 'twas not want of reſpect to
your Authority, and Power, that
made us diſcourſe as we did; but a
ſuppoſition, not injurious to you,
that you would in the exerciſe of
that Power, manifeſt that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it, by tempering it with two
excellent vertues, that beſt become
a Magiſtrate, Equity and Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
This preſumption, Sir, and not
any diſreſpectful one, was that
upon which we proceeded in our
diſcourſe; ſtill taking it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that you would not puniſh two,
for that which was indeed, but the
fault of one; and that if either of
us were, by the others conſent, to
ſuffer; your Equity, or your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
would prevail with you, to
releaſe the other.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Didymus,</hi> had worded
what he ſaid, ſo cautiouſly, that a
diſcerning hearer might perceive,
that his expreſſions related to the
Judges Dignity, not his perſon;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98345:83"/>
yet that ſelf-flattery, which is but
too common an attendant on Men
in Power, making the <hi>Preſident</hi>
take all theſe reſpectful words to
himſelf, made him allow <hi>Didymus,</hi>
without interruption, to proceed in
his diſcourſe, and ſay; you will
eaſily grant, Sir, that Goodneſs,
whereof Clemency is a noble part,
may bring a Magiſtrate, who is
Heavens Vice-gerent upon Earth,
as high a Veneration as Power or
Greatneſs does; if you pleaſe to
conſider, that thoſe of your Religion,
when they would with the moſt
deference ſpeak of God, give the
Title of <hi>Moſt Good</hi> the preference to
that of <hi>Moſt Great,</hi> ſtyling him, as
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> likewiſe often do,
<hi>Deus Optimus maximus.</hi> Certainly,
Clemency is never more a vertue,
nor leſs grudg'd at by Juſtice, than
when 'tis exercis'd towards Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Perſons, by reſcuing them from
the perſecutions of Fortune, and
the unintended rigour of the Laws.
I ſay <hi>unintended rigour,</hi> ſayes <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:98345:83"/>
for I cannot think that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Legiſlators, that have honor'd
injur'd Chaſtity ſo much in <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
and encourag'd Gallantry and
other Vertues, by no leſs than
Crowns and Triumphs; meant to
make the productions of <hi>Chaſtity,
Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> Criminal
things. And, tho' <hi>Chriſtians</hi> diſſent
from others in matters of Religion,
yet thoſe moral Vertues that were
ſo eſteem'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> do not
loſe their nature, when practis'd by
<hi>Chriſtians:</hi> And thoſe brave men,
whoſe love to Vertue made them
Maſters of the World, did not
ſcruple to honour it in their very
Enemies; and did it ſo much, even
in the moſt irreconcilable of them,
that more than one or two Statues
of <hi>Hannibal</hi> were erected
at <hi>Rome;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pliny.</note> to which Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
City 'tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
more glorious, to have thus
honor'd him, than vanquiſh'd him.
And ſure they that thought <hi>Lucretias</hi>
Chaſtity merited ſo many Statues,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98345:84"/>
would not think that <hi>Theodoras</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
a Stake or a Scaffold. This
Ladies actions and mine, are not ſo
hainous, but that in happier perſons,
and milder times, they have been
look'd on under a notion very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from that of criminal ones.
But Sir, continues <hi>Didymus,</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
himſelf to the <hi>Preſident,</hi> in a
very humble manner, if there muſt
needs be offer'd up ſome ſacrifice to
appeaſe the angry Laws, I beſeech
you to let their rigour be ſatisfied
with my Blood, and ſpare this
harmleſs Lady; to whom, if your
compaſſion be needful, I hope you
will not want it for an object, whoſe
Excellencies cannot only make it
reaſonable, but meritorious. For
it will preſerve to <hi>Antioch</hi> its faireſt
Ornament; and a Life ſo Exemplary,
that to give it an untimely period,
for actions, which, being laudable
in their own nature, nothing but a
rigid interpretation of the Law can
make criminal, would be to make
the Laws a terror, rather to the good
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98345:84"/>
than to the wicked. It would be
thought inhumane to treat her as
a delinquent, whom you may juſtly
wiſh your daughters ſhould reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
when by the Grant of what I
implore, you will be ſure to receive
both the thanks of her Sex, and the
applauſe of ours, and what out va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
both, the ſatisfaction of having
ſav'd and oblig'd one of the moſt
admirable Perſons in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Didymus</hi> now perceiving, that
the perſon he pleaded for, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
herſelf to interrupt him; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addreſs'd
himſelf to her, and told
her; do not, Madam, I beſeech
you, require of my obſequiouſneſs,
proofs inconſiſtent with my love;
and add not to my infelicity, by
putting me in ſo uneaſie a condition,
as to find it my duty to oppoſe your
deſires: Ah! refuſe not to oblige
the world, by preſerving the moſt
accompliſh'd it can glory in: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
me not the ſatisfaction, whereof
I am ſo ambitious, of being the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98345:85"/>
inſtrument of your deliverance;
and then I may ſay, that I never
could juſtly dye more ſeaſonably
than now, when being at the height
of all my joyes, my longer life muſt
of neceſſity give an ebb to my feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
ſince after the Glory of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſav'd <hi>Theodora,</hi> I hope for no
higher on Earth, than that of dying
for her. Then perceiving her ready
to renew the Conteſt, he told her
(with a low voice, that the Judge
might not hear him, and with a
ſadneſs in his looks, which ſhe, that
knew his Courage, could impute
to nothing but his almoſt boundleſs
concern for her;) Madam, though
the <hi>Preſidents</hi> impatience did not
call upon us to conclude our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
yet my condition and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ought to put a haſty period
to it: For, Madam, I muſt poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
declare to you, that it would
be as bootleſs as cruel, for you to
think to protect my Life, by the
abandoning of your own: Since to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98345:85"/>
owe a Life to that Cauſe, would
make it not only uneaſie but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
to me, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
uncapable of laſting. So
that enjoyning me to ſurvive you,
would condemn me to a Life, which
after the loſs of yours, muſt be ſpent,
if it could laſt, in fruitleſs deploring
that Loſs. Forbear therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
he, I moſt earneſtly beſeech
you Madam, to exact ſuch proofs of
my Obedience, that 'tis as little in
my power to give you, as it ought
to be in your will to require them;
ſince for <hi>Didymus</hi> to ſurvive <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
is as great an impoſſibility,
as it would be an unhappineſs. O
admirable Conteſt! where the noble
Antagoniſts did not ſtrive for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
but Death; or endeavour'd
to overcome each other, that the
Victor might periſh for the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd:
Where Self-love, the moſt
radical affection of human Nature,
is ſacrific'd to a Love, equally chaſt
and diſintereſs'd: And where Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98345:86"/>
makes each of the Contenders,
in geniouſly Solicitous to appear
Criminal, that the Antagoniſt may
be treated as innocent. How well
does this proceeding prove that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd
Sentence true, that <hi>Love is
Stronger than Death,</hi> ſince in this
Conflict, the generous Friends, are
by the former, made Rivals for the
latter?</p>

               <p>THE afflicted Virgin, to whom
theſe moving things were
ſaid, finding that ſhe ſhould but
loſe her diſwaſions on <hi>Didymus,</hi>
thought fit to addreſs herſelf once
more, to the <hi>Preſident;</hi> and with
humble Geſtures, accompany'd
with Looks, and with a Voice, that
would have ſoften'd any that were
not invincibly Obdurate, ſhe told
him; Though Sir, the Arguments
us'd by this Gentleman, had far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prov'd than they have, that, of
us two, he is the fitteſt perſon to be
condemn'd; yet I hope, where you
Preſide with ſo much Authority, he
will not fare the worſe for being
generous; and that what he has
done, will be more prevalent with
you, than what he has ſaid. Ever
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98345:87"/>
ſince he was capable of bearing
Arms, he employ'd them in the
ſervice of the Emperors; and in
their Camps chearfully follow'd
the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles, where-ever
they durſt fly: And after his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this day hazarded himſelf ſo
generouſly, out of compaſſion to a
diſtreſs'd Virgin; what examples
of gallantry may not be expected
from ſuch a Courage, engag'd by
his Gratitude, when he ſhall act
for the acqueſt of Glory, and the
Service of his Country? If a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
intention be neceſſary to make
an action ſo, his will not be found
to be Criminal; ſince he did not
intend the violation of any Law, but
to ſecond, what we are told to be,
the deſign of all juſt Laws; which
is, to protect the Innocent, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
Vertue. But if by a rigid
interpretation of the Law, he may
be brought within the reach of it;
I hope his Miſdemeanor will not
appear ſo great, but that your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
may allow him all that I
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98345:87"/>
beg for him, which is, that he may
be permitted to repair a miſtake in
the exerciſe of his vertue, by the
continuation of thoſe Services in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Army, which will be far
more uſeful to the publick than his
death, in his preſent circumſtances,
can be. To this <hi>Theodora</hi> would
perhaps have added, (though ſhe
could ſcarce have done it, without
ſome reluctancy from her modeſty)
The things, Sir, that he has been
pleas'd to act and hazard for me,
may perſuade you, that if, contrary
to my prayers and hopes, you
ſhould deſign ſeverity towards him,
you may more ſenſibly puniſh him,
by my death, than by more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
inflictions on himſelf. And
'tis like ſhe would have enforc'd her
arguments and intreaties, for a
Perſon for whom ſhe was ſo much
and ſo juſtly concern'd, when the
<hi>Preſident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> vex'd to find that both of
them ſo little valu'd Life, whoſe
deprivation was the moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
thing he could threaten them
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98345:88"/>
with, prevented her, by ſaying,
with a ſtern countenance, No, I will
hear no more, having heard but too
much already: It does not become
a <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate, to ſuffer any
longer with patience; that Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Criminals ſhould daring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſobey the Laws, ſlight all their
threats, and glory in their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
What each of you has ſaid
to prove himſelf guilty, affords abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
reaſon to condemn you both.
Wherefore, ſince you cannot agree
among your ſelves, I will be your
Umpire, and give both of you what
each deſires and merits. You, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
Maid, ſayes he, turning to
<hi>Theodora,</hi> ſhall dye for having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Priſon. You Diſobedient Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
ſayes he to <hi>Didymus,</hi> ſhall dye
for having perſwaded and further'd
her Eſcape. But to ſpecifie your
chiefeſt Crime, than which there
needs no other, nor can be a
greater, you both ſhall dye becauſe
you are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and conſequently
Enemies to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98345:88"/>
and the Gods that made them ſo.</p>
               <p>This fatal Doom being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd,
the Judge order'd the
condemn'd Priſoners to be taken
aſide, and ſtrongly guarded, till all
things were in readineſs for their
Execution: Which preparatives
he gave order to haſten. Yet
finding by the diſcontented looks,
and confus'd murmurs, of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders,
that the Charms and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
of <hi>Theodora,</hi> and the Youth,
Courage and Friendſhip, of both
the no leſs generous than unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Priſoners, made his Sentence o 
be far leſs lik'd, than were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
&amp; behavior of thoſe it had paſs'd
upon; declar'd, that whilſt he was
diſpatching other publick buſineſs,
he permitted any that ſhould have
Charity enough to make a hopeleſs
Attempt, to endeavour to convert
thoſe obſtinate miſcreants: Adding
withal an intimation, that even
they might ſpeed in their ſuit, if
they would ſeaſonably, with incenſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98345:89"/>
in their hands, flee to the Altars of
the Gods, and humbly implore of
Them, Pardon and Safety.</p>
               <p>This reſpite, as it expos'd the
generous Couple to have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
aſſaulted by Infidels, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of making ſuch illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
Proſelytes, ſo it gave them the
welcom opportunity, of interchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome diſcourſe with one another.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conferences were begun
by <hi>Didymus;</hi> who ſeeing himſelf
upon the point of final Separation
from his admirable Miſtreſs, could
not forbear feeling in himſelf ſuch
diſorders, as on all other ſad occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
his great Courage had kept
him from reſenting. And this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
commotion of mind, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
enough to oblige him to ſay,
to the fair Perſon that occaſion'd it;
Though, Madam, the military courſe
of life I have with ſome forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
purſu'd, has accuſtom'd me to
meet Death in variety of formidable
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98345:89"/>
Shapes and Dreſſes, without being
diſcompos'd by it; yet when I ſee
the world going to be rob'd of its
nobleſt Ornament, and my ſelf to
be depriv'd of the perſon I moſt
love and admire in it; and when
I ſee this matchleſs Perſon ready to
he raviſh'd from us, both in the
flow'r of her age, and by the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
hand of an Executioner; I
think it were rather ſtupidneſs not
to be afflicted, than any weakneſs
to be deeply ſo.</p>
               <p>I was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anſwer'd <hi>Theodora,</hi> ſo fully
ſatisfy'd before, of your Friendſhip
and Compaſſion; that this new
grief of yours, as 'tis a very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
proof of them, ſo 'tis a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcom
one. For, if I were to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
any thing to grieve me, when
I am entring into <hi>the fulneſs of Joy,</hi>
it ought to be, that I find your
good nature renders this ſeemingly
diſtreſs'd Condition of mine very
uneaſie to You; which through
Gods aſſiſtance, is very little ſo to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98345:90"/>
me; and yet will be leſs ſo, if, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating
rather than deploring
our Martyrdom, you will eaſe me
of the juſteſt and greateſt part of my
Grief, that conſiſts in being unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
acceſſory to yours, and ſeeing
you needleſly troubl'd at mine.
That circumſtance, adds ſhe, of
my death, which I perceive much
afflicts you, might in my opinion
more juſtly leſſen, than aggravate
your Sorrow. For, I look upon it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a Favour, than an Infelicity,
that I am early remov'd out of the
World, where I ſee, and ſuffer, and
(which is worſt of all) do, ſo much
Ill. To be early reſcu'd from the
Snares of a Dangerous and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
Age, and preſerv'd <hi>from the
Evil to come,</hi> is rather a Privilege,
than a Calamity, to thoſe that are
duely ſenſible, as I deſire to be,
that one can never arrive unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
at Heaven, nor be too early
happy. And, in this perſuaſion
(continues <hi>Theodora,)</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by conſidering, that the Firſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98345:90"/>
of thoſe who are recorded to have
religiouſly deceas'd, in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
and in the new, juſt <hi>Abel,</hi>
and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; both of them
dy'd young, and periſh'd by the
hands of thoſe that Perſecuted them
for their Piety. And even that
ſpotleſs Lamb of God <hi>who did no
ſin,</hi> but by his Satisfaction, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and Example, <hi>takes away the
ſin of the World;</hi> was ſacrific'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in the flow'r of his Age: So
little is it an unhappineſs, or a
mark of Gods disfavour, to eſcape
the toyles and dangers of a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
Navigation, by being early,
though by a boiſterous Wind,
blown into the Port. And, if it
could become a Woman to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
a Heroe, I ſhould exhort both
you and my ſelf too, generous <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymus,</hi>
(continues ſhe) to entertain
our preſent Condition with Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
becoming <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And,
as it does not trouble me directly,
ſo it ought not to trouble you upon
the ſcore of ſympathy; that I am
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98345:91"/>
ſecur'd from the hazards and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of Age: But be pleas'd
to make uſe of that Courage, now
at the end of your daies, that you
have conſtantly expreſs'd in the
courſe of your life. And, do not, I
beſeech you, repine, either that
you or I, is to fall by the hand of
an Executioner. For that ſeeming,
and but ſeeming Ignominy, was the
lot both of our Saviour's immediate
Harbinger, and of our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
And, when we conſider for
whom, and for what, we ſuffer;
we may find reaſon enough to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the ſentiments of the Apoſtles,
who, after having been miſus'd by
the Jewiſh Council, <hi>went from
their preſence rejoycing, that
they had been thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to Suffer for His name;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 5. 41.</note>
for whom we are going to ſuffer
the like things. For, <hi>Didymus,</hi>
Gods gracious Providence has not
left us to periſh, by ling'ring or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Sickneſs, or troubleſom
Old Age; nor yet for ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98345:91"/>
Cauſe, or ſome unimportant
End. But all in our fate is noble:
And what to others is meer Death,
a debt due to Nature, or the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Sin, to us is Martyrdom,
the nobleſt act of Chriſtianity, and
ſhorteſt way to Everlaſting Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>A Diſcourſe that reliſh'd ſo much
more of a Martyr than of a Virgin,
gave <hi>Didymus</hi> a riſe to continue a
Converſation, by which he found
himſelf as well aſſiſted, as charm'd;
and therefore obſerving the ſerenity
of his Miſtreſſes looks, to be little
inferiour to the beauty of her face,
and remembring what inſtances ſhe
had that day given of an altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extraordinary Piety and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
was, by the ſentiments theſe
reflections produ'cd in him, prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to tell her: I ſhould be juſtly
inconſolable, Madam, to ſee my
ſelf and the world, upon the point
of being depriv'd of ſo admirable a
Perſon, as <hi>Theodora</hi> has, by this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98345:92"/>
daies various Tryals, manifeſted Her
ſelf to be; if I were not confident,
that my Loſs will be as ſhort as
great; and that in the State we are
now entring upon, I ſhall be allow'd
what approaching Death will deny
me in this, and ſhall find in Heaven
the endearing happineſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
with Her more freely, than
our Perſecutions and Her Reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
would here permit. For Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
(continues He,) I am Friend
enough to my own Felicity, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
aſſuredly, that thoſe who ſhall
be happy enough to meet in Heaven,
will know one another there, and
have their joyes hightned by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of what paſt between
them upon Earth. For in the bleſt
State we are haſtening to, our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and conſequently our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
will not only be gratify'd
with Suitable Objects, but be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
by enlarg'd Capacities. And
even in a condition ſhort of that we
this day expect; mens knowledge
has been advanc'd, at leaſt as much
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98345:92"/>
as is neceſſary for our knowing one
another, without the helps that are
ordinarily requiſite to make us do
ſo. As ſoon as ever <hi>Adam</hi> ſaw <hi>Eve,</hi>
he could confidently ſay of her,
that <hi>ſhe was bone of his bone, and fleſh
of his fleſh.</hi> When <hi>Noah</hi> awak'd
from his Sleep, he could tell that
during his ſleep, his younger Son
had behav'd himſelf irreverently
towards him. When our <hi>Saviour</hi> was
tranfigur'd on <hi>M. Tabor,</hi> the three
chos'n diſciples that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him preſently knew
<hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 11. 4.</note> whom they
had never ſeen before,<note place="margin">Luke 9. 31.</note> in ſpite of the
Diguiſe that the Glory they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in put upon them.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells his <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 19, 20.</note> they ſhall be his
joy &amp; crown, before their common
Lord at his appearing: To the
truth of which it ſeems requiſite,
that both the Preachers and the
Converts ſhall be publickly known
at that great appearance, and <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the firſt born, whoſe names are
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98345:93"/>
written in Heaven;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that men there ſhall know one
another. Our Divine Redeemer,
continues <hi>Didymus,</hi> teaches us, that
there is Joy in the preſence of the
holy Angels over a repenting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
which argues, that whether
they know of his Converſion in a
more intuitive way, or by the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of thoſe Angels, that are ſome
times ſent to this lower world about
human affairs, they yet have a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of particular perſons, and take
notice of particular things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
them. And, which makes
exceedingly for my preſent purpoſe,
he elſewhere introduces <hi>Abraham</hi> in
Paradice, calling upon the unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Rich Man, to remember what
his own and <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s differing
States had been upon Earth: And,
which is yet more, to ſhew, that
even in the place of utter Darkneſs
and Torment, the Memory of paſt
things and perſons is not obliterated;
the Rich Man is introduc'd, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
not only <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98345:93"/>
his own five Brothers, and their
dangerous Condition.</p>
               <p>The pauſe that <hi>Didymus</hi> made,
after theſe words, invited <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
to tell him: Since, generous
<hi>Didymus,</hi> I have obſerv'd our ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Teachers to be of differing opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
about the Subject of your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe,
and that they do not look
upon it as an Article of Faith, either
that the Bleſſed do, or that they do
not, know one another in Heaven;
I preſume I may be allow'd to think,
that if they do, (which I know is
the moſt receiv'd Opinion) they do
it in likelihood with other ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than we commonly imagine.
For, when the beloved Diſciple
teaches, that, though <hi>we be here
the Children of God, it does not yet
appear what we ſhall be;</hi> and adds
only in general, that, <hi>when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
or that Bleſs'd State, <hi>ſhall
be manifeſted,</hi> we ſhall be like Him:
When, I ſay, I reflect on this, and
ſome things of the ſame import; I
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98345:94"/>
am prone to fear, that we judge too
much of our future glorious State, by
wrong meaſures, taken from our
preſent frail and mean Condition.
And I am apt to think, that we muſt
ſtay till we come to Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhall frame <hi>Ideas</hi> ſuitable
to the Prerogatives of its Bleſs'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
I think our Notions
will then be rais'd, as well as our
Duſt, and our Love, and other
Affections, will be transfigur'd, as
well as our Bodies. If we know
one another, though our mutual
Love may perhaps be greater than
it ever was on Earth, yet it will not
be upon the former Accounts; but
will be as well better grounded, as
better regulated. That external
Beauty, purſues the fair Speaker,
that here is ſo much doted on and
overvalu'd, will there be found ſo
much inferiour to that of every
Glorify'd Body, that the difference
and degrees of it will be very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
and unable to make dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
impreſſions on thoſe that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98345:94"/>
ſhall remember them: As the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgent
ſplendor of the Sun obſcures
all the Stars, and keeps our eyes
from being any more affected by
the greateſt and brighteſt, than by
any of the reſt. So that our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to one another will be very
little grounded upon External Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which will there either ceaſe,
or be eclips'd; nor upon ſecular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
which will there affect us
far leſs, than our being nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to our common Lord; our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
to whom will be the
chief, as well as juſteſt Ground
of our mutual eſteem and affection.
When Children of the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
have been early parted, and
long bred in diſtant places; though
when they are grown men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
they chance to meet again,
'tis obſerv'd, that at firſt they know
not one another any more than meer
ſtrangers: and when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of their Relation, 'tis not the
little accidents that happen'd to
them at play; nor ſome features,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98345:95"/>
that perhaps pleas'd one of them
in the others Face, but are now
very much chang'd by Time and
Growth; that produce their new
kindneſs: but the knowledge that
they are Children of the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and their finding in each other
perſonal qualities, fit to adorn their
preſent State, and thereby to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
kindneſs and eſteem. And if
ſome years abſence can produce ſo
great a Change, as to make our
neareſt Relations unknowable by
us; and make us look with pity, on
the fondneſſes that trifles produc'd
in us in our infancy: What Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
may we think, muſt be made on
thoſe that convers'd together upon
Earth, when after numerous ages,
they ſhall meet in Heaven, with
minds as much chang'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
as their bodies will then be?
Shall we not by the grounds of a
vertuous Complacency, be more
affected and united, than we are
now by natural Relations, or by
external Beauty, and thoſe other
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98345:95"/>

as to think, that pure and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Affections cannot be admitted
into Heaven; ſince the Scripture
informs us, that not only Joy &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
are to be found even among the
Angels, (who are ſaid to rejoyce at
a ſinners Converſion, and deſire to
pry into the Myſteries of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion)
but Care and Actings for
oppoſite Ends; (as when the Angel
of <hi>Perſia</hi> withſtood <hi>Michael,</hi>
and the Angel that talk'd
to <hi>Daniel.)</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 10. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I do not abſolutely deny, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
replies, that the Bleſſed know
one another in Heaven. And, ſaies
ſhe, with a light change of colour,
I am ſo far inclin'nd to believe it is
true, as, for <hi>Didymus</hi>'s ſake, to wiſh
it ſo. But, as I lately told you, I am
not apt to think, the ſentiments oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98345:96"/>
by that knowledge, will be
ſuch as moſt men imagine. Beſides
thoſe Reaſons that you have inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly
laid together, I think your
perſwaſion of the Saints mutual
knowledge the more probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſeems not readily concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
how at the great Day of
Judgement, the Juſtice of God, in
rewarding and puniſhing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Vertues and Crimes, can be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
to the world, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovering
the Perſons by whom
they were perform'd: Since Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Circumſtances do very much
alter the nature of moral Actions.
And ſince the happy reſidents in
heav'n, will have an eternity alow'd
them to converſe with one another
in; it ſeems highly probable, that
in their various Conferences, they
will meet with, at leaſt ſometime
or other, occaſions, that by leſs
ſagacity than their enlightened
minds will then be endow'd with,
may be improv'd to the diſcovery
of the Perſons they were formerly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98345:96"/>
acquainted with. But on the other
ſide, (continues <hi>Theodora)</hi> we
ſhall have ſuch noble and charming
Entertainments to employ our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
as will engroſs it from the
little and deſpicable Objects, (as
we ſhall then think them) that
now amuſe or buſie us; as when
we behold ſuch a pompous Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
as a <hi>Roman</hi> Triumph, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of ſplendid and magnificent
Objects, that Succeſſively preſent
themſelves to our view, make us ſo
intent upon thoſe ſurprizing Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles,
that even the neareſt and
deareſt Relations, though perhaps
gazing at the ſame Sight, out of
the ſame windows, are apt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
one another. And (continues
ſhe) even when the Saints actually
know and remember one another,
they may love and converſe, upon
terms very differing from thoſe,
that were ſuitable to their mortal
Condition. Yes, <hi>Didymus,</hi> (adds ſhe)
<hi>As</hi> there will be no ſuch difference
of Ages and Sexes, in Heaven, as
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98345:97"/>
there are on Earth; ſince all ſhall
there be <hi>like the Angels,</hi> and have
<hi>Bodies conform'd to the Glorious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of their Redeemer: So,</hi> the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Friendſhips, that will be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
in that happy Place, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their meaſures from the new
and perſonal Excellencies of the
Friends; from their being Rivals
in the Love of God; and from their
differing degrees of reſemblance to
Him, that is the <hi>Brightneſs of his
Glory, and the expreſs Image of His
Perſon.</hi> But, concludes <hi>Theodora,</hi>
we need not ſpend more time in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſing
conjecturally about Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
wherein the Change, we are
now going to make, will ſoon bring
us to be reſolv'd. And in the
mean time, we may well reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd,
with this aſſurance, That
ſince Heaven is a Place, or State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where we ſhall be Bleſs'd with the
<hi>Fulneſs of Joy;</hi> to know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with each other, will be there
found, either a part of our Felicity,
or not neceſſary to it.</p>

an Officer, whom his own

ſympathize with a Perſon, in whom
he ſaw that Quality ſo Eminent,
thought himſelf oblig'd to attempt
the diſwading him, from perſiſting
in ſo fatal a Reſolution as he had
taken. Wherefore, approaching our
Martyr, with very obliging looks and
geſtures, and drawing him aſide, The
Gods, ſayes he, can bear me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98345:98"/>
generous Youth, that 'tis not
without ſome amazement, and more
trouble, than any affliction of my
own has been wont to give me,
that I ſee the Poſſeſſor of ſo much
Gallantry, upon the point to be
deſtroy'd by an unhappy Conſtancy,
which, though in other caſes a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
muſt, being exercis'd againſt
the Gods, become a Crime. And
therefore, I cannot but ardently
wiſh, that after having ſhewn ſo
much Patience and Courage, you
would at length expreſs your Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
too, by letting your ſelf be
perſwaded to a Compliance, that
may reſcue you at once from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
and from Death.</p>
               <p>An advice, anſwers <hi>Didymus,</hi> that
is propos'd with ſo much kindneſs
and civility, and yet preſs'd but
by ſuch unſatisfying Reaſons, does
juſtly deſerve my thanks for it,
but not my compliance with it.
For the Argument you bring againſt
my Conſtancy to the Truth, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98345:98"/>
that my perſiſting in it will coſt
me my Life; which is a proof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that the Religion I profeſs,
will lead me into Danger, but none
at all, that it has miſled me into
Error.</p>
               <p>'Tis altogether extrinſick and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
to a Religions being true
or falſe, that its Embracers happen
to be encourag'd by Preferments,
or expos'd to Perſecutions. Fear is
but an ill Counſellor in matters of
Religion, unleſs it be the fear of
chuſing a bad one, or living unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a good one. He deſerves
not the Bleſſing of having made a
good choice among Religions, that
does more ſeek in his choice, the
Concernments of his Life, than of
his Soul. And as 'tis only for its
being the true one, that we ſhould
make choice of our Religion: So
having once choſen it, nothing
ſhould make us deſert it, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of its being erroneous, and
conſequently of its wanting that
Truth, whoſe appearance made us
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98345:99"/>
embrace it. If therefore, you can
ſhew me, that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is falſe, or that yours is better;
I am not ſo in love with wandring,
as to go on in a wrong way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I once have, by weakneſs or
misfortune, been miſled into it. But
if your Arguments be but menaces,
or any thing that is of that ſort,
which can only manifeſt, that the
power is on your ſide, but do not
at all evince, that the truth is not
on mine; I muſt look upon what you
urge, as not deſerving to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
with, but contemn'd. And if it
were not my cuſtom never to take
any thing ill, that I think is meant
well, I ſhould eſteem my ſelf not a
little injur'd, by the argument you
employ to make me abandon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.
Since, if a perſon leſs ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and gallant had made uſe of it,
I ſhould conclude, that he muſt
ſuppoſe me a Coward, to hope,
by ſuch perſwaſions to make a
Proſelyte. And though I were leſs
aſſur'd than I am, of the Truth of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98345:99"/>
the Religion I have alwaies own'd;
yet would I not for all the world,
on this occaſion, by profeſſing yours,
deſert it: Leaſt by forſaking it,
when I am threaten'd for ſticking
to it; I ſhould procure my ſelf a
diſquieting temptation to ſuſpect,
that I did not deal ſincerely and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
in chuſing a Religion;
ſince I made choice of one, that I
judg'd not worthy to be dy'd for.</p>
               <p>You miſtake my intentions, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Didymus,</hi> replies the <hi>Roman,</hi>
if you think I pretended to fright
you into Apoſtacy: my Vertue would
as little allow me to have ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
a deſign, as your Courage
would permit a hope, that it ſhould
be ſuccesful. But looking upon my
ſelf, as having made a right choice
in that worſhip of the Gods, I make
profeſſion of, I could not think it
injurious to you, to perſwade you,
rather to Live in the profeſſion of
a true Religion, than to Dye for
that of a falſe one. And ſince my
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98345:100"/>
concerns for your ſafety, and the
little time you have to deliberate,
oblige me to ſpeak freely to you;
I cannot but wonder, that a Perſon
that hath courted Honour at the
rate you have done, ſhould loſe
himſelf, for One, whom the moſt
Sacred Perſons of his own Nation,
crucified as a Malefactor; and who
has been ſo ill natur'd, as to invite
his Followers, both by expreſs
words, and by the nature of the
Religion he fram'd, which could
not but be Perſecuted, to involve
themſelves with him in the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
fate.</p>
               <p>The Notions (replies <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
ſomewhat nettled at this
Diſcourſe) that Idolaters frame
to themſelves, of the nature of the
Chriſtian Religion, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as erroneous, as the ways
they take to confute it, are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and inhumane: And they are
uſually no leſs miſinform'd about
the Grounds and Myſteries of our
Religion, than they are miſtaken
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98345:100"/>
about the Objects of their own Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
'Tis true, that the Divine
Perſon I adore, being ſent from God
his Father, to be the great Prophet
and Reformer of the World, did,
with a Prophetick Freedom, as well
as Authority, ſharply rebuke the
Superſtitions of the Jewiſh Scribes
and Phariſees, among whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd;
and did not more unmask
their Hypocriſie, and reproach their
Practices, by the Light of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
than by the ſhining actions
of a moſt exemplary and unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd
Life. And his Holineſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
exaſperated theſe impious Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
that found their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
undermin'd, and their Perſons
diſcredited by him: As their malice
was too great, not to attempt the
Deſtruction of ſuch an Enemy;
ſo his Conſtancy was too great, to
ſuffer him to decline the greateſt
dangers, by declining to perſiſt in the
wonted exerciſe of his Vertues;
whereby he thus became expos'd to
a Death, which he foreſaw, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98345:101"/>
frequently foretold, and which he
alſo willingly underwent, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Everlaſting Life, for thoſe who
ſhould believe in him, and ſtrive to
imitate him.</p>
               <p>And that his Death, whereunto
he ſubmitted to expiate the ſins of
<hi>others,</hi> was not inflicted on him
for his <hi>own,</hi> was evident, by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abſolv'd, not only by the very
Judge, to whom a Criminal fear of
his Accuſers indicted the Sentence
he pronounc'd againſt him, but by
that Supreme and Infallible Judge,
<hi>God himſelf;</hi> who declar'd by aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing
Prodigies, both in Heaven
and Earth, how much he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
with thoſe, that put his Son
to Death; &amp; by raiſing him from the
Dead within three days, to an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Life, proclaim'd how dear
he was to him, and gave him Power,
to make his Followers Partakers of
that glorious condition he himſelf
was advanc'd to. So that (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<hi>Didymus)</hi> thoſe Champions
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98345:101"/>
of his, whom he vouchſafes to ſingle
out from the reſt of his Followers,
and call to Martyrdom, have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
enough to look upon that Call,
as an invaluable Honour, and a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge:
Since, as they are thereby
made more conformable to him, in
chearfully dying for Truth and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy;
ſo they will be made more
plentiful ſharers in thoſe ineſtimable
advantages, that his own meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Martyrdom procur'd him. Yes,
for thoſe to whom he vouchſafes the
Power and Honour of Suffering for
Him, and of imitating him, for the
intereſt of Truth and Piety; he does
not only reſerve ſuch future Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
to crown their Love and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
but often gives them here
ſuch happy foretaſts, in a perfect
aſſurance of it, that I cannot but
look upon it, as a vaſt acceſſion to
that immenſe Love, that made him
dye for Us, that he calls and inables
us to dye for Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:98345:102"/>
I confeſs, <hi>(Didymus</hi> adds in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of his Diſcourſe) that, as he
took upon him the form of a Man,
ſo he ſuffer'd himſelf to be us'd
as good Men too often are. But
his miraculous power and goodneſs,
ſufficiently proclaim'd, that he was
not thrown down from Heaven to
Earth, as your Vulcan is ſaid to
have been, but that he deſcended
from Heaven, to make Men live
an heavenly life: Nor did he, like
many of your Deities, eſpecially
your <hi>Jupiter,</hi> aſſume an humane
ſhape, to do actions below the
dignity of humane Nature; but
he taught Men a Doctrine, worthy,
as well as likely, to be brought
from Heaven; and gave them an
exemplary life, whoſe imitation
would fit them to be tranſlated thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
And then ſubmitted to the
Torments and Infamy of the Croſs,
to purchaſe for his followers, by his
Death, that heavenly condition, for
which he had qualified them, by his
Spirit and his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:98345:102"/>
The <hi>Roman</hi> Officer, not yet quite
diſcourag'd, by the unſuccesfulneſs
he had hitherto met with in his
attempt, reſolv'd to proſecute it
yet further, by ſaying: The ſame
reaſon, that ſomewhat leſſens my
wonder at your deſpiſing Death,
for your erroneous Religion, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
my admiration at your uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs,
to avoid the kind of
Death that threatens your obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
For though the love of glory,
may invite a gallant Man, like <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymus,</hi>
to part with his life for the
attainment of it; yet that ſame
heroick paſſion, ought to make
thoſe it poſſeſſes, more apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
than others of thoſe Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
wherein Death is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with Infamy, and made
juſty terrible with ignominious
Circumſtances; of which, none
can be more diſgraceful, than
the receiving it at the baſe hand
of a common Executioner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:98345:103"/>
The Weakneſs and Examples of
your Gods (replies <hi>Didymus)</hi> have
too much ſeduced you, to make Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
of Good and Evil, by thoſe
popular and pitiful meaſures, that I
cannot but think very unworthy to
be acquieſc'd in by a Chriſtian;
who, to merit that Title, muſt be
ſomewhat more than an ordinary
Man. We judge of good and evil
Actions, by the Laws of God, and
right Reaſon, not by thoſe of Men
in Power. And therefore do not
think, that Conſtancy ceaſes to be
a Vertue, and conſequently an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
not a diſgraceful quality,
becauſe legal Tyrants will call it
Obſtinacy, and condemn Men for
it, to the ſame Puniſhments that
are allotted to diſhonourable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The reſpect our Religion
commands us to pay to a Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
though a Perſecutor, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
us not by force to reſiſt his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
Sentences. But this Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ours, does not at all keep
his Sentences from being unjuſt,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98345:103"/>
nor forbid us to think them ſo; and
conſequently leaves us the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſatisfaction of our Conſciences,
that inwardly abſolve us, when
outward Judges condemn us. And
for proof of this, you cannot but
have taken notice, that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
truly Criminal, Perſons being
conſcious of their own Guilt, either
deny what they are accuſed of, or
endeavour by all means, to palliate
it, and to avoid the being condem'd
for it. We Chriſtians, on the
contrary, do not only Confeſs what
you call a Crime, but Glory in It;
and do not deprecate the fate, that
attends our Conſtancy. Nor can it
fright us from undergoing Death,
for a glorious Cauſe, that we muſt
receive it from an Infamous Hand.
For that by which we eſtimate it,
is, the quality of the action that
procures it, not the condition of
him that is employ'd to inflict it:
And, ſo we can conſider with joy,
<hi>for what,</hi> we are not much troubled
to ſee, <hi>by whom,</hi> it is that we ſuffer;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98345:104"/>
being ſatisfied, that the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
hand may deſtroy a Malefactor,
but cannot make one; and if the
Cauſe that brings a Man to the
Scaffold, be not culpable, the place
cannot make the Death that is there
ſuffered, infamous: Nay, and if
Vertue leads him thither, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of his Death, cannot keep
it from being Glorious; ſince this
demonſtrates the Sufferers unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Conſtancy to be inſuperable,
not only by Death, but by that
which many have embrac'd Death
to ſhun, the Contempt of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Men. Your gallant Roman
Commander <hi>(Attilius Regulus)</hi> is
much leſs remembred and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for all his Military Exploits and
Attempts, than for the Cruel Death
he ſuffer'd, by order of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi>
to whom, in performance
of a Pomiſe, he yielded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
up, with expectation of ſome
ſuch barbarous Uſage as he met
with. And ſure, as a ſubmiſſion
to Indignities, was a duty not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98345:104"/>
meanly glorious in him, to ſhun
the breaking of his Word to his
Enemies; the like reſignation of
themſelves, will not, by unbyaſs'd
Judges, be thought an Action diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
in Chriſtians, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the violation of their Faith,
ſolemnly given, not to a Savage E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
but to a Divine Friend, who
has already, without any obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to do it, ſuffered more ſhame
for them, than the ſublimity of his
condition leaves it poſſible for them
to ſuffer for him. And <hi>though</hi> that
Greek Philoſopher, <hi>Socrates,</hi> whom
your own Oracles, with more of
Truth than they are wont to be
guilty of, pronounc'd the wiſeſt of
Men, was by his own Fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
condemn'd to die by Poyſon,
brought him by the hand of an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner:
<hi>Yet,</hi> ſince that Sentence
was not occaſioned by his Crimes,
but his Vertues, the deadly draught
did not deſtroy his Fame with his
Life; and poyſon'd not his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which it extremely heightned,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98345:105"/>
but that of his Accuſers, and his
Judges; whom after Ages have
look'd upon, as worſe Criminals
than ever they Condemned, and
more unworthy Perſons, than thoſe
they employed to execute their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
And for my part, (continues
<hi>Didymus)</hi> ſome paſſages of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Records encourage me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that, if a Poſthume Fame be
ſuch a Bleſſing, as many imagine,
the Indignities we ſuffer now, will
hereafter procure it us. For I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but hope, and methinks I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee,
that the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles will one
day ſtoop to the Croſs of Chriſt:
And the Temples of your Falſe Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
will be conſecrated to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the True God. The Sword
of the Civil Magiſtrate, which is
now the great and only ſucceſsful
Argument on your ſide, will be
then in Chriſtian hands, which I
wiſh may never employ it againſt
your Religion; whoſe ruine will
not require the active oppoſition of
Power, but the bare withdrawing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98345:105"/>
of its preſerving Support. And then
poſterity, more enlightned and more
juſt, will read the Hiſtory of thoſe
Deſtroyers of the Baptized (which
is, at leaſt, the innocenter) part of
Mankind, with the ſame reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with which they will read
the havocks made by Wars, Plagues,
Maſſacres, and other publick Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>

               <p>THeſe Replies of <hi>Didymus</hi> made
an end of convincing the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that occaſion'd them, that our

               <p>But yet the officious <hi>Roman,</hi> che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
ſome hope, that, if <hi>Didymus</hi>
ſhould ſee his Miſtreſs ready to be
kill'd by an infamous hand; that
Beauty, which had conquered his
heart, would ſoften it, and thereby
make it capable of relenting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
thought fit to make him one
addreſs more, and tell him; It is
not without extreme regret, that I
ſee your inflexible obſtinacy defeat
all my endeavours to procure your
ſafety. But though your miſtaken
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98345:106"/>
gallantry, may make you think it
unhandſom in a Soldier, to diſclaim
a threatned opinion, that he once
adher'd to, leſt the change ſhould
be imputed to Fear or Levity; yet
I hope you will not think, that the
ſtrict rules of that deſtructive Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
ought to oblige a young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in whoſe Sex, Courage is, at
leaſt, an unrequired, if not an alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
improper, Vertue. And
therefore, I hope you will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to ſecond my Endeavours, to
perſwade her, not to throw herſelf
out of a World, of whoſe grandeurs
and pleaſures, her tranſcendent
Beauty promiſes her an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſhare, as well as her Youth fits
her to reliſh them perfectly, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
them long.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Didymus,</hi> though at firſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſurpriz'd at this motion, took
no long time to return anſwer, by
ſaying; I confeſs, I cannot partake
of the trouble you are pleas'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
for the not prevailing of your
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98345:107"/>
Endeavours to alter my Reſolutions.
For though the advice you preſs'd
upon me, was obliging in you to
give, yet it would have been Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
for me to take it.</p>
               <p>And as for what you propoſe, in
reference to <hi>Theodora,</hi> I muſt deſire
to be excus'd from making myſelf
acceſſory to your deſign of tempting
her. For, in my opinion, he that
ſolicites another, to what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
a Crime, doth become guilty
of one; ſo that, as to what concerns
<hi>Theodora,</hi> without being at all ſure
of ſhaking her Vertue, I ſhould
moſt certainly ruine my own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
Yet I cannot think (ſays
the <hi>Roman,</hi> interrupting him,)
but if you would enforce <hi>my</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
with <hi>yours,</hi> the Intereſt
you have in her, would prevail to
make her rather accept of Life, than
deny a Perſon, that ſhe owes ſo
much to; and does not leſs highly,
than juſtly, value.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:98345:107"/>
If (replies <hi>Didymus)</hi> I ſhould
yield to uſe ſo Criminal means, as
to give her an Example of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,
you would have me invite
her to; the attempt would be leſs
improbable: But for me to perſwade
her to what I am juſt going to give
a convincing proof, that I believe
to be worſe than Death; would
make her both hate me, and deſpiſe
me. And to convince you, that
ſuch a Motion as you would have
me make, would loſe me all the
ſhare I may have in her good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
I will dare to own to you, that
if I thought her capable, I ſay not
of endeavouring to ſeduce me, but
of being ſeduced by me, my eſteem
of her would alter upon her change:
And though I could not deny my
wonder to ſo rare a Maſter-piece of
Nature, as is her viſible part; yet
there would be a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a meer admiration of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Beauty, which muſt become
the Trophy of Age or Death; and
that high veneration, that I now
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98345:108"/>
pay to that admirable Perſon's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick
Worth, and unconquerable
Vertue.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhould you doubt (continues
<hi>Didymus)</hi> of the Entertainment,
that ſuch a Piety as hers, would
give ſuch a Motion as you would
have me make; ſince it would juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give her a higher reſentment of
<hi>my</hi> ſolicitations, than of all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of her Heathen <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:</hi>
for theſe do but adviſe her to
decline Danger, by embracing what
they think Truth; whereas that
which you would have me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
her to, is, to purchaſe her
ſafety, by renouncing, what <hi>I,</hi> as
well as <hi>She,</hi> know to be Truth:
And I doubt not, that ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
would ſo highly offend her,
as to enable her, by a bare Pardon,
to acquit herſelf of thoſe Reſpects
and Services of mine, to which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſibly
a Perſon of her goodneſs
vouchſafes ſome Title to <hi>her</hi> grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:98345:108"/>
There is (replies the <hi>Roman)</hi> ſo
great a difference betwixt the caſe
of a reſolv'd Soldier, that thinks
himſelf in point of Reputation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
not to retreat, and that of a
young Lady, from whom no Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs,
much leſs Obſtinacy, can
be expected, that I muſt yet think,
our joynt perſwaſions, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſiſted
by your Example, would
with-hold her from Death, now ſhe
is near enough to it to ſee the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of it.</p>
               <p>Nay, (rejoyns <hi>Didymus)</hi> I did
not ſpeak what I have been ſaying
about my own averſneſs, that I
might hinder you from trying your
Fortune, if you think fit, with <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>'s
Vertue. I do not envy her
Conſtancy (whoſe ſucceſſes have
been hitherto no fewer than its try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als)
the honour of gaining more
than one Victory, in one day. But
what I have been ſaying, was, to
give you one reaſon, of my refuſing
to joyn with you in your propos'd
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98345:109"/>
attempt: againſt which I ſhall now
offer this other reaſon, that I
think it little leſs than impoſſible
it ſhould ſucceed. For I thought I
had already ſatisfied you, that as to
my intereſt in <hi>Theodora,</hi> if it were
much greater, than you, for want
of knowing us both, imagine; ſo
great a miſimployment of it, would
make me juſtly forfeit it; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
that would ſeduce her to
Apoſtacy, inſtead of making her
follow the Advice, would make her
but deteſt the Adviſer. And as to
the hopes, you ground on her ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herſelf upon the point of paſſing
out of the World; let me tell you,
that the ſevere Exerciſes, to which
her ſtrict Piety hath long accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
her, have ſo diſingaged her
affections from temporal things,
that, being already mortified to the
pleaſures and vanities of the World,
Death can now do no more, but free
her from the troubles and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it. She hath employed a
great part of her life, in preparing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98345:109"/>
herſelf to part with it joyfully,
when-ever Nature or Vertue ſhall
require it; and ſhe will find it very
eaſie to lay it down for Religion,
now ſhe is in a ſuffering Condition,
when in her moſt flouriſhing one,
ſhe found it enough to wean her
from the love of the preſent life, that
it detained her from the next. Great
Vertues, ſuch as hers, are like great
Rivers, which, the nearer they come
to the Sea, where they are to end
their courſe, the greater they are
wont to grow, and the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
the ſtream is to be withſtood
or hinder'd from its progreſs. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
now looks upon herſelf, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
but one ſtep more to make, to
reach that Crown ſhe hath done
and ſuffer'd ſo much for: And that
glorious Object, viewed at ſo near
a diſtance, ſo raviſhes and ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes
her Eyes, that ſhe will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
either not ſee, or not regard, any
thing that would hinder or retard
her taking poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:98345:110"/>
Here the <hi>Roman</hi> Officer, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
impatient at <hi>Didymus</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
would no longer forbear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
it, by telling him; To
hear you ſpeak, one would imagine,
that you are not talking of a young
Lady, but of ſome ancient Heroe,
that had been long accuſtom'd to
deſpiſe the Frowns of Fortune, and
keep himſelf from over-valuing her
ſmiles.</p>
               <p>Heroick Vertue (replies <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus)</hi>
does as little know Sexes, as
doth the Soul wherein it properly
reſides. A habitude cannot always
be Eſſential to the Nature of an
Heroick Action: Since the firſt of
that kind that one does, is not the
conſequent, but the beginning, of a
a habitude: And a ſincere and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
reſolution to be highly vertuous,
may make a Woman (as well as a
Man) to <hi>be,</hi> that which the nobleſt
ſubſequent Actions can but declare
her to <hi>have been.</hi> And a Perſon
that, like <hi>Theodora,</hi> acts by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98345:110"/>
and as in the preſence, of
the Deity, may, to maintain her
Loyalty to God, and her Title to
the ineſtimable Rewards he hath
promis'd to perſevering Piety, both
act and ſuffer greater things, than
thoſe very Heroes you talk of were
put upon, by ſuch barely humane
Motives, as Cuſtom, Ambition, or
Revenge. And particularly, as to
the point of perſeverance againſt
Menaces, and Proffers; theſe are not
like to prevail againſt the Conſtancy
of Chriſtians much leſs poſſeſs'd
with Divine Love and Hope, than
<hi>Theodora</hi> is. And indeed, there
can be nothing upon Earth capable
to bribe Them, to let go the Joys of
Heaven, that ſee themſelves entring
upon the Poſſeſſion, and find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſenſible of the ineſtimable
Value of them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (concludes <hi>Didymus)</hi>
you will not, I preſume, think it
ſtrange, that I refuſe to joyn with
you, in a Deſign, that I could not
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98345:111"/>
ſo much as attempt, either with
Hope, or without a Crime; and
that thinking it worthier of my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors,
to imitate <hi>Theodora</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
than to ſeduce her from it,
I chuſe rather to be a ſharer in the
Triumphs of her Vertue, than a
Trophy.</p>

               <p>THis reſolute Concluſion, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
the <hi>Roman</hi> Officer to
break off a Converſation, whereby
he plainly ſaw, there was no cauſe to
hope he could ſhake the Conſtancy
of <hi>Didymus;</hi> and much cauſe to fear,
that <hi>Didymus</hi>'s Conſtancy and his
Diſcourſes, would ſtagger many of
the Heathen Auditors. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
withdrawing himſelf, much
diſcontented at the unſuccesfulneſs
of his perſwaſions, he thought it
would be impious, to make any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
for Perſons he judg'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly
obſtinate, or divert the
fatal Proceedings of the Judge;
who having by this time made an
end of thoſe other Affairs, whoſe
diſpatch <hi>Theodora</hi>'s reſpite was not
to outlaſt; call'd for the innocent
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98345:112"/>
Criminals, and, with a ſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and Voice, demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were yet willing, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
the Deities they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd;
and by burning Incenſe to
them, endeavour to attone for the
Affronts they had offer'd them.
Adding, that there was now no
more time left for deliberating, but
that they muſt immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
thir Impious Religion, or
ſuffer Death for it.</p>
               <p>But this could not ſhake the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Priſoners Conſtancy; which
prompted them to make, with as
much haſte as the <hi>Preſident</hi> could
deſire, an anſwer, that conſiſted
but of a ſhort and reſolute declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
That they had liv'd Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
of Chriſt; and had a
thouſand times rather die, than
ceaſe to be, or to profeſs themſelves
ſuch: And that for the falſe Gods,
the <hi>Preſident</hi> would have them
adore; they had rather be their
Victims, than their Suppliants;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98345:112"/>
and fall Sacrifices to them, than
offer them any.</p>
               <p>This bold profeſſion, ſo incens'd
the perſon 'twas made to, that
he immediately gave order, that
the Priſoners ſhould be led away
to the place of Execution; and
that the Miniſters of Juſtice, (as
he miſnamed his Cruelty) ſhould,
without delay, go on with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
that were making, to
deſtroy them. But while theſe
Officers were ſolicitous to obey
thoſe Commands, <hi>Theodora</hi> took the
opportunity, to tell the generous
Companion of her Sufferings: It
was fit, I confeſs, when we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
with Infidels, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the Objects of our hopes, by
giving them the glorious Titles of
Crowns, and Triumphs; ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to defend the reaſonableneſs of
our Conſtancy, by the greatneſs
of the rewards we expect for it;
'twas very proper to repreſent thoſe
Coeleſtial Recompences, under the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98345:113"/>
notion of ſuch Goods, as thoſe we
argued with, acknowledged to be
the moſt noble and deſirable. But,
(continues ſhe) when we ſpeak of
Heaven among our ſelves, give me
leave to tell you, that I think we
ſhould look upon it under a very
differing notion; and make a wide
diſparity betwixt the Chriſtians
<hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and the Poets <hi>Elyſium.</hi>
The Triumphs we ſhould moſt
deſire in Heaven, ſhould be, not
over our outward Enemies, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Sufferings, but over Sin and
Ignorance, and the frailties of our
Natures, and the imperfections of
our Vertues. And the poſitive
Bleſſings that ſhould moſt endear
Heaven to us, ſhould be, not ſo
much that we ſhall there be
Crown'd by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as that we ſhall
live with him, and <hi>follow that
ſpotleſs Lamb where ever he goes;</hi>
That our gratitude it ſelf ſhall be
perfect, as well as the Bleſſings
that engage it ſhall be compleat;
and That we ſhall have an eternal
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98345:113"/>
Day, to contemplate that <hi>Sun of
Righteouſneſs,</hi> without having that
glorious Object veil'd by any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
Cloud, much leſs hid from
us by the viciſſitudes of day and
night. In ſhort, I think, Devotion
ſhould in our future State, aſpire
to other things, than thoſe that
may be the Objects of meer Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
               <p>And now, generous <hi>Didymus,</hi>
(adds <hi>Theodora)</hi> ſince we are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the laſt ſcene of our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Life; let us, (I beſeech you)
ſummon together and rouſe up all
the Graces and Vertues we have
receiv'd from Heaven, and fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
implore both an encreaſe of
them, and a ſupply of any that our
preſent Circumſtances require;
That we may go off the Stage
Piouſly, as well as Handſomly, and
both act and ſuffer as becomes
Chriſtian Martyrs. Let not any
Crueltys or Affronts of our inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Perſecutors, be able to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98345:114"/>
us; but let our evenneſs of
mind convince them, that they
can as little diſorder us in our
way to Heaven, as hinder us to
get to our Journey's end. But let
not our undauntedneſs appear the
effect of ſullenneſs, or fierceneſs, or
of meer reſolvedneſs; but let it be
ſo calm and charitable, that we may
not be ſuſpected to be the Martyrs,
rather of our Glory, or our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
than of our Religion. Let it
not be thought that we hate life, or
deſpiſe it, but only that we think
it a cheap purchaſe for Heaven, and
for the honour of owning and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
a Redeemer, who, to merit
it for us, took the Croſs in his
way thither.</p>
               <p>Admonitions ſo becoming a dying
Chriſtian, receiv'd ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
as the Piety of it, and the
Veneration he had for the giver,
might juſtly challenge, from ſo
devout and elevated a Soul as that
of <hi>Didymus:</hi> whoſe reſolute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98345:114"/>
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Officer, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his behaviour, as well
ſince as before he made them,
leaving his Enemies no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
that he could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
with, either to alter his own
reſolution, or tempt his Miſtreſs to
change hers; he was appointed to
be firſt led away to Execution: that
the ſight of his Blood might terrifie
<hi>Theodora,</hi> and fright her into a care
to preſerve her own. This reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of his Enemies, did not at
all leſſen his; but having eaſily
obtain'd leave, from the <hi>Roman</hi>
Officers, that could not but admire
his Gallantry, and ſomewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
his condition, to ſay a
few words to <hi>Theodora:</hi> He went
to that excellent Perſon; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
her with a far greater
reſpect, than he would ſhew to any
Power, that could but preſerve
that life, which the <hi>Romans</hi> were
going to take from him: He told
her: Your Piety, Madam, and your
Example, making me preſume,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98345:115"/>
that upon ſuch an occaſion as this,
I may with your conſent, part with
a life, which ever ſince I had the
Fate to ſee you, has been ſo much
at your diſpoſal; I am now going
without reluctancy to perform that
laſt duty, whereto Religion calls
me. But thinking my ſelf oblig'd,
to begin with the moſt difficult
part of my Martyrdom, before I
bid farewel to the World, my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and reſpect, brings me to
take my laſt leave of the faireſt and
excellenteſt Perſon in it. If, Madam,
(ſo he proceeds) I were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of paying you any further
dutys, my humble requeſt to you
would be, to have the honour of your
further Commands. But ſince my
condition leaves me not a capacity
of ſerving you for the future, one
of my laſt Petitions to you muſt
be, to be pleas'd to look upon my
paſt Services, as extremely ſhort
of the deſires of a Perſon, that lov'd
you with as much ardency, as
your Charms themſelves could
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98345:115"/>
kindle; and yet with ſo pure a
flame, that had it been viſible,
even <hi>Theodora</hi>'s Vertue, could not
have diſapprov'd it. But Madam,
(continues he) although to reſcue
you from the condition you are in,
there is no danger ſo deſperate
that I would not joyfully attempt,
if I were again at liberty, and tho'
it were poſſible I could ſurvive you;
yet I am too much concern'd for
the nobler part of <hi>Theodora,</hi> to wiſh,
ſhe would blemiſh ſo ſpotleſs a
life to ſave it. Only, Madam,
give me leave to be ſo kind and
Charitable to the World, as to
wiſh that Providence may find
ſome expedient, to preſerve for
you, both your Crown and your
Head; and that you may arrive
ſo late at Heaven, as to have time
to bleſs the Earth with a long and
Exemplary Life; and may you
lead it with as much Tranquillity,
as you will with Vertue; and
without knowing ſo much as that
trouble, which, I fear, your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98345:116"/>
compaſſion may now and then
offer to give you, upon the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the faithfuleſt of your
Servants.</p>
               <p>Theſe words, and the ſad occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of them, having drawn ſome
Tears into <hi>Theodora</hi>'s fair Eyes;
though the cauſe of them made
them very obliging to <hi>Didymus,</hi>
yet his concern for her quiet, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
engag'd him to help her
to ſuppreſs them, by making haſte
to tell her, that 'twas pity the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity
of her mind and looks,
which Vertue had ſtill kept calm,
and even Perſecutions had not been
able to diſorder, ſhould be diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by any other thing. And
Madam, (continues he) though,
being confident that your charity
will make it unneceſſary for me
to beg your Prayers, I was going
to make it my petition to you,
that you would vouchſafe now and
then to caſt a thought on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of a Perſon, to whoſe mind
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98345:116"/>
you were conſtantly preſent: Yet,
I muſt now retract that humble
requeſt, unleſs you are pleas'd to
grant it me with this qualification;
That the honour you do me, may
not be diſquieting to you. For
how great a bleſſing ſoever it is,
to enjoy a place in your thoughts;
yet an <hi>Idea</hi> muſt repreſent quite
another man than <hi>Didymus,</hi> that
ſhould, eſpecially on its own ſcore,
become troubleſome to <hi>Theodora;</hi>
whoſe compaſſion is as well need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
as undeſired; ſince 'tis injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
both to her ſelf and me, to
look upon Him as a perſon to be
pitied, that is going to receive
the honour and ſatisfaction, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in her ſight, what he ſuffers
partly for her ſervice. And the
place he implores but in her favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
not her mournful thoughts,
will give him the nobleſt and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableſt
Being, that he can have
upon Earth, when he ſhall be in
Heaven.</p>
               <p>The things which <hi>Didymus</hi> ſaid,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98345:117"/>
and the pathetical way he ſaid
them in, did not leave the fair Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
they were addreſs'd to, all the
unmov'dneſs of mind, ſhe us'd to
be Miſtreſs of on other occaſions.
And conſidering theſe as the laſt
and dying words of an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
Gentleman, that had ſo
highly ſerv'd and lov'd her, ſhe
could not hinder her reſentments
from making her, on ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
remit ſomewhat of her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
reſerv'dneſs. Wherefore with
Eyes, wherein though ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to ſuppreſs Tears, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
an extraordinary Grief; and
with Looks, wherein both Gratitude
and Obligedneſs diſplay'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
ſhe told him, If I look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Vertue, generous <hi>Didymus,</hi>
as one that were but ſomewhat
extraordinary, I ſhould think my
ſelf oblig'd to make excuſes; and
ſeek your pardon for having been,
though undeſignedly, ſo acceſſory to
the early loſs of a life, ſo worthy
to be a long one. But what you
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98345:117"/>
have this day done, makes me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that ſuch Diſcourſes,
would not be very pleaſing, to one
that delights in ſuch Actions. But
do not think, I conjure you, that,
though I cannot pretend to merit
or requite Services of ſo unuſual a
ſtrain as yours, I can be inſenſible,
how much I owe to them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the ſcore of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but upon that of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
and generous way wherein
you did them. For (continues ſhe,
with a colour that ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
the meaning of what ſhe
was going to ſay) if after the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Gallantry you this day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,
Providence had thought
fit to place me in a condition of
making you Retributions, I will
allow you to think, that in chuſing
them for you, I ſhould have been
very much, if not unreſervedly,
guided by your wiſhes. Here ſhe
paus'd a while, and bluſh'd the
latter, that ſhe had ſaid, what to
her niceneſs ſeem'd ſo much; and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98345:118"/>
the former, to conſider whether
he deſerv'd not to have more ſaid
to him. But her obliging looks
did ſo well ſecond and expound,
her otherwiſe, ſomewhat indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
words, that <hi>Didymus</hi>'s Heart
readily underſtood the Language
of her Eyes; and her Heart ſpoke
ſo clearly in her Cheeks, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that it ſcrupled to utter by
her Tongue, that, expreſſing more
than ſhe ſaid, without injuring her
Modeſty ſhe righted her Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
her paſſionate Admirer eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf more highly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd,
by this permiſſion, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
her, kindneſs than he would
have done by the perfecteſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of any others love: And
fancying, that by the ſight of that
new Fire that flaſh'd in her Cheeks,
he could deſcern in her Breaſt ſuch
a reſentment of his Services, as
involv'd an approbation of their
cauſe, and imply'd a peculiarity
for his Perſon; he took the high
eſt retribution he ever did, for
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98345:118"/>
the higheſt he ever could receive
from a Lady, whoſe Beauty and
Reſervedneſs were ſo great, that
no favour of her granting, could
appear little.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Theodora</hi> quickly recovering
the diſorder, this merited Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
had put her into, made haſt
to proſecute her diſcourſe, by add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
But 'tis my ſatisfaction, and
will I hope, be yours, that, ſince
you acted upon Religions ſcore,
as well as mine, you will not
want a recompence, greater than
it had been poſſible for me to give
you; ſince in reſcuing me upon a
Chriſtian account, you have ſerv'd
a Maſter, that is able moſt richly
to reward, even <hi>your</hi> Performances
and Sufferings: And doubt not
<hi>Didymus,</hi> (continues ſhe) but that,
when you ſhall once be poſſeſs'd
of a Glorious and Immortal Crown
in Heaven, you will have no cauſe,
to be troubled, at your having,
upon Earth, left a Crown of <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:98345:119"/>
or miſs'd one of <hi>Myrtle.</hi> If I
were to tarry, or rather languiſh,
here below, as many years as your
miſtaken kindneſs makes you wiſh
me; your favours have been ſo
extraordinary, that, without being
guilty of an ingratitude that would
be ſo too, I could never loſe the
remembrance of them, nor omit
paying you the higheſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements,
that the chief place,
not only in my memory, but in
my eſteem and friendſhip, could
make you. But do not <hi>Didymus,</hi>
I beſeech you, think of my Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
you, when the holding out
a few minutes longer for <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
will introduce me into a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where I ſhall ever ſee him,
and never offend him. Let us then,
(concludes ſhe) quit the thoughts
of this World, that we are going
ſo ſoon to quit, and begin to fix
them on thoſe joys of another,
that we are going to poſſeſs for
ever; and during that little time,
that is requiſite to go take our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98345:119"/>
Crowns, let us ſummon up all
our powers, to contribute to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
befitting ſuch Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Let our laſt ſervices to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
be our nobleſt ones, that
our Deaths may at leaſt adorn it,
if not propagate it. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the laſt effects of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
as perſons that do not
deſerve ſuch an uſage, and are
above the reach of it. Let us aſpire
to <hi>Chriſts</hi> temper, in his cauſe; and
ſuffer Like him, as we ſuffer For
him: and then we need not doubt,
but, in ſpight of this ſhort ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
we are yielding to for his
Sake, we ſhall joyfully, and for
ever, meet again, in a better place,
and in an ineſtimably happier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodora</hi> had ſcarce made an end
of ſpeaking, when, all things being
in a readineſs to put the Judges
Sentence in Execution, they to
whom that infamous employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was committed, came to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98345:120"/>
bring notice of it to <hi>Didymus,</hi> who,
notwithſtanding the reluctancy he
had, to part with the admirable, and
now obliging, <hi>Theodora;</hi> thinking
it would misbecome him, to ſtay
for being preſs'd on ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
delay'd not, with all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
he was able to aſſume, to
take his laſt farewel of her. This
cruel ſeparation, being not to have
an end, before both their Lives, was
ſolemniz'd by that excellent pair,
with Geſtures and Expreſſions ſo
ſenſible and moving, that, declining
an account, which I could not
attempt to give, without ſharing
very much in a grief, that I ſhould
be able, but very imperfectly, to
deſcribe; I ſhall ſilently paſs over
the Circumſtances of this ſad Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
that more troubled the
generous Lover, and perhaps his
admirable Miſtreſs too, than that
of Soul and Body, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to follow it. But <hi>Didymus,</hi>
now finally parted from <hi>Theodora,</hi>
whilſt he was moving towards
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98345:120"/>
the place of his Sufferings, having
by the aſſiſtance of him, whoſe
Religion call'd Him to them, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
a temper of mind, ſuitable
to the glorious work he was going
to undertake, and entirely diſpos'd
himſelf, after having done all that
became a Lover, to ſuffer as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>This was much the leſs difficult
for him to do, becauſe his whole
paſt life was an excellent prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
to make him act the laſt
ſcene of it worthily. For (to add
ſomewhat on this occaſion, to the
Character given of him in the
firſt Book.) <hi>Didymus</hi> was a Perſon,
in whom Divine Grace had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
ſo early a Piety, that he
was a well grown Chriſtian, before
he was come to be a full grown
Man. And judging the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
time of his Age, to be, for
that reaſon, the fitteſt to be Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the moſt worthy of Objects;
He was enabl'd both to ſuppreſs
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98345:121"/>
the heats of Youth, and deſpiſe
the Vanities of the World; even
while that uſually ungovern'd Age,
made the former moſt impetuous,
and gave the latter, the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment
of Novelty. Nor did
his being a Soldier, prove an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
to his Piety. The Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Joſhua, David, Jonathan,</hi>
and other brave Warriers of the
<hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> ſhew, that Heroick
Valour, may be accompany'd with
eminent Piety. And the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte
the Heathen World preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Chriſtianity, being a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and continuing to be ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Converſion; argues, that
a Military ſtate of Life, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with the moſt innocent
of Religions. And for <hi>Didymus;</hi>
as he fought not out of Fierceneſs,
or Avarice, or Ambition; but to
exerciſe and improve his Vertue;
ſo amidſt all his Military Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts,
he was ſtill careful <hi>To fight
the good fight of Faith:</hi> And being
taught by the Holy Scripture, that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98345:121"/>
                  <hi>The Life of Man</hi> here on Earth,
<hi>is a kind of Military one:</hi> He us'd
the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp as a School to
a higher ſort of Warfare; where,
as the hardſhips are greater, and
the Victories more difficult, ſo the
Crowns and Triumphs are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
more Valuable and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
A Perſon thus qualify'd
and diſpos'd, could not find it
very uneaſie, <hi>to</hi> part, for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
with a Life that he had led
ſo well, and hazarded ſo often;
nor <hi>to</hi> leave a World, That Sin and
Perſecutions embitter'd, and That
was preſently to be left by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
that he might paſs to a
place where they ſhould meet to
be Crown'd. Wherefore, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to ſhew that the approach of
a reputedly infamous Death, was
not able, either to ſhake his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
or extinguiſh his Charity;
he diſpos'd himſelf to mingle in
his laſt Actions and Sufferings, the
courage of a <hi>Roman</hi> Soldier, with
the reſignment of a Chriſtian
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98345:122"/>
Martyr. And accordingly, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on towards the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
with a calmneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedneſs,
that could ſcarce have
proceeded from a reſolution not
ſtrengthen'd by Faith; as ſoon as
He came thither, He look'd round
about him upon the Guards, and
other Aſſiſtants of this ſad Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle,
in ſuch a way, as if He ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ther
pity'd them, than lik'd the
Pity, which many of them could
not but by their Tears expreſs for
Him, and diſcours'd to them with
all the gracefulneſs, that Youth and
Courage could give ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
a Perſon. And becauſe he
ſuppos'd, that (as 'twas uſual on
ſuch occaſions of Concourſe) there
were among the Spectators, ſome
Military Men that were Chriſtians
in their Hearts, though they had
not been call'd to own it publickly;
He addreſs'd himſelf particularly
to them. And having premis'd,
that he pretended not to inſtruct
them as barely Chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98345:122"/>
he doubted not, but he had
been prevented by the weighty and
moving Sermons of divers burning
and ſhining Lights, and guiders of
the Church: He told them, he
would confine his advices to what
was ſuitable to the condition he
ſhar'd in with them, of being
Chriſtian Soldiers. And then he
briefly, but pathetically, exhorted
them to all thoſe Vertues and
practices, that might recommend
both their Perſons, their Profeſſion,
and their Religion. The laſt of
which, by many Arguments, (which
his example made the more Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive)
he perſwaded them, after
having adorn'd it by their Lives,
to confirm, if they were call'd to
it, by their Deaths: Without forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that the Fearful, are by the
Scripture rank'd with
the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 21. 8.</note> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd
to the ſame place
of Torment; and without fearing
any unmerited diſgrace, ſo much as
that deſerved one, threatn'd by
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98345:123"/>
the <hi>Captain of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 10.</note> to thoſe that <hi>ſhall
deny him before Men.</hi>
He Exhorted them, by their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Obſequiouſneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
their unbeleiving Superiors;
that the valour of Chriſtians could
be eminently active, when their
Religion did not confine it to be
paſſive; and that when Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
how dangerous ſoever, were as
juſt and noble as difficult, they
could emulate, if not outſhine, the
Gallantry of thoſe Deify'd Heroes
they refus'd to Worſhip. And
laſtly, having preſs'd them to be
loyal to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
too, as far as was conſiſtent
with Fidelity to Him that made
<hi>him</hi> ſo: He begg'd their Prayers
for himſelf, and put up ardent ones
of his own, for the Church, the
State, his Perſecutors, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
for the excellent Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his Martyrdom. This ſaid;
he began to do what was to be
done by him, towards the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98345:123"/>
of his Soul from his Body;
and having done it with ſo much
ſerenity of Mind and Looks, that
he extorted an eſteem of his vertue,
even from thoſe that deſtroy'd him
him for it; he let the Executioner
do his part too, (which probably,
was done by taking off his Head)
and in a moment paſs'd, from being
a ſuffering Member of the Church
Militant, to be a happy one of the
Church Triumphant.</p>

               <p>THE Perſecutors of <hi>Theodora,</hi>
hoping to intimidate her by
ſo Tragick a Spectacle, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
her to a place, whence ſhe
might ſee all that had paſs'd; of
which 'twill eaſily be believ'd that
ſhe had not been an unconcern'd
Spectator: Her Vertue and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
making her a ſharer in his
Sufferings, by ſympathiſing with
him, and by endeavouring, as far
as ſhe could, to relieve him by her
moſt ardent Prayers; That his
conſtancy under them might be
Divinely Supported, and richly
Crown'd. But while her thoughts
were, with a Divine grief, Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſing
her loſs; thoſe cruel Men
that had procur'd it, being deſirous
to make uſe of the terrifying im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98345:124"/>
they ſuppos'd ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
while they were freſh and
recent, advanc'd to <hi>Theodora,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them the purpoſely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figur'd
remains of <hi>Didymus;</hi> and
then told her, that ſhe was now
convinc'd, that neither Youth nor
Gallantry was able to protect,
from the fatal anger of the Gods,
thoſe that obſtinately refus'd to
Worſhip them; and therefore they
expected, that, by a ſeaſonable care
of herſelf, ſhe would ſhun the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of ſo Tragical an Example.
To this the fair Martyr replied,
that ſhe was not at all ſurpriz'd
at what had paſs'd, and therefore,
ſhe knew not why ſhe ſhould
be terrified by it. For <hi>Didymus</hi>
and ſhe, and all other conſidering
Chriſtians, that walk according
to their Maſters directions, were
wont deliberately to weigh the
conſequences of embracing a ſtrict
and perſecuted Religion, before
they made Profeſſion of it: And
having foreſeen what it might
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98345:125"/>
coſt them, and ſatiſfied themſelves
that it deſerv'd a yet higher Price;
they were not diſcourag'd nor ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
to be put to pay that price;
eſpecially, when it open'd to them
an immediate paſſage to the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of what they gave it for. She
added, that if the Example of the
generous Martyr, were to have
any operation upon her, it ought
not to fright her from, but confirm
her in, the profeſſion of a Religion,
whoſe truth he thought worth
dying for; and which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the handſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
he had for her preſervation,
he would never ſpeak one word
to perſwade her to decline, for the
protracting of her Life. His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
(continues <hi>Theodora)</hi> lets
me ſee, that no violences upon
Earth, are able to deſtroy a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
that is aſſiſted from Heaven,
and fights in view of the glories
of it: And his Death manifeſts,
how quick the paſſage may, be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this and an incomparably
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98345:125"/>
better Life; and clearly ſhews, how
ſoon the utmoſt effect of your Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
can place thoſe that deſpiſe
it, above the reach of it. Then
caſting her mournful Eyes upon
the ſaddeſt Object that ever they
beheld; If you ſhould, ſays ſhe, be
ſo inhumane, as to exerciſe any
further Cruelty upon this now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate
Priſon, whence his glad
Soul has Eſcap'd; you may intend
him a miſchief, but he will not
feel it, unleſs it be in the encreaſe
of the recompences of his Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
You may, if you pleaſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
over his dead Body; and thoſe
whom his vertue made his Friends,
may ſome of them be troubled
at it: but while you are triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his Death, and others are
deploring it, I doubt not, but the
welcomes and joys he receives in
the bleſſed place he is gone to, make
him happy enough, to pity not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe that hate him, but thoſe
that pity him too. What you
ſhew me as the Trophy of your
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:98345:126"/>
Power, I look upon, as that of his
Conſtancy: and for what you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to be Your Victory, He
will be really Crown'd. The Grave,
(continues ſhe) is, I confeſs, a ſad
Proſpect, to them that look no
further, and terminate their ſight
there; but not to thoſe ſufferers
for the Truth, who, with the Eye
of Faith, looking beyond it, ſee
all thoſe Glories on the other ſide
of it, that expect them there;
whereunto, as ſome kind of Death
muſt neceſſarily be the way, ſo
Martyrdom of all, other is the
Nobleſt. Wherefore, (concludes
<hi>Theodora)</hi> you will very much miſs
your aim, if you forbear bringing
my conſtancy to the laſt Tryal,
only upon hopes, that Death dreſs'd
with unuſual Horror, by being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear'd
with <hi>Didymus</hi>'s Blood,
ſhould frighten me into Apoſtacy:
For, I am much leſs terrified by his
Fate, than encouraged by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
In imitation of which, I
declare to you once for all, that, as
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98345:126"/>
I always valued this World too
little, to be much afraid to part with
it for a better; So I ſhall never be
brought to quitan excellent Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
for a bad one, for fear of ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>changing
a wretched Life for a
happy one.</p>
               <p>This poſitive and final declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Theodora,</hi> did ſo enrage thoſe
to whom ſhe made it, that, finding
themſelves quite diſappointed of
the hopes they had, to terrifie her
by their laſt Expedient, <hi>Didymus</hi>'s
Death; they preſently led her
away to participate of his Fate,
which they found her ſo reſolv'd
not to decline. And now the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Theodora,</hi> having receiv'd that
cruel, but welcom Command, moſt
readily diſpos'd herſelf to obey it:
And conſidering how near ſhe was
to put a period to all the afflictions
of her Life, by the gloriouſeſt Action
it could be concuded with; and
how ſoon ſhe ſhould enjoy the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of entering Heaven, thorough
the ſtreighteſt and nobleſt Gate at
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:98345:127"/>
which it is acceſſible: Her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that was before admirable, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
more ſo than ever, being
ſtrangely encreas'd, by the effuſions
of a Coeleſtial Joy, that did too much
abound in her heart, not to flaſh
out manifeſtly in her looks; to
whoſe native Charms, it ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſo much of Luſter and Majeſty,
that ſhe ſeem'd (upon ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
deſign) to be newly come from
the Heaven ſhe was going to. So
great a conſtancy and chearfulneſs
of mind, upon ſo ſad an occaſion,
wanted not a reſembling Operation,
upon the generality of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Aſſiſtants. For <hi>though</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that was quickly ſpread of ſo
uncommon an Action, as that of
<hi>Theodora,</hi> done by ſo extraordinary
a Perſon, as Fame had repreſented
her to be; had drawn a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of People, to ſee one that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as well as look'd, ſo handſomly:
<hi>Yet</hi> when they had a while beheld
her, and ſaw the cruel Inſtruments
of what ſhe was doom'd to ſuffer;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98345:127"/>
among that numerous Throng of
Spectators, there were none that
were not Admirers; many that
look'd on her with dazled, and few
without flowing Eyes. Every ſort
of Spectators found ſomething in
her Perſon and Condition, that
made them mournful Ones. The
Chriſtians that chanc'd to mingle
with the reſt of the Crowd, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
to ſee their Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of ſo great an Ornament,
and ſo ſhining an Example; though
their grief were moderated by
conſidering, that ſhe was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into a moſt happy place, to
which they might hope, ere long,
to follow her. And in the mean
time, 'twas no ſmall credit to their
Religion, that a Lady of her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
had liv'd according to the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Laws of it; and a Perſon of
her youth and ſex, was ambitious
to dye for it. Thoſe among the
Spectators that yet retain'd <hi>Roman</hi>
Spirits, and were the genuine Off-ſpring
of thoſe noble Anceſtors,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98345:128"/>
that ſcrupled not in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf,
to allow publick marks of honour
to its greateſt Enemies; could not
but be troubled, to ſee ſo rare a
thing as a Female Hero, puniſhed
for a Generoſity, that could not
ſufficiently be Rewarded; and
brought to an untimely, and, in
popular eſtimation, Ignominious
End, for having followed Dictates
of Gratitude and Piety. Thoſe
Infidels, on whoſe ſentiments Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
had more influence than Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
were very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied
with the rigour of their
Magiſtrates; thought it a diſcredit
to their Religion, to uſe ſuch bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
and yet ineffectual Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
to fright Men into it; and
they thought it an invidious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to their Gods, to deſtroy the
faireſt Maſterpieces they had made.
But thoſe that ſeem'd moſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
the fair Martyrs condition,
were thoſe that were diſpos'd to
have their Affections wrought on
by their Eyes, and were apt to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98345:128"/>
be influenc'd by Beauty. For theſe
much repin'd and griev'd, to ſee
ſo glorious a <hi>Sun</hi> reduc'd to ſet in
her Eaſt. They envy'd <hi>Didymus,</hi>
for having ſo generouſly ſerv'd
and ſuffer'd for ſo rare a Perſon;
who, they thought, inſtead of the
barbarous uſage ſhe receiv'd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
to be as happy, as her Smiles
could make her Adorers. And
they allow'd themſelves to think,
that nothing could be a Vertue,
that depriv'd the World of ſo
much Beauty. In ſhort, moſt of the
By-ſtanders griev'd, to behold a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
whoſe youth would paſs for inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and whoſe charms would, give
her Captives among Savages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
in <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Romans.</hi> So that
bating thoſe few Barbarians, whoſe
Superſtition and Malice brought
her to that Condition: All the
other Spectators of her Sufferings,
were deplorers of them too: And
many to that degree, that to judge
by Their looks, and thoſe of our
fair Martyr, one would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that the Aſſiſtants were to be
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:98345:129"/>
ſufferers in the approaching Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
and She but the Spectator
of it.</p>
               <p>And now the Matchleſs <hi>Theodora</hi>
came to the place, whence her
aſpiring Soul was to take its flight
to Heaven. In order to which,
ſhe firſt look'd about her with a
kind of pity, on thoſe, that either
never, or later than ſhe, were to
be admitted into the felicity ſhe
was preſently to poſſeſs: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ſhe paus'd a while, to
recover from ſome diſorder that
ſhe was put into; not ſo much to
ſee her ſelf environ'd with Guards,
as ſurrounded with Gazers: and
then, <hi>though</hi> her Baſhfulneſs made
it more uneaſie to her to ſpeak
to the Aſſiſtants, becauſe her ſpeech
muſt be a publick one, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it muſt be her laſt; <hi>yet</hi> with
a Voice and Geſtures, wherein the
Modeſty of a Virgin, and the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of a Martyr, were happily tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd,
ſhe addreſs'd her ſelf to thoſe
that were about her, in ſuch as the
following terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:98345:129"/>
Since Cuſtom has made it a
kind of Duty, that thoſe that come
to this place, ſhould ſay ſomething
to the Speſtators; and make a
publick Confeſſion of their Guilt,
or proteſtation of their Innocence;
I ſhall in part do both the one and
the other. For I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> deny,
that I am, what the Laws have
condemn'd me for being. Yes;
I own my ſelf a Chriſtian, and in
ſpight of all my paſt and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſufferings, I declare, that I
think it an honour and a happineſs
to be ſo. But on the other ſide, I
can moſt truly proteſt, that I have
tranſgreſs'd no other <hi>Roman</hi> Laws,
than thoſe that are repugnant to
thoſe of God and Reaſon. And
ſince we Chriſtians are taught by
our great maſters Example, as well
as Precepts, not only to forgive,
but to love our Enemies, and pray
for our Perſecutors; I think my
ſelf oblig'd, and by his aſſiſtance
find my ſelf enabled, not only to
forgive, as I heartily do, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers
of my Death, but ardently
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98345:130"/>
to implore for them, the Bleſſing,
and the unmoleſted Exerciſe of a
Religion, that they ſee I value
more than I do my Life. And I
hope, thoſe in Authority will, by
the frequent Executions that daily
ſucceed one another in this place,
be at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>gth convinc'd, how inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
as well as inhumane, a
way they take, to extirpate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity:
Which being an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Light, can be as little ruin'd
by the Violence employed againſt
it on Earth, as Tempeſts can Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
the <hi>Sun.</hi> And becauſe
'tis likely that Charity or Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
has, among other Spectators,
brought hither ſome Chriſtians, I
ſhall now addreſs my ſelf to Them;
yet not to deſire their Pity, but
their Prayers, That I may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to overcome the laſt Enemy,
Death, <hi>and finiſh my Courſe,</hi> in ſuch
a way, as may neither blemiſh my
paſt Life, nor the glorious Cauſe
I gladly looſe it for. But the chief
part of my Requeſt regards your
ſelves, not me. For I muſt beg
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98345:130"/>
you to remember, that, beſides an
All ſeeing Eye, there are many
other Eyes upon you, that pry
into your Actions with ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to find them Criminal: And
that though the truth, nor the
ſubſiſtance of Chriſtianity does not,
yet the Credit of it does much,
depend upon the Nature of your
Actions. For, as all your perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
faults will be imputed to your
Religion, ſo your ſhining Vertues,
will probably bring many Infidels
firſt to admire, and then to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Chriſtianity; juſtly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that That Religion muſt be
excellent, that makes its profeſſors
ſo; and enables, as well as enjoins
them, to live blameleſs in the
World, and go joyfully out of it.
If you lead ſuch lives, you will not
be much afraid of Martyrdom;
which will but ſend you ſooner to
receive thoſe ineſtimable rewards
of them, that Gods goodneſs hath
promis'd and provided. I wiſh
you may never have cauſe, nor
upon occaſion want Courage, to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:98345:131"/>
enter into Life at that ſtreight Gate,
that I am now going to paſs through.
But if you be call'd to that way
of glorifying God, let neither the
ignominy, nor the painfulneſs of
it, deter you. 'Tis not ſhameful,
but glorious, to ſuffer for God, for
Truth, and for a Crown; and my
Example may encourage the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of you to expect, that <hi>Gods
ſtrength will be made manifeſt in your
Infirmity;</hi> and that there's no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
but may be reſiſted and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed,
by the weakeſt hand, that
is ſupported and ſtrengthen'd by
an Almighty Arm. And though
the diſtance between Heaven and
Earth, our Mortal and our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
ſtate, be very great; yet the
paſſage between them may be very
ſhort: and a few moments may
bring us to exchange our Agonys
for Extaſies, and paſs from the
Lamentations of our Friends, and
the reproaches of our Perſecutors,
to the Congratulations of Angels,
and the ſolemn Welcoms of Him,
whom even thoſe Heavenly Spirits
adore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:98345:131"/>
As ſoon as ſhe had ended this
Diſcourſe, though her Soul, abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſuch a Body as hers, could
ſcarce any where but in Heaven,
find an advantage by a change of
Manſion; yet it cheerfully diſpos'd
it ſelf to a Separation, that would
give it a cloſer and more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Union with the Divine Object
of its Coeleſtial love. And after ſhe
had decently and calmly, made all
the preparation that on her part
was requiſite for what ſhe was to
ſuffer, ſhe thought fit to make her
Lifes laſt actions, as moſt of the
reſt had been, acts of Piety, and
Charity. And therefore elevating
her Eyes and Hands towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
where her Heart, as well as
her Treaſure, had been plac'd long
before; ſhe firſt paid her God
moſt humble thanks, for the Grace
and opportunity he had vouchſaf'd
her; <hi>not only to believe in his
Divine Son, but to ſuffer for him;</hi>
and then made a ſhort, but very
fervent Prayer, for the Church, for
her Enemies, and for her ſelf.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98345:132"/>
Which done, with a Countenance
wherein ſerenity was mingled with
joy, ſhe gave a ſign to the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
to do his Office; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
did all that was neceſſary to
compleat her Martyrdom. And
the glad Soul was by the Angels,
(whom ſhe had aſpir'd to reſemble
in Purity and Devotion) carry'd
to that happy place, whoſe Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys
are neither to be
Conceiv'd,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 9.</note> by thoſe that

Deſcrib'd by thoſe that

Felicities, as much Tranſcending
