            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>With Wine, which is still best for being old.</l>
               <l>Judgement in both, with vast expence and thought,</l>
               <l>You from their native soil, from <hi>Paris</hi> brought.</l>

               <l>You like industrious Spiders suck up all.</l>
               <l>Well might the French a Conquest here designe,</l>
               <l>Were but their Swords as dangerous as their Wine.</l>
               <l>Their Education yet is worse than both;</l>
               <l>They make our Virgins Nuns, unman our Youth.</l>
               <l>We that don't know 'em, think 'em Monsters too;</l>
               <l>And will, because we judge of 'em by you.</l>
               <l>You'll say, this once was so but now you're grown</l>
               <l>So wise t'invent new Follies of your own:</l>
               <l>Their slavish imitations you disdain;</l>
               <l>A Pox of Fops that purchase fame with pain:</l>
               <l>You're no such Fools as first to mount a Wall,</l>
               <l>Or for your King and Country venture all.</l>
               <l>With such-like grinning honour 'twas, perchance,</l>
               <l>Your dull Forefathers first did conquer <hi>France:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Whilst they have sent us in revenge for these,</l>
               <l>Their Women, Wine, Religion, and Disease.</l>
               <l>Yet for Religion, it's not much will down,</l>
               <l>In this ungirt, unblest, and mutinous Town.</l>
               <l>Nay, I dare swear, not one of you in Seven,</l>
               <l>E're had the impudence to hope for Heaven.</l>
               <l>In this you're modest—</l>
               <l>But as to Wit, most aim before their time;</l>
               <l>And he that cannot spell, sets up for Rhime:</l>
               <l>They're Sparks who are of noise and nonsence full,</l>
               <l>At Fifteen witty, and at Twenty dull;</l>
               <l>That in the Pit can huff, and talk hard words,</l>
               <l>And briskly draw Bamboo instead of Swords:</l>
               <l>But never yet Bancounter cou'd compare</l>
               <l>To our late vigorous <hi>Tartarian</hi> War:</l>
               <l>Cudgel the Weapon was, the Pit the Field;</l>
               <l>Fieree was the Heroe, and too brave to yield.</l>
               <l>But stoutest hearts must bow; and being well can'd,</l>
               <l>He crys, Hold, hold, you have the Victory gaiv'd.</l>
               <l>All laughing call—</l>
               <l>Turn out the Rascal, the eternal Blockhead.</l>
               <l>—Sounds, cry <hi>Tartarian,</hi> I am out of Pocket:</l>
               <l>Half Crown my Play, Six pence my Orange cost,</l>
               <l>Equip me that, do you the Conquest boast.</l>
               <l>For which, to be at ease, a gathering's made,</l>
               <l>And out they turn the Brother of the blade.</l>
               <l>—This is the fruits of idleness and ease.</l>

There's an old fusty Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher that instructs him; but 'tis in nothing that shall ever make a fine Gentleman of him: He teaches him a deal of Awe and Reverence to the Gods; and tells him that his natual Reason's sin—But, Colonel, between you and I, he'll no more of that Philosophie, but grows as sullen as if you had the breeding of him here i'th' Camp.</p>

                  <l>The Sun in all his glory, ne'er put on</l>

                  <l>The brightest Stars in all Heav'ns Canopie</l>

                  <l>The World was mine, and thousands such as thou</l>
                  <l>Still as I mov'd low to the Earth did bow;</l>
                  <l>Like thronging Curls upon the wanton Sea,</l>
                  <l>They strove, and were as numerous as they:</l>
                  <l>Thither I soon descended in a Cloud,</l>
                  <l>But in the midst of the adoring Crowd,</l>
                  <l>Almighty Woman at my feet did bow,</l>
                  <l>Adorn'd with beauties more than Heaven can show.</l>
                  <l>But one among the rest (for there were store)</l>

                  <l>She did unking me, and her wondrous Eyes,</l>
                  <l>Did all my Power and Thunder too despise:</l>
                  <l>Her Smiles could calm me, and her Looks were Law;</l>
                  <l>And when she frown'd, she kept my Soul in awe.</l>
