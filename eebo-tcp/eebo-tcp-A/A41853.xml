            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Title of this Book ſeems to promiſe but a narrow Hiſtory; and thoſe that only like great Revolutions, and variety of ſeveral Events, which have happened in a long Sequel of Time, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be much prepoſſeſſed in its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: The Conqueſt of an Iſland, altho' honour'd with the Title of a Kingdom, which was compleated in the ſecond Campaign, will appear to them too ſhort to furniſh an Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, with choice Materials. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Intereſt which all <hi>Europe</hi> had in this Affair, did not make it,
<pb facs="tcp:96181:6"/>
as indeed it did, one of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Accidents of the preceding Age; yet the taking of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> and deſolation thereof, being the Capital City of the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the Siege and Surrender of <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> which capitulated not till after a four Months vigorous Reſiſtance, and the memorable Victory of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto,</hi> deſerve the exact Care, which the Biſhop of <hi>Amelia</hi> has taken in Publiſhing them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> never ſaw her ſelf ſo threatned by the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Empire,</hi> as when <hi>Selim</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, form'd the Deſign of ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her this Kingdom; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Enterprize was carried on in the <hi>Divan,</hi> with more dexterity and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy. The Church then govern'd by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth (who was ſince Canoniz'd) was at the ſame time attack'd by ſeveral Reformers,
<pb facs="tcp:96181:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
authoriz'd by Secular Powers; and the <hi>Infidels,</hi> who always make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Diſunion of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> improved ſo favourable an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the enlargement of their Territories and Religion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> alarm'd by the foreſight of theſe Misfortunes, diſpatch'd <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio's,</hi> ſent <hi>Legates</hi> to all the Princes of <hi>Europe;</hi> and not content with theſe his good Endeavours, ſet out a Fleet at his own Charge, and offered to conduct it in Perſon for the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every Prince conſented or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to enter into the League propos'd by his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> according as he was intereſſed to break off, or keep in with the <hi>Port,</hi> and the Advantage he found in the Ruine or Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Republick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Courſe which the King of <hi>Spain, Philip</hi> the Second, held, is a
<pb facs="tcp:96181:7"/>
Piece of the moſt refined Policy. The <hi>Legate</hi> had no ſooner repreſented him with the danger, wherein the <hi>Republick</hi> lay, but he undertook to ſend a great Force, to its Aſſiſtance, and gave Orders at the ſame time, for the equipping of a conſiderable Fleet. All <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> could expect no leſs from a Monarch, who wore ſo many Crowns, and honour'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Title of <hi>Moſt Catholick King.</hi> But his Deſign was only to merit this Title in appearance; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſlowneſs which he uſed in making ready this Fleet, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Orders he gave to <hi>Requieſcens,</hi> Chief of the Council, to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> tended only to ruine the <hi>Republick,</hi> and by this means reduce <hi>Italy</hi> under his Power.</p>
                  <p>The Miniſters, and <hi>Venetian</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals happily penetrated into the ſecret Deſigns of <hi>Philip,</hi> and gave
<pb facs="tcp:96181:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpeedy Notice to their Maſters.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> juſtly grieved to find how unſincerely they were dealt with, made no ſcruple to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelves with the <hi>Turk,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the participation of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, altho' this was expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Treaty, they made with the <hi>Chriſtian Princes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is in the ſumming up of this variety of Intereſts, that our Author dives into, and diſcovers the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and Motions of the principal Courts of <hi>Europe;</hi> and we may well credit his Abilities and Faithfulneſs, from the Part which Cardinal <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendon</hi> gives him in all theſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Myſteries of State.</p>

                  <p>MOſt of the Ancient Geographers and Hiſtorians, have mentioned the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus</hi> with Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.

ſide of <hi>Aſia,</hi> being ſeparated by the violence of a Flood, which over-ran all thoſe Parts. She contains about two hundred Miles in Length, and ſixty five in Largeneſs; and is in Circuit near five hundred. 'Tis ſaid there were heretofore fifteen conſiderable Cities: But at preſent there are only reckoned five, which are well inhabited, <hi>Nicoſia, Famaguſta, Baffo, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſo,</hi> and <hi>Cerines.</hi> The reſt are Towns to the number of eight hundred and forty; and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, divided into eleven Regions or Quarters, named <hi>Baffo, Andimes, Limiſſo, Maſſota, Saſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Meſarea, Cruſſo, Pendengia, Cerines, Carpaſſo, Viſconti;</hi> This Iſland is reckoned at preſent to contain about two hundred thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, a ſmall number in compariſon of that with which 'twas peopled under the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Trajan:</hi> ſeeing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Report of <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n Caſſius,</hi> in the Life of this Prince, the <hi>Jews</hi> maſſacred in one day two hundred and forty thouſand <hi>Cypriots,</hi> to free themſelves from the Tyranny of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. The Inhabitants of this Iſland were ſeparated into four different States, the <hi>Nobility, Commonalty,</hi> the <hi>Freed-Men</hi> and <hi>Slaves.</hi> The two laſt were only employed in Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, and the others lived in Cities, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed the Country-people (contrary to Right) to Servitude and Slavery. They afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed the greateſt part of theſe, whom they called <hi>Francomates.</hi> Thoſe who not yet enjoyed their Liberty, called themſelves <hi>Pareſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens.</hi> They all mortally hated the <hi>Nobility;</hi> and eſpecially theſe latter, being worſt uſed by them.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96181:15"/>
The <hi>Militia</hi> of the Country was drawn from the <hi>Freed-Men,</hi> and conſiſted of a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Regiments and Companies.</p>
                  <p>The Heat of the Climate is the Cauſe why the <hi>Cypriots</hi> are ordinarily of a mean ſtature, and approach rather to Leanneſs than Fatneſs. They are more dexterous and nimble, than ſtrong and vigorous: They are of the ſame Complexion as moſt <hi>Greeks;</hi> their Hair is black, and their Wits delicate and ſurpaſſing; but their Plenty has made them ſoft and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched, and ſubject to Wine and Women. He was not counted a conſiderable man among them, who was not commonly ſerved in Silver; &amp; the Peaſants had each of them a Cup, a Spoon, a Knife, Handle and Fork of the ſame Metal. The <hi>Gentry</hi> lived in as great ſplendor as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Their Houſes were fill'd with Officers and Domeſticks. They were magnificent in Houſhold-ſtuff, as well as in Cloaths The Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of their Tables was equal to the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Cupboards of Plate; and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence they were at in Dogs and Horſes, was anſwerable to this their Profuſion and Luxury. The Incontinency and Looſneſs of their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, has given occaſion to Poets to feign, That aſſoon as <hi>Venus</hi> came out of the Sea, of whoſe Froth they ſay ſhe ſprang, ſhe firſt Landed at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and was thereupon firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cypriana,</hi> and <hi>Paphienna,</hi> becauſe of a magnificent Temple built in Honour of her, in the famous City of <hi>Paphos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Iſle abounding in all ſort of things, yet ſuffers oft times by the great ſcarcity of Water.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96181:16"/>
We read in the Annals of this Country, that the Inhabitants were driven out by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary drought, and that for ſeventeen years together there was no Rain. She is watered with no River. The Rain ſometimes in the Winter cauſes Torrents, which fall from the Mountains with great ſwiftneſs, but are ſoon dried up by the exceſſive heat of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral Wells and Fountains, but they are ſubject to the forementioned Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience: Yet do's the Earth bring forth of it ſelf a prodigious quantity of Fruits. A Third part of Wheat, and other Grains which they gather, is more than what's ſufficient for the Inhabitants. Their Wines are ſo delicious, that they are counted the beſt of all <hi>Greece;</hi> and the Iſle produces ſo great abundance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that it is thought <hi>Selim,</hi> who was more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Wine than any of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, had no greater Motive to conquer it, than that of poſſeſſing ſo delicious a Vineyard. They made ſo much Salt, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> yearly drew three hundred thouſand Crowns, as a Tax on that quantity which Strangers bought up there. Silk and Sugar make up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other great part of its Revenues. She is no leſs fertil in Olives, Honey, Wax, Saffron, Flax, and ſeveral other neceſſary Commodites; but eſpecially in choice Medicinal Herbs and Drugs. They have alſo Mines of different Metals. There is likewiſe to be found ſeveral Precious Stones; and in general, whatſoever the Earth contains that's rich and rare in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96181:16"/>
depth of its Bowels. Its Ayr, in truth, is not anſwerable to the goodneſs of its Soyl; immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate heats rendring the whole Iſland un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy, and in ſome parts contagious, ſo that it ſeems as if its Malignity would raviſh from the <hi>Cypriots</hi> the pleaſure of a long enjoyment of Natures Favours; few of them arriving to great maturity of Years.</p>
                  <p>This Country was firſt invaded by Tyrants; from whoſe hands the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> reſcued it. <hi>Publius Clodius,</hi> as well known by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Baniſhment drew on him, as by his Boldneſs and Birth, took it from the Kings of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This young <hi>Roman</hi> falling into the hands of Pyrates, ſent to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to pay his Ranſom; who offering only a ſmall Sum to the <hi>Corſary's,</hi> they freely gave <hi>Clodius</hi> his Liberty; who, after that, ſought means to revenge himſelf of the ſlight value the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſet on him.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as he ſaw himſelf Tribune of the People, he made a Decree, by which the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus</hi> was declared a Province of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and <hi>Mark Cato</hi> was preſently ordered to take poſſeſſion of it, and tranſport its Riches to <hi>Rome.</hi> He found ſuch vaſt Treaſures, as gave cauſe to think they had tempted the <hi>Romans</hi> covetous humour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was ſo aſhamed and enraged to ſee himſelf ſtript of this <hi>State</hi> by a Citizen of the <hi>Republick,</hi> that he ended his Life with Deſpair and Vexation.</p>
                  <p>After the Fall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> poſſeſſed this Iſle to the Year
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96181:17"/>
1190, when <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> took it from <hi>Iſaac Comnenus,</hi> who had made himſelf the Tyrant of it; and drove him thence, for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the uſe of his Havens to the Fleet, which he conducted to the Recovery of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſold it ſometime after to the <hi>Templers,</hi> whoſe Order was then moſt rich and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But their Eſtabliſhment in this Iſland, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving excited ſeveral Seditions, they yielded their Purchace to <hi>Guy de Luſignan,</hi> King of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> whom the <hi>Infidels</hi> had deſpoyled of his Crown. <hi>Guy</hi> died two years after his Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and left the Iſle to his Brother <hi>Amaury;</hi> under whoſe Government, ſhe was re-peopled, and rendred more fertil than heretofore, having drawn thither ſeveral Families of Strangers, by virtue of Immunities, Exemptions and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. He ſent a famous Embaſſie to <hi>Rome,</hi> to obtain of the <hi>Pope</hi> the Title of <hi>King. Hugo,</hi> his Son, ſucceeded him; who left his Crown to his Son <hi>Henry:</hi> He was the Father of <hi>Hugo</hi> the Second, who died young, and without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Another <hi>Hugo,</hi> his Couſin-German, Son to the Prince of <hi>Pouille,</hi> and <hi>Iſabella, Henry</hi>'s Siſter, was placed on the Throne, as his neareſt Relation, and took the Sirname of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> to make himſelf more agreeable to the <hi>Cypriots. John,</hi> his Son, inherited his Crown, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe left it to his Son, <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. This Prince being troubled with the <hi>Falling-Sickneſs,</hi> was declared unfit to ſucceed; and his Brother <hi>Amaury,</hi> having cauſed him to be taken by force, ſent him to <hi>Aiton,</hi> the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> his Brother-in-Law; who ſhut him up in Priſon.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96181:17"/>
This Treaſon remained not long unpuniſh'd; for the Uſurper was aſſaſſinated in his Bed by one of the Officers of his Chamber, named <hi>Simonnet. Henry</hi> was afterwards eſtabliſh'd; to whom ſucceeded <hi>Hugo,</hi> his Nephew. This <hi>Hugo,</hi> the Third of that Name, was Father of <hi>Peter,</hi> who merited by his rare Valour, the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Couragious.</hi> This Kingdom had never been ſo flouriſhing as it was under the Reign of this brave Prince. He ſetled a Commerce in the City of <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> with all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States; which enriched his Subjects, and yielded him alſo an infinite Treaſure. He ſet out a Fleet of Fifty Gallies, with which, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and thoſe of the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> having joyned their Forces, he took the City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and carried his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts as far as <hi>Syria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After theſe glorious Exploits, he intended to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to pay his Reſpects to that <hi>See;</hi> but during his Abſence, the Count <hi>de Rocas,</hi> to whom he had left the Government of his State, debauch'd the Queen, his Wife, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped the Sovereign Authority.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> advertiz'd of this on his way, returns ſpeedily to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> ſeizeth on the Traytor, and delivers him into the Hands of his Juſtices, to be puniſh'd according to the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: But his great Eſtate, his Credit, and the Protection of the Queen, having corrupted his Judges, he was diſcharged as innocent; and <hi>Viſconti,</hi> Maſter of the King's Houſhold, his Accuſer, condemn'd to a perpetual Baniſhment: This Prince being rendred furious and cruel
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96181:18"/>
by the unjuſtice of this Proceeding, extended his Revenge ſo far, as made all the <hi>Cypriots</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: He loaded 'em with Irons, and condemned 'em to die on the leaſt complaint, and meaneſt appearance of the ſmalleſt Crime. He raviſh'd the Honour of their Wives and Daughters, and expos'd them moreover to the Brutality of the Miniſters of his Paſſion, not ſuffering them to ſpare any.</p>
                  <p>To encreaſe the Terror and Confuſion of his Subjects, he cauſed a new Priſon to be built in the moſt publick part of the City, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced whom he pleaſed of the Inhabitants, of both Sexes, to work at it: But a couragious bold Woman animated them to a Revolt, in this manner; Being a Gentlewoman born, and finding her ſelf forced to ſerve Brick-layers and Maſons, held up her Coats and Shift to her knees, and remained in this immodeſt poſture in expectation of the King, who was to come to ſee the Workmen, attended by all his Court.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as he was over againſt her, ſhe let down her Coats, and ſate on the ground; but ſhe aroſe preſently after he was paſt, with ſuch Impudence as ſcandalized the Beholders. Every one ſurpriz'd with this Spectacle, and being not able to gueſs at the Reaſon, ſome ask'd her, why ſhe was not aſhamed of her Nakedneſs ſave only in the preſence of the King? She anſwered coldly, that ſhe and the Women with her, did not look ſo exactly about 'em; for having ſeen no <hi>Man</hi> but the <hi>King,</hi> ſhe thought ſhe ſhould not offend againſt Modeſty, but only in regard of him: Theſe People net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

by this ſharp Reproach, fell on the Prince, and maſſacred him. His Son, named <hi>Petrin,</hi> or <hi>Petrote,</hi> was ſet up in his place. This new King, having done the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> the honour to eat at his Table, theſe Miniſters could not agree about Precedency; but he decided it in favour of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> The <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> to be reveng'd of the Affront which they pretended to have received, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt him: But their Conſpiracy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing detected, all the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> about the Palace, were ſeiz'd on; who were thrown immediatly down from an high Tower on the points of the Halberts. All of that Nation were uſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Iſland in the ſame manner. The <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Genoa,</hi> concern'd at this Uſage, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared War againſt the King of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> and for that end, ſet forth a Fleet of Ships, under the Command of <hi>Peter Fregoſa.</hi> This Captain made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> being of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the Queen-Mother, whoſe Treaſon reduc'd her Son to ſuch an extremity, that he conſented to yield the Place to the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> and pay them a yearly Tribute; and for the ſurer Payment thereof, gave Prince <hi>James,</hi> his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and his Couſin-Germans for Hoſtages. His Death put his Uncle in poſſeſſion of the Crown, being then a Priſoner at <hi>Genoa:</hi> but he demitted it into the hands of his Son <hi>John</hi> the Second, otherwiſe <hi>Janus,</hi> being thus call'd from the City of <hi>Genoa,</hi> where he was born; the <hi>Mamelucs</hi> made War againſt him, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him in a Combat, wherein he was taken Priſoner, and thence carried into <hi>Egypt:</hi> Theſe

                     <hi>Barbarians</hi> reſtor'd him not to his Liberty, till they had drawn great Sums from him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him to pay eight thouſand Crowns year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tribute; whereunto his Succeſſors ſhould be alſo bound for ever to the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Tribute was punctually paid, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> become Maſters of the Place, thought themſelves oblig'd to ſend it every year to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſince the extinction of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melucs,</hi> from whom <hi>Selim</hi> conquered <hi>Egypt. Janus</hi> had only one Son, nam'd <hi>John,</hi> a Prince of a weak Conſtitution both of Body and Mind, whom the Queen, his Wife, govern'd at her Will: Their only Daughter, nam'd <hi>Charlotta,</hi> was firſt married to a Prince of the Family of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who having been poyſoned, ſhe eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Lewis,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> He reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not long after the Deceaſe of <hi>John,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law. <hi>James,</hi> Baſtard-Brother to the Queen, who was deſign'd for the Arch-Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> could not ſuffer a Stranger to bereave him of the Crown; ſo renouncing his Eccleſiaſtical Profeſſion, he had recourſe to the Protection of the <hi>Mamelucs,</hi> by whoſe Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he drove out the Queen <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and Prince <hi>Lewis,</hi> her Husband, recovered <hi>Fama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta</hi> from the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> and made himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the whole Iſland.

Cornaro,</hi> being of one of the moſt ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in <hi>Venice.</hi> She was adopted by the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> and afterwards conducted to the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to King <hi>James.</hi> This Prince died ſome time after his Marriage, and left the Queen pregnant; whom he made by his Will Heireſs with the Child which ſhe was to bring into the World: She was delivered of a Boy, who was likewiſe named <hi>James,</hi> and lived not above ten Months.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> conſidered the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus</hi> as a State very commodious for them.

and to extend their Dominion as far as <hi>Aſia,</hi> whence by this means they might draw great Advantages, it was on the other hand troubleſom to them to have a State environ'd with thoſe of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally threatned by this formidable Power. That which heightned the more their inquietude, was, That there was no fortifi'd place in the whole Iſland except the City of <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> which was too weak to reſiſt the Invaſions of the <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Selim,</hi> who ſince declared War with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> was then Governor of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and learnt them by his Conduct, that he earneſtly intended the Conqueſt of this Iſland. Theſe Suſpicions obliged the <hi>Senate</hi> to ſend thither <hi>Julius Savorniani,</hi> with a plenary Power. He was a Perſon of Noble Birth, whoſe long Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, together with thoſe of his Father, had rendered him deſervedly famous. He was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to fortifie the Iſland as he thought fit, but with all poſſible diligence, leſt he ſhould be prevented by <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who was then at War with the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and commanded his Army in perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Savorniani,</hi> who was a man of a lively and undertaking Spirit, took Shipping aſſoon as ever he had his Diſpatches. Scarcely was he arrived on the Iſland, but he began to ſurround it, and view thoſe Places which moſt needed to be fortified, with ſuch an exact diligence as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the good Opinion the <hi>Senate</hi> had of him. He thought at firſt to build new Walls, and raiſe new Forts to the City of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> being the Capital of the Kingdom, ſituated in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96181:20"/>
the midſt of the Iſland, and was then about four Miles in compaſs. The Nobility made their uſual Reſidence there; the Riches of the Inhabitants rendered her the moſt wealthy and important place of all the Country; and had ſhe been put in a capacity to ſuſtain a Siege, might have proved, by reaſon of its greatneſs, moſt commodious for a Retreat to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-people in a time of War. Neither did the Charge, nor Difficulty of the Enterprize, which had always deterred the preceding Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, diſcourage <hi>Savorniani.</hi> Having aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Nobility, he ſhewed them the intereſt they had to fortifie their City, to ſecure their Poſſeſſions from the Rapine and Avarice of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and that it was of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to their particular preſervation, and that of the whole State, theſe Works ſhould be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed before the end of ſix Months. Theſe Gentlemen comprehending the danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were threatned, return'd <hi>Savorniani</hi> their Thanks, approve his Deſign, and offer him all that in them lay to facilitate it. He then cauſed ſeveral Workmen and Slaves to come to <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> he pulled down the ancient Walls and adjoyning Houſes, and drew a new Line in a round Figure, leſs than the former, which beginning from an Eminency Northward, near the old Walls, ended at 400 paces near the firſt Circumvallation: He fortify'd it with twelve Baſtions in ſuch a manner that each defended the other with its Cannon. He choſe as many of the beſt qualify'd Gentlemen; to every one of which he committed the care of carrying
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96181:21"/>
forward a Baſtion, and permitted them for a recompence, to call them after their Names. He thought he ought thus to engage them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance theſe Works, and edge 'em on by this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle point of Honour to ſpare no coſt nor pains to haſten forward ſo important a Matter. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them himſelf by his vigilancy and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, going about inceſſantly from one Work to another, and not looſing a moment the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men out of his ſight. This Enterprize was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with ſuch a diligence as ſurpriz'd all People: for theſe Baſtions and the Wall were in a ſhort time brought on to a reaſonable height, and the Ditch made deep enough to defend it ſelf againſt a great Army. The Noiſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of this Work gave the more joy and hopes to the Republick, becauſe it coſt her but little, and becauſe one of her Magiſtrates had ſo happily and ſpeedily finiſh'd it. But the <hi>Turks</hi> took offence at it, and ſeem'd ſtrangly out of humor to ſee an Iſland fortify'd againſt 'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the heart of their Empire, which they had always look'd on with diſcontent in the hands of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> altho' without defence, and expos'd as a prey</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain that <hi>Solyman</hi> conceived an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſpight at it: He fancied the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhewed by this precaution a great contempt of his Age, and expected he wou'd never return from his expedition in <hi>Germany,</hi> where he then made War with that vigor and reſolution as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a young Victorious Prince. 'Tis thought he would have ſtript them of it, had he lived longer: but dying in <hi>Hungary,</hi> at the Siege of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96181:21"/>
                     <hi>Sigeth, Muſtapha,</hi> one of the Generals of his Army, inſpired his Son <hi>Selim,</hi> who ſucceeded him, with his Father's Hatred and Reſentment. This new Emperor believing likewiſe the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> had fortify'd this Iſle againſt him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on the Deſign which he had long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated, of conquering it.</p>
                  <p>And being come to the beginning of his Reign, 'tis not amiſs to ſhew the Reader his Humor, his Genius, and Conduct; having firſt in few words given an Account of the Princes his Brethrens Deſtiny.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solyman</hi> had five Sons, whoſe Birth could no leſs contribute to the happineſs and honour of his Reign, than the Victories he had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had not Ambition and Jealouſie ſtifled in his Heart the Sentiments of Nature. <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> his eldeſt Son, whoſe Mother was a <hi>Circaſian</hi> Slave, had acquir'd by his excellent Qualities, the Love and Eſteem of the whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. He was eſpecially ador'd by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery. His excellent Virtues, inſtead of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Father, excited his Jealouſie and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance; ſo that ſuſpecting him to deſign the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving him of his Crown, he rais'd an Army, under pretence of carrying the War into <hi>Perſia,</hi> &amp; cauſing him to be ſeized on in his Camp, made his Eunuchs ſtrangle him in his preſence. <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girus,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Crump-Back,</hi> by reaſon of his Deformity, affrighted at the barbarous uſage of his Brother, ended his Life in Rage and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, vomiting out a Thouſand Curſes at the Cruelty of his Father. <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Third, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe ſuſpected by <hi>Solyman,</hi> as being no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96181:23"/>
leſs beloved by the Army than his brother <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha,</hi> was forced by the ill uſage he received, to preſerve himſelf by open force, and loſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately a Battle; after which, flying for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to <hi>Tammas,</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> this cruel and Perfidious Prince, affrighted by <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> Threatnings, or corrupted by his Money, delivered him to Executioners, who accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Ambaſſadors which the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had ſent him. <hi>Mahomet</hi> died in the Flower of his Age; and <hi>Selim, Roxalana</hi>'s Son, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, by the death of his four Brothers, <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s only Heir.</p>
                  <p>He was born in 1520, the ſame Year where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in died his Grandfather <hi>Selim,</hi> and was educated in the Art of Government according to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Maxims. Aſſoon as he was at Age, he had the Charge of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and took on him after the Death of his Brother <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Government of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which he ruled during <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Life. This Prince was very happy, if we compare his Fortune with the ſad Diſaſter of his Brethren, who left him ſole and peaceable Heir of a mighty Empire; But on the other hand, very unlike in his manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to his Predeceſſor. He ſhew'd from his Infancy no inclination to War, nor Quality befitting a Prince; but on the contrary, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating from the Sobriety of his Anceſtors, he plunged himſelf into all kinds of Debauchery, and eſpecially in Drunkenneſs, againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Prohibition of his Law. His Table, which, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Seralio,</hi> ſhould be mean and frugal, was covered with the moſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96181:23"/>
delicious and coſtly Meats, and always ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with <hi>Dwarfs, Buffoons</hi> and <hi>Paraſites.</hi> He uſually made one of his <hi>Baſhaws</hi> to dine with him, call'd <hi>Achmet,</hi> a gluttonous, drunken Fellow, who rendered himſelf acceptable to his Prince, by drinking with him whole days together; they uſually held on their Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries till Midnight, and were commonly carried away from the Table de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> drunk. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in Eating and Drinking, made <hi>Selim</hi> ſo groſs and unwieldy, that together with the Redneſs which the Wine gave the Whiteneſs of his Complexion, he reſembled very well the Poet's <hi>Bacchus,</hi> when leaving the Table, he repos'd himſelf croſs-legg'd on Carpets, according to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner. He was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to all thoſe Vices which attend ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Drinking. He was much in the <hi>Seralio,</hi> amongſt the Ladies; and yet this Paſſion could not keep him from a more brutiſh and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable one, which is too common amongſt filthy wretches, who know no Meaſure nor Rule in their Senſualities. He cauſed to be brought up with great Care, ſeveral youths, the comlieſt of which, ſerved about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; on whom he would ſometimes beſtow great Penſions, and conſiderable Employments, according to their Capacity. He took much delight in ſeeing them wreſtle, draw the Bow, and perform their other Exerciſes in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the <hi>Seralio:</hi> But this was always in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, leſt he ſhould abaſe the Majeſty of ſo great an Emperor; and therefore appear'd but ſeldom at theſe Spectacles. When he went
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96181:22"/>
forth to take the Diverſion of Hunting, on the ſide of <hi>Aſia,</hi> with his Dogs and Falcons, he paſs'd over the Channel in cover'd Boats, inſtead of riding on Horſeback out of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi> He minded as little the enlarging his Territories, as depriving himſelf of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he enjoyed in a ſhameful Repoſe. Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Flattery had ſo corrupted his Mind, that he thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>mſelf above all humane Greatneſs. Had he followed his own Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not been led by his Miniſters, he would have been content with the Conqueſts of his Anceſtors, and languiſhed in the ſoft Life of the <hi>Seralio,</hi> ſuffering all the Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> to live in Peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Piali,</hi> and <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who had long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Father's Armies, were two of his greateſt Confidents; and the Favour of <hi>Piali</hi> was grounded on the Honour of his Alliance. <hi>Solyman</hi> returning victorious from the Siege of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> found him lying expos'd in the Fields; where, his Mother, frighted by the March of the Army, had left him. This Prince, in his Paſſage, took the Pleaſure of Hunting, and ſeeing the Child, whom the Dogs were about to devour, gave order it ſhould be taken up, and carried to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> He was educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Seralio</hi> with great Care; and his towardly Inclinations, joyned to the progreſs which he made in his Exerciſes, recommended him ſo greatly to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Affection, that he gave him his Son <hi>Selim</hi>'s Daughter in Marriage. The <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes acknowledge no other Nobility of Extraction in their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96181:22"/>
giving their Daughters in Marriage to ſuch of their Slaves, whom they believe merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Honour by their Services. <hi>Piali,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long commanded the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Land-Forces, was made Captain <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had attended <hi>Selim</hi> from his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and corrupted his few good Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons through too much Mildneſs and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. But that which acquir'd him greateſt Favour, was the ſignal Service, he did him in the Fight betwixt him and his Brother <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet;</hi> for theſe two ambitious Princes were in diſpute about the Empire, in <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. <hi>Selim</hi>'s Army was routed, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was put to flight; when <hi>Muſtapha</hi> rallying his Troops, made him return to a ſecond Charge; and falling on <hi>Bajazet</hi> with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Valour, he won the Victory from him, and wholly defeated him; But <hi>Mahomet</hi> was he, who of all the Miniſters of the Port, moſt abſolutely poſſeſſed his Maſter's Favour, and had alſo given him the greateſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Mark of Fidelity and Affection: For aſſoon as <hi>Solyman</hi> expired in <hi>Hungary,</hi> he was ſo prudent, as to keep his Death ſecret, and preſt forward the Siege of <hi>Sigeth,</hi> with as great vigor, as if the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had been yet alive; ſo that he carried the Place by Aſſault, maugre all the Efforts of the <hi>German</hi> Empire.

of his averſeneſs to Wars; loudly talking du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Father's Life, That he was not of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Race, but that <hi>Roxalana,</hi> his Mother, pretending a big Belly, had Fathered on <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the Child of a certain <hi>Jewiſh Woman;</hi> and therefore they ſtuck not to call him according to his ſuppoſed Birth.</p>
                  <p>And to make this Calumny paſs the better, they added, he was a Favourer of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are more abominable and odious amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> than amongſt any other People; and therefore to gratifie one <hi>John Miches,</hi> a Fugivive from <hi>Spain,</hi> for his <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of his Father <hi>Solyman,</hi> one of the ancient Cities of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and ſeveral Countries round about, to eſtabliſh a Colony of thoſe wretched People. Theſe Rumors made the greateſt part of the Army to prefer <hi>Amurah,</hi> a Prince of Twenty years of Age, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations were anſwerable to his Birth. But thus <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſetled the Crown on <hi>Selim</hi>'s Head without oppoſition; and for a Reward of this Service, the new Emperor gave him the Seals, with the Quality of <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> which is the firſt Miniſter in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire: He was already his Son-in-Law; ſo that <hi>Selim</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Government to his Care, and gave himſelf over to the Pleaſures and Softneſs of the <hi>Seralio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mahomet</hi> was too quick-ſighted, not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that a Favour like his, muſt draw on him much Envy: That Princes oft change their Favourites, and ſuffer with regret, thoſe, to whom they believe they are much obliged,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96181:25"/>
reſpecting them as importunate Creditors, they endeavour to get rid of them aſſoon as any ſpecious Pretence offers it ſelf to colour their Ingratitude. The Example of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s, whom a <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> ruined, without letting the World know the Occaſion, made him wary and ſolicitous to ſtrengthen himſelf in his high Places. He began by free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Selim</hi> from the perplexity of Affairs, which might diſturb his Pleaſures. He afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all thoſe who were not his Friends, from the Prince's Preſence, and brought into their Places ſuch as were affectionated to his Service; and by this means rul'd all at his will. The <hi>Baſſaes</hi> and other <hi>Viſiers</hi> acted only by his Directions, and each of them made their Court to him in the ſame manner as if he had been their Emperor.</p>
                  <p>Since the renewing of the Treaty, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance between the Port and the neighbouring States, and confirmation thereof between <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi> and the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſign'd three years after, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire enjoyed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Peace; the Continuation of which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be laſting, by means of <hi>Selim</hi>'s ſluggiſh and luxurious humor. But the Souldiers being accuſtomed under the preceding Reigns, to Pillage on the neighbouring Countries, tired with Eaſe, murmured at the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Affairs; ſaying, he abuſed his Intereſt in the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> and inſtead of bringing him off from his Debauches, rather enticed him to continue them; diſſwading him from following the Example of his Father and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96181:26"/>
Grandfather, who had conquered ſo many Kingdoms, and carried their victorious Arms to the Ends of the World. They added, That this Lethargy brought ſhame to the Majeſty of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; and that the Idleneſs wherein ſo many brave Men were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſpend their days, was no leſs diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than the Softneſs of their Sovereign; That his Grandfather, whoſe Name he did bear, had not thus reign'd, who by ſeveral Conqueſts acquired with immortal Honour, by the entire Defeat of the <hi>Mamelucs,</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of all <hi>Egypt;</hi> That the <hi>Sultans</hi> were not ſet up to enjoy peaceably what their Predeceſſors had left them, but to enlarge their Empire by new Conqueſts, and reduce the Univerſe to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law: That it belong'd only to private perſons to buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in conſerving their Poſſeſſions; but So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns ſhould have no other End than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit their Countrey: That tho' <hi>Selim</hi> wanted Gourage and Conduct to tread in his Anceſtors ſteps, yet ought he to maintain his Empire by the ſame ways it was eſtabliſh'd; and that as great Motions, and the noiſe of War, keep men in breath, and ſtir up Valour and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo Reſt and Luxury ſerve only to abaſe and depreſs them: That their Emperors did not get their Poſſeſſions by Drunkenneſs and Luxury, but by Labour and Hardſhip: That <hi>Selim,</hi> not contented to fruſtrate them of the Largeſs which the new Emperors uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the Souldiery, at their firſt coming to the Crown, would alſo deprive them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96181:26"/>
of the only means to defend themſelves againſt Poverty and Miſery, although the flouriſhing State of the Empire was the effect of their Labour and Faithfulneſs; and, That, in fine, 'twas very hard to buy thus dear the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>Prime Viſier,</hi> whoſe covetous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor could not be ſatisfied, tho' the whole World ſhould drain it ſelf dry to fill it.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiers were diſcontented at <hi>Selim</hi>'s Advancement to the Empire, and not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cuſtom of diſtributing Money amongſt them, which the <hi>Sultans</hi> are wont to do; and eſpecially the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who were perſwaded that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was the Author of this Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and <hi>Piali,</hi> whoſe Favour this Chief Miniſter endeavoured to ruine, ſecretly entertain'd and cheriſh'd theſe Complaints and Murmurs. <hi>Piali</hi> had been diſgraced, and thrown out of his Office, but the Tears and Prayers of his Wife regained his Re-eſtabliſhment from the Emperor, this Princeſſes Father. <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> having been ſent againſt certain People who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit along the Coaſts of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> had met with bad Succeſs in his Expedition, by the Treachery of <hi>Synam,</hi> Baſſa of <hi>Egypt:</hi> he was accuſed, not only for making War with a kind of indifferency, but treating under-hand with the Revolters, to diſmember <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſhare it betwixt them.</p>

                     <hi>Synam,</hi> who ſought all ways to procure Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from the <hi>Prime Viſier,</hi> became his Accuſer, and <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Crime appear'd more plainly, by having eſpouſed the Daughter of King <hi>Tomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nbeius,</hi> when <hi>Selim</hi> I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exterminated the <hi>Mame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucs.

Mahomet,</hi> who knew the jealous Temper of the Prince, repreſented to him this Affair, as a matter that required a moſt ſevere Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thereupon obliged him to ſend an Executioner into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to bring him <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Head. 'Tis a Cuſtom eſtabliſhed by theſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> from the Tyrannical Power of the Sovereigns, and blind Obedience of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that aſſoon as the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> requires the Head of one of his Generals, tho' he then commanded all the Forces of the Empire, he ſubmiſſively offers himſelf to the Will of the Executioner. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> having notice of his Diſgrace and Sentence, parts immediately from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> where <hi>Amurah,</hi> the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Eldeſt Son, perſwaded of his Innocence, took him under his Protection, and preſented him himſelf to his Father; <hi>Muſtapha</hi> caſting himſelf at <hi>Selim</hi>'s Feet, told him with great Freedom, I will obey without the leaſt Repugnancy your Highneſſes Orders, if I am ſentenced to Death; but if my Enemies, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Power, and your Bounty, overwhelm me by the blackneſs of their Calumnies, I ſhall have at leaſt the Conſolation, that it ſhall be my Sovereign, and not they that ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my Doom.

                  <p>When the <hi>Wine, Sugar,</hi> and other <hi>Fruits,</hi> which the Governors of <hi>Cyprus</hi> were wont to ſend every year to <hi>Selim,</hi> were preſented; <hi>Miches</hi> derided theſe Preſents, telling the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, to ſet him againſt the Republick, that they were more becoming the mean ſpirited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Merchants that ſent them, than the greatneſs of the Prince that received them. He added, That the <hi>Venetians</hi> made continual infractions in the laſt Treaty of Peace, in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving into their Ports ſuch as were Pyrates, and Enemies to his Highneſs: That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> made not a Prize on the <hi>Turks,</hi> but under the intelligence of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and, That, if he ſuffered the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Sea</hi> to be infeſted with theſe Robbers, all his Subjects muſt give over Trading; which would be as diſadvantageous to his Reputation, as contrary to his Profit: That the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion was no leſs intereſſed, ſeeing by this means the Acceſſes to <hi>Meca</hi> were block'd up, and all Liberty taken away of viſiting <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s Tomb, whither ſo many devout <hi>Turks</hi> went on Pilgrimage: That under pretence of chaſing the <hi>Corſary's,</hi> they purſued his Subjects

with ſo great rage and fury, that they cut the Throats of thoſe who ſurrendred without fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <p>Some have affirmed, he gave the poſſeſſion of it to this <hi>Miches,</hi> and that in the midſt of a great Debauch, he had call'd him King of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus:</hi> But whether he really deſign'd to ſet the Crown on the Head of this profligate <hi>Jew,</hi> which is very contrary to the uſual Genius of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Policy and Cuſtoms, or only to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his Appetite to delicious Wines; he in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this Project, fortify'd that part of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which is over againſt the Iſland, and divided only by a ſpace of ſixty Miles.</p>
                  <p>The pains the <hi>Turks</hi> took to fortifie a Place ſo long neglected, gave great Suſpicions to the <hi>Venetians:</hi> But <hi>Selim</hi> being become Emperor, forgat this Enterprize; the remembrance of which was not to be offered to a Prince, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing in effeminate Pleaſures. Yet did <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> and <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſpend whole days and nights in projecting, how to bring him handſomly to undertake the old Deſign; and they thought no way could be better than to rouze him by the Murmurings of his Souldiers, who loudly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a War. They made uſe alſo of ſome of the Women-Favourites, who hated <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:96181:33"/>
to give him this Advice; and <hi>Selim,</hi> diſturb'd with this troubleſom Relation, would know this Miniſters Opinion: <hi>Mahomet</hi> counſelled him to yield to a War; telling him, what a happy opportunity offered it ſelf for it; the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> having ſent to intreat aſſiſtance from his Highneſs, againſt the Tyranny of King <hi>Phillip</hi> the Second.</p>
                  <p>The Novelty of this Enterprize, ſurpriz'd the more the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> being ignorant why the <hi>Moors</hi> would revolt againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> and what For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they were able to raiſe againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: But he willingly received the Propoſition of turning his Arms on the ſide of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>Mahomet</hi> having ſhewed him he could not declare a War againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating the Oath he had taken; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil thereupon broke up, without determining any thing, tho' <hi>Selim</hi> matter'd not much the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which were offered him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors believe nothing ſo great, nor magnificent, whereby to eternize their Names, as to be the Founders of <hi>Moſques</hi> and Places of Religious Worſhip. Theſe Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are lightned within by an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Lamps, which are always burning during their Ceremonies, and they have Prieſts, and particular Miniſters belonging to each of them; the Porches, and ſeveral other parts of theſe Churches, are paved with Marble, enriched with quantity of Precious Stones, and wrought by ſeveral skilful <hi>Italian</hi> Architects, who, for Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, make no ſcruple to be hired by theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. But this Magnificence reaches further;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96181:33"/>
they build Hoſpitals near theſe Moſques, call'd <hi>Kervanſarai,</hi> of as beautiful Structure as the other, in which are put all poor and ſick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are as neatly, as carefully look'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. All Travellers may remain there three days, without diſtinction of Country or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Slaves are therein received, as well as thoſe that are Free, and the greatneſs of their Number makes no man refus'd. There are alſo ſeveral Children brought up in them. <hi>Selim</hi> had a Deſign to build one of theſe Hoſpitals, with a Moſque, which ſhould ſurpaſs, not only in Largeneſs and Richneſs, the <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanſarai</hi> of <hi>Solyman</hi> his Father, but likewiſe all thoſe which had been raiſed by his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. The <hi>Mufti,</hi> who is (as it were) the High Prieſt amongſt them, ſhewed him, 'twas an ancient Cuſtom, eſtabliſhed by God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to employ in theſe fort of Foundations, the Booty gain'd from the Enemies of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and eſpecially from the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who moſt contemn the <hi>Prophet,</hi> and his <hi>Law.

                     <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> whilſt theſe things were in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, found a ſeaſonable time, which he had long ſought, of enteraining the <hi>Sultan</hi> in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. He remembred him, That the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperors began their Reign with ſome Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Enterprize, and valued more the Reſpect and Submiſſion paid them by their Subjects, on the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96181:34"/>
account of a Victory, or ſome Conqueſt, than from their Right of Sovereignty. That <hi>Selim,</hi> his Grandfather, whoſe Memory will be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all Ages, came no ſooner to the Throne, than he carried his Arms to <hi>Perſia,</hi> and having won a ſignal Victory in the Plains of <hi>Calderana,</hi> from the <hi>Sophi Iſmael,</hi> a Prince renowned for his Valour, he made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Tauris,</hi> then the Capital City of that great and famous People: and that this Advantage was only a Prelude to the Glory he afterwards acquired by the ſame Arms. That <hi>Solyman,</hi> his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Father, burning with Zeal to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, made War with the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and ſignaliz'd his firſt Campaign by the taking of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> from which the Emperors <hi>Amurah</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> had ſhamefully rais'd the Siege with conſiderable loſs; and by this Conqueſt, bereaved the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi> of their Reputation of being the beſt Souldiers in <hi>Europe:</hi> He afterwards took the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> from the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Knights, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſworn irreconcileable Enemies, with the ſame valour and ſpeed: That the <hi>Venetians</hi> had likewiſe felt the effort of his victorious Arms; and being ſtraightned ſometimes by Hunger, otherwhiles by his Troops, they were forced, for the ſaving of the Iſles of <hi>Zant, Cephalonia,</hi> and <hi>Corfou;</hi> to conſent to a ſhameful Peace, and to yield him <hi>Naplouſia</hi> and <hi>Malvaſia,</hi> Places of Conſequence, and great Strength, with all the <hi>Morea:</hi> That the <hi>Venetian</hi> State, being deſtin'd to furniſh the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire with Conqueſts, they ought to reckon on a

certain Victory, in declaring War againſt this <hi>Republick:</hi> That, he juſtly drew it upon her, by fortifying a Tributary Kingdom, as if ſhe would maintain by Force what ſhe held only at his Highneſs's Pleaſure: That <hi>Solyman</hi> would not have ſuffered this Inſolency, but driven out the <hi>Venetians</hi> from the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for putting themſelves into a poſture of Defence, whilſt he made War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and thus profiting by his Abſence; he having been often heard to ſay, ſome time before his Death, in a great Paſſion, That <hi>if he return'd Conqueror to</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>he would turn all his Forces toward that Iſland, attacking it both by Sea and Land:</hi> That his Highneſs ſhould the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enter into this his Father's Reſentment, ſeeing God had permitted the <hi>Venetians</hi> to fail of their reſpect towards him at his coming to the Crown, by protecting ſuch as pillaged his Frontiers, and exercis'd their Rapines as well by Land as Sea: That the Ports of the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſerved for a ſhelter and place of Retreat to the <hi>Chriſtian Pyrates,</hi> who continually cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſels; and to have ſatisfaction for all this, there needed only a Deſign to be undertaken, whoſe Succeſs, tho' ſufficiently honourable, was neither perilous, nor impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: What Conſternation, added he, will it be to all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> to ſee the <hi>Venetians</hi> driven out of this Iſle, when they are moſt confident on their Strength, having fortified the Capital City in the midſt of the Country; which, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its deep Ditches, and new Ramparts, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long hold out againſt an Army, which has

been ever ſucceſsful? That the Conjuncture was favourable, by reaſon of the <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> Diviſions, being almoſt all of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with Domeſtick Wars, diſunited by Differences in Religion, and conſequently not in a capacity to aſſiſt the <hi>Venetians:</hi> That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was buſied in reducing the <hi>Moors,</hi> and pacifying the Troubles in the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:</hi> That, beſides the League made between his Highneſs and the King of <hi>France,</hi> this Prince was too young, and his Kingdom too much weakened by inteſtine Wars, to intereſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this Quarrel.

As to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by his Father's Example, and made wiſe at his Neighbour's Coſt, he muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his own Intereſt too well, to break the Peace he made with the <hi>Ottoman Port;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> forſaken on all ſides, muſt inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably loſe the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> before the News of it can come to the <hi>Senate.</hi> Should Fortune moreover (adds he) favour this Enterprize, a man might ſet on foot ſtill greater Deſigns againſt this <hi>Republick,</hi> to the Ruine of the Naval Forces of all <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and by this means open a way to invade all <hi>Italy:</hi> a thing not unthought of by your Predeceſſors: That the Idleneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

the <hi>Venetians</hi> had languiſhed this thirty years laſt paſt, by means of the Peace <hi>Solyman</hi> had granted them, rendered the Conqueſt of their whole State very eaſie; having forgotten the Art of making War, there being but few left of the ancient Officers and Souldiers; ſo that ſeeing themſelves in a manner loſt, they muſt ſubmit to ſuch Conditions as would pleaſe his Highneſs to impoſe, and yield their Necks to the Yoke, rather than undergo all the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of War. So that in fine, his Army enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laden with Spoil, would return in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> followed by a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous number of Slaves and Captives, making Vows and Wiſhes for the continuance of his proſperous Reign; which would preſage him a continual Series of Victories and Conqueſts, and an immortal Glory, by the Defeat of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the moſt averſe People to the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Law</hi>

                  <p>In the Year 1569. <hi>Italy</hi> was affiicted with ſuch ſcarcity, as made all the Cities thereabouts feel the ſmart of it, and expect a terrible Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Pouille,</hi> which are, as it were, the Store-houſes of <hi>Italy,</hi> were as empty of Corn as other Places. Yet the <hi>Triumvirs</hi> thought on an Expedient, which much helped the City: They iſſued out an Order, by which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96181:37"/>
they promiſed a great Price to ſuch Merchants as ſhould bring Grain; which brought ſo many Veſſels laden with it to <hi>Venice,</hi> that the People ſcarcely felt the Scarcity, with which other parts were afflicted. But that which was worſe than this, and haſtened the War which the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> projected againſt the <hi>Republick,</hi> was, That on the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> at Night, in the ſame Year, the Powder took Fire in the Arſenal of <hi>Venice,</hi> and blew up the Magazines, with ſuch a dreadful Blow, that all the Inhabitants, diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Noiſe, came out into the Streets, and publick places, leſt they ſhould be overwhelmed in the Ruine of their Houſes. The Sky ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a light Fire, which cauſed ſuch a terrible Conſternation, that ſeveral imagined <hi>Venice</hi> was threatned on all Parts; and ſuch as were moſt fearful, reckon'd the Day of Judgment was now come. The violence of this Fire, made it ſelf felt to the moſt ſolid Edifices of the City; and the very Boats in the Channels were lifted up in the Air by it. But that which ſurpaſſes all Belief, was, that the neighbouring Iſles were ſhaken by it; and it was known afterwards that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Treviſa</hi> and <hi>Padoa,</hi> and thoſe of ſome Towns at greater diſtance, ſaw at that time, their Windows, as it were, all on Fire, and heard ſuch a noiſe under ground, as made 'em fear a terrible Earthquake. The Houſes near the Arſenal, buried ſeveral Perſons of both Sexes under their Ruine.</p>
                  <p>This terrible Diſturbance being ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and the publick Conſternation leſſened, they began to ſuſpect ſome ſecret Conſpiracy.

The Senate put the Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> in Arms; whoſe Rendezvouz was in the Place of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> whence were ſent to all the Quarters of the Town ſuch as were able to do Service.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Suſpicions were encreaſed, aſſoon as it was known the Arſenal was burnt; this being the Part by which the <hi>Republick</hi> might receive its Death's Wound. <hi>Paul Troni</hi> was ſent by Order from the Senate to the Arſenal, to be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inform'd. He found all the Gates of it open; but not one of thoſe which followed him, had the boldneſs to enter: And had not <hi>Trony</hi> himſelf ſhewed them an Example in his own perſon, they would have all abandon'd him. Some Nobles aſſiſted him in an exact view of all places; of which he made his Relation to the <hi>Senate;</hi> and aſſured them he ſaw no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Fire, nor the leaſt appearance of a new Flame. He found the Walls and Towers on the ſide of the Iſle of <hi>Muran,</hi> overthrown from top to bottom, without the Magazines, or Sea-Equipages being any ways damnifi'd. The Convent of the <hi>Religious,</hi> called <hi>Celeſtins,</hi> and all the Houſes round about, underwent the ſame Misfortune as the Towers and Ramparts. The Nobility, which were up in Arms, guarded the Town ſeveral days and nights, and equipp'd two Gallies for their Security without. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it appear'd in the Sequel, this Diſaſter could not be a meer Accident, the Fire having taken ſeveral Magazines at the ſame time, 'tho far diſtant from one another: There were great Rewards promis'd to thoſe who could diſcover the Authors; and a Diſcourſe ran, that the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous

                  <p>This ſad Misfortune was quickly bruited over all <hi>Europe,</hi> and Report made, as is uſual, That the Loſs was greater than it was.

                  <p>This ſeemed rather a Declaration of War to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador, than a telling him they intended ſuch a thing; and he ſeeing no likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of averting the Tempeſt which had ſo ſuddenly gathered, he ſought, only to gain time, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> might make ſome Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: And to this end, he uſed great Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to oblige him to ſhew the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> That the <hi>Republick</hi> had ever faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept the Treaties of Peace, never failing in the leaſt reſpect to his Highneſs: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring him alſo, the Almighty had ever puniſh'd thoſe who violated the publick Faith, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oaths.

of the dreadful Multitude of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> with which the Iſland was to be over-run; but who might have valiantly defended it, had they met with a happy Paſſage. <hi>Martiningo</hi> had four Ships appointed him, to conduct theſe Succours to <hi>Famaguſta.</hi>

                     <hi>Savoriani</hi> adviſed the <hi>Senate</hi> to ſend over at leaſt Eight Thouſand Men into the Iſland, which could not be kept with a leſs Force: But <hi>Martiningo,</hi> being jealous leſt <hi>Savoriani</hi> envied his Reputation, and deſirous to ſhew his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and Bravery, would needs undertake to defend <hi>Famaguſta</hi> with Three Thouſand; and the <hi>Senate</hi> approving his Zeal and Forwardneſs, imprudently conſented to ſo hardy a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. Thoſe who are Chief Officers in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, do many times manage the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſury with the ſame Thrift and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringneſs they uſe in their own Domeſtick Affairs; and think they thus mightily oblige the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.</hi> But the <hi>Venetians</hi> perceived too late their Folly in ſending Three Thouſand Men, againſt an innumerable Army.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Senate</hi>'s Deliberations, about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this War, ſome were for ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Garriſons every where, and keeping only on the Defenſive ſide. Others were for ſetting out as great a Naval Army as was poſſible, and fight the <hi>Infidels</hi> on the firſt occaſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by decide at one ſtroke the Fate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> This laſt Advice was approved as the moſt profitable and honourable: The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> hoped the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a great Fleet, would come to their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96181:43"/>
and likewiſe expected, that Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. whoſe Zeal and Courage were well known to them, would aſſiſt them in ſo urgent an occaſion. <hi>Jerom Zani</hi> was made General of the Sea-Forces. This Employ is of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe which have no Authority but out of <hi>Venice;</hi> but the Power of it is then of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Extent, and there is no Appeal allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Sentence of this Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. The <hi>Senate</hi> made choice of ſeveral vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and reſolute Gentlemen from amongſt the Nobility, to make Commanders of their Frigats and Galleys; and Sea-men and Slaves were ſent for from the other Cities of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> to <hi>Venice.</hi> They proceeded on the ſetting forth fourſcore and ten Galleys; whoſe Furniture and Equipage could be ſupplied from the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenal.</hi> They built twenty two at <hi>Candia,</hi> which were joyned with thirty ſix others that were arm'd againſt <hi>Corſary's,</hi> and to keep the Sea open along the ſides of this Iſland. They likewiſe equipp'd twelve Veſſels called <hi>Galeaſſes,</hi> by reaſon of their prodigious Greatneſs. Theſe are moved both with Sails and Oars, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the Sea like ſo many floating Caſtles. The weight of theſe Bulky Veſſels braves the violence of the Waves, and fears no Storm nor Tempeſt. They moreover equipp'd twenty Veſſels laden with Men and Ammunition; not to mention the Galliots, and ſeveral other leſſer Boats; the Conduct of which, they gave to <hi>Hermolaus Tripoli,</hi> a careful and active Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. Such a conſiderable Fleet ſo ſoon made ready, notwithſtanding the diſadvantages
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96181:43"/>
the <hi>Senate</hi> then lay under, ſurpriz'd with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment the neighbouring Nations. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Pope</hi> permitted great Tranſportations of Corn from <hi>Anconia</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> and a great Subſidy to be rais'd from the Clergy.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Senate read <hi>Bonrici</hi>'s Letters, by which they were informed of the coming of the <hi>Chiaus,</hi> the occaſion of his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and all that paſt between <hi>Barbaro</hi> and the <hi>Chief Viſier. Bonrici</hi> having learnt at his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that Acts of Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were already began on the Frontiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came afraid leſt <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Son, (who was <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and had ſtopt thoſe whom the Governour of <hi>Cataro</hi> had ſent to carry Preſents on his part) ſhould oblige the Envoy to return back the ſame way he came. In this Apprehenſion he propos'd the diſpatching of one of his People to <hi>Raguſa,</hi> charged with Packets of Advice to <hi>Venice,</hi> to the end they might have a Galley ſent them for their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and ſurer Paſſage. The Envoy approving this Expedient, <hi>Bonrici</hi> wrote his Sence in Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, leſt his Packets ſhould be intercepted. The <hi>Senate</hi> well ſatisfied of the Care and Diligence of <hi>Bonrici,</hi> ordered <hi>Francis Troni</hi> to attend them with a Galley at <hi>Raguſa.</hi> They arrived after ſome days, and returned ſafe; but <hi>Troni</hi> was forbid to enter <hi>Venice:</hi> which oblig'd him to lie at Anchor at the Ports Mouth, till further Order. In the mean while <hi>Bonrici</hi> Landed, and having confirmed by word of Mouth, what was contained in his Letters, he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the next day to fetch the <hi>Chiaus</hi> in a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96181:44"/>
                     <hi>Gondollo,</hi> and bring him to the <hi>Senate.</hi> He was brought up the Channel, and Landed at St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s; which Place was ſo crouded, that it was no ſmall difficulty to make way for him. The murmurings of the People, who gnaſht their Teeth with rage and indignation againſt the breaking of the Peace, ſtruck the <hi>Chiaus</hi> with ſuch Terror, that he took <hi>Bonrici</hi> by the hand, the better to ſecure his Life; for he ſaw himſelf in no ſmall danger.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as he entred the Senate-Houſe, after a ſhort Preamble, he preſented <hi>Selim</hi>'s Letter, and that alſo of the <hi>Prime Viſier.</hi> The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> complained in his, That, the <hi>Uſcots,</hi> who were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and Allies of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> continually moleſted his Subjects; and, that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> inſtead of hindring theſe Violences, encouraged the Robbers underhand to commit them: That, animated with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hatred againſt the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pyrates, they gave no Quarter to thoſe that fell into their hands; cutting their Throats at the time they cried for Mercy, and yielded without Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But that which was moſt inſupportable to his Highneſs, was, the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a ſhelter for Pyrates, which diſturb'd the Commerce of the <hi>Mediterranean Seas:</hi> That, being Maſter of all the Countreys, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded this Iſle, it lay on him to ſecure the Navigation to thoſe Parts; and therefore if they deſigned the continuance of the Peace which they had ſo often broken, they muſt yield him this Iſland, chaſtiſe the <hi>Uſcots,</hi> and treat his Subjects henceforward with more
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96181:44"/>
humanity: That, if they liked theſe Terms, they ſhould receive kind Remarks of his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Favour; but if on the contrary, they refuſed theſe reaſonable Conditions, he was in a capacity to do himſelf ſpeedy Juſtice, and make them repent of their Folly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prime Viſier</hi>'s Letter contain'd only Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters treated of between him and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador; exhorting the <hi>Senate</hi> to grant free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> deſired. They had already reſolved what to anſwer the Envoy; and the <hi>Doge</hi> was of opinion to give it him in Writing. The <hi>Venetians</hi> affirmed in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That, notwithſtanding the ill uſage which the Subjects of the <hi>Republick</hi> had received, that Peace had been ever of their part moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved: That, the <hi>Uſcots</hi> were a poor ſort of People, who living on Robbery, fell indifferently on both <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> That, it was allowable by right of War, to give no Quarter to Pyrates; and, as to the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> it belonged to the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:</hi> That, the <hi>Corſary's</hi> were ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entertained in their Ports, that there were four Galleys conſtantly kept to hinder their Entrance: But if the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> made uſe of theſe Pretences to colour the breaking of the Peace, the <hi>Senate</hi> was reſolv'd couragiouſly to defend themſelves; hoping the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice would revenge their Quarrel, and protect their Innocency. The <hi>Chiaus</hi> being diſmiſt, was carried in a <hi>Gondolo</hi> to the Galley in which he came, which tarried for him at the Haven's Mouth; which immediately hoyſted
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96181:45"/>
Sayl on his coming on Board, and tranſported him to the Frontiers of the State; having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no Civilities or Preſents from the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.</hi> But <hi>Mark Anthony Barbaro</hi>'s Lady ſent him, by the permiſſion of the <hi>Senate,</hi> ſome Refreſhments and a Silk Veſt, to the end her Husband might be the leſs rudely uſed at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> where the <hi>Chiaus</hi> returned without any likelihood of an Accommodation.</p>
                  <p>The Declaration of War made the Nobility and Commonaly paſs over from their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation to Choler and Boldneſs; and the young People, irritated at the perfidiouſneſs of <hi>Selim,</hi> conceived a great Contempt at his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs and want of Sence of Honour, againſt whoſe Forces they hoped to maintain their Right; provided Heaven declared it ſelf not againſt them; whereas the ancienter ſort, more experienc'd, foreſaw the Danger of breaking off at any time with ſo formidable a Power: But fearing on the other hand, that in granting his Demands, this would be an encouragement to them to ask more, and that the State weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by degrees with theſe Compliances, would at length grow contemptible to her Allies, as well as to her Enemies. On theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they reſolv'd themſelves into a War, without hearkning to any Propoſal of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Peace. Politicians found this Reſolution more generous than prudent; for by amuſing the Enemy with ſome ſort of Negotiation, a ſtop might be put to their Army; its heat might be abated; and Time gained to provide for the Defence of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> Moreover, perhaps
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96181:45"/>
the Storm might have been laid with Money, which oftner prevails than Arms on theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> whoſe Avarice enclines them to hearken to any ſuch kind of Propoſal. But the Ardor of both the Nobility and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, who ſtrove to give Teſtimonies of their Fidelity, hindered them from making theſe Reflexions. All the neighbouring Cities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Republick,</hi> ſhewed the ſame Earneſtneſs; ſending Offers to the <hi>Senate,</hi> each according to their Ability. People came from all parts to <hi>Venice;</hi> ſome proffered their Eſtates, others their Perſons; and the greateſt part to ſerve in the Wars at their own Charge. So many offered to embark themſelves, that the <hi>Senate</hi> fearing to expoſe at one time ſuch Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Illuſtrious Perſons, ſent ſeveral of them home, having firſt praiſed their Zeal and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. All the other Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> gave Marks of the ſame inclination, to defend the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;</hi> and the time being appointed, when the Fleet ſhould ſet forth for the Iſle of <hi>Corfou,</hi> the General <hi>Zani</hi> weighed Anchor, and ſayled to <hi>Zara,</hi> to order the Affairs of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> whilſt all the Forces got themſelves in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                     <hi>Lauredon,</hi> Doge of <hi>Venice,</hi> Aged fourſcore and ten, died ſuddenly in coming from the <hi>Senate,</hi> in the midſt of the Gonſultations for the War; and it being feared, leſt the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Intereſts of Parties, ſhould draw out in length the Choice of a new <hi>Doge,</hi> and thoſe who had right of Election, being far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſhould abandon their Poſts in ſo perilous
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96181:46"/>
a Conjuncture, the <hi>Senate</hi> ordained that the number of Electors ſhould be reduced to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 'Twas neceſſary, for the ſatisfaction of the People, and the exigency of the preſent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to chooſe a Perſon of extraordinary Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Prudence; not following the ancient Cuſtom of peaceable times, which was to elect one of a common Capacity, and of a Humor rather to be governed than govern. Amongft all thoſe who ſtood conſpicuous, none appear'd more fit and worthy than <hi>Lewis Mocenigo,</hi> both by his Nobility, his Alliances, and great Place, being a Procurator of St. <hi>Mark.</hi> He had acquired an high Eſteem, by a faithful diſcharge of ſeveral Employs; and the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the ancient Diſcipline was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a Perſon of his Wiſdom and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. The Forty Electors ſhut up in the Palace to make this Choice, were not long in their Deliberations. In ſhort, <hi>Mocenigo</hi> had all their Suffrages, and took poſſeſſion of his new Dignity. The ſame day he was elected, he made a thankful Speech, which confirmed the advantageous Opinion of his Capacity; he proteſted that he would endeavour to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by his Services the Honour conferred on him.</p>

                     <hi>Sebaſtian Venieri,</hi> who, tho' very ancient, felt none of the Infirmities of old Age, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Iſle of <hi>Corfou,</hi> with a Sovereign Authority. He being weary of Eaſe, heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with pleaſure to a Propoſition which was privately made him by Deputies from the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirots,</hi> who inhabit near Mount <hi>Chimera.</hi> Theſe

Fifteen hundred Foot, with ſome Horſe, were immediately tranſported to the firm Land. The Place, altho' ſituated on a Mountain in the midſt of ſeveral others, and better forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd by Nature than Art, was eaſily inveſted. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Batteries, whence the Cannon plaid, did no great Execution: <hi>Marmario,</hi> who had the ordering of it, deſiring to take from the Beſieged all hope of Relief, poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of thoſe high Grounds which commanded the Place, and ſuch parts by means of which they might have Communication with the Country: He pick'd out for this Deſign the moſt reſolute mongſt the <hi>Epirots,</hi> who made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of this Poſt, after a fierce Combat, in which the Beſieged were repulſed to their Gates. The <hi>Turks</hi> fired ſeveral times their Cannon from their Walls; but having not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96181:47"/>
any expert Gunners amongſt them, they burſt two of their greateſt Pieces, by over charging them, which ſet fire on all their Powder. This Accident, together with the Belief that the Army of the Beſieged was greater than indeed it was, and that all <hi>Epirus</hi> had revolted, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them not from defending themſelves, out of a deſperate Obſtinacy. <hi>Venieri</hi> intending to profit by this Error, diſpos'd all things for a general Aſſault the next Morning. The <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> having notice of this Attack, ſtole away privately out of the Town in the Night, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a few, who preferring a glorious Death to a ſhameful Flight, were put to the Sword, in ſuſtaining the Fury of the Aſſailants. The Fugitives were purſued, and made Priſoners by the <hi>Epirots,</hi> who knew the ways of the Country. <hi>Venieri</hi> having left a Garriſon in the Place, the Government of which, committing to <hi>Marmorio,</hi> he returned himſelf to <hi>Corfou,</hi> proud of his good Succeſs. <hi>Zani</hi> arrived there in the beginning of the Summer, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving tarried long at <hi>Zara,</hi> in expectation of the Arrival of the Fleet; to which were to be joyn'd the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s and the <hi>Pope</hi>'s. He judged it not fitting to ſet out to Sea without a conſiderable Aſſiſtance; having Order from the <hi>Senate</hi> to ſayl to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and fight the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, aſſoon as the Confederates ſhould joyn him. 'Twas generally believed, that had he parted immediately after <hi>Colonni</hi> was arrived with the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Galleys, without ſtaying for the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s, and made directly for <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus;</hi> the Place might have been preſerved.

                     <hi>Quirini</hi> joyn'd him at the ſame time with twenty five Galleys of <hi>Candia,</hi> and took in his paſſage a Caſtle in the <hi>Morea,</hi> defended by the <hi>Infidels,</hi> whence he drew out twenty Pieces of Cannon. <hi>Zani,</hi> not willing to loſe time at <hi>Corfou,</hi> ſent <hi>Sforza Palavicinus,</hi> General of the Land-Army, with forty Gallies, to beſiege <hi>Margariti,</hi> a City of <hi>Epirus;</hi> which was kept by a ſtrong Garriſon, by reaſon of the Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Commodiouſneſs of the Place. <hi>Sforza</hi> Landed five thouſand Men; but drawing near the Town, whether he feared the Enemies Horſe might fall too fiercely on him, or find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enterprize, on a ſecond view, too dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, he put his Men on Board again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daring to ſtay for the <hi>Turks;</hi> aliedging, for his Excuſe, That he did not believe the Place to be ſo far diſtant from the Sea: He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſent to <hi>Zani</hi> for new Orders; who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him to call a <hi>Council of War;</hi> in which, it was determined, to abide by this Siege, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not for the Honour of the <hi>Republick</hi> to draw back. He deſired the Officers of the Fleet to provide him with Cannon for Battery; which they willingly undertook, tho' their Carriage was extream difficult: But <hi>Palavacinus</hi>'s Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage again failing him, ſhewed them, that this Expedition would prove more dangerous than profitable; and thereupon embark'd himſelf and his Men: Altho' this General, to regain his Honour, earneſtly deſired Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

all the while the Fleet remained at <hi>Corfou.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, this great Army, having ſpent moſt of the Summer in the Ports, by the neglect of the Commanders, the Sea-men living in Gormandizing and Idleneſs, fell into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Diſtemper, with which alſo the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were as greatly afflicted. This Sickneſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, carried away great Numbers; ſo that <hi>Zani,</hi> ſuppoſing Exerciſe and change of Ayr, would in ſome ſort cure them, ſet Sayl for <hi>Candia:</hi> But whether their Proviſions were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready corrupted, or theſe new rais'd Men, not accuſtomed to the Seas; the Sickneſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to that height, that in two days time, it cleared a whole Ship; and thoſe that were put in their places, incurr'd the ſame Fate. Both Souldiers and Sea-men falling one upon another, and ſuffering inſupportable Dolors, breathed out the laſt moment of their Lives. They were thrown into the Sea, aſſoon as they expired, and ſometimes before. Thoſe that performed this ſad Office, expected ſoon to receive the ſame themſelves, from other hands; and the horror of Death might be plainly read on each man's Face. The exceſſive Heats, and Malignity of the Air, encreaſed ſtill the Mortality; and when arrived at <hi>Candia,</hi> there were found miſſing twenty thouſand Men. The General much perplexed, how to repair this Loſs, forced the <hi>Candiots</hi> to find him Sea-men and Souldiers; and tho' ſeveral were drawn out from the Iſles of <hi>Zant</hi> and <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> and the Providors <hi>Quirini</hi> and <hi>Canali</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

                     <hi>Pius</hi> V. who underſtood not ſo well the Art of War, as the Government of the Church, ſuffered himſelf to be led into an eſteem of <hi>Colonni,</hi> by means of ſome Conferences with him on the preſent State of Affairs, and by his offers of Service, which made him to be preferred before ſeveral Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who ſought all occaſions to obtain this Employ: He made himſelf ſo worthy of it, and ſhewed ſo much Prudence and Valour in the emergencies of War or Peace, that his Credit with the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtill encreaſed, notwithſtanding the Envy and Jealouſie of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually endeavoured to do him ill Offices. The <hi>Venetians</hi> would not at firſt acknowledge him Chief of the Army of the Holy See, ſuppoſing him too much devoted to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Intereſt; becauſe he poſſeſſed ſome Towns dependant on that Crown: But he knew ſo well to diſabuſe them, by a ſincere Application to their Service, that they would have willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truſted him with the full Command of their whole Army. The <hi>Pope</hi> ſent at the ſame time

to the King of <hi>Spain, Lewis Torici,</hi> Auditor of the <hi>Reta,</hi> to entreat him to joyn his Fleet with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and contract an Alliance with them, according to the Deſign which he had often propoſed; his Holineſs aſſuring him he would not only intereſs himſelf in this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, but enter therein, and aſſiſt the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> to the utmoſt of his Power. <hi>Pius</hi> V. made the ſame Declaration to <hi>Michael Soriani,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> returned no Anſwer to the Propoſition of Alliance, but promis'd to ſet out fifty Galleys immediately to <hi>Sicily,</hi> with Order to obey him whom the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould chooſe to command them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Colonni</hi> expected long the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet; and <hi>John Andrew Doria,</hi> who conducted it, did not arrive at <hi>Meſſina</hi> till <hi>July;</hi> neither would he weigh Anchor, ſaid he, till he received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and uſed all his Endeavors to retain the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Galleys. <hi>Colonni</hi> ſent ſpeedy notice of this to his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> who immediately diſpatch'd a Courier into <hi>Spain,</hi> to preſs the King to make good his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: But the Anſwer arriving at <hi>Rome</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Twelfth of <hi>Auguſt, Colonni</hi> and <hi>Doria</hi> did not depart till the Twenty fifth for <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> where they ſet footing after Twelve dayes Navigation; altho' <hi>Zani</hi> had Order, as we have already ſaid, to attempt the Delivery of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and fight the <hi>Infidels,</hi> if they offered to hinder them from it. The Seaſon being far ſpent, and the Fleet in no good order, made him dread the Event of a Battel: He called a Council of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96181:51"/>
War, on what was moſt expedient to be underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; <hi>Antony Canali</hi> &amp; <hi>James Celſi</hi> were Providors to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army; the <hi>Republick</hi> never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding the Sovereign Command to one only General. Theſe Officers are indeed inferior to him, yet he can determine nothing, unleſs one of theſe two be of his Opinion. <hi>Sforza Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicinus</hi> was admitted into this private Council; an Honour which no Stranger ever had before. But becauſe it was poſſible they might divide in contrary Opinions of equal Authority, they reſolved to ſubmit to that which was the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's; and this Regulation was conſtantly and ſtrictly obſerved afterwards. <hi>Celſi</hi> and <hi>Palavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> were not for going directly to <hi>Cyprus;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, That the Tempeſts which are frequent in Autumn, were to be conſidered: That the greateſt part of the Sea-men were not well acquainted with thoſe Seas; and moreover, their Companies were not compleat; ſo that ſhould the <hi>Turks</hi> accept of an Engagement, and be worſted, yet could they get ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits at Land, as would put their Fleet again in a good Condition; and ſhould they refuſe a Defiance, they had Places of Retreat in <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and ſeveral other Ports, where the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> dar'd not attack them, but would be forc'd to retreat themſelves, leſt they ruine their whole Fleet; ſo that it would be better to ſend Men and Ammunition to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> for the Defence and Refreſhment of the Iſle, than to hazard at once the Safety of the State, which conſiſted alone in the Maritine Forces: That to ſave the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſo great a Navy, they might attack
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96181:51"/>
the Caſtles of the <hi>Dardanello's,</hi> lying at the Mouth of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> or fall on the Iſle of <hi>Nigropont,</hi> and take by Aſſault <hi>Chalcis,</hi> its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Town: That, this Conqueſt, which was certain, would make amends for the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> in caſe the <hi>Infidels</hi> ſhould be obſtinate in its Invaſion; and ſhould they come to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Nigropont,</hi> thy would by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion eaſe the <hi>Cypriots,</hi> and give the Enemy Battel with greater confidence of Victory, the two Armies being of equal ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zani</hi> leaned to this Opinion, but he ſuffered the Providor <hi>Canali</hi> to ſpeak before him; who ſaid, that beſides the <hi>Senate</hi> ordered immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Succors to be given the <hi>Cypriots;</hi> whoſe Caſe otherwiſe would prove deſperate, it was far more reaſonable and natural, to endeavour the Conſervation of ones own, than to become Maſter of that which is another's: That the Succors which were to be put into <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> would ſignifie nothing to <hi>Nicoſia;</hi> on the taking of which, depended the loſs of the whole Iſland: That, if it were already too late to endeavor its Deliverance, the Seaſon would much leſs permit them to beſiege Caſtles further diſtant, and ſo near to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> might behold them from the Windows of the <hi>Seralio;</hi> nor to think of the taking of <hi>Nigropont,</hi> for which, they muſt Land Men and Cannon, to batter <hi>Chalcis,</hi> the Capital Town; againſt which 'twas almoſt impoſſible to raiſe Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: That the North-Eaſt Wind, which then blowed, would carry them in four dayes to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and might return with a Southern Wind,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96181:52"/>
which riſes commonly at the beginning of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn:</hi> That the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus</hi> was the real cauſe of the War; the Title of Conqueror being due only to that Party which ſhould become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of it: That it was very ſtrange, the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s and the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Fleets, which had been expected all the Summer, ſhould ſet out only to deliberate, whether they were to ſuccor a Country, for the ſecuring of which, theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ordered to fight: That if the <hi>Infidels</hi> kept themſelves in their Ports for fear of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging; beſides, that they ſhould be then in a capacity to relieve <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> there might be good advantage made of this Diſtruſt; and the Confederate Army would gain greater Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: That if they, on the contrary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Defiance, they might in the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Event, hope well from the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of their Cauſe, and promiſe ſomething from the Protection of Heaven; and altho' they had not ſo many Ships as the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> theirs were on the other hand far better; their Fleet conſiſting of an hundred and fourſcore Galleys, and twelve Galeaſſes, which amounted to a good Naval Army; beſides other Veſſels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd only to carry Ammunition and Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereof, in caſe of neceſſity, a good uſe might be made: That it was true, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Navy was greater, as conſiſting of ſixty Galleys, and about fifty Frigats, beſides ſeveral ſmall Veſſels, whoſe multitude was troubleſome, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than diſadvantageous in a Fight: That, in ſhort, it were better to expoſe themſelves to a Defeat, than the ſhameful Reproaches of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96181:52"/>
left People, who threw themſelves on the <hi>Republick</hi> for Protection: That they would draw on them the hatred of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> ſhould the <hi>Infidels</hi> take from them a Kingdom before the Eyes of ſo powerful a Fleet; and if Fortune were not favourable to them, the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> would have at leaſt this conſolation, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving uſed its utmoſt Endeavors, according to its generous Maxims, rather to riſque its whole Eſtate, than to leave her Subjects to the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an Uſurper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zani</hi> was ſhaken by this Diſcourſe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to bear alone the Reproaches he muſt have undergone from the <hi>Senate,</hi> if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted not its Orders; he entred into <hi>Canali</hi>'s Sentiment, and concluded it neceſſary to be followed: But there hapned a freſh Conteſt, which occaſioned another Perplexity more troubleſome than the former. <hi>Zani</hi> and <hi>Doria</hi> being gone in ſearch of <hi>Mark Antony Colonni,</hi> to regulate with him the firſt Difficulty, he was of opinion to go immediately to the Succor of the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus: Pompey Colonni,</hi> his Kinſman, and <hi>Alvarez Baſano,</hi> General of the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Galleys, were alſo of this Mind: But <hi>Doria</hi> upholding on the contrary <hi>Celſi</hi> and <hi>Palavici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s ſence, obſtinately affirm'd, The <hi>Venetian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was no to be expoſed, in their languiſhing condition from the contagious Diſtemper, to the danger of a Fleet ſo well equipp'd; and reproach'd <hi>Colonni</hi> with ſacrificing the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army to the proud and ambitious humor of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Whereunto he replied, That it would be far more p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Spain</hi> to loſe all his Ships in an Engagement, than fail in what all <hi>Europe</hi> expected from ſo puiſſant a Sovereign: That there was no need of bringing an Army ſo far, and which has been ſo long time look'd for, if they came on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to behold a Kingdom taken by the <hi>Infidels,</hi> who would become far more formidable by caſting a Terror into the Confederates Army, than in conquering the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> That it was but reaſonable to yield to the Opinion of thoſe Perſons who were moſt concerned, and who would be an Example to the reſt, and firſt engage in this generous Expedition. <hi>Colonni</hi> added, The <hi>Pope</hi> ordered him expreſly to ſayl up to the Enemy, and terminate this War by the deciſion of a Combat; ſo that he could not avoid the following thoſe Orders; the inexecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, would be prejudicious to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and that of all <hi>Europe. Doria,</hi> fearing to be thought cowardly, or ill-intentioned, yielded at laſt; but ſold his Compliance dear, in finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Campaign ſooner by half than need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; for uſing all Delays till the Thirteenth of <hi>September</hi> in Deliberations, he publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, his Return ſhould be on the Firſt of <hi>October,</hi> with all his Fleet, whereſoever it lay; being willing the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould be informed of this, to the end they might not pretend a Surprize. The other Generals were agreed, That in caſe of an Engagement, all the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Veſſels ſhould be mixt without any Formalities of Precedency; to the end the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Danger being equally divided, each might do his Duty, and be animated by Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

The <hi>Venetians</hi> not following him, he gave out, there needed no further proof to diſcover their ill Order and Weakneſs.

                  <p>THE firſt Rumors of this War, being ſpread over <hi>Cyprus,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced different Effects in the Minds of its Inhabitants, every one being pleaſed or diſpleaſed according as they were intereſſed. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People expected Eaſe from their Labours, in ſome new Revolution; their Maſters, who uſed them with too great ſeverity, having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to ſuch a Deſperation, that they had thoughts, more than once, of delivering their Countrey to the <hi>Infidels:</hi> And for want of a better Commander, they choſe a certain School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, whom they intended to proclaim King,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96181:57"/>
under the Protection of the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi> But the <hi>Venetians</hi> having Notice of the Deſign, before the Rebels treated with the <hi>Port,</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this pretended Monarch, according to the greatneſs of his Crime. The Nobility were willing enough to take Arms for the Defence of their Country; but there being no Sovereign Magiſtrate in the Iſle, and the Officers aſpiring Jealouſies producing Emulations and Hatreds, things were but ill ordered for a Defence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Storm which was now fallen on them. In the beginning of the Year 1570. the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſent Notice to the <hi>Cypriots</hi> of the Declaration of War. <hi>Nicholas Dandoli</hi> was then Podeſtat of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> and had ſucceeded <hi>Lawrence Bembo,</hi> whoſe Death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very projudicial to the Affairs of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Dandoli,</hi> who being but a meer Lawyer, took on him the Government of his own head; was a man of great Inſolency, and wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of ſuch an Employ. <hi>Lawrence Tipoly</hi> and <hi>Mark Antony Bragandini</hi> were then at <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maguſta,</hi> the former in quality of Podeſtat; the other exerciſing the Magiſterial Function; and both well acquitting themſelves of their Duties <hi>Aſtor Baglioni</hi> commanded the Garriſon; who was a Leader of good Experience, full of Courage, and of no leſs Prudence, but had neither Men, nor Authority ſufficient to withſtand a great Force.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as this News was known at <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> there was held a Council, conſiſting of the principal Citizens, to adviſe and order what was neceſſary in this extraordinary State of Affairs.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96181:57"/>
'Twas firſt determined, to cauſe all the Corn and Grain of the Country round about, to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into the Town; which was accordingly with great diligence executed. <hi>Dandoli,</hi> whoſe firſt Care was, to finiſh the new Fortifications, had no Genius or Experience in theſe ſort of Affairs: And when it was decreed, that theſe Works ſhould be continued according to <hi>Savoriani</hi>'s Platform, and the Baſtions begun by his Order, carried on by the ſame Gentlemen to whom that Care was committed; <hi>Dandoli</hi> ſhewed, That the Money would be ill managed, and ſoon conſumed, if ſeveral Perſons had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of it; wherefore he was for keeping it himſelf, and finiſhing only one Baſtion at a time, and thus diſmiſt the greateſt part of the Workmen. He ordered other Affairs in the ſame manner; for according as the Report roſe or abated of the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Army, ſo he encreaſed or diminiſhed the Preparatives for the War: And when it was believed as a thing certain, That the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet would not ſet out from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> that Summer, all things were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on at ſuch a negligent rate, that <hi>Baglioni,</hi> and ſuch as underſtood thoſe Affairs, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally advertiz'd <hi>Dandoli</hi> to ſtand on his Guard, and expect a ſudden Invaſion from the Enemy. <hi>Eugenius Sinclitici,</hi> Count <hi>de Rocas,</hi> one of the beſt Families of the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> having been deputed to <hi>Venice,</hi> to entreat aſſiſtance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Iſland, with the Title of <hi>General of the Horſe,</hi> which the <hi>Senate</hi> had given him; with the News, That the War was certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; but he brought neither Men nor Ships.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96181:58"/>
All People were ſtrangely ſurpriz'd to ſee him thus return; conſidering the Condition of the Iſle, the Weakneſs of the Garriſon, Scarcity of Arms, and eſpecially of Muskets; ſo that it was thought, his new Honour had made ſome decay in his Sences; ſeeing he forgat to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent theſe wants to the State. The <hi>Cypriots</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves thus fruſtrated in their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, made bad Relations of his Voyage; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, his going to <hi>Venice,</hi> was only for an Airy Title of Honour, to ſatisfie his Vanity, rather than the Exigencies of the Iſland; ſo that he would have done as well to have ſtaid at home with his Lady; they having no need of a Captain, who brought nothing but a Name, and neglected the Duties of the Office.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>James Nores,</hi> Count <hi>de Tripoli,</hi> betwixt whom and <hi>Rocas</hi> reigned an hereditary Jealouſie, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying the Honour which <hi>Rocas</hi> came from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, entertain'd theſe Complaints and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs: and his Merit having acquired great Credit amongſt the Nobility, the Publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the greater Hatred and Contempt againſt his Enemie; which proved very hurtful to the Welfare of the Country. When the Council was aſſembled, <hi>Rocas</hi> and <hi>Dandoli</hi> were of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinions; ſo that no good could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to the preſent State of Affairs: And thus the Winter was paſt over in Quarrels and fruitleſs Debates.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the Spring, there aroſe a Diſpute between the Magiſtrates of <hi>Nicoſia</hi> and <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> touching the Tranſport of Grain, which was gathered in the fruitful Plains
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96181:58"/>
of <hi>Meſſara,</hi> equally diſtantfrom theſe two Towns. 'Twas thought fitting, for the adjuſting of this Difference, to agree on a Place and Time, wherein all the Magiſtrates and Military Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhould meet; in which Aſſembly, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the War, ſhould be treated on, and each Perſon his Function and Poſt allotted him, that he might be in a readineſs on the firſt Occaſion: Which Meeting was held at a Place called <hi>Aſchia;</hi> where all preſent exhorted one another to lay aſide their Differences, and joyntly concur to the common Safety. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards decreed, That the Corn of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Meſſara,</hi> ſhould be equally ſhared between <hi>Famaguſta</hi> and <hi>Nicoſia;</hi> each of them gathering that part which lay neareſt them. They moreover Ordered, when this was done, That the Countreys which were fartheſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and whoſe Crops would be troubleſom to be tranſported, ſhould be laid waſte, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Enemy from Forrage. But they after changed their Deſign into that of preſerving them for the refreſhment of the <hi>Chriſtian Army,</hi> which they expected would come to their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; contenting themſelves with pulling down all Mills, to deprive the Enemy of the Uſe of them; who yet profited by ſo abundant a Crop when they leaſt expected it; having already ſtored themſelves with Proviſions from <hi>Cilicia.</hi> After a long Deliberation of what Place <hi>Baglio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> ſhould undertake the Defence, 'twas reſolved, he ſhould ſhut himſelf up in <hi>Famaguſta;</hi> which according to all appearances, was to be firſt beſieged; and that in expectation of the Three
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96181:59"/>
Thouſand Men which <hi>Martiningo</hi> was to bring them from <hi>Venice,</hi> there ſhould be a like Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber choſen from among the <hi>Freed Men</hi> of the Iſland, to ſtrengthen the Garriſon: That there ſhould be as many put into <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> with ſome new Levies raiſed out of the Country; and the Citizens of both Places, were to take Arms, and be liſted into Companies; which ſhould be commanded by young Gentlemen. There was afterwards an Account taken f the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men each of theſe Cities could well contain; and thoſe who lived far in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, were Ordered to leave their Villages, and retire to theſe Places of Strength. The mixt Multitude, ſuch as Women, Children, and aged Perſons, were enjoyned to betake themſelves to the Woods and Mountains, with whatſoever they could carry; and ſeveral were ſent out to diſcover in what Parts they could be in moſt ſurety. <hi>John Suſomini,</hi> a prudent and careful Perſon, had the Charge of leading them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Goods and Chattels. <hi>Cerines,</hi> a Maritine Town, ſituated over againſt <hi>Cilicia,</hi> was ordered to be ruin'd; as not being in a condition to hold out a Siege; and its Artillery to be tranſported to <hi>Nicoſia:</hi> But ſome being of a contrary Opinion, 'twas thought expedient to communicate this Affair to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect its Orders. The greateſt Difficulty agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was, Whether 'twere moſt advantageous to oppoſe the Enemies Deſcent, or let them Land without Reſiſtance? <hi>Rocas</hi> and <hi>Dandoli,</hi> who endeavoured to raiſe their Reputation in Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Affairs, by ſingular Opinions, rejected ſuch
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96181:59"/>
as were neceſſary to be followed; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly maintained, by a fatal obſtinacy to their Countrey, That the <hi>Infidels</hi> ſhould be ſuffered to Land. <hi>Aſtor Baglioni</hi> endeavoured on the contrary, to make them embrace a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Reſolution: He vehemently ſet before them, That there is nothing more dangerous than Deſpair or Diſtruſt at the ſight of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; People ſeldom coming to themſelves in ſuch a kind of Conſternation: That he knew, after a particular Search, there were more Horſe in the Iſland than was conceiv'd; there being enough to mount eight Thouſand Men; the greateſt part of which, might be Armed with Lances, and the reſt with Carabins and Muskets; and in this Equipage might ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully oppoſe the <hi>Infidels</hi> Landing; and being ſeconded by choice Men of the reſt of the Militia, and five and twenty Thouſand Foot, drawn up on the Hills of <hi>Salines,</hi> on the Sea-Coaſt; the ſight of ſo conſiderable an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would perhaps put a ſtop to the Enemies Fleet, and defer their Landing: That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever might happen, they muſt of neceſſity oppoſe them, tho' they ſhould fail, and be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowered by their Number: That in fine, All the Rules of War oblig'd them to reſiſt their Entrance, unleſs they deſign'd to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves contemptible to their Enemies, and caſt the <hi>Cypriots</hi> into a Conſternation.</p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Gentry</hi> that aſſiſted at this Council, were of <hi>Baglioni</hi>'s Opinion, and promiſed him to uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to facilitate the execution of this Deſign: But <hi>Dandoli</hi> and <hi>Rocas</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:96181:60"/>
perſiſted in maintaining, there were only <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maguſta</hi> and <hi>Nicoſia</hi> to be defended; and that the Malignity of the Ayr, with the exceſſive Heats would drive away the <hi>Turks</hi> from the other Parts of the Iſland.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rocas</hi> added, that <hi>Palavicinus</hi> had been of the ſame Opinion in <hi>Venice;</hi> which was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Senate;</hi> and therefore he muſt yield without wavering, to the Sentiment of ſo great a Captain, being likewiſe confirm'd by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Council, without the leaſt reſpect to the Reaſons which might be alledged to the contrary. <hi>Baglioni</hi> interrupting him, To what purpoſe (ſaid he) is <hi>Palavicinus</hi> and the <hi>Senate</hi> cited? Are we not here on the Spot, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently far better inſtructed in the preſent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igency of Affairs, than all the <hi>Republick</hi> joyn'd together, who judge only from a ſimple Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It is Men, and not Counſel, which ought to have been ſent us from <hi>Venice.</hi> The Paſſion, with which he was tranſported, made him add, That if no body elſe would follow him, he would go to the Sea-ſide with his Friends and Domeſticks, to receive the <hi>Infidels</hi> at their Deſcent; for he would never conſent they ſhould Land, as if the Countrey was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to them by Agreement: That he would give them ſome Demonſtrations of Courage, at leaſt with his ſmall Company, if he could not hinder their Deſign; it being a grievous ſhame to be expoſed to the Raillery of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and hear them ſay, <hi>The</hi> Venetians <hi>were ſo affrighted at the News of their Coming, that they were not able to bear the ſight of them.</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:96181:60"/>
The two Chiefs hardening themſelves in their Obſtinacy, as faſt as they found Reſiſtance, <hi>Baglioni</hi> added, He would lead up as many Horſe as he could find in the humor to attend him to the place moſt in danger; at leaſt to learn the Force and Number of the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> being not able to bear the Reproaches which would be caſt on his Countrey. That they had not one Perſon of ſufficient Valour to face the Enemy. <hi>Dandoli</hi> made Anſwer, He might do as he pleaſed; but would never conſent to his having any Troops committed to him: Saying moreover, he would ſend Notice to the <hi>Senate</hi> of the Succeſs of ſo raſh an Enterprize. <hi>Baglioni,</hi> who knew the <hi>Senate</hi> confided more in the <hi>Providors,</hi> than in the <hi>Military Officers,</hi> and that they do more approve a diſcreet Conduct, than a bold and honourable Exploit, pretended to perſiſt in his Reſolution, but intended to do nothing contrary to the <hi>Providors</hi> determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſembly being broke up, each Perſon departed to his Poſt, to execute the Orders which belonged to him.</p>
                  <p>Things being in this condition, and all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bewailing this Diſunion amongſt the Chief Perſons in Authority, the Veſſels on which <hi>Martiningo</hi> was embark'd with the three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men which the <hi>Senate</hi> ſent to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> touched at <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> and brought the ſad News of the Death of their Commander; whoſe Age not being able to undergo the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of the Voyage, encreaſed by the ill Ayr, he died in the way, not ſuffering them to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96181:61"/>
carry him to ſhoar, in order to his Recovery. He was the more regretted, by reaſon his Death was accompanied with that of the greateſt part of his Men, ſeiz'd by the ſame Diſtemper; ſo that the Remainder arrived in ſuch a condition, as ſenſibly touched all who were intereſſed in the Welfare of the <hi>Republick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On a Belief that the <hi>Infidels</hi> would begin by the Siege of <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> the Defence thereof was committed to <hi>Baglioni;</hi> and <hi>Rocas</hi> return'd to <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> to command that Garriſon. And it being well known that neither <hi>Dandoli,</hi> nor <hi>He</hi> underſtood the Art of War, they had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two old Officers given 'em; <hi>Ranconi</hi> and <hi>Palacio,</hi> to aſſiſt them in their Councils, in caſe they had Docility enough to be inſtructed. Since the Conference at <hi>Aſchia,</hi> Affairs moved but ſlowly, and the carrying on of the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications was in a manner neglected. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers encouraged the Souldiers in their Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by telling them, The <hi>Turks</hi> would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take nothing till the next Campaign, ſo that they had time enough to provide for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Countrey. They were alſo ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent as to ſuffer the <hi>Freed Men</hi> newly liſted, to return home, and bring if they would, their Wives into the Garriſons.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely were they got to their Villages, but <hi>Nicoſia</hi> was alarm'd by the Diſcovery of Twenty five Sayl of <hi>Turks</hi> Men of War, lying at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor over againſt the Iſle of <hi>Baffo.</hi> This News ſtrangely ſurprized the Officers, and caſt the People into a horrible Conſternation. 'Twas thought immediatly the whole Fleet was not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96181:61"/>
far diſtant from this Squadron; and indeed they were in the right; for theſe were ſent before, commanded by <hi>Siroc,</hi> one of the General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, with Order to make Deſcent on the Iſland, and get information from the firſt that fell into his hands, of the State and Strength of the Countrey, the Deſigns and Motions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and to return quickly with an Account of what he had learnt. <hi>Siroc</hi> landed at a Place called <hi>Lara,</hi> with five hundred Foot, ſeized on ſome Peaſants, whoſe Villages he burnt and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged. This Booty having drawn him farther into the Iſland, he was charged by a Regiment of <hi>Epirot-Horſe,</hi> whoſe Quarters lay near <hi>Lara,</hi> and beaten back to his own Veſſels; leaving eleven of his Men dead on the place, and two of 'em were taken Priſoners, with one of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. <hi>Zandochio,</hi> who commanded this Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horſe, entred into <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> puft up with this ſmall advantage, and cauſed to be carried before him, on the top of Lances, the Heads of theſe Enemies that were killed. 'Twas known from theſe two Priſoners, That the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Army lay in the Port of <hi>Finicia;</hi> and that the <hi>Sultans</hi> never before ſet out ſuch a numerous Fleet, ſo well ſtored with Men, and all ſorts of Proviſion and Ammunition neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ſo prodigious an Army: That the <hi>Viſier,</hi> who commanded it, was ſtill employ'd in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking the Horſe, and would ſoon follow in Perſon. Thoſe who expected this inundation of <hi>Barbarians</hi> not before the next Summer, and conſequently believed the Danger at a great diſtance, were terribly alarm'd; ſeeing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96181:62"/>
ſo near. <hi>Dandoli</hi> and <hi>Rocas,</hi> who walk'd every day about the Town, full of Pride and Confidence, found themſelves immediatly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with ſuch a diſheartning Faintneſs and Terror, the Effects whereof could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from every vulgar Eye: They at laſt ſaw themſelves void of Counſel and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; their Fortifications unfiniſhed, their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon without Arms, and much weakned by the Leave they had given the <hi>Freed-Men.</hi> They miſtruſted the Fidelity of their Slaves, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of their Officers of War, and their Authority and Power over the Souldiers: They ſent immediatly Commands to the <hi>Freed-Men</hi> to return to <hi>Nicoſia:</hi> But moſt of theſe rude and brutiſh People refuſed to obey their Orders, and withdrew into the Foreſts and Mountains, believing themſelves in greater ſafety, and more at liberty there, than within the Walls; ſo that ſcarcely five hundred, of the ſeven thouſand who were Muſtered, returned: 'Twas alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to give Liberty to the Slaves; and this was, without doubt, an excellent means to make them forget the Tyranny of their Maſters, and engage them faithfully to ſerve the <hi>Republick,</hi> had not this Means been thought on too late: Yet was it proclaimed throughout all the Iſland, That the <hi>Senate</hi> granted a full and perfect Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in general to all thoſe who were born Slaves; exhorting them, for an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Grace, that ſuch amongſt them as were able to bear Arms, ſhould repair with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to <hi>Nic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſia</hi> and <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Defence of the Countrey. This Bait drew
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96181:62"/>
not many; and excepting ſome who lived in the neighbouring parts, and could not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly get away, they all withdrew into the Mountains with their Families, and whatſoever they could carry along with them.</p>
                  <p>This Proclamation was made about the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>June;</hi> and in the Firſt of <hi>July</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet appeared, making with full Sayl towards the Iſland. They caſt Anchor at <hi>Baffo,</hi> and rode there only one day, and then came up to <hi>Limiſſo,</hi> where they Landed ſome ſmall Forces, to be informed of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: They were charged by the <hi>Epir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t</hi> Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and conſtrained to return to their Veſſels with ſome Loſs. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> advanced the next Morning as far as <hi>Salines,</hi> entring into the Gulph which bears that Name; and tho' they expected to fight at their Deſcent, yet did they Land all their Forces without the leaſt reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. <hi>Baglioni</hi> ſtill endeavoured to vindicate the <hi>Cypriots</hi> from this Affro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, and required, to no purpoſe, ſome Horſe to contend with them on the Shoar.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Dandoli</hi> and <hi>Rocas</hi> kept with them all the <hi>Cavalry;</hi> and whether they feared they ſhould be beaten, or agreed together to diſguſt this brave Commander, they contented themſelves with being Spectators of their Landing. <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> took this for a good <hi>Omen</hi> of their baſe and fooliſh Conduct; and his Army promis'd to themſelves, as well as he, an aſſured Victory. This Navy conſiſted in near four hundred Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of all kinds. There were one hundred and ſixty Galleys, or Frigats, near fifty Galliots;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96181:63"/>
the reſt were laden with Victuals, Ammunition, and Souldiers. But this Number aggrandiz'd extreamly the Fleet, which extended it ſelf as far as the Eye could reach; and the <hi>Cypriots,</hi> affrighted at this terrible Aſpect, kept a ſad and ſolitary Silence at the noiſe of the Shouts of Joy uttered by the Souldiers and Sea-men. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> and <hi>Dandoli</hi> ſhut themſelves up in <hi>Nicoſia</hi> with their Horſe; and <hi>Baglioni</hi> retired to <hi>Fama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta;</hi> which was the firſt Place to be beſieged, according to the Report of the Fugitives and Priſoners. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army conſiſted of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty thouſand Men, without reckoning the Slaves, and ſuch as followed the Camp; which made in all, according to exact computation, above an hundred thouſand Men. There were near nine thouſand <hi>Janizaries</hi> in this Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in whoſe Valour the <hi>Turks</hi> put their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Confidence. They had two thouſand Horſe, and as many Mules, and other Beaſts of Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                  <p>All this Army was ſoon Landed; and <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> who was the Principal Author of the War, had the general Command of them. <hi>Hali</hi> and <hi>Piali</hi> were joyntly Commanders of the Fleet; but this latter with more Authority than his Companion, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who always appoint two Admirals; one of which has greater Power than the other. They Landed none of the Men belonging to them, for fear of being ſurprized by the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Fleet, which they expected muſt certainly come to the Succour of the Iſland.</p>

                     <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> having for ſome dayes refreſhed his Army, he during that timecauſed a general Muſter to be made of it, and informed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the ſtate and ſtrength of the <hi>Cypriots;</hi> preparing all things for the Siege of <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> according to what he had deſign'd before he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> But he receiv'd an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which obliged him to think of another Enterprize.

                  <p>The <hi>Viſier</hi> having ſent for his Interpreters, and diſmiſt thoſe about him, they ſhewed how <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> whoſe Fortifications and Strength they were exactly acquainted with, was not in a condition to hold out long; giving him a perfect Account of the Place, the Incapacity of the Commanders, for whom the Souldiers had a great Averſion and Contempt; of the ill State of the Garriſon, and ſmall Proviſion of Victuals and Ammunition for the ſuſtaining a Siege. Theſe things, part of which were too true, were ſo exaggerated by theſe two Fugitives, that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> eaſily ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to be perſwaded by them. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented him with the immenſe Riches which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96181:64"/>
were ſhut up in <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> with all the Nobility of the Iſle, to tempt his Avarice, by the hopes of an ineſtimable Booty: They aſſured him, on ſo eaſie a Conqueſt depended that of the whole Countrey: They continually put him out of Conceit with beſieging <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> by ſhewing him the Garriſon was ſtrong there, and its Commander would defend the Place to the laſt Extremity; and moreover, the taking of it could not much advance his Affairs: That he ought to march ſtraight to <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> to which Place they would be his Guides, and lead him the neareſt way; entreating him to keep them as Hoſtages and Pledges of an aſſured Victory. The <hi>Viſier</hi> perſwaded by theſe earneſt Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, gave over his firſt Deſign, commends the Zeal of theſe <hi>Renegadoes,</hi> makes them Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, promiſes them great Rewards, and ſhews them publickly all Reſpect imaginable: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the next Morning to <hi>Piali,</hi> Chief <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea, whatſoever he learnt from theſe Traytors; but <hi>Piali</hi> was not of opinion theſe Villains ſhould be ſo ſoon and ſo greatly credited: He would have the <hi>Viſier</hi> believe, that the firſt Enterprize was of far greater Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; eſpecially conſidering the <hi>Sultan</hi> had likewiſe approved of it; and might be carried on at the ſame time both by Sea and Land, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> not being in a capacity to ſuſtain theſe two different Attacks: That the Loſs of <hi>Fama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta,</hi> depriving the <hi>Nicoſians</hi> of all hopes of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, they muſt ſurrender to ſuch an Army: That <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> the Capital of the Kingdom, and ſituated in the midſt of the Countrey, had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96181:64"/>
been fortify'd by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> with great Care and Charge; which was ſufficient to ſhew thence muſt be expected a vigorous Defence, the Place being in ſuch a condition: That the Nobility, and all the Riches of the Iſle being therein included, 'tis to be expected, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, animated by a deſire to preſerve their Treaſure and Families, muſt hold out in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the laſt Breath: That he would not empty his Ships of Souldiers to encreaſe the Land-Army, before he underſtood what Strength he needed to withſtand the <hi>Chriſtian Fleet,</hi> which would infallibly come to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Beſieged. Thus did <hi>Piali</hi> declare himſelf: Whether this was his real Opinion, or that he was nettled to ſee a Deſign underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in which he could have no part: But <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> ſtuck the cloſer to this new Project; by having put ſome Chriſtian Priſoners to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the violence of which made 'em confirm the greateſt part of thoſe things the two <hi>Greeks</hi> had ſpoken. Being thus reſolved, he ſent three thouſand Men towards <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> to conceal his real Deſign, with Order to march ſecretly thither, leſt <hi>Baglioni,</hi> who knew well the Ground, ſhould charge them at a diſadvantage, to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves of all Avenues, and hinder any Communication betwixt the two Cities. He gave a <hi>Cypriot</hi> Monk, who was found amongſt the Priſoners, ſome Letters to the Chief of the Nobility, ſtuft with proud and threatning Terms, which theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> commonly uſe to exalt the Power of their Sovereigns, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently equal to that of the Almighty. He
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96181:65"/>
treated in his Letters, with an inſupportable Diſdainfulneſs, not only the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in general; and ſummonn'd at the ſame time, the <hi>Cypriots</hi> to deliver to him their Capital City; and put him in poſſeſſion of their whole State, with a promiſe to let them live in an entire Liberty, and ſuffer them to enjoy their Religion and Eſtates. The <hi>Nicoſians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning no Anſwer to ſuch unreaſonable Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> took this ſo hainouſly, that he waſted all the Country round about. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Borough of <hi>Leiparus</hi> felt the firſt Effects of his Cruelty: But whether they were diſguſted by the bad Uſage they had long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Nobility, or would ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from being pillaged, and their Houſes from being burnt, they ſurrendred themſelves to the <hi>Infidels,</hi> on advantageous Conditions; and ſeveral other ſmall Places followed their Example. The <hi>Nicoſians</hi> thought themſelves obliged to puniſh this Fact, to prevent the ill Conſequences of it; and therefore ſent ſome Regiments under the Command of <hi>Demetrius Laſcaris,</hi> which being arrived at <hi>Leiparus,</hi> cut all the Inhabitants Throats, during an obſcure Night, whom they ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in their Beds; not ſparing a man of them, and burnt the Village. This ſevere Chaſtiſement affrighted the neighbouring parts, and kept the reſt of the Iſle within the Bounds of their Duty.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> parted from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,</hi> at the Head of two thouſand Horſe, and a conſiderable Body of Foot, ordering the reſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96181:65"/>
of his Army to follow him with the Artillery and Baggage; and after ſix days March, came, and poſted himſelf within four Niles of <hi>Nicoſia.</hi> There were in the Town fifteen hundred <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> a thouſand Gentlemen, with their Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, two thouſand Freed-men of the new rais'd Forces, two thouſand of other Foot, drawn from different parts of the Iſland, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred Citizens in Arms, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Epirot-Foot,</hi> five hundred Horſe of the ſame Nation, and a thouſand other Cavaliers, conſiſting of Gentry: Beſides as many Slaves, as were found able to do Service, had Arms given 'em, and the Place was furniſh'd with all ſorts of Ammunition and Proviſions for a long Siege. Beſides, the multitude of unſerviceable People, which were retired into inacceſſible places; more then twenty thouſand Men, able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Countrey, were gone to ſeek for Safety in the ſame Retreats. There might have been drawn a great Succour from ſo conſiderable a Number, had there been Arms for 'em, and a Commander capable to mannage them. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Palaceo,</hi> a Perſon of a conſummated Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and who was ſent to <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> as has been already obſerved, to aſſiſt <hi>Rocas</hi> and <hi>Dandoli</hi> with his Advice, was for charging the Enemy in their March with all the Horſe, and a part of the Foot; aſſuring them, they would be ſurpriz'd by this vigorous oppoſition, and put in Diſorder before they could be form'd into a Body. Altho' theſe two Generals were often ruled by <hi>Palaceo</hi>'s Opinion, yet they now again re-aſſumed their former Obſtinacy, and rejected this wholſom Advice.</p>

The whole <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army came up the next Morning, being the Twenty Second of <hi>July,</hi> to the <hi>Viſier,</hi> who cauſed his Tent to be ſet in a Plain at the Foot of a little Hill, call'd <hi>Mandia,</hi> from the neighbouring Village: He extended his Camp as far as a Countrey-Seat belonging to <hi>Demetrius.</hi> Having found all the Wells there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts poyſoned, he caus'd new ones to be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and proved ſeveral to be wholſome Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who thought to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the <hi>Infidels,</hi> or make them undergo an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Thirſt, had the diſpleaſure of ſeeing this their Stratagem of none effect. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the Place at the Head of his Cavalry, to view it, and draw out the Garriſon; but <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doli</hi> and <hi>Rocas</hi> would not ſuffer the <hi>Nobility</hi> nor <hi>Epirots</hi> to ſally forth; who burnt with a deſire of charging the <hi>Infidels.</hi> The <hi>Viſier,</hi> who often turned his Head towards the ſide of the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, ſeeing no body appear, cried out in Laughing, <hi>The</hi> Chriſtians <hi>were to blame in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving themſelves ſecure behind their Walls.</hi> He cauſed Lines to be drawn as near as could be to the Body of the Town: He raiſed his firſt Battery on the ſide of St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Gate, over againſt the Baſtion of <hi>Podocatero,</hi> with ſuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that the work was finiſhed in a Night's time; the Beſieged having ſcarce made any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. This Battery being diſtant about three hundred paces from the Baſtion, did not much dammage either the Walls, or the neighbouring Houſes; the <hi>Infidels</hi> rais'd three more; one againſt St. <hi>George</hi>'s Church, the other on a Prominency called St. <hi>Marguerite</hi>'s Place; and a third, on a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96181:66"/>
riſing Ground, term'd <hi>Mandia;</hi> with which, they endeavour'd to ruine thoſe of the Beſieged, and diſmount their Cannon; but ſeeing this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery advanced not much their Deſign, the <hi>Viſier</hi> made the Trench be carried on to the Walls of the Ancient Town, and within an hundred and fifty paces to the Counterſcarp. He afterwards built four Forts, oppoſite to ſo many Baſtions, called <hi>Podocatero, Avila, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> and <hi>Tripoli,</hi> from the Names of thoſe who took care of their Structure under the inſpection of <hi>Savoriani.</hi> Theſe Works being ſoon finiſhed, the <hi>Turks</hi> placed great Pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance on them, ſome of which carried Bullets of ſixty pound weight, which would in a ſhort time grind the Wall to Powder: But having fired continually for four dayes together, they obſerved the Bullets entred only the Earth which filled the Thickneſs of the Walls; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they quitted theſe new Batteries. The Commanders of the Place, who dared not to Sally out, endeavour'd to ruine with their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non the Enemies Works, killing every day ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their Men. The <hi>Turks</hi> diſpleaſed at the ſmall effect of their Artillery, advanced their Trenches near enough to the Counter-ſcarp, to ſhelter themſelves from the continual Firings of the Beſieged. This Work contain'd ſeveral Angles, and the Earth thrown up on the ſide of the Town, was a ſufficient Defence to the Workmen: They wrought day and night with an indefatigable Toyl, without reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the time of the greateſt Heat; ſo that in a ſmall ſpace they got to the Walls. They made
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96181:67"/>
a ſecond deep Trench, that was Cannon-proof againſt the Town; which was lined with with Musketiers; who fired ſo thick, that the Beſieged durſt not appear on their Ramparts; ſo that the <hi>Infidels</hi> lodged themſelves in the Ditch without any reſiſtance. The Cavalry of the Garriſon would have ſallied out on the <hi>Turks,</hi> to hinder theſe near Approaches, but they could never get leave of their Superiors.</p>
                  <p>The Siege grew every day worſe for the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the Garriſon being conſiderably weakned by the great number of Souldiers that were killed or wounded. The <hi>Infidels</hi> gave 'em not a Moments Reſt, attacking them in ſeveral places at a time; having freſh Men continually to ſupply the places of the tired or ſlain. They were already ſo well lodged in the Ditch, that they began to undermine and pluck down the Walls, and there remained no way to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from entring the Town. In this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, the Chief of the Garriſon went to <hi>Rocas</hi> and <hi>Dandoli,</hi> to whom they repreſented the deplorable ſtate of the Place; conjuring them to have pity on the Capital City of the Iſland, and not ſuffer ſo many brave Men to be ſlain like Beaſts, pent up within Walls: That if they muſt periſh, it might be with Arms in their hands; by which means, they ſhould not undergo an inglorious and languiſhing Death; which is commonly met with in an obſtinate Siege: That they might be permitted to charge the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> whoſe Inſolence grew every day inſupportable: That true Valour ſhewed it ſelf more by fighting with Swords in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96181:67"/>
their Hands, than firing great or ſmall Pieces at a diſtance; ſeeing Fortune many times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Brave and Valiant in this manner, by the hands of a paultry Fellow, during a Siege; and the Enemies having made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Out-works, they were near the laſt extremity, ſo that they could not comprehend the Policy of keeping Peoples Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits evaporating between Walls; and which at the ſame time encreaſed the Courage of the <hi>Turks;</hi> and that in ſhort, their only Safety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in making a vigorous Sally, before the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon was wholly out of condition to ſuſtain a general Aſſault. Theſe Remonſtrances and Entreaties ſomewhat prevailed over the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders; but tho' they were convinced of the neceſſity of a Sally, yet were they hardly brought to yield to it; alledging, there remain'd only five hundred <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers, in whom lay all their Confidence, as not much truſting the <hi>Freed-Men,</hi> who were altogether undiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd; much leſs the <hi>Citizens,</hi> a great part of which they had loſt in the forty dayes Siege, as well by the exceſſive heat, as the Enemies hands; who were ſo far from underſtanding the Trade of War, that they could not tell how to carry their Arms. After long Conteſts, a Sally was at length granted; and for this end, a thouſand Foot were choſen, who were to be ſuſtained by the <hi>Epirot</hi> Cavalry. Thoſe of the Ifle could not ſuffer themſelves to be reſerved in an occaſion which muſt decide the good or bad Fortune of <hi>Nicoſia;</hi> and therefore preſs'd <hi>Dandoli</hi> to permit them to joyn with the <hi>Epirots;</hi>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:96181:68"/>
ſhewing him what a great Affront 'twould be to young People, who deſired nothing more than to ſpend their Blood in the Honour and Defence of their Countrey, to give this plain demonſtration of miſtruſt of their Courage and Fidelity. <hi>Dandoli,</hi> who was not eaſily brought to change his Mind, and feared the Place would be in this manner left deſtitute, forbid any Horſe to ſtir, except thoſe of the <hi>Epirots.</hi> The next Morning there were drawn out two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men; the Command of which was given to <hi>Ceſar Pioveni;</hi> to whom was joyned <hi>Albert Scotto,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Panteus,</hi> together with <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Gradenigo</hi> and <hi>Zanet Dandoli,</hi> two young Noble <hi>Venetians.</hi> They were ordered to deſtroy the Enemies Out-works, and if poſſible, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der uſeleſs their Cannon, aſſoon as they had driven them out of their Trenches. <hi>Pioveni,</hi> having provided all things neceſſary for this Exploit, gave Order to his Men to be ready about Noon at the Town-Gate; becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi> uſually went te reſt at that time. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the Deſign they had laid, was not well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, by the <hi>Greeks</hi> Fault, who ſet on the Avant-Guard before the Sign given, through the Envy of ſome Officers, who were jealous leſt their Commanders ſhould get too much Honour by a happy Succeſs: Yet <hi>Pioveni</hi> at the Head of this Detachment, Marched out by a way which lay private about the Ditches, and led to the Trenches. He arrived there without any diſturbance unperceived, and charged with ſo great Valour, that the <hi>Turks</hi> ſurpriz'd with this unlook'd for Onſet, before they could give
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96181:68"/>
notice thereof to the Camp, believing the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> to be more in number than they were, fled before them as faſt as they could. The Aſſailants kill'd ſeveral of them, and became Maſters of the Places where they lodg'd; and thinking they were followed by their Horſe, purſued them into their Camp, which they fill'd with Diſorder and Confuſion. But <hi>Dandoli,</hi> whom perhaps God had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Miniſter of his wrath to the <hi>Cypriots;</hi> for the Ruine of their City, would needs hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Epirots</hi> from paſſing out of the Town. Some Gentlemen highly offended at his forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to be of the Party with the <hi>Epirot-Horſe,</hi> had armed themſelves like them, and mixt amongſt them. <hi>John Falerio,</hi> a Noble <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian,</hi> who was to be their Leader, was known by his too great care of concealing himſelf; and <hi>Dandoli,</hi> who ſtood at the Town-Gate, to ſee his Orders obſerved, reprehended him too ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this his Diſobedience; <hi>Falerio</hi> boldly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, <hi>He thought himſelf oblig'd in this Occaſion to hazzard his Life in the</hi> Republick<hi>'s Service:</hi> But <hi>Dandoli</hi> more enrag'd by this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, cauſed the Gates to be ſhut, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Epirots</hi> to return. The Chief of the Garriſon entreated him to Sacrifice his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment to the need his Men had to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; laying before him, how that theſe brave Foot-Souldiers would be immediatly cut in pieces before his Face, if ſome Horſe were not ſuddenly ſent to their Succour: That they ought not to be thus abandoned for the Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſome raſh young Heads; yet whoſe Fault
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96181:69"/>
was too great a deſire to ſhew their Courage. But <hi>Dandoli,</hi> inflexible to their Reaſons and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, anſwered in a Fury, <hi>Let them periſh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than my Orders be diſobeyed.</hi> And thus did this mean Soul, tranſported by Pride, expoſe this generous Company, in whoſe Safety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that of the whole State.</p>
                  <p>Theſe valiant Men, having rendered uſeleſs the Cannon of both the Batteries, thirſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Glory and Revenge, purſued too far the flying Enemy. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> advertized of the Rout of his Men, ſent out a Party of Horſe to their Relief; and they rallying at the ſight of this Aſſiſtance, returned to the Combat with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vigour. The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves back'd by the <hi>Epirots,</hi> made a firm reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and both ſides did their utmoſt. The <hi>Turks</hi> were animated by the ſhame of having been driven from their Trenches, by an handful of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in the ſight of ſo great an Army: and they, on the other hand, encouraged by the aſſurance of the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Epirots,</hi> flattered themſelves with the hopes of a certain Victory. But the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſe having charged on every ſide their ſmall Number, they were forced to take their Heels, and yield to the Multitude. The <hi>Spahies,</hi> who purſu'd them, made a great Slaughter of them: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder which could not enter into the Town, the Gates having been ſhut, for fear the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> ſhould enter, lay all night in the Ditches, and with much danger and difficulty gat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance through the Breaches already made in the Ramparts. The <hi>Turks</hi> loſt fifteen hundred
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96181:69"/>
Men in this Occaſion, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> about two hundred; amongſt whom, is to be chiefly remembred <hi>Ceſar Pioveni,</hi> their Leader; who often look'd towards the Town for the Horſe which were to relieve them; but ſeeing no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Succour, he threw himſelf deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately on the Enemies, and was over-powered by their Number. <hi>Albert Scotto,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who behaved themſelves with the ſame Generoſity, incurred the ſame Fate. There had been obtained a ſignal Advantage over the Enemy that day, and the <hi>Turks</hi> would not have been able to extricate themſelves out of their Diſorder; had the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Cavalry come in to their Aſſiſtance, at the ſame time the Trenches were cleared: The Terror was ſo great in their Camp, that ſeveral there began to think of Flight. They ſince confeſs'd, That had this Advantage been cloſely followed, and their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery made uſeleſs, they muſt have rais'd the Siege. <hi>Dandoli,</hi> to repair the Dammage which his Obſtinacy had occaſioned, became yet more intractable; ſwearing, he would not hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuffer a Man to out of the Town at any ones Inſtance, under pretence of charging the <hi>Infidels,</hi> or ruining their Works. The <hi>Turks</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by this Shock, in taking greater Care of themſelves, and doubling the Guard over the Workmen, whom they relieved continually; and thus advanced their Works with an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diligence. They had already beat down part of the Ramparts, and the fore-part of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; ſo that 'twas no hard matter to aſcend on the Breaches. The Beſieged abandoning the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96181:70"/>
Out-works, retrenched themſelves with a great Ditch, and repaired as well as they could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſide the Ruines of their Baſtions; and put themſelves in a condition to fight on the Walls. The <hi>Infidels</hi> doubled their Attacks; and the hope of certain Pillage, rendered them indefatigable. Altho' the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> kill'd them a great many Men, yet were they weakened themſelves by theſe means. The few Souldiers which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had ſcarce any Arms in good order, nor Powder and other Ammunition; and this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity began to diſcourage them about the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of the Siege: Yet the hopes of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet, which was dayly expected, bore up their Spirits againſt their ill Fortune, and bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Commanders. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> cauſed ſeveral Letters to be ſhot into the Town, fill'd with Threatnings and Promiſes; by which, he exhorted them to prevent their approaching Ruine: But this Courſe procured him no Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, the Souldiers being ſtill reſolute, in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of Aſſiſtance, which rendred them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliable.</p>
                  <p>They wrote to <hi>Baglioni,</hi> to entreat him, if he could leave <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> without great prejudice to his Intereſt, and that of the State, to come to their aſſiſtance. Theſe Letters were written in Characters, leſt they ſhould be intercepted, and there were great Rewards promiſed to him that would undertake to carry them. The Ways were ſo diligently kept, that they fell into the Enemies hands; the Perſons that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with them, being led round about the Walls, and maſſacred in the ſight of the Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96181:70"/>
to deter others from accepting for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch a dangerous Commiſſion. <hi>Baptiſta Scolomban,</hi> a brave and daring Officer, who commanded two hundred Men in the Town, and was perfectly acquainted with the Wayes, was entreated by all the Garriſon, to expoſe himſelf for the common Safety, and carry a Letter to <hi>Famaguſta. Scolomban</hi> affected with the common Calamity, undertook this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enterprize; and leaving the City by night, he arrived at <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> by winding and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Ways. He gave an Account to <hi>Baglioni,</hi> of the deplorable State of the <hi>Nicoſians;</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating his Pity, and that he would come and repair the Dammage, which had principally happened by the incapacity of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>Baglioni</hi> could not leave his Poſt, much leſs ungarriſon the Place in favour of the Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: Yet, to ſatisfie, in ſome meaſure, thoſe unhappy People, who implored his Aſſiſtance, and leſt it ſhould be ſuſpected, he was deterred by the greatneſs of the danger, he reſolved to throw himſelf into <hi>Nicoſia;</hi> and to keep this his Intent ſecret, ſuppoſing them of <hi>Famaguſta</hi> would hinder his Departure. <hi>Scolomban</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, his Preſence would re-animate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants and Souldiers, and his Orders would be executed with the greateſt joy and readineſs imaginable. He well knew the ſmall ſufficiency of both <hi>Dandoli</hi> and <hi>Rocas,</hi> and foreſaw the loſs of the Capital City, would make great way for that of <hi>Famaguſta:</hi> But this Deſign being diſcovered, his Houſe was immediately beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Populacy; who reſolv'd to retain
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96181:71"/>
him by force, if their Entreaties could not prevail. <hi>Bragadin</hi> and <hi>Tipoli,</hi> who no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of this his Reſolution, ſhewed him ſo plainly the ill Conſequence, that he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to their Reaſons. <hi>Bragadin</hi> taking on him to ſpeak in the Name of the Town; gave <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomban</hi> to underſtand the Kingdom would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the Risk of being loſt, by weakening the Garriſon of ſo important a Place, and taking thence ſo able and neceſſary a Commander: That this was an expoſing his Perſon to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Danger, and in a manner, to deliver <hi>Famaguſta</hi> into the Enemies Hands: That ſhould they conſent to his Departure, 'twas not in their power to contain the People and Garriſon: That the Souldiers would deſert the Place, in ſeeing themſelves bereaved of their General; and the Citizens, deſpairing of their Safety in a Defence, would ſet open their Gates to the <hi>Infidels. Scolomban</hi> return'd with this Anſwer; and the <hi>Nicoſians,</hi> expecting no longer any Succour thence, ſent to thoſe who were retired on the Mountains; beſeeching them to chooſe out ſome of the ableſt Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, to come to their Aſſiſtance; ſhewing them the deplorable Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they were reduced: But their Meſſengers having been ſurpriz'd, the <hi>Infidels</hi> loaded them with Irons, and carried them about for a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle to the Beſieged; to inform them, that they were forſaken on all hands, ſo that they had no other way but to ſurrender.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Viſier,</hi> finding his Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ineffectual, and that his beſt Souldiers
.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96181:71"/>
were carried away by Sickneſs, cauſed by the exceſſive Heats, beſides thoſe he loſt every day in the Attacks, reſolved to make a general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, before the Courage and Number of his Men were more diminiſhed. Providence ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded this Deſign; for receiving frequently News of the <hi>Chriſtian-Fleet</hi>'s being kept back at <hi>Candia,</hi> by the contagious Diſtemper, and how they had already loſt above twenty thouſand Men; and that the <hi>Venetians</hi> could not ſoon enough remedy this Misfortune: He wrote to <hi>Piali,</hi> to ſend him a Detachment of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and other <hi>Infantry;</hi> aſſuring him, he need not fear any danger on the Sea, ſeeing the Allies were ſo far from ſuccouring the <hi>Cypriots:</hi> That their chief Care was, to preſerve themſelves from the Plague: That he had made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Breach in the Walls of <hi>Nicoſia;</hi> the taking of which was certain, if he would ſhare the Honour with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hali</hi> came and joyn'd him, at the Head of a great Body of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> fill'd up with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Voluntiers, drawn out by the hope of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> being recruited with theſe new Forces, appointed a general Aſſault to be made on the Eighth of <hi>September,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all things neceſſary with great Care, for this important Expedition. He commanded his Officers to refreſh their Souldiers; to keep them in good Order, and exhort them to acquit themſelves well, by the remembrance of their paſt Actions: He ſhewed, That they were at the Vigil of finiſhing honourably this War, and being recompenſed for their Hardſhips and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96181:72"/>
That they were to ſtorm a Place, which could no longer hold out againſt them; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the condition whereunto their Cannon had reduced its Walls; having moreover to do with People covered with Wounds, and ſo greatly diſmayed, that deſpairing of their own ſtrength, they every day implored the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Neighbors, which aſſured them of the Victory, provided they were not wanting in their Duty: That in becoming Maſters of a City of ſuch conſequence, they would poſſeſs the Riches of a whole Kingdom; whoſe Treaſures gathered during ſeveral Ages, ſhould be equally divided amongſt them: That the <hi>Venetians,</hi> in fortifying <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> ſhewed plainly enough the Importance and Worth of the Place.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiers being thus animated by great Encouragements and Promiſes from their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and the Army divided into four Bodies, they were ordered to March at Break of Day towards the Town. Theſe four Squadrons at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd at the ſame time the four Baſtions of the Place, before which the Beſieged had raiſed Forts. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Caramania</hi> commanded that party which attack'd that of <hi>Podocatero; Muſaferro,</hi> that of the Fort of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> and <hi>Hali</hi> and <hi>Muſtapha</hi> aſcended at the ſame time on the Breaches of thoſe of <hi>D'Avila</hi> and <hi>Tripoli,</hi> with the Sound of Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets. The Beſieged had no expert Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and laboured beſides under the want of many Neceſſaries; yet made an incredible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. They were perſwaded, that the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Confedrates obliged the <hi>Turks</hi> to this
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96181:72"/>
vigorous Aſſault; and if they were repulſed, they would abandon the Siege, and betake 'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Veſſels. This Belief doubled their Courage, and kept them up with dayly Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of bettering their Fortune: They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided thoſe Souldiers which remained, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed them on the Defence of the Breaches, and planted their Cannon in proper places, to divert the approaching Storm. They brought on their Walls all ſorts of Weapons and artificial Fires; and in general, whatſoever might annoy the Aſſailants; whom they receiv'd with that Reſolution and Valour, that they drove them from off their Ramparts; having firſt made a great Slaughter of them. Altho' the Beſieged loſt fewer Men by far than the <hi>Infidels,</hi> yet were they more weakened than they; for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment from the Fleet, enabled the Beſiegers to ſend continually freſh Men, which relieved the wounded and weary; and the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> on the contrary, ſuſtained all theſe different Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, without a Moment's Refreſhment. Theſe Onſets laſted long, and the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who thought to carry the Place at the firſt Aſſault, began to doubt of the Victory; and grew leſs fierce at the ſight of that Reſiſtance, which they did not foreſee. The Beſieged on the other hand, emboldened, by having made ſo brave a Reſiſtance, defended themſelves with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Vigor and Conſtancy. <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and the Generals of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, ſeeing their People thus repulſed, edged them on by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching them for not making themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of a Place, in a manner level'd; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96181:73"/>
only by an ignorant and undiſciplin'd Handful of Men. Theſe Invectives, together with the hope of Booty; of which theſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> were remembred, made them begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain an Attack, far more terrible than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but which alſo ended in a Repulſe from the Beſieged, tho' more tired and weakned than ever. The <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Cypriot-Gentry</hi> follow'd by their Vaſſals and Domeſticks, exhorted one another to prevent by an honourable Death, the ſhameful Loſs of their Lives and Country. Thoſe who defended the Baſtion of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> attack'd by the <hi>Baſſa Muſaferro,</hi> overthrew the <hi>Infidels</hi> into the Ditch, with their Engines, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under certain little Places of Shelter, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by an able Engineer, named <hi>Suſomini.</hi> The others behaved themſelves as well at the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks of <hi>Avila</hi> and <hi>Tripoli;</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> puft up with this Glorious Succeſs, inſulted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready over the <hi>Infidels,</hi> inviting them again to a Third Aſſault.</p>
                  <p>This Day might have wholly diſheartned the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and preſerved <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> had not the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Caramania,</hi> who attack'd the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of <hi>Podocatero,</hi> been ſeconded by the ill Genius of the Place. <hi>Rocas,</hi> who defended this Baſtion, and whoſe obſtinate Conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs held as long as the Siege, having repulſed the Enemy, and ſeeing they returned not to the Charge again, came down into the Town, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Nobility and Souldiers, who guarded this Poſt, and left it naked; which the <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving, attack'd it again, and got on the top of the Walls, and made themſelves
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96181:73"/>
Maſters of the inward Trenches; having firſt cut ſeveral <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in pieces. The Beſieged, being reduced to their new Fortifications, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſtill in their reſiſtance; but the <hi>Turks</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained the Tops of the Walls, in great Multitudes, fill'd the Ayr with Shouts of Joy and Victory, and poſſeſs themſelves alſo of theſe Works. The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Freed-men,</hi> betake themſelves to Flight: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Gentlemen, and ſome few <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers, who had diſengaged themſelves from the Fury of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> would not diſhonour their Birth, nor Countrey, by yielding; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the <hi>Barbarians</hi> until their laſt Breath. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> hearing the Noiſe of this Diſorder, and being ſufficiently informed of the Occaſion, by thoſe flying, ran in great diligence with ſuch as he could haſtily gather; but ſeeing himſelf out of a poſſibility to encounter the Enemies, he placed himſelf at the Head of his Company; and falling amongſt them like a deſperate Man, he was ſtab'd ſeveral times, with <hi>Palacio,</hi> his Brethren, and others his near Relations. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> miſuſed his Body; exerciſing on it all the Cruelties which Vulgar Ntaures are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</p>
                  <p>The Conquerors, meeting no Reſiſtance, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuouſly entred the Town; and dividing into two Parties, Marched directly to the Bulwark of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> where the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſtill held out, witb incredible Valour; where they came upon their Backs: Thoſe that ſo valorouſly reſiſted, knew nothing of the Defeat of their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but found themſelves immediatly inveſted
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96181:74"/>
by one of theſe Parties, whom they knew by their Enſigns, and the confuſed Shouts and Noiſe of the Souldiers; and <hi>Muſaferro</hi> giving an Aſſault without, became Maſter of the Wall. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſurrounded on each ſide, and knowing not on which hand to turn, were all of them put to the Sword. The Forts of <hi>D'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vila</hi> and <hi>Tripoli</hi> incurred the ſame Fate. <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochio</hi> got out from <hi>Nicoſia</hi> by a falſe Door, with the ſad Remains of his <hi>Epirots,</hi> and ſought his Safety by Flight. <hi>John Falerio,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Troop of an hundred Horſe, rais'd at the Charge of <hi>Francis Caterini,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Baffo,</hi> reſolving to ſell his Life dear, came up, and charged moſt deſperately the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all before him; but being overwhelmed by the Multitude, he was overthrown, and lay amongſt the dead, covered with Wounds and Blood; <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> having known him, gave him his Life, and diſmiſt him, having firſt paid his Ranſom. The Biſhop of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> who, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole Siege, had aſſiſted the Souldiers and Inhabitants with his Eſtate and Perſon, was kill'd in the mixt Multitude. The People ſtill defended themſelves in the Streets and narrow Paſſages, without Officers to Head them, or any kind of Military Skill, according as they were in any capacity of Reſiſtance: But the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels</hi> ſoon put to the Sword, and diſperſed all thoſe who through Deſpair oppoſed their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties; the Fury of theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſparing neither Men, Women or Children.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever a man may imagine that's horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deplorable, comes not near the diſmal
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96181:74"/>
condition of this unfortunate City, lately ſo ſightly and flouriſhing. All parts reſounded with Shrieks and Groans. The Women of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity fled for Refuge into the Churches, proſtrate at the feet of the Altars; with doleful Cries imploring Heaven's Compaſſions. Some drew their Children with them along the Streets; others, on their knees endeavoured to ſoften by their Prayers and Tears, the hardneſs of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> Hearts, and offered themſelves to their Swords, to attone for the Death of their innocent Families. 'Tis reported, ſome threw themſelves down off their Houſes to avoid the Brutality of the <hi>Infidels;</hi> and that others were ſo cruel, as to cut their own Daughters Throats, for fear they ſhould loſe their Honour with their Liberty: But there was one eſpecially amongſt the reſt, whoſe Deſperateneſs and Grief requires a particular mention in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
                  <p>This Woman, hearing by the Shouts, Shrieks, and other dreadful Noiſes, wherewith the Town reſounded, That the <hi>Infidels</hi> were become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of it, left her Houſe, to know what was become of her Husband, and three of her Children, who had followed him to the Breaches: But ſeeing the Garriſon routed, ſhe recovered her Lodging; where ſhe ſoon heard they all four periſhed with their Arms in their Hands, in uſing their utmoſt Endeavours to defend their Countrey. This Relation depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her of her Judgment and Reaſon, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into her Chamber, where ſhe beholds her young Son, who was a Child of perfect Beauty,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96181:75"/>
the only one left her, and which ſhe loved with a tenderneſs not to be expreſs'd: This unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Mother, having long held him in her Arms, tells him in a Tone mixt with Deſpair and Compaſſion, <hi>Shall theſe inhumane Wretches ſnatch thee out of my Arms, and make thee their Slave, abuſing perhaps thy Body too, becauſe of thy Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> In ending which Words, ſhe ſtuck a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into his Throat, and afterwards kill'd her ſelf at three Stroaks with the ſame Weapon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> entred into the City, which was full of dead Bodies, and ſtreaming with Blood; where, being come to the Publick Place, he made the Slaughter ceaſe; promiſing their Lives to ſuch as laid down their Arms: Whereupon, the Populacy rendered themſelves on diſcretion. <hi>Dandoli,</hi> who had retired into the Royal Palace, with ſeveral others, ſent to deſire Quarter of him, by a principal Officer, named <hi>Conſtancio:</hi> But the <hi>Turks</hi> having, in the mean time, broke open the Gates, and forced open the Door of that Apartment wherein he retired, maſſacred him and all his Company. <hi>Podocatero</hi> defended himſelf to the laſt, in the Houſe of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Count <hi>Tripoli,</hi> who was kill'd two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in an Aſſault: He made his Compoſition, and obtained for himſelf and thoſe that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, liberty of dwelling with their Wives and Children in the Town, by paying great Ranſoms, and delivering to <hi>Muſtapha</hi> all the rich Furniture of this Magnificent Houſe: But this perfidious <hi>Turk</hi> broke his Word, and kept them all Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:96181:75"/>
The Souldiers, diſtracted after Booty, fill'd the Town with Marks of their Rapine and Brutiſhneſs. The <hi>Viſier,</hi> to ſhew that Pity did not oblige him to give Life to thoſe who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred without Reſiſtance, and that he only cauſed Murthering to ceaſe, that he might have the more Captives, made the old People and Children to be ſet apart, and led into the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Place; where having been thrown one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, they were all of them moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely burnt alive. 'Tis thought there were above twenty thouſand Perſons put to the Sword after the Town was taken; whoſe Death, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' cruel, was envied of thoſe who ſurvived them, only to bewail in Captivity the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ruine of their Countrey. They were ſeen ſome dayes after in the Fields, weak and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, faſtened in great Companies to long and heavy Chains, lying on the ground like ſo many irrational Creatures. The Lamentations and Bewailings of the Women and Children, were yet more irkſom to the Husbands and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, than the loſs of their own Liberty; but they often ſaw themſelves ſeparated from each other, without hope of ever meeting again; which made many pine away with Grief. The <hi>Infidels</hi> carried off twenty thouſand Captives from ſeveral parts of the Iſle, not reckoning thoſe which they made in <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> who were all ſold into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia.</hi> Eight days was the City plundring, and tranſporting the Booty: But a Couragious <hi>Cypriot-Woman</hi> ſnatch'd this Prey out of the hands of <hi>Muſtapha.</hi> He had laden the two greateſt Veſſels of the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:96181:76"/>
Fleet with Plate and other valuable Spoyls; He alſo embark'd on the ſame Veſſels ſeveral of the chiefeſt Gentry, comely Children, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Women, with which he intended to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and make a Preſent to the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> Whilſt theſe Veſſels were lading, which lay near one another, and ſtaid only for a good Wind, to ſet Sayl; this generous Matron, preferring Death above a cruel Servitude, deſcended into the Ships Hold, and couragiouſly put Fire to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the Flame whereof, communicating it ſelf immediately to the other Veſſel, they were ſoon both conſumed, with all their Lading; there eſcaping only ſome Sea-men who ſwam to Shoar.</p>
                  <p>After the entire Deſolation of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> the <hi>Cypriots</hi> who were withdrawn into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, under the Conduct of <hi>Scipio Caraffa</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul Synclitici,</hi> who had often ſurprized and defeated the <hi>Infidels</hi> in the Fields; now by the Advice of their Principals, ſent to demand Compoſition, and ſurrendred themſelves to the <hi>Viſier,</hi> with aſſurance of their Lives.</p>
                  <p>There had been put a great Garriſon of <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Freed-Men</hi> into <hi>Cerines;</hi> which the Neighbourhood of <hi>Cilicia</hi> rendred important; the taking of which, was not over-eaſie, by reaſon of the difficulty in bringing Cannon. This Place had been heretofore fortify'd, and made famous by the brave Reſiſtance of Queen <hi>Charlotte;</hi> whom <hi>James</hi> her Baſtard-Brother, had therein long beſieged: But <hi>John Maria Mudacio,</hi> who was the Governor, diſmayed at
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96181:76"/>
the Diſaſter of the <hi>Nicoſians,</hi> baſely ſet open the Gates to the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Cilicia. Muſtapha</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd the Place, diſarm'd the Inhabitans, put Commanders of his own into <hi>Baffo, Limiſſo</hi> and <hi>Salines,</hi> left a moderate Garriſon in <hi>Nicoſia;</hi> the Government of which, he committed to <hi>Giaferro;</hi> and parted the Seventeenth Day of <hi>September</hi> with his whole Army, to inveſt <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maguſta.</hi> He had ſent a Slave before, whom he commanded to preſent to the Officers of the Place <hi>Dandoli</hi>'s Head, without ſaying any thing more; thinking to affright them by ſo terrible an Object, and oblige them to a Surrender: But they ſhewed little Fear at the Spectacle; and reſpecting the Death of <hi>Dandoli,</hi> as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Loſs in compariſon of their Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal City; of which this imprudent Governor was the Author: They buried his Head, and prepared themſelves to revenge the Death of their Companions. The <hi>Viſier</hi> made his Naval Army advance at the ſame time as he drew near the Place, on the Weſtern ſide; thinking to diſmay them, being inveſted both by Land and Sea. He cauſed it to be ſummoned, and endeavoured to perſwade the Inhabitants 'twas better for them to try his Mercy, than oppoſe his Arms; but theſe Promiſes and Threats ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no Impreſſion on their Minds, buoyed up with confidence in the Experience of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, in the Strength of the Place, and its Garriſon; <hi>Muſtapha</hi> contenting himſelf with this Trial of them, put his Troops into Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Quarters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:96181:77"/>
Thus did the <hi>Infidels</hi> advance their Conqueſts in this Campaign, whilſt the <hi>Confederate-Fleets,</hi> divided amongſt themſelves for Superiority, and too weak to ſuccour the <hi>Cypriots,</hi> made ſlow Preparations for their Deliverance. Their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders having left <hi>Candia,</hi> the Seventeenth day of <hi>September,</hi> touched the ſame night at a Place called <hi>The Red Caſtle,</hi> which lay in the mid way between <hi>Candia</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus. Zani</hi> caſt Anchor a little above the Town, and <hi>Colonni</hi> ſtopt at <hi>Calmat,</hi> where <hi>Doria</hi> alſo came and caſt Anchor, altho' he affirm'd this Road was dangerous. He put out to Sea at Midnight, without Notice to <hi>Colonni</hi> beforehand, and ſent him word at parting, that he foreſaw a Storm ariſing, and that he would ſayl towards <hi>Italy,</hi> if the Wind encreaſed. This Proceeding offending <hi>Colonni,</hi> confirm'd the <hi>Venetians</hi> Suſpitions; who loudly complain'd of the Inſincerity of this <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeſe.</hi> Setting Sayl the next Morn at Break of Day, they were informed by <hi>Lewis Bembo,</hi> who was ſent out to learn the Enemies Proceedings, that <hi>Nicoſia</hi> was taken, and all the reſt of the Iſland, excepting <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> from the Relation of ſome <hi>Rhodians</hi> which he met in a Veſſel laden with part of the Booty of the Iſland. This ſad News obliged <hi>Doria</hi> to return, and joyn <hi>Colonni;</hi> with whom were already <hi>Zani,</hi> and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Officers, to conſult what they were to do in ſo ſad an Occaſion. <hi>Zani</hi> had already held a Council; in which <hi>Palavicinus</hi> and <hi>Celſo</hi> were not for going to the Succour of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> and <hi>Canali,</hi> ſince the taking of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> was likewiſe of the ſame Opinion. <hi>Venoccio, Quirini,</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:96181:77"/>
and <hi>Duodi,</hi> who commanded the Galeaſſes, and <hi>Troni,</hi> were for going directly to the <hi>Infidels,</hi> now grown careleſs, and overcharged with Priſoners and Booty. Moſt of them which were Aſſembled in <hi>Colonni</hi>'s Galley, were for return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Candia;</hi> and <hi>Zani</hi> alſo ſeem'd to approve of this Opinion by his Silence. Matters being in this ſtate, 'twas concluded to attack by the way the City of <hi>Chalcis</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Negropont,</hi> or ſome other Place eaſie to be taken. The Noiſe and Confuſion hindred a preciſe Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; wherefore each of them, according as his Fancy guided him, weighed Anchor, and parted without Order.

The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Garriſon of <hi>Caſtelnovo,</hi> a Place ſituated on the oppoſite Coaſt to that of <hi>Cataro,</hi> ſeized, through the Careleſneſs of the Officers, on two <hi>Venetian</hi> Galleys, which were left for the ſecuring the Town, and Gulph of the ſame Name.

to periſh, rather than ſurrender themſelves, with their Arms in their hands, to the Mercy of theſe <hi>Barbarians;</hi> wherefore, making all the Sayl he could towards them, he fell in amongſt the thickeſt of them, and fighting like deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate People, was himſelf ſlain, with moſt of his Men; but ſold his loſs at a dear Rate to the <hi>Infidels.</hi> The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſe, at the ſame time, made great Inroads in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and forced all the Countrey-people to retire to Places of Strength, having waſted and ſpoiled all their Harveſts. Had theſe Diſgraces happened to the <hi>Venetians</hi> at the beginning of the War, they might have comforted themſelves by the hopes they had in their Naval Forces; but ſeeing <hi>Nicoſia</hi> already loſt, and the whole Iſland in a manner ſwallowed up, their Commanders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to quit the Seas, and eighteen Galleys deſtroyed and taken in different and vexatious Occaſions; they were the more ſenſible of theſe Calamities, by having flattered themſelves with the <hi>Pope</hi>'s and King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Aſſiſtance; whereby they queſtioned not but to be able to drive the <hi>Barbarians</hi> from <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and defeat them in a Naval Engagement. This Confidence gave occaſion to a falſe Report, which ran touching theſe pretended Advantages, of which they were ſo firmly perſwaded at <hi>Venice,</hi> that the <hi>Senate</hi> imparted this great News to <hi>Pius</hi> V. and the reſt of the <hi>Confederates;</hi> but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came afterwards aſhamed and ſorrowful for their fond Credulity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> diſheartned by theſe Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, knew not where to betake themſelves,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96181:80"/>
nor what to do. They ſaw a formidable Army, ready to enter on their Country, and ſcarcely had any more Hope in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Aſſiſtance; whoſe Slowneſs was no leſs ſuſpected, than the Artifice of him who commanded their Navy: All <hi>Italy</hi> being diſmayed at the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and the Progreſs of ſo formidable an Enemy, reproached <hi>Doria</hi> with the ſecret Joy he felt from the Perplexity and Weakening of the <hi>Venetian</hi> State: But they themſelves were no leſs blamed, for taking ſo little Care to preſerve a Kingdom exceedingly threatened; in not ſending Forces ſufficient, nor chooſing a Governor capable to oppoſe the Enterprizes of an open Enemy. They were alſo blamed, for having put the Command of their Fleet into the Hands of a Perſon, wholly unworthy this great Truſt; eſpecially conſidering, this Navy was their only Confidence. Complaints were made againſt the corrupt Dealings of thoſe who were to furniſh the Army with Victuals and Ammunition; and the contagious Diſtemper, which ſwept away ſo many Thouſands, was attributed to the bad Proviſions wherewith the Victualers had ſupplied the Fleet. The Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which were engaged in the Service of the <hi>Republick,</hi> murmured at the Pride of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Officers; who uſed them with the ſame Diſreſpect, as if they had been their Slaves. 'Twas publickly diſcourſed, That this Severity diſguſted their Friends and Allies; and that they would be conſtrained at length, ſor want of Men, to recal ſuch as were baniſhed, and change corporal Penalties into ſeveral Years Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96181:81"/>
in the Wars; and to make their Criminals, Souldiers or Sea-men, according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Puniſhment they deſerved. Theſe Speeches being come to the Ears of the <hi>Senate,</hi> they thought themſelves bound to give a great Example of their ſevere Juſtice; and make known to <hi>Europe,</hi> That whatſoever Power a Citizen might be entruſted with, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he might have in the Armies, he is no leſs accountable for his Behaviour, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Cenſure of the meaneſt Subjects of the State: 'Twas reſolved on then to ſet up a Tribunal againſt thoſe who had the laſt Year the chief Adminiſtration of Affairs committed to them. There were three Commiſſioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the <hi>Senate,</hi> to examine the Guilty, <hi>John Mocenigo, Federio Valereſio,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Contareni,</hi> who dying immediatly after his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Gaſper Raynerus</hi> was choſen into his Place. Theſe three Magiſtrates began with the General <hi>Zani;</hi> calling him to anſwer the Matters laid to his Charge. But he being already inſtructed with the bad Offices Fame had done him, and foreſeeing the Storm ready to fall on his Head, was no ſooner at <hi>Corfou,</hi> but he ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the <hi>Senate</hi> to grant him his Diſcharge, and ſend another in his Place. The <hi>Senate</hi> delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated not a Moment in chooſing <hi>Sebaſtien Venieri</hi> in his ſtead; tho' he was not then at <hi>Venice;</hi> but his Services ſpake in his Favour, and all the World was willing to do him this Right. He coming from gaining <hi>Supoto</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> readily took on him the Defence of the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus</hi> (an Employ which no body dared to

accept) altho' his Age of Seventy Years might have been admitted as a juſt Plea, to excuſe him from ſo difficult and dangerous a Commiſſion. He was always of opinion, ſince the Loſs of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> to carry all poſſible Succours to ſave the reſt of the Iſle; arguing with ſuch Earneſtneſs and Vigour, as ſtartled the young People. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin Barbarigo,</hi> a Perſon to whoſe Wiſdom and Experience ſeveral important Affairs had been committed, was joyned as a Partner to this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Commander; with Order to command the Naval Army, in caſe <hi>Venieri</hi> ſhould land to the Succour of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> The new Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners ſent an Officer with <hi>Barbarigo,</hi> for <hi>Zani,</hi> to bring him Priſoner to <hi>Venice;</hi> thinking, ſuch an Act of Juſtice would terrifie thoſe who found themſelves guilty; and ſhew all <hi>Italy</hi> the Severity with which were maintained the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi>'s Laws. <hi>Zani</hi> was accuſed for ſuffering the Souldiers to live irregularly, and without Diſcipline; to have preferr'd his Countrymen in all Offices and Employs, and authorizing their Inſolencies againſt the <hi>Confederates;</hi> to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed his Authority in Matters of his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Intereſt; and not to have upheld the Honour of his Dignity with the Courage and Prudence neceſſary for a General; and which was worſt of all, That he had not followed the <hi>Senate</hi>'s Orders, which required his Succour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> and forced the two <hi>Providors</hi> to follow his Sentiment, altho' they were of a contrary Opinion. <hi>John Legio, Provid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96181:82"/>
of the Affairs of this Province. <hi>Julius Savoriani</hi> alſo proſecuted <hi>Legio,</hi> and obtained of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirs,</hi> that the Accuſed ſhould be kept cloſe Priſoner, during the time Informations were to be brought againſt him. He was charged with paſſing whole Days and Nights at Play and Debaucheries, and making himſelf by theſe means, mean and contemptible to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; for having treated the Allies with great Roughneſs, and not only diverting the publick Stock to private Uſes, but exacting on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants belonging to the <hi>Republick</hi>'s Cities; for delivering out Proviſions at an exceſſive Rate, and furniſhing the Army with Stuffs and Cloaths in ſuch a manner, as ſavoured more of the Merchant, than Officer of War; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, through his Ignorance and Vanity, hindred <hi>Savoriani</hi> from acting for the good of the Province; and cauſing, by his ill management, ſeveral other Dammages. The Publick was ſtartled to ſee two of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Magiſtrates lie in the Priſons at <hi>Venice;</hi> and 'twas verily thought they had loſt their Lives, had they been brought to Tryal during the Heat of the New Tribunal: But their Friends and Kindred rais'd up ſo many Difficulties in the Proceedings againſt them, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their Judges, which could not hold above a Year, expired before they could be Sentenced. Theſe Affairs waxing ſoft with the Time, the Knowledge of them was remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Colledge of Forty; where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Employes of the Accuſed, obtained both their Abſolutions, tho' there were too
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96181:82"/>
many Proofs againſt <hi>Legio.</hi> And thus did this Inquiſition, which appear'd at firſt ſo rigorous and dreadful, occaſion more Fear than Hurt. <hi>Zani</hi> died in Priſon with Shame and Grief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Sentence was given. He was a Perſon better verſed in Affairs at Court, than in Feats of War. His Father, at his Death left him no Eſtate, ſo that he was forced to ſhift for his Living: Voyaging into <hi>Syria,</hi> when he was very young, he ſerved as a Factor there; and after a long time, traffick'd for himſelf; and return'd to <hi>Venice,</hi> with ſo great an Eſtate, that he was rank'd with the principal Citizens. He afterwards was admitted into the Management of publick Affairs; by which means, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured ſo many Friends, that he was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed in the greateſt Offices of the State. He was a Candidate in the laſt Election of a <hi>Doge,</hi> with <hi>Mocenigo,</hi> who carried it from him, only by the Credit of his Family, which was more powerful and numerous than that of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</hi> He was afterwards choſen General of the <hi>Venetian-Fleet;</hi> an Office of abſolute Authority out of <hi>Venice;</hi> but he wanted both Courage and Wiſdom to ſupport the Honour and Weight of this Burden.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope,</hi> extreamly afflicted, ſince <hi>Colonni</hi>'s Return, with the Miſery of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf more than ever, to find the Means of ſuccouring the <hi>Republick;</hi> and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Entreaties with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to make him enter into the League, which he had already projected. This Affair was long agitated in the <hi>Senate;</hi> wherein ſuch as were
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96181:83"/>
diſguſted at the Propoſals of a ſecond Alliance with <hi>Spain,</hi> by the Vexations the firſt had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them, ſtrengthened their Opinions with the laſt Words of one their principal Senators. This Magiſtrate, Venerable by his great Age, was conſulted lying on his Death-Bed, touching the Courſe to be taken when the War was firſt declared. <hi>Tell,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>the</hi> Senators <hi>from me, that they had beſt to comply with the</hi> Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or<hi>'s Will, and make Peace by any means with him; or if they are for ſhewing themſelves brave, and righting their Cauſe by a War, let them make no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with the</hi> Spaniards; <hi>but begin by putting a ſtrong Garriſon into the Iſle of</hi> Cyprus, <hi>and haſten to meet the</hi> Infidels <hi>with their own Forces: 'Tis certain the</hi> Pope <hi>will never abandon them; and that the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>to acquire the Reputation of a Prince, zealous for his Religion, cannot lie idle, and ſee them fight, but will be the more ready to come to our Aſſiſtance, by how much he believes we can make a ſhift without him; and then the</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, <hi>being free from the Engagements of a Treaty, may take ſuch Meaſures as beſt pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Altho' this Diſcourſe moved ſeveral of the <hi>Senate,</hi> yet the Generality were for a contrary Reſolution. They imagined a diſadvantageous Peace with the <hi>Infidels,</hi> would draw on them the Indignation and Hatred of all <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> And making themſelves thus contemptible to the Miniſters of the <hi>Port,</hi> they wouldſtart continually new Pretences, and at length demand whatſoever Places they yet held in <hi>Greece.</hi> This Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being ſtrengthened by vehement Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96181:83"/>
from the <hi>Pope,</hi> made them conclude on a League.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Council was no leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed on this Matter than the <hi>Senate:</hi> Some of its Miniſters were of Opinion not to enter into a League againſt the <hi>Ottoman Empire;</hi> ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, as to their regard, at the other End of the World: That 'twere better for them to preſerve their own Conqueſts, than attempt new ones in a Countrey, the Acquiſition of which, cannot compenſate the Coſt: That, if they were reſolved to extend their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they had better carry the War into <hi>Africa,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Turks</hi> made it againſt the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and at the ſame time chaſtiſe the <hi>Algierines,</hi> for pillaging their Subjects: That, if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> enters into the League, he muſt furniſh the <hi>Republick</hi> with the greateſt part of his Troops, without any expectation of Profit from ſo conſiderable a Charge and Trouble: That, the <hi>Venetians</hi> inconſtant in their Reſolutions, and ruin'd by the Charge of their Fleet, would baſely forſake their Confederates in the heat of the War, as they had already ſeveral times done. They added, 'twas dangerous to ſend all their Naval Forces to the furtheſt part of the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi> in a time when the Inſurrection of the <hi>Mores</hi> was not wholly quieted; and thoſe of the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> every day encreaſed; and that the Reſentment of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand Practices of the <hi>French</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> were equally to be feared. Thus did they reaſon, whoſe <hi>Views</hi> reached no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Spain:</hi> But others, whoſe <hi>Politicks</hi>

were larger, affirm'd, That if the <hi>Republick</hi> fell for want of Support, under the weight of the War, 'twould be infallibly carried next into <hi>Spain;</hi> &amp; the <hi>Port</hi> had already determin'd the execution of this Project: That, if the <hi>Venetians</hi> were ſtrong enough to repulſe the <hi>Infidels,</hi> 'twas of abſolute neceſſity, for his <hi>Catholick Majeſty</hi> to bear a part in this glorious Advantage; and if the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> ſhould be conſtrained, by a Defeat, to accommodate her ſelf on ſhameful Conditions, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would be reproach'd for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> by refuſing to enter into the League: That the <hi>Turks</hi> could in a dayes time paſs over from <hi>Epirus</hi> to <hi>Ottranto,</hi> and land in <hi>Italy</hi> more Forces than could be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, were the <hi>Venetians</hi> put out of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to contribute to the common Defence: That <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> were not to be feared in this preſent Conjuncture; thoſe Princes not daring to undertake againſt a Sovereign League with the <hi>Republick</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> who diſpoſe of all <hi>Italy;</hi> and for which, all <hi>Chriſtian States</hi> have a Reſpect and Veneration: That this was a fit Occaſion, wherein to give Marks of a true Zeal for the Intereſt of Religion: That there was no need of being at any great Charge, ſeeing his <hi>Holineſs</hi> permitted a Tax to be laid on the Clergy, which would furniſh a Stock ſufficient to equip and keep up a good Fleet: And that, in fine, Whether the <hi>Venetians</hi> would faithfully obſerve the Treaty, or make Peace on diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Conditions, his <hi>Catholick Majeſty</hi> would be advantaged and honoured by this Confederacy. Altho' <hi>Philip</hi> had Piety enough
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96181:84"/>
to be ſenſible of theſe Reaſons, yet was he more ſwayed to favour the League, by the Fruit he hoped to reap from this War, He cauſed the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Nuncio</hi> to be ſent for, and aſſured him, That notwithſtanding the Revolutions in his Dominions, which might fairly excuſe him from entring into the League, and equipping a Fleet for the <hi>Levant,</hi> he would prefer the publick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own private Intereſt, and joyfully ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Intentions, as a Mark of the Reſpect he had for him. He ſent at the ſame time Orders to the Cardinals, <hi>Granvil</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checo;</hi> as likewiſe to his Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome,</hi> to conclude the Treaty of Alliance with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> on ſuch Conditions as his <hi>Holineſs</hi> would pleaſe to make.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetian-Ambaſſador,</hi> having already received the ſame Power, the Negotiation of the League began. The <hi>Pope</hi> committed the Management of this Affair to ſix Cardinals; whom he cauſed, together with the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> to come before him, and made them a Diſcourſe full of Sentiments, proceeding from the Tenderneſs of a Father, afflicted with the Misfortunes of his Children. He began, by ſhewing them, The Anger of Heaven could not be turned away, but by Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prayer, and Re-eſtabliſhment of the Ancient Diſcipline of the Church; and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in ſuch affectionate Terms, as drew Tears from their Eyes. He afterwards particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariz'd all the Diſorders of the Church, and as their Chaſtiſement, the fore mentioned Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, wherewith <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> was afflicted:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96181:85"/>
And having praiſed the good Qualities of theſe Prelates, of which this Aſſembly conſiſted, he exhorted both them, and the Ambaſſadors, to endeavour with all Sincerity, the finiſhing of this important Work; recommending to them, amongſt other things, the Re-union of the Confederates Affections, which he eſteemed of far greater Importance in this War, than the Conjunction of their Arms. He added, They could not too ſoon put themſelves into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to retake the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> this Poſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary for the Execution of ſeveral En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes; and even for the Conqueſt of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and other Places, Conſecrated by the Bleſſed Preſence of our Saviour, and Operation of the principal Myſteries of our Salvation. In fine, this Venerable old Gentleman offered to go in Perſon in this Expedition, without any regard to his Age and Infirmities, ſhould this be deem'd neceſſary for the common Good. This Aſſembly, having rendered their moſt humble Thanks to his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> deſired the Conditions of the Treaty; which the <hi>Pope</hi> promiſed to ſend them the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The Cardinals and Ambaſſadors, having conferred a good while on the Means, whereby to repulſe and attack the <hi>Infidels,</hi> broke up in a perfect Intelligence.</p>
                  <p>This Treaty was very eaſie to be concluded in appearance; but at bottom was full of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Obſtacles. That which ſuited well with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Intereſt, diſagreed with thoſe of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> who fearing the encreaſe of the <hi>Turk's</hi> Force in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Illyria,</hi> yet more
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96181:85"/>
paſſionately wiſhed the diminution of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Power in <hi>Italy.</hi> They had in this reſpect, a leſs Deſire to invade, than to defend; and were rather for drawing the War out at length, than ending it by a Victory. The <hi>Republick,</hi> on the contary, uſed all their endeavours to make a ſpeedy Deciſion of it; as fearing the exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Treaſure. The Allied Towns were wearied with ſending Money and Sea-men; and the Fields, for want of Tillage, already lay waſte. Such oppoſite Intereſts produced every day ſuch great Difficulties, that the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation was ſeveral times breaking off, had not the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſometimes intreating one, and threatning another, kept up the Confereences by his Patience and Conſtancy. When they came to Agreement on any Articles, they fell out about other Incidents; and it was determin'd, for avoiding the Conſequences, to ſend conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually Copies of the Treaty to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Senate,</hi> and expect their Orders; and in the mean time, publiſh the Concluſion of the League. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> dared not to oppoſe this laſt Article, altho' they knew very well, that ſuch a Report might alarm the <hi>Infidels,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to make Peace on advantageous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Senate,</hi> having examin'd the Articles of the Treaty, found ſome of them prejudicial to their Intereſts, and blamed <hi>Soriani</hi> for not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing with more rigor the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s Pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But becauſe he was thought to lean too much to the making of a League and War; they ſent him <hi>John Sorantro,</hi> as an Adjutant; who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96181:86"/>
immediatly arrived at <hi>Rome:</hi> He was a rough ſort of a man, poſitive and ignorant in Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; whoſe Carriage ſo ſar diſpleaſed the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he had like to have ſent him out of <hi>Rome,</hi> had he not feared <hi>Soriani</hi> might ſuffer for it; for whom his <hi>Holineſs</hi> had a particular Eſteem: And in effect, he was a Perſon of great Prudence and ſingular Integrity, and well ſeen for a <hi>Venetian</hi> in Matters of Religion, fit for the Employ he exerciſed, as well for his Fidelity, as Experience. <hi>Sorantro</hi> was no ſooner ſetled at <hi>Rome,</hi> but he grew weary with the importunate Demands of Cardinal <hi>Granvil,</hi> and other Miniſters of that Faction. <hi>Soriani</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended himſelf indiſpoſed, to excuſe himſelf from theſe Conferences; and this Affair grew ſo troubleſom, that the Commiſſioners, ſetled to regulate it, began to deſpair of ending it: Yet the <hi>Pope,</hi> diſcouraged by no Difficulty, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted all theſe Obſtacles, and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things, but only one particular Article. The <hi>Spanlards</hi> pretended, the King, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſhould appoint the <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Army; foraſmuch as his <hi>Catholick-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> contributed chiefly to the Charge of the War; and the <hi>Venetians</hi> would by no means yield to this. <hi>Pius</hi> V. was for <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi>'s being reveſted with this Character, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had the Honour to be <hi>Philip</hi> the Second's Brother: But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were reſolved to exclude <hi>Colonni</hi> from his Office, demanded, That <hi>Don John</hi> might be impowered to name a Lieutenant General to command in his abſence; deſigning to ſecure this ſecond Place to <hi>Doria,</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:96181:86"/>
or elſe to <hi>Lewis Requieſcens,</hi> Brother to <hi>Zuniga.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> had a horrid Repugnance to this; but ſeeing the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority interpoſed, they thought their Intereſts could not be better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged than in his Hands: Whereupon <hi>Pius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>Don John</hi> ſhould command the Army, when there in Perſon; but would hearken to no Propoſition touching the choice of him, who was to command in his abſence; ſeeing this Right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to the Sovereign Prelate. <hi>Granvil</hi> and <hi>Zuniga</hi> refuſed this Condition; ſaying, 'twas to be communicated to the King, their Maſter. The <hi>Pope,</hi> who was very jealous of his Authority, diſpatch'd at the ſame time, a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier into <hi>Spain:</hi> He wrote thereon to <hi>Philip</hi> in Terms ſo pathetick and rational, that this Prince ſent an Order to his Miniſters, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Treaty: And to ſhew that he would be concerned in the nomination of the Perſon which was to command the Fleet in <hi>Don John</hi>'s Abſence, he propoſed <hi>Mark Anthony Colonni,</hi> together with <hi>Requieſcens</hi> and <hi>Doria;</hi> and thus preſerv'd the <hi>Pope</hi>'s good Opinion.</p>
                  <p>This Prelate was ſo vigorous and firm in what he believed to be equitable, eſpecially when the Honour of the See was concerned, that he would not buckle to the greateſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign in <hi>Europe,</hi> to maintain its Intereſts. He thanked King <hi>Philip</hi> for the Deference he paid him, and gave <hi>Don John</hi> the Title of <hi>Generaliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo;</hi> and to <hi>Colonni,</hi> the ſame extent of Power in his Abſence. <hi>Philibert Emanuel,</hi> Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> was propoſed to command the <hi>Chriſtian Army;</hi> which the <hi>Venetians</hi> much deſired; and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96181:87"/>
the <hi>Pope</hi> had no leſs an eſteem of his Capacity; but beſides that, this Prince eſteem'd it of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence to leave his Eſtates, whence his Father had been driven, and of which he came now from poſſeſſing himſelf. The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> could not approve, that a Sovereign Prince, whoſe Head was full of great Projects, ſhould have committed to him ſuch a Power. They raiſed a new Difficulty on the Deſign they had on <hi>Africa;</hi> maintaining, the League was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> but againſt all the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> People. The Cardinals aſſembled on this Affair, could not forbear ſmiling at the Pretention, and ſhewed the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> That the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> was ſo far from being conſidered as an Enemy, by reaſon of his Religion, that he ought to be earneſtly ſolicited to enter into the Confederacy: That the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes would joyn themſelves to little purpoſe, if the War were carried any where but to <hi>Greece,</hi> and on the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Countreys. The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> refuſed again to ſign the Treaty, unleſs therein were comprehended the Conqueſt of the Cities of <hi>Tripoly, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Algier;</hi> alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That without this Clauſe, the People would never be brought to conſent to the levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Taxes which were neceſſary for the Entertainment of their Fleet. They would alſo have a Promiſe, the <hi>Infidels</hi> ſhould not be atrack'd, but the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſſiould keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the defenſive part; foreſeeing the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Army</hi> would be far ſtronger than the <hi>Confederates;</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> granted this laſt Article, as having diſcovered the Meaning of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:96181:87"/>
theſe Demands. The <hi>Pope</hi> being tired with the length of theſe Conteſts, ſent <hi>Pompey Colonni</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain,</hi> a Perſon of large Abilities, charged with Packets and Inſtructions; and who was moreover ordered to lay open to <hi>Philip,</hi> that his Miniſters ſpoyled the Fruit of his good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions by the averſion which they manifeſtly diſcovered againſt the <hi>Republick. Colonni</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf ſo well of his <hi>Holineſs</hi>'s Orders, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ordered his Ambaſſador to paſs over all theſe Difficulties, and conclude the ſo often mentioned Treaty. 'Twas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reported, the <hi>Pope</hi> acquainted this Prince with the <hi>Venetians</hi> treating with the <hi>Port,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the Fame of this League to better their Compoſition; which was true enough; for they had ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſecretly negotiated with the <hi>Prime Viſier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, all Matters being regulated, the <hi>Pope</hi> intended to ſolemnize, before the Foreign Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, the Confederacy between the <hi>See,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians.</hi> He gave Notice of this to the Miniſters of the Allies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring them to meet him at the <hi>Vatican;</hi> where he celebrated Maſs; having made them firſt ſign the Treaty. But before this, Cardinal <hi>Granvil</hi> being come, together with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, he roſe up, and declared the King, his Maſter, was not in a readineſs to execute this Year what he promiſed in his Name: That the Seaſon was too far advanced to work at the Preparatives of a Fleet: He afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who had ſeveral Veſſels ready to put to Sea, ſhould furniſh his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96181:88"/>
                     <hi>Catholick-Majeſty</hi> with them, they receiving Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from him, and Money for all the Charges of the Campaign. 'Twas agreed on in the firſt Conferences, That in expecting the Concluſion of the Treaty, all poſſible Preparations ſhould be made for the War, to prevent the loſs of Time: So that the <hi>Venetian</hi> Miniſters, enraged at this unexpected <hi>Remora,</hi> deteſting a Return of this Nature, withdrew to confer together, and brought Anſwer, They intended to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the <hi>Senate</hi> of the inexecution of the Treaty. This Proceeding touched the <hi>Pope</hi> to the quick; and tho' he was prepared to overcome by his Patience whatſoever might oppoſe this good Work, he loſt all reſpect for Cardinal <hi>Granvil,</hi> and drove him away from his Preſence; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt told him with great ſharpneſs, That <hi>he ſaw he made it his Buſineſs to ruine the Affairs of</hi> Chriſtendom. He afterwards comforted the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and enjoyned them to aſſure the <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory</hi> from him, that he would ſo order the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould religiouſly obſerve the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as it was known at <hi>Venice,</hi> what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at <hi>Rome, , Moſenigo,</hi> who was then <hi>Doge,</hi> and the principal Magiſtrates, who had been ever of opinion to avert this Storm by an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, fell outragiouſly on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> calling them Cheats, and perfidious People; and changed the Deſign of taking Arms, into that of concluding a Peace; for which there happened a favourable Occaſion: <hi>Mark Antony Barbaro,</hi> their Ambaſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confined to his Houſe, ſince the Declaration
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96181:88"/>
of War, was not ſtrictly guarded; who, aſſoon as he underſtood the loſs of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> ſought all Means to accommodate the <hi>Republick</hi> with the <hi>Port,</hi> ſeeing no other Remedy to ſo vexatious a Diſaſter, nor a better way to recover his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. All the <hi>Turks</hi> trading in <hi>Venice,</hi> were impriſoned, aſſoon as 'twas known there, how the <hi>Republick</hi>'s Ambaſſador was uſed at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople. Amuti,</hi> an Envoy from the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> paſſing then through <hi>Venice,</hi> was alſo ſtopt, and more carefully kept than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priſoners. <hi>Barbaro,</hi> introducing himſelf into the Acquaintance of a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Phyſician, named <hi>Solyman,</hi> who had frequent Acceſs to the <hi>Prime Viſier,</hi> by means of his Profeſſion; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to him a Propoſal of treating with this Miniſter, touching the Exchange of Captives; and to try whether he was any ways inclinable to a Peace. <hi>Solymon</hi> made this Attempt, not wholly without Succeſs; and entreated <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> to ſend ſome body, as from his part, to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> which he willingly conſented to; for he was none of the worſt of the <hi>Venetian</hi>'s Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. This Envoy, being charged with Letters from <hi>Barbaro</hi> to the <hi>Senate,</hi> arrived juſt at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> when the News came there of a freſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made to put to Sea the next Spring. The Council of Ten, which conſiſts only of Magiſtrates, of a conſummate Experience, and whoſe Authority abſolutely decides either War or Peace; would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this Affair to the <hi>Senate.</hi> They choſe <hi>James Ragozzone,</hi> a prudent and active Perſon, who having long traded into <hi>Turky,</hi> knew well
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96181:89"/>
the Ayr and Manner of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dealings, to go and negotiate this Exchange; but with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Inſtructions to conclude an Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on the Conditions which <hi>Barbaro</hi> and he ſhould judge leaſt incommodious to the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Voyage diſquieted <hi>Pius</hi> V. who miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Buſineſs to be a Cloak to a real Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of Peace. Alarm'd by theſe Suſpicions, he ſent for Cardinal <hi>Commendon,</hi> in whom he repoſed an entire Confidence. His <hi>Holineſs</hi> knew this Prelate's Zeal to Religion, and that his Vertue and Sincerity were proof againſt all Intereſts and Paſſion. The <hi>Pope</hi> entertained <hi>Commendon</hi> in the Garden of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> with the deplorable State of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Affairs; ſighing unfeignedly at the Relation of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes with which they were threatened; and demanded of him, what means ſhould be uſed to hinder the <hi>Venetians</hi> from an haſty Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi> For no body, ſeeing the Indifferency of the Miniſters, which were to make the League, but would conclude it paſt effect. <hi>Commendon</hi> exhorted his <hi>Holineſs</hi> to try all ways to break off theſe Practiſes, and counſelled him to ſend <hi>Mark Antony Colonni</hi> to the <hi>Republick,</hi> whoſe Dexterity and Earneſtneſs might be more likely to prevail with the <hi>Venetians</hi> to continue the War, by his loſing the Lieutenancy in the <hi>Chriſtian-Army.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> never ſhewed ſo much Heat in all this important Affair, as he did in putting in practice this good Advice: For aſſoon as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendon</hi> had taken leave of him, he ſent for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96181:89"/>
                     <hi>Colonni,</hi> and ordered him to go in perſon, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the <hi>Venetians,</hi> diſheartended by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages they received the laſt Year, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted by the diſingenuous Dealings of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi> His <hi>Holineſs</hi> ſhewed him, 'twas to be feared, leſt the Miſtruſt they had of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and of themſelves, ſhould force them on unjuſt Meaſures: He enjoyned him to uſe all his Induſtry to conclude the League, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſet about it, notwithſtanding all the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which appear'd inſurmountable; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, God would bleſs this Enterprize, and carry it on by ways incomprehenſible to humane Reaſon; all things being eaſie to thoſe who put their Truſt in him. <hi>Colonni</hi> took Poſt for <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> where he was received both in publick and private, with great Honour and Welcome; his new Dignity encreaſing the Eſteem and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>Venetians</hi> had for him: But the Chief Senators, who had alwayes an Averſion for the War, received him with great Coldneſs: Yet they knew themſelves obliged to honour him, and uſe ſome Compliance to a Perſon, whoſe Merit rendered him dear to the Sovereign Prelate; and who moreover was to ſhare with <hi>Don John</hi> in the Conduct of the Army, and command it alone in this Prince's Abſence. <hi>Colonni,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſht not his Harangue which he made in full Senate, with the vain Ornaments of a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Eloquence, but by eaſie and natural Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, he endeavoured to perſwade his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors to embrace what was neceſſary. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by praiſing the <hi>Pope</hi>'s ardent Zeal, whoſe Intereſt was no other than the Preſervation of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96181:90"/>

                     <hi>Colonni</hi> was as able at conducting an Army, as making an Oration.

He had likewiſe engaged them by ſeveral good Offices; and his Prudence made no leſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the Minds of the Senators and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Magiſtrates. He had drawn many of them already into the Intereſts of the League, and miſt not one Occaſion in common Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, or in particular Entertainments, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them underſtand the neceſſity of it. The Council of Ten, who did not at all approve of the Alliance, yet ſaw little forwardneſs of a Peace.

This Magiſtrate thought it an unjuſt thing, that the Members of the ſame Body ſhould have no participation in their Motions; that ſome ſhould make the Secrets of the State

a Myſtery to others; and that the Council of Ten ſhould underhand endeavour a Peace, and at the ſame time delude the <hi>Senate,</hi> without conſulting them on the Means of carrying on the War. He repreſented to his Colleagues, that if it were perillous to make known to ſo many People the State of their Affairs, it was yet more dangerous to refer all to a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Magiſtrates; and if the Secret was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kept by them, they met with this Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that Matters were not ſo well and fully diſcuſſed.

liberty to take what Party ſhe pleaſed: That there is no body but will prefer a certain Peace, not only to a diſſicult and hazardous War, but alſo before the probability of a glorious Victory: That any man might ſee they would exhauſt their Treaſure, and diſguſt the Allied Towns, which ſupplied them with Sea-men and Slaves: That the <hi>Pope</hi> had more good Will than Power; and that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> failed of his Word: But 'twas to be examined on the other hand, whether it was leſs advantageous to them to enter into a League, and ſtrengthen themſelves by that means, than to hearken to an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, which could not be effected, but on the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s own Terms: And whether a ſhameful Peace, granted by an inſolent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, might be expected to be laſting and ſincere? For if they were not ſatisfied in this Difficulty, to what purpoſe ſhould they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a Negotiation, which would give them freſh occaſion of Diſquiet, and draw on them the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Indignation, and Contempt of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes: That ſuch who were ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Love with Eaſe, as to ſuffer all things, than incur a War, would do well to reflect on the Motives, which not only <hi>Selim</hi>'s Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors had, who were Warlike Princes, but of <hi>Selim</hi> himſelf, wrapt up in Softneſs, to violate their Oaths, and break Treaties ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſworn: Beſides, the Pride of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> People, appeared plainly in the ſmall Account they made at the <hi>Port,</hi> of the <hi>Venetian Militia;</hi> the Diſproportion of the Forces of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> with thoſe of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and the

ſmall Confidence which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had in the Succors of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes.</p>
                  <p>That it then lay upon them to know, if after having anſwered ſo reſolutely the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Envoy, they were rather for renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their Reputation, than be affrighted at the firſt Noiſe of Arms, and meanly beg their Peace, or make a generous Effort; and ſhew theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,</hi> being ſenſible of the Indignities of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her, wants neither Strength nor Courage; and can bring, when ſhe pleaſes, the Forces of other <hi>Chriſtian States</hi> to her Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>That it was time to undeceive the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> falſe Perſwaſion, of the <hi>Venetians</hi> being terrified at the only mention of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Name.</p>

                  <p>That ſuppoſing no Loſs of their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by ſeeking a Peace, yet the <hi>Sultan</hi> will be ſure to impoſe on them his own Conditions: For, if before the Loſſes, which the <hi>Republick</hi> had now ſuffered, he violated the Oaths, by declaring a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; can it be expected, he will be more Religious, when being become more inſolent, by the Conqueſt of a new Kingdom, and ſatisfy'd in the Diſunion of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> he will invade all <hi>Italy?</hi>

That they had no Reaſon to rely any longer on the good Offices of the <hi>Prime Viſier;</hi> ſeeing the Preſents and Penſions he had already drawn from the <hi>Signiory,</hi> could not empower him to avert this Tempeſt from falling on their Heads; but on the contrary, would have ſurprized and deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Vigilancy of their Reſident; perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, his Highneſs arm'd himſelf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſuccouring the <hi>Mores</hi> of <hi>Grenado;</hi> and therefore they were bound in common Prudence, not to truſt any more an Enemy, that came juſt from betraying them: And now this Miniſter, continuing his Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, would by a feigned Negotiation, amuſe and abate their Courage, retard their Preparations, and diſturb their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, and ſurprize them again with a numerous Army.</p>

                  <p>That the <hi>Turks</hi> might, if they were minded, come on full Sayl to attack their chief City; and then, what Confuſion would there be?

                  <p>That it behooved them to prevent theſe Misfortunes; the Foreſight of which, ſtruck him with Terror; there being only one Remedy; which was, to conclude the League with all Expedition, and joyn the <hi>Confederates</hi> in the beginning of the Spring, to find out the Enemy, and fight him.</p>

                  <p>Theſe ancient Magiſtrates, ſeeing the League in a manner concluded, charged <hi>Nicholas Ponti,</hi> one of the moſt conſiderable amongſt them for his Age and Eloquence, to anſwer <hi>Tripoli.</hi> Who began, by reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up all the ill Offices which Cardinal <hi>Granvil</hi> and <hi>Doria</hi> had done to the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;</hi> comparing the Malignity of their Proceedings and Diſcourſes, to the Fury of the <hi>Ottomans;</hi> and endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Aſſembly, that it was contrary to all the Rules of Prudence, and common Sence, to ground a Victory on the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ofan Allied Prince, whoſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage lies rather in their Weakneſs, than Strength.</p>

His Holyneſs and the Republick were agreed to go in ſearch of the Enemy; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found him, to engage, immediately after the Conjunction of the Fleets: the <hi>Venetians</hi> being greatly intereſſed to end this War in any ſort: The <hi>Pope</hi> on the other hand truſting to the Divine Aſſiſtance, and fearing the League would not laſt long, was alſo for deciding the Quarrel by a Combat, expreſly enjoyning this to <hi>Colonni</hi> at his departure.</p>

But having found the Place in a better Condition, than he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, returned to <hi>Corfou,</hi> where he received an account of the Concluſion of the League, and expected the Aſſiſtance of the Ally's. His Fleet conſiſted of Sixty Veſſels; when News came to him that the Infidels appeared before <hi>Candia.</hi> Not finding the Road of <hi>Corfou</hi> ſecure, he reſolved to Sayl into <hi>Sicily,</hi> as well to haſten the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as to hinder the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army from blocking up the Paſſage. He received in his way a Command from the Senateto ſteer this Courſe, and was well pleaſed with himſelf that he had prevented their orders. <hi>Colonni</hi> wrote to him at the ſame time from <hi>Naples,</hi> to the ſame purpoſe. He ſent out before <hi>Sancto, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Troni</hi> and <hi>Daniel Molino,</hi> with three Gallies to cruiſe on the <hi>Adriatic</hi> Gulph. <hi>Sancto</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

to leave the two others in the mid-way, and make directly to <hi>Venice,</hi> to inform ſuch Veſſels as were going to <hi>Corfou,</hi> to Sail to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> and avoid by this means the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet. He likewiſe diſpatch'd one <hi>Benedictus,</hi> Captain of a Friggat, a Native of the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to the Providors <hi>Quirino</hi> and <hi>Celſi</hi> to haſten them away, without any delay, to the place of Rendezvous with the ſixty Gallies, of which he had left them the Command, with whom he joyned ſome time after <hi>Colonni</hi> arriv'd there.</p>

                     <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth, who was not wanting in any particular of his Duty, aſſembled the Sacred Colledge immediately, after the departure of his Fleet, and nominated two Legats, <hi>to wit,</hi> Cardinal <hi>John Francis Commendon,</hi> and <hi>Michael Bonelli</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Alexandrinus,</hi> who was his Siſters Son, and brought up in the order of St. <hi>Dominic.</hi> The Colledge ſollicited for him a Cardinals Cap, as ſoon as his Unkle was ſeated on the Throne. He was indeed a young Man, of ſmall experience, but of ſuch a Virtuous Temper, as rendred him worthy of the Sacred Purple. <hi>Commendon,</hi> though abſent, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before ſeveral of his Competitors, who ſtrove for that Honour. His Piety, Prudence and Zeal to the <hi>Holy See,</hi> merited, without doubt, this Preference, and none in that time at his Age acquired ſuch an Eſteem and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>Nunciatures</hi> and <hi>Embaſſies.</hi> He had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated with all the Soveraigns of <hi>Europe,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pontificats of the three laſt <hi>Popes,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with thoſe of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland.</hi>

He had made Friends amongſt the Chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of each Nation, and having applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Learning, the Humours and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Princes, he had dexterouſly inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated himſelf into their Favour. He was ſent to the Emperor <hi>Maximilian, Sigiſmond Auguſtus</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> whom the Pope Vehemently deſired to enter into League.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Alexandrinus</hi> was diſpatched to the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> who in his Paſſage to <hi>Spain,</hi> went through <hi>France,</hi> where he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded extraordinary Circumſpection in dealing with ſeveral Great Perſons of different Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. As ſoon as he arrived in <hi>Spain,</hi> he paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately Solicited <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> to execute the Conditions of the League in good earneſt. Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that ſhould the <hi>Venetians</hi> grow in the leaſt meaſure jealous of his Sincerity, they will certainly turn their Thoughts on their own particular Intereſts, at the Coſt of his, and other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes: That a State which has no Inclination for War, muſt naturally tend to the ſide of Peace. That his Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty had great Reaſons to fear, leſt the weight of the War ſhould fall on <hi>Spain,</hi> by a forced Compliance of the <hi>Venetians</hi> with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror: That the State of his Affairs not permitting him to manage a matter of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in Perſon, he ought to ſend ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to <hi>Rome</hi> of approved Wiſdom and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with ample Power of regulating all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which may happen, on which diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him continually Couriers, much time is waſted by expecting his Orders, and ſeveral
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96181:103"/>
favourable occaſions loſt to the Progreſs of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Arms. That all Sincere Endeavours muſt be uſed, That his Fleet and thoſe who were to command it, arrive preciſely on the day and place appointed for the general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of the whole Army; That the <hi>Remora's</hi> had already coſt great and unneceſſary Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and withal entreated this Prince not to commit the whole Care of this Expedition to the management of his Miniſters, leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they abuſe his Power and Truſt.</p>

                     <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was a Young Ambitious Prince, who was eaſily enflamed with a deſire to do ſome Signal Service to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom</hi> in her neceſſities. The Legat exhorted him to enter into the League, by repreſenting him how greatly he was obliged to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the Infidels, and oppoſe their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to preſerve the Conqueſts of his Predeceſſors on the Coaſts of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> He then likewiſe deſired him to ſend Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to make him take Arms againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> on ſuppoſal he would comply with this Requeſt, on account of the Allyance and Amity which the Relation of Nighbourhood had long ſince eſtabliſh'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. <hi>Tipoly</hi> had been already ſent into <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> to Solicite the ſame thing on the part of the Republick. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> returned the like anſwer to the Legat which he had already made to <hi>Tipoly;</hi> That he would never be wanting in what <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> may juſtly expect from a King, whoſe greateſt Glory is the title of moſt <hi>Catholick,</hi> and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96181:103"/>
abſolutely devoted to the Service of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> whoſe Youthful Heat paſſionately deſired a War with the <hi>Turk,</hi> aſſured the Legat his Forces ſhould not be wanting to ſo Holy an Enterprize, but needing time to ſet out a Fleet in good order this Summer, he would not fail to be in readineſs againſt the next, and would in the mean time adviſe with his Holyneſs whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'twere better to make them direct their Courſe to <hi>Greece,</hi> or conduct them himſelf on the Coaſts of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> to divert the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Forces; That he intended to charge his Embaſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> to follow thereon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his Holyneſs ſhould determine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned according to his deſire, to ſend to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> although the Age and Sluggiſh Temper of this Prince gave ſmall hopes of any Aſſiſtance from him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> ſent at the beginning of the War <hi>Vincent Alexandri</hi> to <hi>Tammas</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> in quality of Embaſſadour, who having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed <hi>Germany, Poland,</hi> and <hi>Moldavia,</hi> embark't at <hi>Mount Gaſtro</hi> on the <hi>Euxin,</hi> for <hi>Sinope;</hi> where landing, he travelled through <hi>Armenia,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Provinces dependant on the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> and happily arrived at <hi>Tauris,</hi> then the Capital City of <hi>Perſia,</hi> by reaſon of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tongue and Cuſtoms. He found <hi>Tammas</hi> basking in ſoftneſs, encircled with Women and <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> and returned to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> without any poſitive anſwer from this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate Prince. <hi>Tammas,</hi> although Son to the brave <hi>Iſmael,</hi> an avowed Enemy to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and who by his Valour had meritted the Title
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96181:104"/>
of <hi>Sophi,</hi> trembled at the bare mention of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms, and had cauſed <hi>Prince Iſmael</hi> his Son, who was Heir as well of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers Virtue as Name, to be carefully guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, leſt he ſhould by ſome means or other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him in a War againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Alexandrinus</hi> likewiſe negotiated by the <hi>Popes</hi> order, a Marriage between <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Margurita de Vallois</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Siſter: This Allyance had been already propoſed, but no Prayers and Entreaty could make <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> change his averſion to Marriage. The <hi>Pope</hi> deſired he would embrace this offer, to hinder this Princeſs from eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Navar,</hi> who was a <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt. Sebaſtian</hi> anſwered the Legat, who preſt him on this Affair, that in Complyance with the <hi>Popes</hi> deſires, he would eſpouſe <hi>Marguerit,</hi> without demanding of the King her Brother any other Conditions, than to break off with the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> and enter into the League againſt the Common Enemy of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Legat was order'd to paſs over into <hi>France,</hi> in his return from <hi>Spain,</hi> to exhort his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty to joyn himſelf to the Confederates, tho' the Pope could not expect he would declare himſelf, againſt an Empire with which he had made Peace: the Civil Wars which diſturbed his Countries not permitting him to make ſo conſiderable an Ally his Enemy; but he thought it might be taken ill, if he was the only <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Prince, whoſe Aſſiſtance the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly See</hi> ſhould omit imploring; and at the ſame time drew a promiſe from him to undertake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96181:104"/>
againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> while their Forces were employed in the <hi>Venetians</hi> Service, 'Tis thought the <hi>French</hi> could not reſt quiet, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Spain</hi> without Troops and Defence, they would amuſe the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> by turning the brunt of their Forces on that ſide. <hi>Gaſpar de Coligny,</hi> Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> a Perſon of great Courage and Conduct, ſaw this a favourable Conjuncture for the executing thoſe great Deſigns which he had projected againſt <hi>Spain.</hi> This King anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to the Formal Sayings of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, That if the Emperor and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would enter into the League, he would alſo enter therein, as well to teſtifie the Eſteem and Conſideration he had for the Holy Father, as to follow the Zeal and Piety of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to the Church; That he would not break the Peace which was lately confirmed by a new Allyance, his Queen being Siſter to the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Kings: but as to the Marriage of <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> he was already engaged to give the Princeſs <hi>Margurita</hi> to his Couſin, the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Alexandrinus</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with great earneſtneſs this Allyance wou'd certainly tend to the Prejudice of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, by countenancing a Party in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which would certainly ruin it. He told him moreover whatſoever might render him ſenſible, of the ill conſequences of ſuch an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance. The King diſpleaſed at this Diſcourſe, taking <hi>Alexandrinus</hi> by the hand, pray, ſays he, aſſure your Unkle from me, That I give my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to a Prince, whoſe Humour and Temper I ſo well know, that I can bring him into the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96181:105"/>
Boſom of the Church when I pleaſe; That my diſcontented Subjects will be ne'r the Stronger, for having him on their ſide, and I have only this means left me to be revenged on them, for the deplorable condition wherein they have laid my Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Alexandrinus</hi> returned with theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers from <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> well ſatisfied with the Honours which he received, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Commendon</hi> was charged with a lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more tedious and laborious, by the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which detained him Two Years in <hi>Germany.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> had entruſted him with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two Affairs, the firſt to uſe the utmoſt of his Eloquence to engage the Emperor in the League; and the other, which was no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, concerned the Title of Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> with which his Holyneſs came from Honouring <hi>Coſmus de Medicis.</hi> After the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed on the Perſon of Duke <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> by his Couſin <hi>Laurence,</hi> the City of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> jealous of her Liberty, imagining ſhe could not maintain it, but under the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one Chief, choſe Young <hi>Coſmus,</hi> who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their expectations, and opened the way to Great Enterpriſes. The firſt years of his Government were traverſed by ſome Malicious and Envious Spirits, who could not endure he ſhould uſe the Counſel of ſome particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and diſpoſe of the Republicks Treaſure. The Nobility had often retired from the City, diſpleaſed at his Conduct: they often aſſembled without permiſſion, and the Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96181:105"/>
wherewith this new Soveraign had pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their Audaciouſneſs, drew on him a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War. But his application to diſſipate all theſe Intrigues, annulled the deſign of the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, and the different Conſpiracies which he happily diſcovered, ſerved only to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his Authority. Having vanquiſhed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the Rebels, he baniſh'd the reſt, or put them to Death; ſo that becoming Maſter of the reſt of the Citizens, by Favours and Preſents, they preferred an Honourable Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Riches acquired under the Peaceable Government of a Soveraign, before a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious and imaginary Liberty.</p>
                  <p>The other allyed Towns, wearyed with the Pride and Avarice of their Magiſtrates, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiſe a Monarchial Government. <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> drew inſenſibly on himſelf the whole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the People and Senate, poſſeſſed himſelf with the execution of the Laws, and left the Officers only Vain Titles and Names, without either Force or Credit, quaſht all the Liberties of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> altho' Idolaters of Independency; and in fine, inveſted himſelf with the Soveraignty.</p>
                  <p>The Exiles implored the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Peter Strozzi,</hi> one of their Patriots, a Perſon Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and Enterprizing, hoping with the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>French,</hi> to re-eſtabliſh themſelves in their Country. But the good Fortune of <hi>Coſmus</hi> diſconcerted all their Projects. He beat <hi>Stroz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi,</hi> drove him from <hi>Aetruria,</hi> poſſeſſed himſelf of the City of <hi>Sienna,</hi> a place conſiderable for its Strength and Riches, and finding his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96181:106"/>
much encreaſed by this Conqueſt, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſtinguiſh himſelf from the other <hi>Italian</hi> Princes. But Mens Ambition generally increaſing with their good Fortune, the Quality of Duke, which Uſurpers commonly take on them, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering not ſufficiently his Vanity, he reſolved to confirm by ſome Glorious Title, what he had gained by Force and cunning. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to erect his new State into a Kingdom, thinking it large enough to deſerve that Title. He thereupon endeavour'd ſeveral times at this Honour, and the <hi>Pope,</hi> who had ever refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, at length granted him ſomething like it. He had wrought himſelf into the Affections of his Holyneſs, by ſetting up Tribunals of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who already began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pread their Doctrins through <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> and at length obtained of <hi>Pius</hi> V. in the year 1570. the Title of <hi>Great Duke,</hi> which is not much Inferiour to that of a King. Coming to <hi>Rome</hi> with a Numerous and Magnificent Train, his Holyneſs ſent two Cardinals before him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with great Teſtimonies of Honour and Affection, and publickly crowned him, during the Celebration of the Sacred Myſteries. <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who pretended that <hi>Coſmus</hi> and his Eſtate depended on the Empire, reſpected this Action as an Attempt againſt his Dignity, the <hi>Holy See</hi> having no right to his Vaſſals. <hi>Coſmus de Medicis</hi> on the contrary, defended himſelf from being a Feudatory to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and thereupon <hi>Maximilian</hi> ſent Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours to <hi>Rome,</hi> to blame the <hi>Pope</hi> for what he had done. This Conteſt was like to prove of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96181:106"/>
dangerous Conſequence, and <hi>Commendon</hi> was order'd to find out expedients. He diſcuſſed in preſence of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the rights of the <hi>H. See,</hi> and Empire; ſhewing him that the Iſſue of this Quarrel might prove prejudicial to him, in the preſent Conjuncture, and explained ſo clearly the Reaſons of it, as ſoftned him in ſome meaſure, and engaged him to ſend one to <hi>Rome,</hi> to agree on ſome Expedient which might ſuit the Intereſt of both Parties, yet without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the <hi>Popes</hi> Decree. This buſineſs might have been perfectly ended, had not the Legat been obliged to paſs over with all Speed into <hi>Poland,</hi> earneſtly to oppoſe the ſecret Deſign of that King, which was to put away his Wife, <hi>Maximilian</hi>'s Siſter, and Eſpouſe a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of an ordinary Family, with whom he was extreamly in Love.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> had already tryed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Inclinations, by their Embaſſadour <hi>James Sorancio,</hi> who having diſcovered the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Imperial Majeſties Miniſters, found them not at all inclinable to the League; and when he propos'd it to <hi>Maximilian,</hi> he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That when the Truce made between him and <hi>Selim</hi> was expired, he would then conſider the Conditions offered by the Confederates; but whatſoever Inſtances <hi>Sorancio</hi> made him to know theſe Conditions, the Emperour would never talk further about it. Although this Prince was willing the War ſhould laſt, yet he was fearful of entring into an Affair, whoſe Succeſs was doubtful. The Weakneſs of his Body rendring alſo his mind leſs diſpoſed to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96181:107"/>
great Enterpriſes. Thinking himſelf unable to bear ſo heavy a Burden, nor of ſufficient Credit amongſt the Princes of the Empire, who are as much afraid of the Encroachments of their own Emperour, as of the Invaſion of the <hi>Turks.</hi> He likewiſe miſtruſted the Conſtancy of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who perhaps would leave him enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Heat of the War, expoſed to the common Enemies reſentments; beſides, being taught by his own experience, that ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies joined together, was but a Body of an ill Compoſition, whoſe efforts, by reaſon of its diſ-union, could not atchieve any great Matters.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe Duty 'twas to draw him into the League, did all he could under-hand to hinder it; ſo that the movements of the Imperial Court were meer Myſteries and Diſſimulations. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador publickly ſolicited <hi>Maximilian</hi> to engage in the League, aſſuring him of his Maſters Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Aſſiſtance to the utmoſt of Power; ſo that the Emperor reſolving to manage himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beſt manner, that he might not diſoblige the Pope nor Republick, gave all outward Signs of his readineſs to comply with the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. Affairs being in this diſpoſition, when <hi>Commendon</hi> came to <hi>Vienna,</hi> he gave <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> to underſtand his Charge was not ſo much to perſwade him to joyn with the <hi>Holy See,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> againſt the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Empire, as to aſſure him, that if he would diligently Arm himſelf, he ſhould receive from the Soveraign Prelat, whatſoever a Dutiful Son can expect from the Tenderneſs of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96181:107"/>
Father: That the deplorable ſtate of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> call'd aloud for his earneſt Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: That the <hi>Pope</hi> alarm'd at the Miſeries of <hi>Europe,</hi> had hitherto uſed fruitleſs endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to pacifie the Quarrels, and end the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes; and at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Pontificat, ſent up Fervent Prayers to God for the defence of his Church, againſt its greateſt Enemy; That his Petitions would have been undoubtedly heard, had not the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> themſelves labour'd at their own Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: That they were ſet upon by a Prince, puffed up with Pride and Vain Glory, wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Luſt and Idleneſs, yet deſigned no leſs than the Invaſion of all <hi>Italy,</hi> having firſt taken the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus</hi> from the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Tho' the <hi>Pope</hi> was perſwaded God permitted this <hi>Barbarian</hi> to form theſe great Projects on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to re-unite <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and remember them of their Duty; That the Victory was certain from a due Preparation for War by united Forces; That his Imperial Majeſty would be more advantag'd by the Defeat of the <hi>Muſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> than any other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Prince; That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Honour of Precedency before all other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, this obliged him to a more ſingular forwardneſs, his Place Empowring him more particularly to exhort <hi>Europe</hi> to a common Defence in caſe of a Vacant <hi>See;</hi> That he would not trouble him with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the loſſes which the Infidels made his Father <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſuffer, nor thoſe he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der went himſelf. That the Infidels ſetting on the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, during their Diſ-union,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96181:108"/>
found an Infallible means to ruine them, one, after another; That all the Advantages they obtained over them, ſprang from their Miſ-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; each of them ſhutting his Eyes at anothers Misfortunes, found himſelf at laſt inſenſibly overwhelmed in the Ruine of his Neighbour; That the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes had not hitherto bin in a Capacity of attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Infidels both by Sea and Land; That the <hi>Turks</hi> uſually invaded <hi>Hungary,</hi> when they undertook nothing againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> on the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> and on the contrary, left <hi>Germany</hi> at reſt, when they invaded the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Countries of the Republick: That if his Imperial Majeſty would joyn his Forces to the Confederates, as well for his own Intereſt, as the <hi>Signiories,</hi> they might with ſuch a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army, exterminate the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Nation, or at leaſt ſubdue its Pride, and curb its continual encroachments; conſidering the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet would conſiſt of Two Hundred and Fifty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and conſequently will be far ſtronger than the <hi>Turks,</hi> being Manned with Sixty Thouſand Foot, and Five Thouſand Horſe; ſo that the Emperour aſſiſted by the Forces of <hi>Germany,</hi> might ſurprize the Enemy in <hi>Hungary,</hi> lying open without defence, he might poſſeſs himſelf of it in one Campaign, and extend his Conqueſt as far as <hi>Thrace,</hi> and ſtrike <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with the Terrour of his Arms; That the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and all other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this Enterprize; and the <hi>Poles,</hi> who are a Valiant People, and ſo Strong in Horſe, would eſpouſe the common Cauſe at the <hi>Popes</hi> firſt entreaty.</p>

                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:96181:108"/>
The Legat concluded his diſcourſe with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding the Emperor, that if he let ſlip this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity, which ſeem'd to be offer'd by Heaven it ſelf, it muſt be thought the Divine Wrath has blinded the Eyes and hardned the Hearts of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperor gave a fair hearing to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendon</hi>'s Diſcourſe, but wanting Courage and Prudence to declare himſelf for the League, he required further time for Conſideration, and then returned Anſwer in Writing. He acknowledged no Prince more intereſs'd than himſelf in the Deſtruction of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; ſo that he muſt paſſionately deſire it, receiving ſuch continual Alarms from their Neighbourhood, but he could not exerciſe any Act of Hoſtility, againſt ſo Potent an Enemy, with whom he had lately made a Truce, the obſervation of which was confirmed by Oath. That his being more expoſed to the Injuſtice of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he muſt be forced on other meaſures, than the reſt of the Confederates; and would therefore ſee firſt what the King of <hi>Poland</hi> would do, and the other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, who had not yet declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Legat anſwered, this Method was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly contrary to that which ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, inasmuch as thoſe who were moſt mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and ready to be ſwallowed up, ſhould ſhew themſelves an example to others, whoſe States being farther diſtant, were leaſt in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. That if he any longer delayed to animate his Subjects by a Speedy and Generous Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96181:109"/>
he wouldrender indifferent the greateſt part of thoſe who were wavering in their choice on what ſide to incline; and when he ſhall ſollicit the <hi>Polanders,</hi> and other Neighbouring Princes in quality of a Legat, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of him, how he found the Emperor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and what Troops he had raiſed for that Deſign; ſhould he anſwer his Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty intends to take his reſolutions from theirs, 'twill be eaſily perceived how fruitleſs his Embaſſie has been to him; That none of the <hi>Northern</hi> Princes will take Arms, as long as they ſee the States of the Empire look on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned; It being alſo certain, when the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhall ſee themſelves cut off from all hopes from the Empire, and ſorced to decide the Controverſie by a Naval Combat, they will not ſuſtain this Burden with the ſame Reſolution they ſhewed at firſt; ſo that unleſs the Emperor gives ſome Diverſion to the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Forces on the ſide of <hi>Hungary,</hi> their Army will not be able to hold out long againſt the <hi>Grand Signiors,</hi> but muſt lay aſide all hopes, and ſhamefully break that Allyance which ſerves as a Buckler to all <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and as to the Truce, he need not endeavour an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Scruples about that, ſeeing the Emperor himſelf had complained in ſeveral Diets, that its Articles were not obſerved by the Infidels, who kept their Word no longer than it held with their advantage, and broke their Oaths by Incurſions and Seizures of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places in <hi>Hungary;</hi> That his Character of Legat obliged him to give an account to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96181:109"/>
his Holyneſs of the Conferences held with his Imperial Majeſty, and therefore entreated him to conſider how the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> would be affected, when they knew his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, beſeeching him withal to take care leſt he repented of his Indifferency, when the miſchiefs were paſt remedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maximilian</hi> being full of Trouble and Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, leſt <hi>Commendon</hi> ſhould ſend advice, to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> of what paſt betwixt them, which would be a means to cool the Zeal of the Confederates; demanded of him ſome days time to deliberate, further on that Affair. The Perplexity wherein his waveringneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him, the fear of engaging in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous War, or occaſion the breaking the League, and the Inſtant Exhortations of the Legat, gave his mind no quiet Night nor Day. He wrote the next morning betimes a Note to the Legat, who imparted the ſame to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Hiſtory, containing exactly theſe Words. The Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> to Cardinal <hi>Commendon. I have not ſlept ſince the Conference which you and I had Yeſterday, ſo ſenſible am I of the Reaſons you offered me: the Affair we treated on, I know requires ſpeedy Anſwer, and therefore intend, with Gods Aſſiſtance, to come to ſuch a reſolution, as will content his Holyneſs. But I entreat you by the Friendſhip betwixt us, not to ſend as yet any poſitive Meſſage to</hi> Rome, <hi>till we have had another meeting, which I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſhall be within two days at furtheſt. And therefore pray think not this delay long.</hi>
                  </p>

He ſent for the Legat three days after, and promis'd whatſoever his Holyneſs could deſire from him, but on condition the Allys would ſend him Troops to prevent Surpriſes from the <hi>Turks,</hi> who might perhaps in their Reſentments turn their whole Force on him; in which caſe he muſt be aſſured of this Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, before he could publickly declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Favour of the League; and withal muſt know with what number of Horſe and Foot the Confederates could aſſiſt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commendon</hi> anſwered him, he might aſſure himſelf of a conſiderable ſupply, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it according to his own mind. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>Maximilian</hi> ſaid the Confederates muſt conſider what Detachments they could ſpare from their Army. You will fall into your firſt unreſolvedneſs (replyed the Legat) if you ſtick at ſo ſmall a matter, and 'twill be thought you ſeek new Pretences to avoid engaging your ſelf; for before the Allys can communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this Affair to each other, and the Reſult of their Deliberations be known, conſidering the diſtances of the places, and length of time which ſuch a Negotiation required, more than half of the Year will be loſt; and your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, who knows better than the Allys, what Forces you need, may obtain what you deſire at the firſt Propoſal. The Emperor having awhile longer held out, on this Article ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf to the Legats Reaſons, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, provided he were aſſiſted with Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand Foot, and Four Thouſand Horſe, one half of which ſhould conſiſt of <hi>Germans,</hi>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:96181:110"/>
to joyn his Forces, he would attack the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and give a great diverſion to them on that ſide.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as <hi>Commendon</hi> drew this Aſſurance from him, he gave advice thereof to the <hi>Pope,</hi> by an expreſs <hi>Courier,</hi> together with a full and particular account of this Negotiation. He afterwards went into <hi>Poland,</hi> not only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> to enter into the League, but to diſſwade him from the unjuſt and violent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of putting away his Wife.</p>
                  <p>The Legat ſpeedily paſſed over <hi>Moravia,</hi> and <hi>Sileſia,</hi> notwithſtanding the rigor of the Cold, and incommodiouſneſs of the Snows of that Country. He found this poor Prince beſotted with the Love of this forementioned Woman, his mind being ſo entirely poſſeſſed by this furious Paſſion, as left no room for thought of buſineſs. He endeavour'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the Project of a Divorce, remitting the execution of this Deſign, when the Legat ſhould be gone. But <hi>Commendon</hi> by his inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Carriage, had ſo greatly inſinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the affections of the <hi>Polanders,</hi> that he became acquainted with the whole Intrigue, and the Methods laid by the King to effect this Separation. The Cardinal therefore made a Diſcourſe to him on the Excellency and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Marriage, the Holyneſs and Indiſſolvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the Conjugal Union amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and ſhewed him plainly he could not break his Vow to the Queen, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring himſelf, and engaging in a Cruel War with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:96181:111"/>
The King appeared ſufficiently convinced by the Cardinals Reaſons; but his Paſſion would no queſtion have prevailed, had not the death of the Queen, which immediately happened, prevented that grievious Scandal. For ſhe ſeeing her ſelf ſlighted, and driven from her Husbands Bed, for the avoiding other affronts, left <hi>Poland,</hi> under pretence of viſiting her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. She ſtaid a while at <hi>Lintz,</hi> a City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Arch Duke</hi> her Brother, where ſhe dyed with Regret and Sorrow.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Poland,</hi> being ſolicited to joyn himſelf with the Confederates, remitted this Affair to the <hi>Dyet,</hi> which was then held, to lay, by this means, on this Honorable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly the ſhame he had to refuſe the gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Holyneſs's juſt Deſires. The <hi>Walaques,</hi> a People bordering on <hi>Poland,</hi> and Tributary to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> had driven away their King and ſet up another in his place, upheld by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Grand Signior. Bogdan</hi> the former King had recourſe to the <hi>Polanders,</hi> who lending their Aſſiſtance to his Re-eſtabliſhment in the Throne, diſoblig'd the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> which affair gave no ſmall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance to <hi>Sigiſmond;</hi> who was not for War, tho' the greateſt part of the Senate were. The chiefeſt of the Nobility, with whom <hi>Commendon</hi> was much in favour, ſought by Arms to encreaſe and uphold their Credit, and therefore zealouſly promoted his Demand. The buſineſs began to be in a fair way, when the Kings Sickneſs put a ſtop to the Concluſion of it. For <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> having no Children nor
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96181:111"/>
Heirs of his Name, the Senate and Great Lords laid aſide all affairs, the better to attend to the Future Election. <hi>Commendon</hi> alſo was not behind hand in his Care about this matter, as fearing leſt ſome <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince, by great Sums of Money might prevail with the Senate, and People, to chuſe him for their King. But <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> without any reaſon offer'd, than his bare Will, diſmiſt the <hi>Dyet,</hi> and cauſed himſelf to be carryed to <hi>Chimieſchi,</hi> a Frontier Town of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> where his exceſſive Paſſion conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably encreas'd his Indiſpoſition. He drove away his Phyſitians, placing his only Confidence in an Old Witch, who promis'd to cure him by Virtue of her Enchantments. But he dyed within a few days, and the Great People of the Kingdom not being any of them able to pretend to the Election; engaged themſelves in ſeveral Intereſts to obtain by their Suffrages, his Favour who ſhould be choſen King. The <hi>Interregnum</hi> laſted a whole year, and the Eſtates aſſembled at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> Elected in fine <hi>Henry Duke</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> Brother to <hi>Charles</hi> IX. King of <hi>France;</hi> This ſurpriſing Diverſity of Affairs, long retained Cardinal <hi>Commendon</hi> in <hi>Poland.</hi>

                  <p>Whilſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> loſt time in Diſputing each Article, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet deſolated the Iſland, and ravaged all the Coaſts of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> State. <hi>Hali</hi> parted from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the beginning of the Spring, with fourſcore Gallies, and other Veſſels laden with Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and freſh Men to fill up the places of thoſe that dyed.

other Veſſels under the command of <hi>Muſtapha;</hi> who lay before <hi>Famaguſta.</hi> He afterwards ſet Sail with the remaing Forces for the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and paſſing by <hi>Candia,</hi> he came and caſt Anchor at <hi>Nigrepont,</hi> called heretofore the Iſle of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boe,</hi> where the <hi>Baſſa Partau</hi> was already ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd with all his Fleet.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Louchali</hi> Cruiſed with fifty Gallys, on the Coaſts of the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of the Iſle, where he landed ſome men, who waſted the Country for a great Space; chance favour'd the Valour and Diligence of him, who was ſent out on this Expedition. <hi>Retimo,</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Town, and well Peopled, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Garriſon, and ill fortified, lay open to the leaſt Inſults. <hi>Barochi, Sacredo,</hi> and <hi>Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani</hi> her Magiſtrates, on the rumour of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Enemies at <hi>Negrepont,</hi> were ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent with <hi>Marinus Caballo Providitor</hi> to ſend them at leaſt Five hundred Men, to encourage
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96181:113"/>
the Inhabitants, and defend themſelves from Surpriſe. But <hi>Caballo</hi> refuſed them, leſt by this means he might weaken the Garriſon of <hi>Gandia,</hi> whereon depended the conſervation of the reſt of the Iſland. Thoſe of <hi>Retimo,</hi> whom the march of the Infidels fill'd with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, were ſeized with ſuch a Trembling at the hearing of the Enemies being at <hi>Suda,</hi> that taking care only of their Lives and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milys, they forſook the Town without minding their Eſtates, and gain'd in great haſt the Mountains, and other places of Retreat, it not being in the Magiſtrates Power to hinder them; who ſeeing this, cauſed the Treaſure to be caſt into a Deep Well, and the Publick Regiſters exported out of the Town, and thus left it. <hi>Louchali</hi> drew near it with a deſign of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing at the leaſt Reſiſtance, intending only the Alarming of the Inhabitants, but finding it forſaken, he gave the plundering of it to his Soldiers, who being laden with Booty, burnt it, with whatſoever they could not carry along with them. 'Tis ſaid the Infidel cauſed what was taken from an Old Woman, to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her, who was the only Perſon left in the Place, and commanded her in a joke for all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements, to thank his Countrymen for the Booty they had left his Army, and thus returned enrich'd to his Fleet.</p>
                  <p>The Pillage of the Country and Deſolation of <hi>Retimo,</hi> ſerved for a Pretence to the Revolt of ſome Peaſants; who being diſcontented at the rigorous uſage which was ſhewed them in the Impoſition of the heavy Taxes on them,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96181:113"/>
and forcing them to ſerve the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallys, were reſolved to make advantage of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Iſle, believing this a favourable conjuncture for the caſting off the Yoak which they long intended. And in Effect, had the <hi>Barbarians</hi> remained any conſiderable time in <hi>Candia,</hi> and the male-contents declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Iſle would have bin abſolutely loſt. Theſe Peaſants not being able any longer to contain themſelves, got together in great numbers, on occaſion of a Prieſt whom a young Gentleman had beaten. They thereon took Arms, broke into, and plundred this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Houſe, and murthered him and his whole Family. Which Action having encreaſed their Boldneſs, they fell on the Nobility, and made a great Slaughter of them, pillaged their Eſtates, and ſhared the Booty between them, as if they had obtained the law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ul Poſſeſſion of it by right of Arms. They wrote at the ſame time to <hi>Perteau,</hi> entreating him to take them under his Protection, but he who had the charge of carrying their Meſſage, on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn relating this <hi>Baſſa's</hi> departure from <hi>Suda,</hi> the Remorſe and fear of Puniſhment diſſipated this multitude, ſeveral of them returned into their Houſes, and others offer'd the <hi>Providi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> to take a new Oath of Fidelity, deſiring Pardon for their Fault. <hi>Caballo</hi> was the more inclin'd to grant it, as apprehending the Conſequence of ſo dangerous an Emmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But when he underſtood the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had weighed Anchor, he ſent a thouſand Foot againſt theſe Rebels, under the command
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96181:114"/>
of <hi>Peter Avogaro,</hi> to whom was joyned <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Calergio,</hi> followed by a great number of Friends and Domeſtic's. <hi>Avogaro</hi> diſarmed theſe Mutinous People, and made them Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, ſeveral of which were condemned to dye, and more to the Gallys.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> at their departure from <hi>Suda,</hi> drew near a place called <hi>Turluro,</hi> to alarm thoſe of <hi>Canea,</hi> but were ſurprized by a Tempeſt wherein they loſt Three Gallys, and nine others had like to incurred the ſame Fate. They put off from <hi>Candia</hi> to make a deſcent into <hi>Serigo,</hi> and waſted the Country round about, without offering to attack the Town. They afterwards ſteer'd their Courſe toward <hi>Zant,</hi> where they alſo landed ſome Men; but <hi>Perteau</hi> ſeeing the Inhabitants retired into the Caſtle, and bent on a Reſolute Defence, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his Choler on the Trees and Houſes.</p>
                  <p>He cut down all the Vines with which this Iſle is every where planted, and burnt ſuch a Prodigious quantity of Veſſels, that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were at a great loſs where to beſtow the next year their Wines. From <hi>Zant</hi> he came to <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> the Territory of which is far more extenſive and Fruitful. Where the <hi>Barbarians</hi> made a great Multitude of Slaves, Drove away a prodigious number of Cattle, and thence parted to <hi>Corfou. Lewis Gorgio,</hi> and <hi>Francis Cornelio,</hi> to whom the care of this Iſle was committed, had prevented <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,</hi> by a deligent Preparation, on ſuppoſal they ſhould be attackt. They cauſed all the Corn in the Fields to be haſtily tranſported in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the City. ſo that that the <hi>Turks</hi> finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Pillage, revenged themſelves on the Trees with Fire and Sword. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Soldiers not daring to ſet upon them in the open Field, laid Ambuſhes for them, and kill'd ſeveral who were ſtraying in ſearch of Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; The Commanders were informed by ſome Priſoners they took, that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had no deſign of beſieging their Town, being well fortified; and in effect they ſoon ſet Sayl for <hi>Supoto.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> had poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this place at the beginning of the War with as great Dexterity as Valour; and <hi>Manlio,</hi> by whoſe advice it was attacked, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the care of keeping it, when 'twas taken. The <hi>Italian</hi> Garriſon being diſmayed at the Arrival of ſo formidable an Army, ſlipt out at a private Gate, and abandoned the place with more Cowardiſe than the <hi>Turks</hi> had one before them, leaving their Commander to the Mercy of a Cruel and Spightful Enemy: Yet <hi>Manlio</hi> defended himſelf with thoſe few Men that ſtaid with him to the laſt Extremity, more edged by deſpair than hope of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but at length was forced to yield the place, and himſelf a Priſoner.</p>
                  <p>The War laſting all the Winter in <hi>Iliria,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> theſe Provinces were over-run with the Enemies Troops at the beginning of the Spring; and the Inhabitants of <hi>Zebenico</hi> who had no Mills about their Town, ſuffered great Inconveniencies for want of Flower. <hi>Hemolaus Tipoli,</hi> who commanded four Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys along this Coaſt, attacked, during the

Night, an ancient place near <hi>Zebenico</hi> call'd <hi>Scardona,</hi> kept by a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Garriſon, which held the Country in Subjection. <hi>Hermolaus</hi> having taken and burnt this place, did thereby lay open a way to thoſe of <hi>Zebenico</hi> for the grinding their Corn. He held afterwards four of the Enemies Veſſels, as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, who retiring up the River of <hi>Narante,</hi> ſet upon all the Barks which appeared in thoſe parts. <hi>Tipoli</hi> having given them Chaſe, they made to Shore, and landed a thouſand Men, who immediately oppoſed the <hi>Venetians</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to their Veſſels, but their Cannon forced them to leave them, and <hi>Tipoli</hi> having taken out thence whatſoever was valuable, burnt them. The <hi>Venetians</hi> at the ſame time met with an happy opportunity, but the ſmall Diligence and Vigour they uſed in effecting the Enterprize, ſpoiled the Succeſs of it.</p>
                  <p>There were ſome Perſons ſent privately by the <hi>Turks</hi> to <hi>Alexander Donati</hi> Governour of <hi>Antivari,</hi> who were conducted out of the place by ſome <hi>Epirots,</hi> that perſwaded them by the way to deliver <hi>Scutari,</hi> a Town well fortified, and the Capital of the Province.

The Senate judging it expedient to follow this advice,

ſent him eight hundred Men, commanded by <hi>Annibal Emiliani</hi> of <hi>Forli,</hi> with order not to undertake any thing, without the participation of <hi>Zachari Solomoni</hi> Magiſtrate of <hi>Cata<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Donati</hi> vext that he muſt ſhare the Honour of this Enterprize, obeyed with an ill will, and kept the matter no longer as a Secret; ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> having notice of it, puniſht the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors with the greateſt Severity, and more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guarded the place. The <hi>Venetians</hi> hoping to ſubject all <hi>Epirus,</hi> ordered <hi>James Malateſte</hi> to march to <hi>Cataro</hi> with Four Thouſand Foot. This place, beſides the Plague with which it was afflicted, had underwent all the Calamity of War, and the Infidels thought to have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized it by the Treaſon of a <hi>Sicilian</hi> Captain, who was to deliver them a Gate, the keeping of which was committed to him. <hi>Salamoni</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd this Plot, ſaved the Town, and cauſed the <hi>Sicilian</hi> to be ſtrangled; who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hang'd by one Foot, on the outſide of the Walls. But the Deſigns on <hi>Epirus</hi> met with very unfortunate ſucceſs, and proved greatly diſ-advantagious to the State. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels becoming Maſters of a Village about two hundred Paces from <hi>Kataro; Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſte</hi> wanting Experience, and not being able to ſmother his Reſentments, thought he was bound in Honour to drive the Enemies from a Poſt, which was won in his Sight, and whoſe Neighbourhood incommodated the Town; and ſeeing no likelyhood of attacking them that Day, he prepared himſelf the next morning, and being informed of the place of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96181:116"/>
he ſent one Party before him by Land, and himſelf went on board a Gally with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of choice Men.</p>
                  <p>He made ſure of a Riſing Ground near the <hi>Bourg,</hi> in which they had paſſed over the Night, and whence they diſlodged at the firſt news of his March. <hi>Malateſte</hi> pillaged and burnt this Village, enraged that he had miſt his blow. But the Infidels, who ſent at the ſame time for Aſſiſtance in all the Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Parts depending on the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> ſpeedily gathered a conſiderable Body, charged <hi>Malateſte</hi> from a higher part of the riſing ground of which he had poſſeſſed himſelf, row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down great Stones on his Men, and over-whelmed them in a Tempeſt of Darts and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. This Surprize, together with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagiouſneſs of the place, having diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited them, <hi>Malateſte</hi> uſed his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make them keep ſome order, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Enemy alone with too great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had his Thigh broke with the blow of a Stone, and was made Priſoner. The <hi>Turks</hi> carryed him to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he could not obtain his Liberty, till after two years Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and then was releaſed at the Interceſſion of the King of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>This Misfortune ruined the Affairs of the <hi>Venetians</hi> in <hi>Epirus,</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> alarm'd at the danger with which <hi>Scutari</hi> had been threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Revolt of ſome of the Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring People; ſent a conſiderable Army of Horſe and Foot under the Command of <hi>Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat,</hi> to keep this Province in its Duty. This
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96181:116"/>
                     <hi>Baſſa</hi> drove the <hi>Epirots</hi> out of the Field, who had taken part with the Republick; and forced them, after ſeveral Combats, to ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up in <hi>Dulcino;</hi> where <hi>Achomat</hi> beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them with his whole Army. He batter'd the place ſeveral days with his Cannon; threw down the Walls, and gave divers Aſſaults, whence his People were continually repulſed by the vigorous reſiſtance of the Beſieged; who ſeconded the Scituation of the place. 'Twas a Scraggy Rock ſurrounded by the Sea, except a ſpace of Land, which ſerves for an Avenue, and which part was the moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortified. <hi>Caracoſſa</hi> having taken thirteen Gallies, approached <hi>Dulcino,</hi> to acquaint the Inhabitants, that they were no leſs in danger from the Sea than the Land. This threatning ſo diſmayed them, that they had ſet open their Gates to the Infidels, had not <hi>Tipoly</hi> and <hi>Sora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> obliged <hi>Sciara</hi> and <hi>Martinengo, Malateſte</hi>'s Succeſſors, to get into the place, with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement of Five Hundred Men, which he had led to <hi>Cataro. Martinengo</hi> no ſooner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the ill condition of the place, but ſent word to the Senate, he would leave it, if he were not ſuccour'd in three days. <hi>Perteau,</hi> who left <hi>Supoto,</hi> arrived hereupon with all the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army; ſo that the Beſieged having no hope of Aſſiſtance, ſurrendred, on condition the Citizens ſhould only take an Oath of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and the Garriſon march out with their Arms and Baggage. But this Treaty was executed according to the uſual Faith of theſe <hi>Barbarians:</hi> For <hi>Achomat</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96181:117"/>
it ill the place ſhould be yielded to <hi>Perteau,</hi> and not to him, who firſt beſieged it; when he was entred, fell to Plundring it. <hi>Perteau,</hi> who was no more exact to his Word, laid all the Soldiers in Chains, excepting <hi>Martinengo, Venieri, Podeſtat</hi> of the Town, and ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, whom he permitted to depart, having firſt taken away their Arms and Equipage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dolcino</hi> being taken and ſackt, the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's</hi> Fleet went to caſt Anchor over againſt <hi>Antivari;</hi> a City built on a riſing ground, in the midſt of a Plain within Three Miles of the Sea, ſufficiently fortified by its natural Situation, as well as Walls. The Valour and good Diſpoſition of the Inhabitants would have defended the place better than its Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But <hi>Emiliani</hi> and <hi>Donai,</hi> who were to ſuſtain the Siege, were ſo much at variance, that they made uſe of their Authority to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to the Conqueror; the Effects of whoſe Perfidiouſneſs was ſufficiently felt by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Garriſon. The Soldiers were put to the Chain, and as many Citizens as were found retiring with their Goods (according to the Articles of the Treaty) were taken and ſold for Slaves. <hi>Perteau</hi> cauſed the Archbiſhop of the place to be cruelly murthered, a Perſon, whoſe Singular Piety cannot be ſufficiently commended: He permitted the two Traytors to retire where they pleaſed. But they ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht, and ſecured themſelves by a Voluntary Exi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e from the Puniſhment due to ſo infamous an Action. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> left a moderate Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the place at his departure, and raſed the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96181:117"/>
Caſtle of <hi>Piſani</hi> down to the Ground. He dealt in like manner with the Town of <hi>Budua,</hi> which its Inhabitants had deſerted; and afterwards returned to his former poſt, to retake <hi>Cataro.</hi> He had ſent an <hi>Epirot,</hi> taken Priſoner at <hi>Dulcino,</hi> whom he uſed as his Kinſman (being both of of the ſame Country) to exhort the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Surrender. He was enjoined to aſſure him, that in caſe he yielded to his deſires, the Garriſon ſhould march out with their Baggage, and the Inhabitants enjoy an entire freedom from all Impoſitions; but if they deſigned to hold out a Siege, they ſhould certainly be put to the Sword. <hi>Barbaro,</hi> for thus was this <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot</hi> Priſoner call'd, having offer'd his Propoſals in the hearing of the Citizens and Soldiers, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomoni</hi> anſwered in the name of the Town, That the Republick having committed to him the keeping of it, he would rather periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the Inhabitants, than fail in his duty. In the mean time <hi>Perteau</hi> advanced up the <hi>Gulph</hi> of <hi>Cataro,</hi> thinking the Misfortune of <hi>Antivari</hi> and <hi>Dulcino</hi> would diſhearten the <hi>Catarians,</hi> and make them comply with his Offers. But being informed of their Generous Anſwer, he imagin'd <hi>Barbaro</hi> had ill acquitted himſelf of his charge, and therefore cauſed him to be laid in Irons. The Fleet continued their Courſe, and caſt Anchor under <hi>Caſtel-Novo,</hi> to deliberate maturely on this important Enterprize. The Garriſon of this laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned place paſſionately deſired the taking of <hi>Cataro,</hi> confidently affirming the Siege could not be either long or difficult. But <hi>Perteau,</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:96181:118"/>
who miſtruſted the Succeſs, wiſely conſider'd he might ſet himſelf more back in <hi>Selims</hi> favour, by a diſappointment in his Deſign, than he could advance himſelf in the accompliſhing it; and therefore declared, his chief buſineſs was to find out the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet, and engage 'em: and as to the Siege, it muſt be deferred till the next Spring.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the <hi>Turks</hi> remained in this Road, <hi>Louchali</hi> and <hi>Caracoſſa</hi> with part of the Gallies, went to inſult over the <hi>Venetian</hi> Iſlands. But <hi>Curſolari,</hi> which lay moſt expoſed to danger, was preſerved by an Adventure worth admiring. <hi>Antony Balbo</hi> its Governour, more faint hearted and timerous than a Woman, fled the ſame Night the News came of the arrival of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet, and was followed immediately by the Men Inhabitants. Their Wives being left alone in the Town, ſhut the Gates, and by the Counſel of a Prieſt, called <hi>Antonio Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cono</hi> (who had endeavour'd to retain the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Citizens) they put on the Cloaths, and took the Arms of their Husbands, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Walls, and thus ſtood in the poſture of People, reſolutely determin'd on a Couragious Defence. This Stratagem was ſeconded by a Singular Accident; for one of theſe Women ſeeing the Enemies Gallies drawing near the Walls, boldly put fire to one of theſe Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, pointed by chance directly againſt the Fleet. The Shot was ſo fortunate, that it ſtruck down one of the Maſts of their Gallies; and the Infidels ſuppoſing the Garriſon were very bold and numerous, retired without lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:96181:118"/>
The Senate was ſo pleaſed with this Action, that when after the War, the Inhabitants of <hi>Curſolari,</hi> preſs'd by Scarcity, had recourſe to their Liberality; 'Twas anſwered, They had not ſo well ſerved their Country nor the State, to deſerve ſuch a Favour, and muſt preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Wives Names, to whom they were indebted for their Safety. The <hi>Turks</hi> advanced as far as the Iſle of <hi>Leſina,</hi> where they landed, and Pillaged the Country; forced the Town and burnt it; the Old People of it were murthered, with all others that were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Service, and the reſt made Slaves. Theſe <hi>Pyrats</hi> rejoined <hi>Perteau,</hi> who no ſooner had ſet Sayl, but he received orders from the <hi>Sultan</hi> to beſiege <hi>Cataro.</hi> But he returned anſwer to his Highneſs, That this Expedition muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be put off to a more commodious Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſteered his Courſe thereupon to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fou.</hi> Where he landed in Perſon with Eight Thouſand Foot and Four Hundred Horſe taken out of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and charging the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who raſhly oppoſed his deſcent, he beat them, and made them retire into the Town. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards made himſelf Maſter of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, which he burnt, as if he intended a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Siege. But the Cannon from the Caſtle, which kill'd him ſeveral People, forced him to retire. He cauſed the Fields to be waſted, the Trees to be cut down, and returned to his Veſſels without any advantage from ſo great a Devaſtation. This <hi>Baſſa</hi> being too well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of the ill Condition of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, tarryed thirteeen days longer before <hi>Corfou,</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:96181:119"/>
without undertaking any thing further, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of News from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with as great aſſurance, as if he had rode in the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Ports; which was no ſmall Grief to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> conſidering how eaſie this <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> might have been attacked and routed, had their Fleets bin out with the ſame Diligence, and good Agreement.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> Celebrated with great Joy, the Concluſion of the League, in the preſence of the Foreign Miniſters. But if this Union encreaſed the Courage and Hopes of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> the main difficulty lay in raiſing of Money, to carry on theſe great Preparations. After ſeveral Aſſemblies of the Senate, the Reſult of their Debates was divided, touching the manner of exacting Contributions from the aſſociated Cities. Some were for levying a tenth part on all the Fruits of the Country. Others, That every one ſhould pay proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to the quantity of Acres he held; which laſt advice was followed.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as this Tax was publiſhed, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſo greatly ſet againſt it, that all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, Fairs and Markets rung with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. One Town exhorted another not to ſuffer ſo grievous an Impoſition, which would ſoon be followed by others more intollerable. 'Twas every day ſpread about in all places, that new ways were deviſed to impoveriſh the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated Cities; That theſe Impoſitions had no Preſident; That whatſoever the Earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced was laden with Tribute; That no Commodities were free; That Seamen were
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96181:119"/>
preſs'd from the aſſociated Towns, contrary to their Rights and Priviledges; That ſo great a number of them were raiſed, that the Fields lay waſt, and ſuch as remained within, were overburdened with Taxes; That endeavours were uſed to render them uncapable of ever raiſing themſelves from theſe Miſeries, whilſt the Chief Magiſtrates lived in Luxury and Wantonneſs on what they had unjuſtly taken from their poor Families; maintaining in this manner their Rapine and Avarice, under a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a War, wherein only <hi>Venice</hi> was inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted; That before the laſt drop of Blood was drawn out of their Veins, the Senators would do well to open their Coffers; That ſuch a grievance was not to be endured, but openly and univerſally proteſted againſt, by which means the Senate would be forced on more moderate Counſels. Some of thoſe who were moſt notorious for theſe Complaints, were puniſht for their Inſolency; but 'twas not judged fitting to paſs further, till the Deputy of each Town were heard. The Senate ſeeing the City filled with theſe Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, order'd them to make their Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces apart. Their Harangues were all different, ſome affirmed an inhability to contribute in any ſort to new Impoſitions, having much ado to acquit themſelves of the old. Others reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſome Diminution; but all in general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Decree. The Magiſtrates were ſtrangely ſurprized at ſo preciſe and general a Refuſal. 'Twas impoſſible to make War with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mony; and ſufficient Supplies could not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96181:120"/>
be had without extraordinary Levies, and it highly concerned the Senate's Authority not to revoke a Decree of that Nature. This Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair having bin long agitated, 'twas thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to encline to moderation, to prevent any Sedition; and the diſcontented Towns putting themſelves under the Protection of ſome Neighbouring Prince. The Senate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then annulled their Decree; all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties were order'd to be in the Palace; where they were told, That the Decree they complain'd of was made by meer neceſſity, the Senate being very ſenſible of its Rigour and Severity; That they had voluntarily revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it, being ſatisfied with their Zeal and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; That this Condeſcenſion ſhould oblige them to aſſiſt the Republick, according to their utmoſt Power; That the State expected no leſs an acknowledgment for the fifty years Peace which ſhe had procured them; That 'twas fitting thoſe amongſt them, whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries lay neareſt the Sea Coaſts, ſhould contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute moſt, as being in greateſt danger; That 'twas abſolutely neceſſary to provide for a great Army, or reſolve on yielding to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and perhaps become Slaves and Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Venice,</hi> wherein reſides the Soveraign Authority, would contribute firſt; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates freely ſubmitting themſelves to the Execution of their own Laws; That if they conſider'd the weight of the Burden they had to bear, they muſt alſo conſider the Enemy they had to deal with, who without any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96181:120"/>
on their parts, forced them againſt their Wills on theſe defenſive Preparations. This Diſcourſe ſo appeaſed the Deputies Minds, that they conſented to a levy of Poll-Mony, amounting to more than three hundred Thouſand Crowns a Year whilſt the War ſhould laſt.</p>
                  <p>This Talk being over, <hi>Venice</hi> was vexed with another trouble worſe than the former. There were every day Reports ſpread of the Progreſs of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Iſlands, That having Pillaged <hi>Candia, Zant,</hi> and <hi>Cep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halonia,</hi> they would exerciſe the ſame Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in other places, and come with a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army to attack the chief City. Although her Situation ſecured her from a Surprizal, yet the ſlowneſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred alſo the other Confederates, obliged them to ſtand on their Guard. They feared leſt the Populacy, affrighted at the ſight of the Infidels, and ſtruck with ſome panick terrour, ſhould forſake their uſual Traffick, and leave the Town in diſorder and Confuſion. The Magiſtrates to prevent ſo great a Miſchief, reſolved to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie themſelves on the ſide of the Sea: for <hi>Venice</hi> is ſo Situated amongſt ſmall Iſles, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Continent by the Waters flowing in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> that there's no going on Shoar to her but in ſmall Barks, whoſe prodigious number fills the Channels, which paſs through the midſt of the greateſt Streets. Great Veſſels can come near her only in one place, and neither dare they enter without the guidance of ſome Skillful Pylot of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the continual agitation of the Waves
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96181:121"/>
making this Paſſage uncertain and difficult. Two well built Caſtles form and defend the Entrance of the Port, which is ſhut up by a great Iron Chain, faſtned from one Fort to the other. There came Three Gallies from <hi>Pola</hi> well Armed, which rode at Anchor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Port, and three great Veſſels over againſt a place called <hi>Malamocque,</hi> in as good a Condition as the Galeaſſes. The Continent was fortified with Trenches, Forts, and Walls, which Works were defended by ſeveral great Pieces of Cannon, drawn from the Magazins of the Arſenal; wherein were placed ten Thouſand Foot, raiſed in the Cities, obliged to furniſh them with Militia, with what Horſe they could get beſides. <hi>Julius Savorniani,</hi> in whoſe Ability the Senate put much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, was ſent for from <hi>Zara</hi> to take care of this Work, and named General of this little Army. <hi>Vincient Moroſini</hi> who was choſen Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, had Co-adjutors, <hi>Lewis Grimani, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Buono, Andrew Bernardi, Laurence So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancto, Mark Juſtinian,</hi> and <hi>Francis Michaeli.</hi> The <hi>Venetian's</hi> Application to this new Work, made their Strength miſtruſted, and in effect it might be ſaid, conſidering theſe Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, That the Infidels were already Maſters of the whole State, and that now they had only their Capital City left to preſerve.</p>
                  <p>The reſtleſsneſs of the <hi>Venetians</hi> was encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the News of the taking of <hi>Famaguſta;</hi> and the Republick having from thence forward no other Support than her Sea Forces, all her hopes lay in the Deciſion of a Combat. This
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96181:121"/>
News being found falſe and without grounds, the City began to re-aſſure her ſelf. But this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port proved ominous, and preſaged the Miſery which ſoon after happened. <hi>Zani</hi> had ordered <hi>Peter Troni</hi> the laſt Summer to load four Veſſels at <hi>Candia</hi> with Proviſions and Soldiers, and carry them to <hi>Famaguſta. Troni</hi> dyed in the mean time, and <hi>Mark Antony Quirini</hi> was put in his place. Who fruitleſly ſpending the time, till the end of the year in the Port of <hi>Candia,</hi> there was another Officer choſen for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this Enterprize, called alſo <hi>Quirini,</hi> and Sirnamed <hi>Stenta,</hi> who took as many Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as he thought requiſite for this Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He ſet Sayl on the Thirteenth of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> and came within ſight of <hi>Famaguſta</hi> after ten days ſetting out. The Enemy had left ſix Gallies near enough the place to defend the Entrance of the Port from the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. <hi>Quirini,</hi> who had twelve very well equipt, ſent before the Veſſels which were laden with Ammunition and Proviſions to draw the Infidels out to fight, and endeavour'd in following them to conceal his courſe. The <hi>Turks</hi> no ſooner ſaw them, but they made out after them with full Sayl. But the twelve <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies, which appeared immediately made them get to Land, where they diſ-imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked their Cannon, and retrenched themſelves on the Shoar. <hi>Quirini,</hi> who purſued them, ſunk two of their Gallies, the four others eſcaping by means of the Night, whilſt <hi>Quirini</hi> was endeavouring to put his Succours into the Town. He went the next morning in ſearch
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96181:122"/>
of them, and fell on one of thoſe great Veſſels which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Mahones,</hi> which ſet out from a part of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> carrying Cloaths for the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army, and three hundred <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> who did not ſurrender till after a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Fight. <hi>Quirini</hi> moreover took a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel, which the <hi>Turks</hi> conſtrained to part from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to carry Ammunition to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus.</hi> The Governour of <hi>Damas</hi> was in this Veſſel with two hundred Soldiers. He got out in a ſmall Boat to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet; and his Men were put to the Chain. <hi>Quirini</hi> entring <hi>Famaguſta</hi> with ſuch glorious Spoils, aſſured the Garriſon of a more conſiderable aſſiſtance than that which he then brought them, and thus returned to <hi>Candia</hi> as happily as he ſet ſorth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Muſtapha</hi> tranſported, during the Winter, freſh Troops into the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to fill up the places of the Dead and Wounded. And the Pillage of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> the Noiſe of which was carryed far and near, on purpoſe to ſtir up the Rapinous Humour of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> had brought over above Sixty Thouſand Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, in hopes of Sacking <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> which was held for the Store-Houſe of all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Ports, and imagin'd to be full of Riches. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> renewed afreſh at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>March</hi> his Preparations of this Siege. <hi>Bragadin</hi> and <hi>Baglioni,</hi> who defended the place, labour'd without ceaſing at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing of their Rampars, as ſoon as the the Enemy retired into Winter Quarters, and employed this Seaſon in fitting and preparing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96181:122"/>
all things for a vigorous Defence. But they chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applyed themſelves to perſwade the Garriſon to hold out to the laſt, and dye like Faithful Subjects and true <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The good Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency between theſe Commanders, and Obedience of the Soldiers (two things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a dangerous Conjuncture) had ſaved <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maguſta,</hi> if the baſeneſs of thoſe, whoſe duty was to ſuccour it, had not abuſed and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the hopes of the Beſieged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Muſtapha</hi> drew near the place immediately after the taking of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> and told his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when he had conſidered the Situation and Fortifications of it, that this Siege was far leſs difficult and dangerous than that he came now from finiſhing. But mention'd nothing what he thought of the Commanders and Garriſon, whoſe Capacity and Courage he more feared, than their Walls and Ditches. He ſent three thouſand Men, in his March towards <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> to hinder the Communication of the two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; of which <hi>Baglioni</hi> having notice, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them in Ambuſh, and charged them with that fierceneſs, that he ſcarcely ſuffered one of them to eſcape. He moreover ſet upon their Reer Guard, when they retired into their Quarters, of which more than five Hundred Men lay dead upon the place; ruin'd their Works, and carryed away one part of their Baggage. Theſe Valorous and Generous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhewed <hi>Muſtapha</hi> that <hi>Famaguſta</hi> would be better defended than <hi>Nicoſia;</hi> neither did he think this Conqueſt certain, as long as the <hi>Venetians</hi> had one Port in the Iſle; and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96181:123"/>
for the Siege of <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> intimated of what importance he thought the taking of it was. The prodigious Army with which he was to attack it, ſeemed to encourage him: But ſeeing the Fatigues of the Soldiers, during the Siege, and what an abundance of Men 'twould coſt him, he had endeavour'd to win the Inhabitants by entreaties, and grievous threats. Sometimes he deſired them to make their own Terms of Compoſition; otherwhiles threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them with a Deſolation, like that of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſia.</hi> But both his Offers and Threatnings were rejected. He ſent then <hi>Podocatero</hi> and <hi>John Suſomini,</hi> to perſwade them to ſurrender. They were enjoyned to aſſure them, that he was really intereſſed in their Fortune; and that they ought to ſeek their ſafety in his promiſes and Faithfulneſs. But theſe ſayings were of no Force with the Beſieged. <hi>Suſomini</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Force in the Town, becauſe of his great Skill in <hi>Fortifications;</hi> and <hi>Podocatero</hi> o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with Sorrow, by returning with ſuch a diſagreeable Anſwer to the Viſir, was ſent back for fear of the ill uſage of his Wife and Children, who were kept in the Camp as Hoſtages.

                     <hi>Muſtapha</hi> finding this Endeavour vain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged himſelf on this poor Gentleman, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Head to be cut off in the ſight of his whole Army, his Wife and Children being preſent, who were dragged in Irons to aſſiſt at this Spectacle; and this <hi>Barbarian</hi> thence forward had recourſe only to Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Famaguſta</hi> is ſituated on that ſide which faces <hi>Syria,</hi> the Sea waſhing the Feet of its Walls. The Rocks that reach from a little Promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is at the right hand of the Town, form a Port very ſure and large. Two Shelfs of Sand ariſe behind theſe Rocks, the one which joyns the Cittadel, and touches the Sea Shoar, ſerves for a Ditch, and ſo cloſes the entrance of the Port, that ſcarcely can the Veſſels find a Paſſage. This Channel is defended by a Caſtle, built on the other ſide, which anſwers the Citadel. The Town contains about two Miles in Circuit, ſhe is ſurrounded by a deep Ditch, and Stone Walls, fortified by ſeveral Towers, built after the ancient Manner, more for Shew than Defence, whoſe Materials are eaſily beat down by the Cannon. The <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had raiſed ſome Works after the modern uſe, according as the time and place allowed them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Viſir</hi> having encamped his Army, began his Lines of Circumvallation, opening at the ſame time a Trench by forty Thouſand Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96181:124"/>
defended by as many in Arms. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards raiſed his Batteries in very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Places. The Beſieged every day ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed out with incredible Valour, and kill'd great numbers of the Enemy. They ſtole out in ſmall Companies, and tarryed not for the orders of their Commanders to attack their Trenches. But whatſoever advantages they gained, they loſt ſtill more than the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers, proportionably to their Forces. Three hundred Men, moſt <hi>Greeks,</hi> armed with Sword and Buckler, according to the manner of their Country, having made a Sally, were charged by the <hi>Turks</hi> in a place diſ-advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them, where they ſuffered themſelves to be imprudently ſurpriz'd. They left Fifty of their Company dead behind them, and the reſt being grievouſly wounded, were beaten back into the Town. Since that time the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals forbad, on great Penalties, all Perſons to go out of the Town without leave. The Batteries of the Beſiegers being higher than the Walls of the City, no body could ſafely walk the Streets, nor abide in their Houſes. But ſeeing their Cannon did not ſuch executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they expected, they ſet up another Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery againſt the Walls of the place, and made therein a conſiderable Breach. Yet dared they not to hazard an Aſſault, but advanced as far as the Counterſcarp, and endeavour'd to fill up the Ditch to the Top of the Breach, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend more eaſily thereon. They threw Night and Day great quantities of Earth on the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the Wall; and for fear it might be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96181:124"/>
removed by the Beſieged, who had already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it, they lined the Counterſcarp with Musketeers, who continually fired on the Breach; ſo that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> not daring to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this place, could not hinder the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent into the Ditch. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> fill'd it up to the Rampart; covering it on the right and left with Babbins and Sacks of Wool till 'twas Musket Proof. They attempted an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault by this Breach, which would have ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with them, had not the Beſieged, who burnt their Sacks and Faggots, driven them from this Poſt, with the loſs of many of their Men.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> diſcouraged, neither by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the danger, nor yet by the Difficulties or Fatigues, re-took the Ditch, and repaired again the ruined Works. They ſet Miners here and in many other places. The Beſieged liſtning to them, heard the noiſe of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, and made ſome Counter-Mines. But there was one ſprung on the ſide towards the Sea, where 'twas leaſt miſtruſted, that with a terrible Noiſe overthrew a Tower, and part of a Wall, which buryed many Soldiers in its Ruine. Preſently after the blowing up this Mine, the Beſiegers, who were in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, made an Aſſault on this Breach with great Shouts, and the place had bin loſt, if thoſe who guarded that Quarter, and were unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, had been capable of Fear. They bore this Shock, maugre their Surprize, with an Heroick Courage and Valour: ſo that the Commanders getting leaſure to draw Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96181:125"/>
the Enemies were vigorouſly beaten back. <hi>Baglioni</hi> falling upon them with a handful of pick't Men, tumbled them down into the Ditch. Their Officers, reproaching them for being beaten off with ſo ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, from the Breach of a place half won, made them return five times to the Aſſault, but were always received with the ſame Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and in fine, forced to a diſorderly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, being ſorely Wounded. The Beſieged, to prevent ſuch another Attack, raiſed up a new Wall with Forts upon the Houſes which were demoliſh'd, for to make Retrenchments, in caſe the Enemies ſhould gain the out-works. The Beſiegers ſprung a great Mine at the Gate, called <hi>d'Limiſſo,</hi> which blew up many Men, and effected ſuch a Breach as might be eaſily aſcended. The Infidels, animated by Honour, the Recompence, their Commanders promis'd them, and hopes of a Rich Prey, fell deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately on this Breach, rending the Air with their Shouts, and marching over the Ruins of the Wall, on the Bodies of the ſlain and wounded. At the ſame time, and with the ſame Vigour they attackt the other Breach, thus to divide and weaken the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Fight held for Six hours together in both theſe places without a moments Reſpite: and if the Men that defended the place, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this day the height of Valour, the Women alſo teſtified more than could be expected from the Weakneſs of their Sex; for not contented to carry Arms and Ammunition to the Soldiers, they ventur'd into the greateſt
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96181:125"/>
Dangers, throwing down Stones and Scalding Water on the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were exceedingly diſturbed by it. The Biſhop of the City, a <hi>Dominican,</hi> was on a <hi>Baſtion</hi> near the Gate of <hi>Limiſſo,</hi> with a Croſs in his Hand, and going with a marvellous Courage in the moſt perilous places, animated his People by his Zeal and Example. <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> vext at the loſs of ſo many Men, and diſappointment in ſo many Attempts, reſolved to encreaſe his Batteries, to make wider Breaches, and thereon ſounded a Retreat. Yet did he not ſuffer the Beſieged to reſt, but haraſt them Night and Day, that he might tire them out with continual La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; as ſoon as the Batteries were ready, they fired ſo faſt, that the Beſieged counted in one day five Thouſand Bullets from their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies greateſt Pieces. Neither the old nor new Wall could reſiſt this Fury, nor the Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged repair their Ruines, being hindred by ſuch Showrs of Musket Shot. The offering at this Work, was to expoſe themſelves to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Death. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> being no longer able to defend this <hi>Baſtion,</hi> dug a Mine under it, to be ſprung, as ſoon as the Enemy ſhould become Maſters of it. The <hi>Viſir</hi> cauſed the Town to be aſſaulted at the ſame time by all his Army in four different places; and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> being tired and wounded, could hardly undergo theſe Attacks. Yet did they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Infidels with more Courage than Strength. The Diſpute at <hi>Limiſſo</hi> was the moſt obſtinate, becauſe <hi>Muſtapha</hi> encouraged his Men by his own Example, and the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:96181:126"/>
were forced to abandon this Poſt, Some of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who were mixt with them in the heat of the Fight, entred the Town; when <hi>Baglioni</hi> percieving the danger, ſo ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſet Fire to the Mine, that above Three Thouſand <hi>Turks,</hi> who thought themſelves ſure of the place, were blown up with the Baſtion into the Air. The effect of this Mine was ſo Violent, that it fill'd the Neighbouring places with Ruines and Dead Bodies. Near an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Soldiers, amongſt which were ſome Officers, that could not retreat time enough, unfortunately periſhed together with the <hi>Turks.</hi> The General diſpirited at ſo many Repulſes, began to diſtruſt the taking of a place ſo bravely defended. He had already loſt the third part of his Army. He feared, that the ill Succeſs of this Siege wou'd eclipſe his Glory of taking <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> and bring him into Diſgrace with the Sultan. Theſe Reflexions ſtrangely diſquieting him, made him ſevere with his Men; He ſometimes upbraided them for ſuffering themſelves to be repulſed from the Breaches of a diſmantled place, into which they might have eaſily entred. He other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles incited them by great Promiſes to uſe their utmoſt endeavours for preventing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief expected in <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> which would cauſe them to begin their Works anew. Having let them reſt four days, he order'd his Officers with ſound of Drum and Trumpet to a freſh Aſſault of the late Breaches. Himſelf at the Head of his beſt Troops, fell in with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Valour on that of <hi>Limiſſo,</hi> which the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:96181:126"/>
of the <hi>Baſtion</hi> had rendred very eaſie to be defended. <hi>Lewis Martiningo</hi> bravely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this firſt Effort, with ſuch Men as he could draw together; but not being able to hold out againſt a ſecond Charge, more furious than the firſt, <hi>Baglioni,</hi> tho' ſlenderly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed, coming ſeaſonably by the Gate, fell on the <hi>Turks,</hi> diſorder'd them, and having kill'd a great many, put the reſt to Flight. They were received in all other places with the ſame reſolution, being forced to leave the Walls, and retreat into their Camp with conſiderable loſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> ſo frequently aſſaulted, bore theſe violent Efforts, ſome of which held four and twenty Hours together, and the Beſieged, joining Prudence with their Valour, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Attempt, and brake the meaſures of the <hi>Barbarians. Hicronimo Magio,</hi> a Native of <hi>Anglaria,</hi> a Town in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> an excellent Ingineer, was in the place, who invented cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain new Mines and Fire-Works, with which he greatly endamaged the Enemy. He le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd his Cannon ſo exactly, that he diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eighteen of the Beſiegers Pieces, by ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting right into their Mouths, and in an inſtant ſhatter'd and overthrew the Works, on which they had ſpent much time and labour. <hi>Baglioni, Bragadin</hi> and <hi>Tipoli</hi> having appointed the Officers of the Garriſon every one his Poſt, continually viſited them, giving all neceſſary orders, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and encouraging the Soldiers, and comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Perſon with the Enemy in the greateſt Dangers. They eat and lay in the Towers of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96181:127"/>
Ramparts, not to be out of ſight of their Men. The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who thought it a point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to keep their Poſts, outbraved Death, by ſhewing as great a Contempt of Life, as Love for Honour. They ſtood before the Cannons Mouths as if their Bodies had been Walls, and his place who was carryed off, was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplyed by another. Neither were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants wanting in their Duty, the young People being amongſt all Attacks, ſpared not themſelves in any danger. The Ancient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Women and Children were ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Power. Some tended the Works, and received the Soldiers Command with a wonderful readyneſs. The Ancient Women led on, and encourag'd by the Eccleſiaſticks, brought Victuals and other Neceſſaries to the main Guards, and Poſts furtheſt advanced. A Great Store-Houſe was raiſed, into which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Perſon had put in what his Houſe yielded; and leſt Money ſhould be wanting during the Siege, new was Coyned of Braſs, with the Arms of the Republick, whereon was put a Price, the value of which was to be paid in Silver as ſoon as the War ſhould be ended. 'Twas judged that <hi>Famaguſta</hi> might have been ſaved, had the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſent any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Succours. The Valour and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Commanders, the Courage of the Garriſon, and Firmneſs of the Citizens, who held out four Months againſt the vigorous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of a numerous and formidable Army, reſolved to dye with Arms in their Hands, and who deſtroyed Sixty Thouſand <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:96181:127"/>
would have certainly made them raiſe the Siege, had the Republick ſeconded theſe brave and generous Reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hierom Ragazoni,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been entreated by <hi>Bragadin</hi> and <hi>Baglioni</hi> to go and demand Succour of the Senate; ſlipt out in the Night through the Enemies Sentinels, paſt over into <hi>Candia,</hi> and got to <hi>Venice.</hi> He ſhewed the Magiſtrates the piteous ſtate of the Town, and ſpared neither Prayers nor Tears to move them to Compaſſion. The two Commanders had already made known this Extremity to the Republick, and that it was impoſſible to hold out longer, unleſs they were ſpeedily ſupplyed with new Troops and Ammunition. <hi>Bragadin</hi> o'rewhelmed with Deſpair, yet complained pathetically to ſee himſelf thus forſaken, recommending his Children to the Senate, whom he comforted in his Letters, and exhorted to be ever true to their Religion and Country according to his Example. Which Letters being read in Full Senate, ſet all the Kindred of <hi>Bragadin</hi> on wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. But this afflicted Family found more Compaſſion than Aſſiſtance from theſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. <hi>Genevre Salviati, Baglionies</hi> Wife, whoſe Spirit was enflamed by the Grief to ſee her Husband in ſuch danger, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from breaking out into Reproaches. She every where publiſhed, That if the Republick forſook a Perſon ſo greatly devoted to their Service in ſuch a preſſing Extremity, they muſt not expect hence forward that any Man will adhere to their Party. Having held this
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96181:128"/>
Diſcourſe before the Chiefeſt of the City; ſhe afterwards went and importun'd the Senate, and forced them by her Clamours to meet and conſult on a Remedy; but 'twas no where to be found. All the Troops were embarkt on the Fleet, on deſign of a general Engagement: They knew not on whom to caſt their Eyes, and no body offered himſelf to execute ſo peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous an Enterprize. <hi>Genevre,</hi> who had not only the Courage of a Man, but of a generous Soldier, importun'd an order from them of conducting theſe Succours, alledging her Sex was not to be minded, ſeeing a Womans love to her Husband would tranſport her beyond all Dangers. Her reſtleſneſs making her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Senate's tedious Deliberations, ſhe ſent to <hi>Peruſia,</hi> where <hi>Baglioni</hi>'s Family was of great Conſideration, ſecretly to raiſe Men, and draw together his Friends and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants, being reſolved in her own Perſon, and at her own Expence, to conduct a Succour to <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> in caſe the Senate came not to ſpeedy determination. In fine, to leſſen her Diſcontent, 'twas agreed, there ſhould be ſent to <hi>Bragadin</hi> 700 Foot which were deſigned for the Navy, with Orders to <hi>Honorius Scotto</hi> their Collonel to convey them thither. At the ſame time Orders were given to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy two Veſſels, for the carrying all manner of Refreſhments, the Command of which was given to <hi>Nicholas Donati.</hi> At his departure he was adviſed to be careful of his way, and ſteer towards <hi>Candia,</hi> there to learn News of the Enemy: Theſe Succours were long in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:96181:128"/>
preparing, that <hi>Genevre</hi> had no leſs difficulty to haſten them away, than to obtain them: and for the compleating her Deſpair, the Senate forbad her making uſe of this opportunity of going to her Husband. <hi>Donati</hi> was no dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genter in his Voyage, than in his ſetting forth: and yet the Fame of this mean Supply might have preſerved <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> and this relief might have arrived time enough, had he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of going on Shoar at <hi>Crete,</hi> only coaſted the Iſle towards the South, to avoid meeting with the Infidels. But he unfortunately put in at <hi>Candia,</hi> that he might be more particularly inſtructed in his way, and confer with the orher Officers of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet about it. The <hi>Providitor Caballo</hi> ſtaying him on ſeveral pretences, made him loſe the opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting ſo generous a deſign. 'Tis true, he was not the moſt to blame, <hi>Caballo</hi>'s Avarice, and <hi>Quirini</hi>'s Spleen being the principal cauſes of his ſtay. <hi>Caballo</hi> deſired to make advantage of the Proviſions, <hi>Donati</hi> was carrying to <hi>Famaguſta;</hi> and <hi>Quirini</hi> was glad of this occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf of the Senate's Ingratitude, in not acknowledging the Service, he had done by his former Succouring the ſame place. The other Officers in vain remonſtrated to him the neceſſity of ſaving a place of that Conſequence, nor was it to any purpoſe to repreſent, that ſuch gallant Men well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be relieved, and this ſecond Attempt would crown his former Action. We muſt (anſwered he furiouſly) make the Senate feel the want of ſuch Men as we, learn to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:96181:129"/>
thoſe Citizens who ſerve them Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Armies, and no longer beſtow all their Favours to ſupport the Ambitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of thoſe who take their eaſe at home. 'Tis ſaid, That <hi>Quirini,</hi> advanced from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Poverty to great Wealth, was thereby become leſs active, loving more to enjoy what he had gotten, than gain Reputation. But during theſe Diſputes, he received orders from <hi>Venieri</hi> to repair immediately to <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſo that ſetting Sayl, and leaving <hi>Donati</hi> diſabled to conduct his Succours, the Beſieged, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſt by Fire and Sword, tired out with numerous Inventions and Stratagems, aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Enemies Cannon, as well by Sea as Land; their Gallies having approached the Walls to reduce them to deſpair, held out yet longer, reſolved to defend themſelves to the laſt, in hopes of being ſoon relieved.</p>
                  <p>Tho the <hi>Famaguſtians</hi> had by four Months Siege loſt the greateſt part of their Garriſon, there remaining but eight hundred <hi>Italians,</hi> wearyed out and wounded, yet were they not diſcouraged, till they had ſpent their Powder and other Proviſions. All the Stores were exhauſted, and the Famine was ſo great, that they had ſeveral days fed on Horſes, Aſſes, Dogs, Cats, and ſuch like Creatures, ſo that Toyl and Hunger had quite exhauſted their Spirits. The Commanders, who never before would hearken to any Propoſals of yielding, began to be touched with the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Inhabitants. Theſe poor People told <hi>Bragadin,</hi> That having given ſo many
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96181:129"/>
Marks of their Courage and Fidelity, in hopes of being ſuccour'd; they muſt think of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring on honourable Conditions; before the Enemy became inſtructed of the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State, to which they were reduced; That ſome care muſt be taken to preſerve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of a place, whoſe Zeal and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Republick had ſufficiently experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: That a longer and more obſtinate Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> was not to be affected; leſt they ſhould draw on themſelves a Diſaſter, like that of <hi>Nicoſia;</hi> That they ſhould be yet worſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then the <hi>Nicoſians,</hi> having held out longer; That he would conſider how cruelly the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> might uſe the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> when taken Priſoners, having ſo often felt their Valour; and whether he could conſent to the Sack of the Town, and the delivering up himſelf with the Wives and Children of ſo many gallant Citizens, who had ſuffered all the Extremities of War, in the Service of the State and their Country. Such preſſing reaſons perſwaded in fine, <hi>Bragadin</hi> and <hi>Baglioni;</hi> The latter ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Heaven to Witneſs, that it was not he who rendred the Town, but the Senate gave up him to the Enemy. On the Firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> there was by general conſent a White Flag ſet upon the Walls, to let the Beſiegers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand they were inclinable to a Treaty. There was at the ſame time a Ceſſation of Arms, Deputies were ſent, and Hoſtages given on both ſides. <hi>Hercules Martinengo</hi> and <hi>Mathew Colcio,</hi> ſent to treat with <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by his Son, who conducted them into
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96181:130"/>
the Camp in great State. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys were at their entrance into the Town treated by the Governours with like Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>After many Conferences, <hi>Famaguſta</hi> was at laſt deliver'd up on theſe Conditions; The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were to be ſuffered fully and quietly to enjoy their Eſtates, with Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the free exerciſe of their Religion. The Garriſon was to go forth with Flying Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Arms and Baggage. The Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were to take with them five Pieces of Cannon, ſuch as they pleaſed out of the place; and three Horſes of State taken from the Infidels. They were to be ſupplyed with Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to tranſport them into <hi>Candia;</hi> with a Squadron of Gallies for their Convoy. <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> was too well informed of what paſt in the Town, to be ignorant of their Extremity: but he fear'd, he increaſing the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſhould drive them to Deſpair, by refuſing the Conditions, and was willing to ſpare the reſt of his Army. But if he accepted the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation, 'twas on deſign to falſifie his Word, and by cruel Punniſhments to avenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on them, for the time and Men he had loſt. The next day, the better to conceal his Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, he kindly preſented the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with all ſorts of Refreſhments. The greateſt part of the Garriſon and of the Baggage was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on board the Veſſels to tranſport them, when <hi>Bragadin,</hi> coming forth of the Town, ſent to requeſt <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> he would put in ſome of his Men, to preſerve the Inhabitants from
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96181:130"/>
ill uſage. The Deſire met with a kind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from the <hi>Viſir,</hi> who appointed when <hi>Bragadin</hi> ſhould come to him. He went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed by <hi>Baglioni, Tiepoli, Lewis</hi> and <hi>Hector Martinengo,</hi> with ſeveral other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and attended by near Two Hundred Musketeers. <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> on pretence of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Honour, made the Troops about his Tent ſtand to their Arms. He, and the Chief of his Company were brought in, and had Seats given them with great Ceremony. The <hi>Viſir</hi> at firſt ſpake to them very kindly, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring concerning many particulars of the Siege, and commending their Courage and Conſtancy, with a Flattery the more perfidious, in that he was going to cut their Throats. As they were taking their leave, he ſpake to <hi>Bragadin,</hi> to ſend him the Priſoners, taken during the Siege. <hi>Bragadin</hi> extreamly ſurprized, anſwered him he knew not of any Priſoners to return him: and thereupon this <hi>Barbarian,</hi> who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, putting on Aſtoniſhment, cryed out furiouſly, That they were then murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red during the Truce, and at the ſame time cauſed all theſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be ſeized on, and put in Irons. 'Twas in vain for them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt the Breach of the Articles; They were dragg'd out of his Tent, and cruelly ſlain in his Sight.</p>
                  <p>The Unfortunate <hi>Bragadin,</hi> was ſaved from this ſlaughter, to ſatiate the Tyrants Rage, by undergoing the greateſt Torments. <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> deſiring to make him ſuffer more than one Death, ſet thrice his Scimitar to his Throat;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96181:131"/>
which this Illuſtrious <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſtill undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beheld. Having cut off his Noſe and his Ears, they threw him with Irons on his Legs into a hole, whence the Executioners drew him on the following days, to make him carry Earth in a Basket. They made him bow down with this heavy Burthen, and kiſs the ground every time he paſt before <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who was ſetting Men at work to repair the Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Famaguſta.</hi> He was afterwards put on Board the Fleet, where he ſuffer'd ſeveral other Indignities. They tyed him to one of the Yards of the Gally, to make the Deformity of his Viſage more publick. He was drawn into the Market place, and being hung up by the Heels, was flead alive. The Cruelty of this Torment, drew not from him ſo much as a Sigh, or the leaſt word that ſavour'd of Meanneſs and Dejection; and this Hero ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred his Soul to God, reproaching his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with their Perfidiouſneſs and Barbarity. His Skin ſeaſoned with Vineger and Salt, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> cauſed to be ſtuffed with Hay, and faſtned on the Top of his Cabin for a Spectacle to the Coaſts of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi> 'Twas put into the Arſenal of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whence the Children of this generous Martyr redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, and preſerv'd it as the moſt Glorious Trophy of their Family. The Fury of <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> being appeaſed by this Barbarous Execution, he gave the reſt of the Garriſon their Lives, but chained them to the Oar. Thus <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> as valiantly defended, as 'twas obſtinately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt, followed the mournful Deſtiny of the unhappy Iſle of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>

                  <p>WHILST the <hi>Barbarians</hi> finiſh't the Conqueſt of the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus, Colonni</hi> and <hi>Venieri,</hi> who expected in <hi>Sicily Don John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> beheld with grief the Deſolation of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia. Venieri,</hi> advancing too far with his Fleet for the taking in of Proviſions at <hi>Tropia,</hi> was ſurprized by a Tempeſt, in which he loſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Gallies, that were daſht in pieces againſt the Rocks near the Shoar; and for to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat this Misfortune, the Fire took the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Gallies, commanded by <hi>Francis Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</hi> Theſe Diſgraces joyned to the Loſſes, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſuffered in the laſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96181:133"/>
afflicted them the more, by how much they placed all their hopes in the Naval For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Pope, who grew impatient at the ſlowneſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> continually diſpatcht Couriers to King <hi>Philip,</hi> complaining at their letting ſlip the beſt part of the Seaſon, without drawing any advantage from all theſe great Preparations of War. All <hi>Europe</hi> was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the motions of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But whether 'twas an effect of the Gravity of the Nation, or that <hi>Philip</hi> deſign'd the Republick's Ruine; his ſmall haſt to ſecond the Soveraign Prelate's Intentions, gave cauſe to miſtruſt his Sincerity. Although the time wherein his Fleet was to arrive in <hi>Italy</hi> was expired, and the Seaſon already far ſpent, 'twas not yet well known, what was to be expected on that hand, and the Conduct of <hi>Don John</hi> gave great Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions to the Republick. This young Prince, whoſe Army was ready to part, buſied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in fitting up his Equipage, by the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of which he pretended to draw admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all other Countries. Beſides, this pittiful reaſon, <hi>Maximilian's</hi> two eldeſt Sons, whom the Empreſs their Mother cauſed to be brought up near <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> their Unkle, waited the occaſion of this Fleet, to paſs over into <hi>Italy.</hi> One of theſe Princes fell ſick, and was a good while before he recover'd, ſo that the Gallies could not leave the Port of <hi>Barcelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona;</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> murmured againſt this delay, ſo prejudicial to the Affairs of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom;</hi> and cauſed by reaſons of ſuch ſmall moment. In fine, <hi>Pius</hi> V. ſharply affirming,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96181:133"/>
the intereſts of Religion, were betrayed, by abandoning the Confederates; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aſhamed at theſe Reproaches, ſet Sayl, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Genoa,</hi> towards the end of <hi>July,</hi> by afavourable Wind; <hi>Don John</hi> landed, and diſpatcht at the ſame time <hi>Plegio,</hi> one of his Gentlemen, to give notice to the Pope of his arrival in <hi>Italy,</hi> and aſſure him he would, by his future diligence, make amends for the time he had loſt. Yet he tarryed ſome days at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> during which <hi>Doria,</hi> who entertain'd him in his Palace, treated him with whatſoever the Magnificence and abundance of the Country yielded. <hi>Antony Tiepoli,</hi> who was going Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour into <hi>Spain,</hi> was order'd to wait on him at <hi>Genoa,</hi> to compliment him in the name of the Senate, and entreat his immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, for the Relief of thoſe unhappy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that wanted his Aſſiſtance. He diſmiſt ſome <hi>German</hi> Lords, who were to go to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Land; ſent to <hi>Naples</hi> one part of his Fleet, under the Command of the <hi>Marquis</hi> of St. <hi>Cruce,</hi> to make ready all things there for his Reception, and ſome days after took the ſame Courſe. Cardinal <hi>Granvil,</hi> who lately ſucceeded <hi>Riberio,</hi> in the Government of the City and Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> preſented him with a Standart, which he had received from the Pope. <hi>Don John</hi> parted immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and came on the <hi>17th.</hi> day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to <hi>Meſſina. Colonni</hi> and <hi>Venieri</hi> went out to meet him with all their Gallies. They ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to oblige him to uſe greater Diligence in his paſſage to <hi>Greece,</hi> the engagement of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96181:134"/>
Treaty of Allyance, and diſadvantages of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for want of his Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul Odeſcalchi,</hi> a Prelate of a ſingular Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, was diſpatcht to him from his Holyneſs, to joyn his Exhortations and Entreaties to the <hi>Venetian</hi>'s Remonſtrances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don John</hi> excuſed his ſtay, by laying it on the Preparations of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do; and complain'd of certain Diſcourſes, ſtuft with Outrages and Lies; by which 'twas endeavour'd to perſwade the Publick, that his Catholick Majeſty and he, were not willing to engage the Infidels, whatſoever occaſion might offer it ſelf of receiving, or bidding Defiance. He afterwards returned the Pope and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick thanks for their Eſteem and Confidence in him, notwithſtanding his Youth and inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, aſſuring them he would be wanting in nothing, his Honour required, for the defence of their Intereſts. But this was a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Strain from that which was uſed in the Council which was given him. It was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>Spaniards, of Doria, Landriani</hi> Governour of <hi>Sicily, Sforza</hi> Count of St. <hi>Flora, Aſcanius Corneo,</hi> and <hi>Gabriel Cerbellon. Requieſcens,</hi> in whom reſided the greateſt Authority, during this Expedition, ſhewed, that laying aſide all Punctilio's of Honour, they ought to avoid the engaging the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet; That the <hi>Venetian</hi>'s Intereſts were quite different from the King of <hi>Spains;</hi> That the Republick ſtill diſmayed with the danger ſhe had run, and deſpairing of making with the <hi>Sultan</hi> any reaſonable acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, was for playing a deſperate Game, and hazzarding all; whereas his Catholick
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96181:134"/>
Majeſty, who was led neither by Neceſſity nor Deſpair, could not endanger a Fleet, whoſe Conſervation was to be reckoned of equal value with Victory; and that <hi>Don John</hi> ought more to prize the Honour, he had of being the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Brother, than the Command of the Confederates Army. The <hi>Italian</hi> Captains knew that <hi>Requieſcens</hi> had his Maſters Secret, and therefore they hearkned to him with as much reſpect, as if he had been the King that ſpake: They only anſwered, 'twas to be feared leſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> truſting no longer to the Aſſiſtance of their Allies, ſhould clap up a ſhameful Peace, which might ſharpen the Pope againſt <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> Yet 'twas determin'd to go as far as <hi>Greece,</hi> as if 'twas deſigned to carry the War thither; and having amuſed the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> during the whole Summer, they ſhould then return and lay up their Gallies in the Ports. <hi>Quirini</hi> and <hi>Canali,</hi> Providitors to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army, brought Sixty Gallies from <hi>Candia</hi> to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> perſwaded the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. <hi>Doria</hi> and the reſt of the Fleet being come thither likewiſe, the Council was call'd, in which 'twas reſolved to ſayl towards the <hi>Morea, Colonni</hi> and <hi>Venieri</hi> having deſired it with great Entreaties. A review was made of the three Fleets, and becauſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> had more Veſſels than they needed, and there being a want of them in the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Fleet, Soldiers were offered in exchange on his part, which were accepted by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſo that four Thouſand <hi>Italians</hi> were embark't on the Republicks Gallies at the <hi>Spaniards</hi> coſt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96181:135"/>
for whoſe Maintenance and Support they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded great ſtore of Proviſions.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things being thus prepared for a departure, the Generals, Officers and Soldiers went on board, having firſt devoutly received the Sacred Hoſt, and ſet Sayl the fourteenth day of <hi>September,</hi> by the favour of a fair Wind. They carryed along with them the Vows and Benedictions of all the People of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and other Neighbouring Countries, who came down in great Concourſes to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> to ſee the moſt numerous Navy which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ever ſet forth; who made the Port and Coaſts ring with Shouts of Joy. The Flower of the <hi>Italian</hi> Nobility was in this Fleet, ſeveral of them having ſignaliz'd themſelves by Valorous Actions, as <hi>Sforza</hi> Count of St. <hi>Flora, Andrew Doria, Aſcaneus Corneo, Pompey Colonni, Paul Urſin</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> his Brother, <hi>Gabriel Cerbellon, Paul Sforza, Honorius Cajetan, Vincent Vitelli,</hi> and ſeveral others of the beſt Families in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples, Auguſtin Barbarigo, Mark Quirini, Antony Canali</hi> and <hi>Paul Duodi,</hi> Noble <hi>Venetians.</hi> There were alſo <hi>Spaniards</hi> of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct merit; namely, <hi>Lewis Requieſcens,</hi> Chief of the Council to <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Auſtria, Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Pius</hi> V. ſent alſo <hi>Michael Bonelli</hi> his Kinſman, Brother to Cardinal <hi>Alexandrinus,</hi> to ſerve his firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſhip under ſuch great Captains. All theſe Young Lords, attended by a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Domeſticks, zealous for the Honour of their Religion, had embarkt themſelves in the quality of Volunteers. Although <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> won the publick Affections by his Youth, his Martial Ayr and Good Mein, yet the Generality of People could not but fear the Succeſs of an Affair, whereon depended the Welfare of Chriſtendom, which needed a Commander of great Courage and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The Naval Army conſiſted of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten Gallies, each of which carryed an hundred and fifty Soldiers, armed with Muskets, Swords, and kind of Half Pikes, of twenty eight great Ships of Burden, Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which having only Sayls, move not with that ſpeed, as the Gallies do. Theſe were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Men, with all kind of Arms, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins of War, and commanded by <hi>Caeſar d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valois,</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Gentleman. There were beſides ſix Galeaſſes, which were floating Caſtles, carrying Guns of the greateſt Size, and which Fear neither the Attacks of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor the violence of the Waves.</p>
                  <p>This numerous Fleet, having weighed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor from the Port of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> at Sun riſing, after four hours Sayl, came to the Premento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of St. <hi>John;</hi> where ſhe r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96181:136"/>
The next Morning ſhe uſed no greater diligence, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtill buſying themſelves in theſe kind Employs, and ſpending much time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. <hi>Venieri,</hi> who ſuſpected theſe Amuſements, ſhewed a great deal of Impatience; <hi>Don John</hi> having ſent him word, he took in freſh Water, that he might not be obliged to ſtop any more in his courſe; he, in an angry manner retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him anſwer, That his Fleet had bin ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with all things neceſſary fifteen days ago; That time was not to be thus conſumed, ſeeing <hi>Autumn</hi> drew near; That 'twas a ſhame they had not yet undertaken any thing, againſt the Infidels, who were ſtill Maſters of the Seas; That he believed him too jealous of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to avoid occaſions of obtaining it; but he feared his Council were not led by ſuch generous Sentiments: This Young Prince awakened by ſo bold an Anſwer, made a little more haſt, and came to <hi>Corfou,</hi> after ten days Navigation; in which he often met with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds. <hi>Paul Urſin,</hi> being ſent out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fleet, informed the Generals, that the Infidels had lately retired from before this Ifle, having done what miſchief they could in it; and that departing from the Gulph of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> on the fourteenth of <hi>September,</hi> they had ſayled to <hi>Lepanto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet rode three days before <hi>Corfou,</hi> to refreſh themſelves, and expect ſome Veſſels, which were behind. Having provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves with all neceſſaries, and taken in more Artillery; the Council Aſſembled to deliberate, on what was needful to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96181:136"/>
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> whereof conſiſted <hi>Don Johns</hi> Council, prepoſſeſſed with the ſecret Intentions of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> were far from being in the <hi>Venetians</hi> Sentiments. Yet they did not openly declare themſelves, but appearing uncertain, between both ſides, they were for determining themſelves, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exigency of Affairs, with reſpect to time, place, and all other Circumſtances, reſolving on nothing but what might be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Catholick Majeſty. They were wholly againſt the Confederates advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Greece,</hi> alledging, this would be to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Army to Winds and Tempeſts, uſual in <hi>Autumn,</hi> on thoſe Coaſts; That they might beſiege <hi>Supoto, Margariti,</hi> or <hi>Caſtel Novo,</hi> the taking of which places would be followed by the Conqueſt of all <hi>Epirus;</hi> That when the Sea became boyſterous, each might retire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Ports, to return on the next Spring, more early, to make amends for this years loſs. <hi>Venieri</hi> underſtood well enough, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> ſought out Pretences, to let the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſlip, and return into <hi>Sicily,</hi> towards the midſt of <hi>Autumn,</hi> as if they had Religiouſly obſerved their Engagement, though they had not ſtruck a ſtroke. This ancient Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhewed, to the end he might the longer retain them, that the Peaſants of <hi>Candia</hi> were revolted; That the whole Iſle was in a terrri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſternation, ſo that 'twas to be feared, leſt the <hi>Mahometans</hi> ſhould make advantage of theſe Inteſtine Orders. That 'twas their Duty to hinder the Attempts, which might be made
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96181:137"/>
that way; it being unreaſonable, the Republick ſhould ſet out every year a Fleet, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Profit for ſo great an Expence; and that he doubted not but the <hi>Barbarians</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption would accept a Combat. <hi>Colonni,</hi> more ſixt to the Intereſts of the Pope, than <hi>Phillip</hi> the Second's, penetrated into the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Intentions, and was for neither of theſe opinions. He maintained the Sedition of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> was appeaſed, ſo that this Country needed no Succours; That the taking of <hi>Supoto</hi> or <hi>Marguriti,</hi> was an Enterprize unworthy ſuch an Illuſtrious Armado; That 'twas ſhameful to them, to have layn in the Ports of <hi>Sicily,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Turks</hi> ravaged the Iſle of <hi>Corfou,</hi> not weighing Anchor till the departure of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet: Such a piteous Conduct as this, fruſtrating the expectations of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> would prove as diſadvantagious to them, as Honourable and Profitable to the Infidels; That they came not ſurely with ſuch Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to behold the Republicks States, filled with Murthers, Rapines and Devaſtations; That he was, in fine, for going directly to the Enemies, to draw them to an Engagement; according to the orders he had received from the Pope, to whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> had committed the Soveraign Power of this Expedition; That their Fleet weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſpent with Labour, and continual Courſes in the laſt Campaign, could not hold out againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which was in its full Vigour and Prime; That ſome Spies, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Baſſa's of the Sea, had detached ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96181:137"/>
Gallies, imagining the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would not attempt any thing at the end of a Campaign; That ſhould Fear, keep the <hi>Barbarians</hi> blockt up in their Ports, the advantage of curbing their Inſolence, and encouraging the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> would at leaſt redound hence. That the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts of <hi>Autumn</hi> were needleſs Terrors, and meer Chimera's, ſeeing there was time enough remaining, for the effectual execution of what they came out, and that in all caſes, there were good Ports, and ſafe Retreats againſt the Violence of the Seas.</p>

                     <hi>Colonni,</hi> having thus ſpoke in the Council of War, advertiſed <hi>Don John</hi> and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> in private, not to diſcourage the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and thwart them in their way, leſt they forced them on deſperate Councils; diſadvantagious to the reſt of the Confederats; That the loſs of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and the Pillage of their other Iſlands, the Vaſtations of Inland Countries, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of their Gallies, which were ſunk or loſt; ſo greatly diſpirited them, that unleſs they were effectually aſſiſted elſewhere, they would certainly conclude a Peace, with the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, on ſhameful Conditions for themſelves, and indeed, diſhonourable to all <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> That 'twas true, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hazarded more, and gained leſs than the <hi>Venetians</hi> in a Combat; But the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Honour, was as much concerned, as the <hi>Venetians</hi> Safety.</p>
                  <p>The Opinion which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had, that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet would avoid meeting them, made them enter into <hi>Colonni</hi>'s Sentiment.

The Chief Officers were the more perſwaded of this, by a Bark arriving from <hi>Zant,</hi> which brought News, that Sixty <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Sayl had ſteered their Courſe towards <hi>Modon.</hi> The greateſt part of the Officers extreamly rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at this News, prepared to follow them, and diſpoſed their Men to fight, although they expected to find the Enemy in a poſture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The Fleet having ſet Sayl, the firſt of <hi>October,</hi> were driven by a violent Wind, which obliged them to drop Anchor, and ride before <hi>Gomenize</hi> two days. <hi>Don John,</hi> and the two other Generals, made an exact view of all their Troops, in expectation of a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account, of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Giles d'Andrade</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was ſent together with <hi>Cantareni,</hi> and <hi>Malipieri,</hi> each on his Gally, to diſcover the number, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Enemy; reported, they had ſeen Sixty Sayl, making towards the <hi>Levant,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing preciſely, their Courſe; and that their Generals, with the reſt of their Fleet, lay near the City of <hi>Lepanto;</hi> That they had received no news of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet; That they wanted Sea-men and Soldiers, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were employed in this leaſure time, in filling up vacant Places; and that 'twas thought they came to beſiege the City of <hi>Zant.</hi> This Relation encreaſed the deſire which the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> had of fighting them; and <hi>Don John</hi> ſhewed in appearance great joy at ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an occaſion; and treated the <hi>Venetians</hi> with more Sweetneſs and Confidence.</p>

The Confederate Army had ſcarcely began to Sayl, when a Diſſention aroſe, which had like to have proved of fatal Conſequence. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> had embarkt on their Gallies, ſome Companies which <hi>Don John</hi> had given them in <hi>Sicily.</hi> An Officer, named <hi>Mutio,</hi> a Native of <hi>Cortonne,</hi> was order'd on board a Frigat of <hi>Candia,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Andrew Calergio;</hi> who treated this Captain with great Inſolency, and contempt. <hi>Calergio</hi> prayed him ſeveral times, to live more civilly with him; but this fair procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, gaining nothing on the Spirit of this bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Perſon; <hi>Calergio</hi> complained of him to <hi>Venieri;</hi> acquainting him, that he could not be Maſter of his Frigat. <hi>Venieri</hi> ſent for <hi>Mutio,</hi> to chide him; but he derided this Order, and anſwered, he knew no other General but <hi>Don John.</hi> The Guards of the Standart, were at the ſame time diſpacht, to ſeize on his Perſon. Theſe Officers, in the Republick's Navies, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Generals Orders; and 'tis a Capital Crime, not to yield Obedience to them. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieri</hi> had agreed with <hi>Don John,</hi> that in caſe the Soldiers, which were Strangers, deſerved Puniſhment, they were to be ſeiſed on; but this Prince ſhould judge them himſelf, to ſhew the Reſpect, they were willing to pay to his Quality of <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> and for the greater Authority of theſe kind of judgements. <hi>Mutio,</hi> did not only defend himſelf from being ſeized on, by theſe Perſons; but cauſing his Men to take their Arms, he charged the Guard of the Standart ſo furiouſly, that one was kill'd, and the reſt forced to depart the Veſſel, grievouſly
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96181:139"/>
wounded; uſing a thouſand outragious, and unmannerly expreſſions againſt <hi>Venieri.</hi> This Inſolence, capable to provoke the moſt Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Moderate Temper; ſo lively touched this Old Commander; that he cauſed this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, to be ſeized with three of his Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and hang'd them all four, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tryal, at the Yards end, of his Gally; notwithſtanding the entreaties of <hi>Paul Sforza,</hi> in whoſe Regiment <hi>Mutio</hi> was a Captain; and without giving advice of it to <hi>Don John.</hi> This Prince, nettled at ſo violent and haſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, aſſembled his Council, to ſeek means of Revenge, for an affront, of which he was the more ſenſible, by his ſecret hatred of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Some <hi>Spaniards,</hi> too fierce and open Enemies to <hi>Venieri,</hi> and the Republick, would have him puniſhed in the ſame manner, and with this ſame haſt, he had uſed in the behalf of theſe four Perſons; affirming the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, could not be otherwiſe revenged, which he had offered the Supream Authority; and that the death of the guilty Perſon, was the only Vengeance which would coſt leaſt Blood. <hi>Don John</hi> would have willingly followed this ſevere Counſel, had not <hi>Colonni</hi> ſpeedily ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, there was more Malignity, than Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in taking ſo cangerous a Party. This Wiſe Commander, having exactly informed himſelf about <hi>Mutio</hi>'s Execution; and the manner, after which the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> pretended to draw their ſatisfaction; went directly to <hi>Don John,</hi> at Midnight; this Affair requiring an extream Diligence. He found him in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96181:139"/>
Paſſion, and threatning to leave to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, ſuch a Terrible Example, that ſhould for ever put a ſtop to ſuch Irregular Attempts. <hi>Colonni</hi> entred immediately into his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; found <hi>Venieri</hi>'s Action worthy of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and more raſh and injudicious, than had bin yet repreſented: He afterwards uſed all his Rhetorick and Prayers, to mitigate his Cholor; by ſhewing him an Affair as this was, muſt not be undertaken, in the firſt Motions of Paſſion. All the World will acknowledge, ſays he, that <hi>Venieri</hi> deſerves Death; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, it does not follow, you are obliged to diſpatch him, without examining the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it. You muſt firſt fight the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> if you be reſolved to follow the violent Counſels, which are offered you, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the common Cauſe. The Republick's Fleet, conſiſting of Fifty Gallies, will defend him; without examining, whether he has right or wrong; yours being leſs numerous, you ought to miſtruſt the event of ſo Bloudy a Conteſt. But ſuppoſing, you conquer them, what Comfort will you reap thereby, in redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing by this means, the Affairs of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> into the moſt deplorable Eſtate imaginable. Will you ſuffer ſo good Beginnings, which promiſe you Immortal Honour, to terminate in ſuch a ſad and miſerable end? Will you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Eſteem of ſo many Princes, and the Love of their People, which will on this Action, change into Hatred and Curſes? En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little into your ſelf, let your Reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it ſelf, and know that in overcoming
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96181:140"/>
your Paſſion, you will acquire as great Glory, as ſubduing one of the Infidels Countries. Conſult not your Power, nor the greatneſs of the affront offered you, but conſider the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Affairs; and be perſwaded, you will be eſteemed the Wiſeſt Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> when being able to obtain ſatisfaction to your juſt Paſſion, you ſacrifice your reſentment, to the Intereſts of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>

                     <hi>Don John</hi> yielded to theſe Reaſons, on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Venieri</hi> ſhould never preſent himſelf before him. He hated him before this Affair hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, for ſo ſeldom making his Court to him, and not demeaning himſelf according to certain Punctilio's of Reſpect, and ſervile Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies, which pleaſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pride. He was a true <hi>Tarpolian,</hi> that underſtood his buſineſs, but could not ſcrew himſelf into all the crin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and flattering ſhapes of Courtiers; and therefore paſt for a rude ſort of a Man. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonni</hi> went afterwards to <hi>Barbarigo,</hi> who, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had not the Title of General, was never the leſs conſiderable in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army; and whom the Senate had choſen to repair by his Prudence and Gentleneſs, the Faults which <hi>Venieri</hi> might poſſibly commit. This Prudent Magiſtrate thanked <hi>Colonni</hi> for the Service he came now from rendring the Republick, and aſſembled at the ſame time the Council. All People were of advice, that <hi>Venieri</hi> ſhould not be preſent with <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> leſt ſome new Action ſhould divide the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and make them fail of the occaſion of giving Battle; and that <hi>Barbarigo</hi> ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96181:140"/>
his place, in the General's Conferences. Withall my heart, anſwered <hi>Venieri</hi> briskly; but I for my part too pretend, that young Man, and all of his Humour and Council, forbear coming into my ſight. This Affair having bin happily ended, by the addreſs and care of <hi>Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> the Fleet continued its courſe, and ranged it ſelf into order of Battel, for fear of ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal; and to the end every one might quit and return to his Poſt according to the ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences without diſorder and Confuſion. This diſpoſal having ſomewhat retarded the Fleet, ſhe arrived not till the next morning at <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> were ſhe caſt Anchor two days in the <hi>Alexandrine</hi> Port, to learn News of the <hi>Mahometans. Venieri</hi> received Letters in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving from <hi>Caballo,</hi> dated from <hi>Candia,</hi> which gave him advice of the ſurrender of <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> and the Cruelty of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who had inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly maſſacred <hi>Baglioni,</hi> with the Valiant Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the place, and barbarouſly put to Death <hi>Bragadin,</hi> againſt the right of Nations, and the publick Faith. All the Soldiers, gnaſhing their Teeth, at the relation of this Barbarity, urgently demanded, to be led to revenge the death of theſe generous <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the exultations, wherewith their Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners were filled, at the ſurrender of ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a place.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> having caſt Anchor at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> underſtood that the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Corfou,</hi> came upon them with Full Sayl. They were hardly brought to believe this, as not comprehending whence this new
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96181:141"/>
Courage ſhould come to them. They had ſo long bin in poſſeſſion of the Seas, without the leaſt diſturbance, and were ſo prejudiced in their opinion, concerning the pitiful condition of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet, that they could not imagine them Couragious enough, to challenge them to an Engagement. Their Generals, whom this report had ſtrangely alarm'd, immediately coming from their aſtoniſhment, ſent forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Barks into all the Ports of this Gulph, to bring them Seamen and Soldiers. They were much perplexed what to do. <hi>Perteau</hi> was by no means for hazarding a Battel, and an advantage which they poſſeſſed without ſtriking a Stroak: but the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> having laid on him a contrary order, and he making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reſponſable, for the event of this in-excuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was for knowing the opinion of the Chief Officers, before he declared his own. The Wiſeſt amongſt them could ſee no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood of Succeſs, in accepting the defiances of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet, confident in their Strength and Bravery; yet <hi>Selim</hi> would be diſpleaſed, and enraged perhaps, at this their wary Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hali,</hi> whoſe Age and Temper did not ſuit with ſuch a Prudent Conduct, and ſeconded by thoſe who aſpired after bold Attempts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the Affront offered the <hi>Muſulmen,</hi> by deliberating whether the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were to be engaged, who offered them what they ever paſſionately deſired. We muſt, ſaid he, be as mean Sprited as thoſe People, whom we have ſo often beaten, both at Sea and Land, to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96181:141"/>
a moment, in going to receive them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been in ſearch of them on the Coaſts of <hi>Sicily,</hi> they not daring to appear. It ſeems, as if 'twere we, who have bin chaſed, tho' during the whole Campaign, we have won Cities from 'em, ravag'd their Fields, and ſunk and taken ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their Veſſels, with an Army always Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, and ſeconded by the good Fortune of our Invincible Monarch; yet we heſitate, we tremble, and would colour over our Cowardiſe, with a chimerical and falſe Prudence. And if the Enemies become Maſters of the Entrance of this Gulph, we ſhall keep our ſelves like Women, ſhut up in our Ports, expoſed to the Scorn and Laughter of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who according to the Rules of War, will not fail to beſiege ſome Maritime place, to draw us to a Combat. Shall we ſuffer the Tributary Cities to be laid Waſt and taken, without ſuccoring them? What will <hi>Europe,</hi> attentive to the event of this War, think of us? Shall we ſuffer (having ſo often defeated the <hi>Chriſtians)</hi> it to be be reported throughout the World, That the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> has made us at length abandon the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Archipelago.</hi> God and his Holy Prophet preſerve us from ſo great Infamy, and grant that the Sultan, who repreſents the Divinity on Earth, be not infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of our irreſolvedneſs. If we be not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to renounce the Advantages which we come from obtaining, let us not at leaſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Victorys of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes on the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and fall into ſuch a meanneſs, as may ſully their Memory, as well as the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96181:142"/>
Reign of <hi>Selim.</hi> Have we forgotten, that <hi>Piali</hi> loſt the Command of this Fleet, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving omitted to purſue the Enemies, although he put himſelf in a poſture to do it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came culpable, only by the Winds Fault? A Soveraign ſo jealous of the Reputation of his Arms, will bluſh at our Waveringneſs, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us for it, as we deſerve. For, in fine, we ought only to deliberate how to ſpare our Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Bloud, and not doubt of Combating and Vanquiſhing our Enemies.</p>
                  <p>This Diſcourſe moved thoſe that were of a contrary advice, and <hi>Perteau</hi> himſelf was drawn thereby to prefer, what ſeem'd honourable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what was ſafe and profitable. They were told, that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet had already got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten above the Iſle of <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> they therefore ſent the <hi>Corſary Caracoſſa,</hi> Famous for his Valour and Skil, to learn more particular, and certain news. He took a Skiff, and drew ſo near the <hi>Cbriſtians,</hi> under the favour of a dark Night, that he could tell every Veſſel: He found not their Fleet ſo ſtrong, as 'twas imagined; and returned ſull of joy, to aſſure the Baſſa's, that the Enemies Forces conſiſted only of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten Sayl. 'Tis true, he could diſcover no more, and that the reſt of the Gallies and other Veſſels lay at Anchor in different Roads. The <hi>Turks</hi> flattering themſelves already with a Victory, immediately weighed Anchor, to cut the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhort in their paſſage, whom they imagin'd too weak, to dare to expect them. Two Hundred Gallies, and near Sixty and Ten Frigats, and other Veſſels, compoſed the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:96181:142"/>
Fleet, therein comprehending the Sixty Sayl, which were diſcovered making towards <hi>Modon,</hi> and which rejoyn'd them in the Night, unknown to the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The <hi>Barbarians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving there were but an hundred and ten Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the Confederate Fleet, came in ſearch of it, with great Confidence and Triumph.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> parted from the Port <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drine</hi> the ſame day, being the Second of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and ordered themſelves in the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> as if the hour of Combat had bin agreed upon by them and the Enemy. Yet they deſpaired of fighting them, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted only the advantage of daring them to it. The two Fleets, thus deceived, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves engaged, by a fatal neceſſity, to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Combat, notwithſtanding the foreſight of the Generals. The <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who had, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Night, got a little beyond the Gulph, caſt Anchor at <hi>Galengo,</hi> and ours, who advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced further, caſt Anchor between <hi>Petala</hi> and the <hi>Curſolary</hi> Iſlands. The two Fleets quitted their Poſts by break of day, the next morning, without each others knowledge; and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> more minding their Preparations for a Fight, than their Courſe, ranged themſelves in order of Battel, and divided their whole Force into four Squadrons. The Right Wing, which reached towards the Sea, conſiſted of Fifty Four Gallies, and was commanded by <hi>John Andrew Doria. Auguſtin Barbarigo</hi> was at the Head of the Left Wing, with a like number of Gallies. <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> commanded the main Body, conſiſting of Sixty one Veſſels,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96181:143"/>
having on each hand of him <hi>Colonni</hi> and <hi>Venieri.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Urbin</hi>'s Son, joyned the Captain Gally of the Church, being on board that of the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and <hi>Alexander Parma,</hi> that of the <hi>Venetians</hi> on the Admiral of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>Genoa. Peter Juſtiniani,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Gallies of <hi>Maltha,</hi> and <hi>Paul Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> were at the two ends of this Line. The Marquis of St. <hi>Cruce</hi> commanded a reſerved body of Sixty Sayl, to help thoſe who had moſt need. <hi>John de Cardone</hi> preceded the whole Army, with a Squadron of eight Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, to make diſcoveries. He was ordered to be at no greater diſtance from the Fleet, than four hours Sayl, to ſend notice to the <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo,</hi> as ſoon as ever he ſaw the Infidels, and immediately return and re-joyn the Army. The Six <hi>Venetian</hi> Galleaſſes made a kind of a vantguard, on deſign to diſconcert the Enemy, by the Fire of their Artillery, which carryed very far. The Confederates Veſſels were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, for fear they ſhould take in the Fight particular Reſolutions; and 'twas decreed they ſhould mix, that they might ſhare the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Honour, and mutually animate each other to combat well, and ingage the ſtrongeſt to help the weak. The ſame Veſſels were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and ſent away, of which there were a prodigious number, to remove all hope from the Soldiers of ſaving themſelves otherwiſe, than by defending their Gallies. Although the Veſſels of Burden were well equipt and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by good Soldiers and Artillery, yet 'twas not thought fitting they ſhould enter into the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96181:143"/>
engagement, leſt they might not be able to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the reſt of the Fleet, in caſe the Wind changed, or they wanted it.</p>
                  <p>The Two Fleets were ſeparated by the <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolaries,</hi> at Sun Riſing, ſo that one could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the other. Ours having ſtill continued their Courſe, were ap-perceived by the Infidels, who appeared alſo ſome time after in the ſame order of Battel, excepting their not having a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Body, and that their Line, by conſequence being of greater extent than ours, was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Cuſtom, drawn up in form of an Half Moon. <hi>Hali,</hi> as being chief Baſſa of the Sea, was in the midſt of the Army, on board the Admiral, directly oppoſite to <hi>Don John</hi>'s. <hi>Perteau</hi> was on one ſide of him in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gally. <hi>Louchali</hi> and <hi>Syroch,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the two Wings, faced <hi>Doria</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barigo.</hi> They were no further diſtant than ten miles from one another, when <hi>Don John</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Courſe, gave the ſign to Fight, by ſetting up the Standart, ſent to him at <hi>Naples</hi> from his Holyneſs; The Adorable Image of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> on the Croſs, curiouſly wrought on this Banner, was no ſooner diſplayed, but the the whole Army ſaluted it with ſhouts of Joy. Some bethought themſelves of advertizing this Young Prince not to expoſe himſelf too confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, in hopes of Victory, to the hazard of a Battel, the advantage of which could bring no profit to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but whoſe loſs would lay open to the <hi>Barbarians</hi> a way into <hi>Italy.</hi> But an Advice given ſo late, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, was not ſo much as hearkned to;

and <hi>Don John</hi> commanded the Soldiers ſhould be refreſhed with meat, and afterwards made to take Arms, and all things elſe prepared for a Fight. The Officers, to whom was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this care, had the leiſure of doing this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Precipitation, and Diſorder, whilſt <hi>Don John,</hi> followed by <hi>Requieſcens</hi> and <hi>Cardone,</hi> went in a Shallop from one Gally to another, to exhort the Soldiers to behave themſelves like <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> He judged of the brave diſpoſition of the Navy, by the publick Acclamations; and as ſoon as he came on board the Admiral, on deſign to harangue his People, he lookt up to the Standart, and entreated of God with Profound Humility, to grant his Protection to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by caſting Fear and Dread into the minds of the Enemies of his Holy Name. Then all the Officers gave at the ſame time a ſign for Prayers, and the whole Army on their Knees devoutly adored the Sacred Image of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 'Twas a Spectacle admirable enough, to ſee ſuch a prodigious number of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers armed to fight, and breathing nothing but Slaughter, to proſtrate themſelves in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſome looking towards Heaven, others having their Eyes fixt on Crucifixes, and all in the poſture of Suppliants, fervently praying for the Pardon of their Sins, and for the Grace to vanquiſh theſe <hi>Barbarians.</hi> This Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance might make ſome ſuſpect, that ſeized with Fear and Dread, they had no other hopes but in the extrordinary aſſiſtance of Heaven; had not the Valour and Courage they ſhewed in this Rencounter, ſufficiently juſtified their Humility and Devotion.</p>

Theſe Sacred Solemnities being over, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains repreſented to their Men, That they were at length, come to that happy day, in which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might take Vengeance for the Outrages they had received from the Infidels; and for ever deliver themſelves from the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Yoak they would lay upon them; or open by a Glorious Death, the way to Paradiſe, and Crown themſelves to all Eternity; whereas their Enemies muſt expect the infinite Pains of Hell, if they loſt their Lives in the Fight; That God by his Mercy promiſed them in this World Riches, Pleaſures and Honours, if they ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this perilous occaſion; and Riches of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Price, if they loſt their Lives; That they ought to remember the impatient and earneſt expectation, which all <hi>Europe</hi> had ſhewed for the union of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes; and with what Horrour they deteſted their Miſ-underſtandings and Diviſions; That they ſaw themſelves at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the utmoſt of their wiſhes; That their Army was filled with the braveſt and moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Youth of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> That they were now in a Condition, to teſtifie to their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as well as the Infidels, that it has not been hitherto through the want of Courage or Prudence they have been worſted, ſeeing their particular Miſ-underſtandings have been the onely cauſe, That the <hi>Barbarians</hi> had ever made their Profit of theſe Diviſions; and that now God by his Grace, had given the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prelat, and the reſt of the Confederates, a Spirit of Peace and Concord, who would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo give them Strength and Courage againſt the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96181:148"/>
Profaners of his Name; That the <hi>Turks</hi> puffed up with Pride at their advantages in the laſt Campaign, diſdainfully offered a Combat, when they might end the War by keeping themſelves peaceably in their Ports; That God ſtruck them with ſo great Blindneſs, on purpoſe to deliver them to the juſt Reſentments of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> reſolved on a ſtrenuous Attack, confident of Victory, and animated to revenge the Death of their Brethren, on their cruel Murtherers; That this numerous Fleet, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Soldiers and Seamen, was now falling a Prey into the hands of thoſe, whom ſhe thought to terrifie by the multitude of their Veſſels; That they were intereſſed to fight, not only for the ſake of a Victory, but to ſave what they eſteemed moſt dear and precious; That the Liberty of all <hi>Italy,</hi> was in their hands, with the Honour and Lives of their Wives and Children, and that they themſelves would be taken and ſold, if their Valour made not all theſe Diſgraces fall on the Heads of their Enemies.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the two Fleets drew near to one another, and that of the <hi>Turks</hi> was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a favourable Wind, but which fell a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the Fight began, as if Fortune would make all advantages equal, by preparing a great Calm, on ſo remarkable a day. But it blew a little afterwards in favour of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> and carryed the ſmoak of their Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the Faces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army; ſo that this Change was lookt on as a kind of Miracle, and an aſſiſtance ſent from Heaven. The Prieſts,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96181:148"/>
amongſt whom were ſome Religious <hi>Capucins,</hi> exhorted the Soldiers with Crucifixes in their Hands, aſſuring them the Change of the Wind was an infallible mark of protection of the God of Hoſts, whoſe Enſigns they ought to follow with Confidence. The Soldiers anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by theſe Diſcourſes, went to fight with as great Contempt of Death as hopes of Victory, (ſtrong Motives to awaken Strength and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.) The <hi>Mahometans</hi> having ſeen our Fleet make up to them above the <hi>Curſolary</hi> Iſlands, were ſtrangely aſtoniſhed at it. They were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſurprized at ſo bold a March. But when they perceived the prodigious number of Veſſels, which they did not ſuſpect, they felt themſelves ſtruck with a terrible Terror. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,</hi> amongſt the reſt, began to bewayl his Misfortune, and was ſorry he had engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſo great danger, for the humouring of young raſh Heads. But 'twas no longer time to muſe on any other Remedy, than the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of making a ſtrenuous Reſiſtance, or periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When the two Fleets drew near at the diſtance of a Mile, <hi>Hali</hi> fired one of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Pieces, to have the Honour of beginning the Action; and <hi>Don John</hi> at the ſame time anſwered him in like manner from his Gally. The <hi>Turks</hi> ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing alſo the Air with Shouts, accompanyed with the noiſe of Drums and Trumpets, and other Warlike Inſtruments, made up directly to the ſix Galeaſſes, who were advanced, and ranged two by two before the Fleet. The terrible Fire from theſe Floating Caſtles, put a ſtop to the courſe of the Infidels,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96181:149"/>
and made them ſlacken their pace. Some of their Veſſels driven out of their order by the firſt Diſcharge, quitted their Ranks, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled themſelves with thoſe which were to ſupply their places, ſo that both of them remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned expoſed to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Cannon. Had this Avantguard been leſs diſtant from the Body of the Battel, and we charged the <hi>Barbarians</hi> on this firſt Diſorder, there might have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a great and ſpeedy Victory. But the Gallies being obliged to march in a Front, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced but ſlowly, and left too great a diſtance between them and the Galeaſſes. As ſoon as the two Armies were within Cannon Shot, both Fleets fired ſo faſt, that the obſcurity of the Air, cauſed by a thick Cloud, encreaſed the Horrour, which ſo dreadful a noiſe made in all parts. The Officers and Soldiers, ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Darkneſs, confuſedly mixt, and threatned with the ſame danger, could no longer diſtinguiſh one another. Some <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies, who would have gotten betwixt the Galeaſſes, having drawn too near the Land, to attack them in the Flank, fell into a grievous diſorder, ſo that <hi>Barbarigo,</hi> who commanded the Left Wing, firſt charged them, and drove them violently towards the Shoar. <hi>Siroch,</hi> who commanded the Enemies Right Wing, was pent up between a Promontory called <hi>Moleſegno</hi> and the <hi>Curſolarys,</hi> and ſaw himſelf ſet upon by our Gallies on the ſide of the full Sea. But ſome of his Gallies having made a vigorous attempt to cut through our Right Wing, charged the <hi>Venetians</hi> with the greateſt Valour imaginable.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96181:149"/>
This Effort of theirs would have endangered the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Gallies, had not ſome of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Frigats, diſmayed at the firſt Attack, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fly towards the Land. The two Fleets had as yet only fired their great Peices, with which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were better ſtored than the <hi>Turks,</hi> and whoſe uſe they knew better than they. They had amongſt others, certain Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a new Invention, whoſe ſurprizing effect much contributed to the gaining of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Theſe were a kind of Mortar Pieces, which falling into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſels, made a horrible Slaughter. The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Broad Sides, continued the Fight with Musket Shot; the <hi>Turks</hi> anſwering them with Darts and Arrows. But theſe kind of Arms are generally laid by, as being of no great Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. 'Tis true, a Man cannot uſe a Musket with that readineſs; but then on the other hand, they do greater execution. Ours had ſheltered themſelves by thick Planks on the ſide of their Gallies, which ſerved for a kind of Wall, which received the Enemies Shot, and behind which they threw ſeveral artificial Fires. Beſides they were moſt of them armed with Head and Back Pieces; whereas the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, on the contrary, preſented themſelves naked. But that which contributed moſt to their Defeat was, <hi>Don John</hi> publiſhing a little before their Fight, by the advice of the two other Generals, that liberty ſhould be given to all the Slaves, condemned for their Crimes to the Gallies, if they obtained the Victory. The Captains at the ſame time ſet them looſe,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96181:150"/>
giving them Arms, to deſerve, by couragious Endeavours, the recompence which was now promiſed them. Some from the hopes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from their Slavery, others breathing Pillage, according to their natural Inclination to Theft, leapt into the Enemies Gallies, through Swords and Darts, with a Valour, ſo determined, that <hi>Don John</hi> made good his Word to them. But if this Expedient was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, it proved alſo very prejudicial, for by this means the Gallies were not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to purſue the vanquiſhed. The Infidels, who bethought themſelves of promiſing as much to their Slaves, did not draw thence the ſame advantage. Their Gallies being full of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> ſo ill handled, that they look't upon their Death as the lighteſt of their Miſeries. But theſe people became as furious as Wild Beaſts eſcaped out of their Dens, where they had bin long ſhut up, ſeized on the Arms of thoſe who had bin killed at the ſame Inſtant, and on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever came to their Hands; and being far more animated by Revenge, than hopes of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, maſſacred their Patrons and Officers; ſo that ſeveral <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies were loſt by the Fury and Rage of theſe deſperate People. The Fight was then very earneſt on all hands, and the Veſſels of the two Fleets mixt together, boarding one another without diſtinction, thoſe that came next to them. Both good and bad Fortune preſided in their turns in theſe ſeveral Rencounters. Some Gallies avoiding Boardings by their Lightneſs and ſwiftneſs, and Skill of their Pylots, made up to others unequal to 'em
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:96181:150"/>
in number, but far ſtronger in Soldiers and Equipage. Others, who could not diſ-engage themſelves, fought with exceſſive Courage, and with an obſtinacy without Example. One Squadron kept fighting againſt another; a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtant, two other Veſſels were ſingly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; ſome Gallies were hooked and chained to others by their Grapling Irons, and ſo pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with Cannon Shot, that the Water ruſhed into them in prodigious quantities. Two <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Veſſels purſued one <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> Two <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> further off chaſed a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gally. A Confederate Veſſel was ſurrounded by ſeveral <hi>Mahometan</hi> Friggats. Here you might ſee a Gally bereaved of her Oars; another ſo ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that ſhe was ſinking. One yielding to the Strongeſt, another eſcaping from the Hands of thoſe who thought themſelves Maſters of it. Some ſought to fly, others to vanquiſh; and the Heroick Exploits of the Combetants had already coloured the Seas with red, and filled the Veſſels with Bloud and Slaughter. <hi>Don John</hi> engaged particularly <hi>Haly's</hi> Gally. <hi>Venieri</hi> and <hi>Colonni</hi> fought each of them on their ſide with incredible Valour: Each of the Admirals were Attended with ſome Gallies, which ſupplyed 'em with Men, to fill up the places of the Dead and Wounded. Their preſence encreaſed the Courage of their Soldiers, who put forth their whole Strength to deſerve their Eſteem. The <hi>Turks</hi> ſhewed at the beginning of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment great Contempt of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them as baſe ſpirited People, whom they had always beaten, and dared not expect them.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96181:151"/>
But their Zeal for their Altars, together with the neceſſity of Vanquiſhing, rendred them ſo fierce and terrible, that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were diſmayed at the Fury with which they came to the Charge. The <hi>Mahometan</hi> Armies are only to be feared in the firſt onſet; and their Vigour abates, when the firſt Effort is ſuſtained. And in effect, they defended themſelves as People wearyed and tired out at the end of the day; and our Men, who perceived this, were the ſtrongeſt, and attackt them with the more hope and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. The Fight continued for three hours with an equal advantage, the Victory inclining to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. But the Left Wing, who were firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, began to drive all before them; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Friggats making haſtily towards the Shoar. <hi>Barbarigo,</hi> ſeconded by <hi>Quirini</hi> and <hi>Canali,</hi> ſunk <hi>Siroch</hi>'s Gally, who was kill'd, defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like a Lyon. His Death was attended with that Conſternation uſual at the loſs of a great Officer; and the Gallies which he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, vigorouſly attackt by the Republicks, fled towards the Coaſts. The <hi>Turks,</hi> who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced near the Land, for the ſafety of their Lives and Liberties, drew after them their whole Fleet, and were the cauſe of its entire Defeat. The Conduct of their Commanders was certainly much to be blamed; for thoſe who underſtand Maritime Affairs, ſay, they ſhould have kept out as far as they could at Sea, that their numerous Fleet might have the more room, and to make their Soldiers loſe ſight of Land, who had an Eye to the Shoar, as their place of Refuge. The good News of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96181:151"/>
ſpreading it ſelf amongſt the Confederates Fleet, came to the Ears of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> who had been long engaged with the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Admiral <hi>Haly,</hi> without loſing or winning any Advantage; Yet the Infidels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſlacken their Courage; when the Joy which this News brought to <hi>Don John,</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the Jealouſie he had conceived againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who firſt made the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory appear on their ſides and carry'd away from him this Honour. This Sentiment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Valour, they fired more fiercely on the Admiral. <hi>Hali</hi> fell down dead with a Musket Shot, in encouraging his People by his example, to bear up againſt this vigorous Attack. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> immediately boarded his Gally, taking down his Standart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters of his Veſſel. <hi>Don John</hi> at the ſame time made them cry Victory, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the reſt of his Men, and terrifie the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.</hi> 'Twas no longer then a Fight, but a cruel Maſſacre of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who ſuffer'd their Throats to be cut without reſiſtance. <hi>Doria</hi> and <hi>Louchali,</hi> the two Famouſeſt Captains of their Age, ſet one againſt another, and excited by equal Emulation, had both the ſame Deſign as ſoon as they ſaw the two Fleets engaged, which was to get out to Sea, and come and charge behind, and in the Flanks. But <hi>Doria</hi> having not Veſſels enough to make a Front, equal to that of the Infidels, gained the Sea with all his Gallies. Eight of the Republicks Friggats, whoſe Captains miſtruſted his ſincer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and imagined he was ſhifting for himſelf,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96181:152"/>
according to the event of the day, ſtood ſtill with their Oars lifted up; and five others, who knew not the occaſion of this ſtop, ſtood alſo ſtill, according to their example, between the Squadron of <hi>Doria</hi> and the Body of the Fleet. <hi>Louchali</hi> perceiving his meaſures broken by <hi>Doria</hi>'s dexterous Foreſight, inveſted theſe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as they lay ſtill without motion. The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> though unequal in number, defended themſelves with admirable Valour, and were all worſted and put to the Sword. <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chali</hi> remained Maſters of their Veſſels, and revenged <hi>Doria</hi> by this Advantage, from the ſuſpicions entertain'd of his Conduct. He was for going afterwards to ſet upon the great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Fleet; but he found the brave <hi>Peter Juſtiniani</hi> in his way, who ſeconded by the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> with two of their Gallies, had already ſunk down three of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and narrowly purſued a Third. He was environed from all parts, and loſt all his Men. A <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officer, by whom he was happily known, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leapt into his Gally, was ſo generous, as to ſave his Life; but he was at the ſame time ſuccoured, and re-taken with his Gally from the Infidels; ſo that this Officer being become his Priſoner, begged quarter of him on his Knees, and obtained both his Liberty and Life at his Interceſſion. In the mean time <hi>Loucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi> came with the Fierceneſs of a Conquerour, to ſuſtain the main brunt of the Battel. But <hi>Doria,</hi> thinking it at laſt, time to ſhare in the Victory, which was already gained, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned his diſtant Poſt, and ſtruck in with his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:96181:152"/>
whole Right Wing amongſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who began to turn their Backs. The <hi>Marquis</hi> of St. <hi>Cruce</hi> commanding the reſerved Body, purſued them with the ſame vigour, as ſoon as the ſmoak would permit him to ſee what was to be done. <hi>Louchali,</hi> who only ſet himſelf to watch advantages, and had not fought regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, underſtanding the Death of <hi>Haly,</hi> and ſeeing no Flag on his Gally, doubted no longer of his Defeat. He clapt on all his Sayl and fled, followed by Thirty Gallies, as ſoon as he perceived <hi>Doria</hi> and the Marquis of St. <hi>Cruce</hi> endeavouring to come on him. The reſt of his Veſſels were taken or ſunk. And from that time the vanquiſhed ceaſed from all reſiſtance. Some <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſels were run on Shoar; and <hi>Perteau,</hi> without being known, eſcaped in a ſmall Boat through the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Gallies. <hi>Paul Urſin</hi> ſeized on his Gally by a particular Accident. He came from taking the firſt Veſſel he had boarded, when he was obliged by a falſe Alarm to quit his Prize and Poſt, to ſuccour <hi>Don John,</hi> whom he believed to be in great danger. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been diſabus'd by the Rout of the Infidels, he met with <hi>Perteau</hi>'s Gally, which was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſave her ſelf by force of Oars, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her Decks, and made himſelf Maſter of her. That which carryed <hi>Haly</hi>'s two Sons, and which kept on ſide the Admiral, ran againſt <hi>Colonni</hi>'s Gally with ſuch violence, that ſhe made her quit her Rank; but was her ſelf ſo plyed with the Cannon, by two of our Frig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, from which ſhe endeavor'd to eſcape, that theſe two young Lords were taken Priſoners,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96181:153"/>
with their Veſſel and Equipage. <hi>Colonni</hi> ſet on the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Admiral with as great Boldneſs and Courage, as if his Gally had never been damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and took a <hi>Brigantine,</hi> which attack't him in the Flank, all whoſe Soldiers he put to the Sword. <hi>Ramagſio Sequani,</hi> a Commander of the order of <hi>Malta,</hi> well experienced in the Seas, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd himſelf in this occaſion by as great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour as Prudence. General <hi>Venieri,</hi> who went continually from one end of his Gally to the other, often expoſed himſelf to eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, with his Sword and Buckler. He earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſhed to encounter ſome Infidel, and make him fall under his Blows; and neither of the Generals ſhewed in the heat of the Fight more Courage and Stout heartedneſs than this Old Commander.</p>
                  <p>The Infidels loſt thirty thouſand Men in this Engagement, the Bloudyeſt they ever felt ſince the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. Five Thouſand were taken Priſoners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amongſt whom were <hi>Haly</hi>'s Two Sons. Their Father was for giving them the ſight of the Flight and rout of the Allys, which he thought unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; to inſpire them with the ſame Contempt and Diſdain againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> which he had: and make them learn Military Experience at the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> coſt; but had he never ſo little miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted his ill fortune, he would have left them in the Town of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> or permitted them to be Spectators only of the Fight at a diſtance on the Shoar. The Conquerors made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of an Hundred and Thirty <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies; Fourſcore and Ten, or thereabouts were
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96181:153"/>
run on Ground, ſunk or burnt. But the Liberty which Twenty Thouſand <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves of different Nations recovered, gave as much Joy to the Confederates, as the loſs of theſe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. The Booty was no leſs conſiderable; for beſides the Pillage of the Iſles, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> had moreover laden themſelves with that of ſeveral Merchants Veſſels, which they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the Seas. The Booty was ſhared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Soldiers, excepting the Priſoners, the Gallies, and Artillery. This was without doubt a Signal Victory, and the greateſt which has been won from them on the Seas this ſix Ages. This Battle was fought in the ſame Gulph, and almoſt in the ſame place, where <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus</hi> defeated <hi>Marc Antony</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opatra;</hi> and whatſoever Elogiums Ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have made on this Victory, 'tis hard to know which of the Two was moſt Famous. The Firſt carryed it by the number of Veſſels, the Fame and Magnificence of the Preparations, and the great Concourſe of ſeveral Nations. But this ſurpaſſed in the good Condition of its Gallies, the length of its Action, and the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Obſtinacy of the Combatants. <hi>Marc Antony</hi>'s Flight immediately put his Enemy in poſſeſſion of the Victory; and <hi>Don John</hi> diſputed it a long time before he could obtain it, and loſt more Men, though he drew not ſo great Advantage by it as the Emperor, <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> loſt eight thouſand of the Stouteſt Men in their Fleet. Twenty Captains of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies loſt their Lives, moſt of them being of the Ancienteſt Families in the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96181:154"/>
Republick; amongſt whom we may reckon the Three Brethren, Grand-Children to <hi>Lewis Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Sober. Louchali</hi> had attackt their Gally, and their Governour, who ſeized on a Skiff, to get two of them away from the Danger, could never obtain of them their Conſent to forſake the Third, who could not follow them by reaſon of his Wounds. They dyed with their Arms in their hands near the place where their Brother lay expiring, and ſignaliz'd at the ſame time their Fidelity and Tenderneſs. Several other conſiderable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were alſo loſt, and eſpecially on board the Generals Gallies, who were moſt fiercely enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, amongſt whom is not to be forgotten <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian Gratiani,</hi> a Young Gentleman of great Courage and Hopes, who was killed by a Musket ſhot in the Head, and fell dead at <hi>Colonni</hi>'s Feet. The Author of this Hiſtory ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Reader will give him the liberty of rendring this Teſtimony of Love to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Brother, who deſerved a more happy deſtiny. But <hi>Barbarigo</hi> was alone as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted as all the others together. He had broke the Enemies Right Wing, and animated his Men to purſue them. But expoſing himſelf too deſperately, he was ſtruck into the Eye with an Arrow, with which he dyed ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Arms of his dear Friends. He askt in dying news how the day went, and of the State of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet; and having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were utterly defeated, he lifted up his hands to Heaven, and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred up his Soul in Peace, making Signs, that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96181:154"/>
he dyed content, after ſo glorious an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. He was worthy, without doubt, of the greateſt Honour, for by his Prudent Conduct the Confederates were brought to fight the <hi>Turk;</hi> and he behaved himſelf in the whole Action with incredible Valour and Courage. He gave the firſt charge, and firſt routed the Enemy. But the Immortal Glory which he now enjoys, is a far greater Recompence than the Praiſes and Honours which could be given him on Earth.</p>

                     <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> after <hi>Haly</hi>'s Death, and the taking of his Gally, attended by <hi>Venieri</hi> and <hi>Colonni,</hi> and ſeveral others, who had no longer any Enemy to encounter, went on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating their Victory, whereſoever they found any ſtill reſiſting. The Fight laſted from five in the Morning till the cloſe of the Evening. The Darkneſs of the Night, and the Sea, which began to grow troubleſom, obliged the Conquerours to retire with the Captive Gallies, into the Neighbouring Ports. Such as were wounded were carefully lookt after. The next Day and Night were ſpent in rejoycing and Thankſgiving to God. <hi>Don John</hi> forgat his Animoſity, embraced <hi>Venieri</hi> with great Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Friendſhip, and told him in moſt obling terms, how much he admired the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Valour which he ſhewed in ſo great Age. But this new Friendſhip laſted not long.</p>
                  <p>'Twas reſolved the next morning by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſent, to purſue the vanquiſhed, and not give them the leaſure of coming to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Don John</hi> being grown more enterpriſing
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96181:155"/>
ſince this great Victory, deſign'd to leave the Sick and Wounded at <hi>Corfou,</hi> with whatſoever was cumberſom in the Fleet; to take an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Gallies, to equip them with the Spoils of others, and beſiege the Town of <hi>Lepanto.</hi> The Conſternation of the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> made him believe the place would ſurrender as ſoon as it ſaw his Enſigns. He deſign'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to encourage the <hi>Greeks</hi> to an Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whom the defeat of the <hi>Turks</hi> had ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to a Revolt, and expected only ſome ſmall Aſſiſtance to declare themſelves. This Project was well contrived, and the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious the Confederates could form in this War. But <hi>Venieri's</hi> troubleſom humour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily broke all the meaſures of it. 'Twas decreed that the Generals ſhould diſpatch the next morning all together Couriers to <hi>Pius</hi> V. to give him notice of the Victory obtained of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which his Holyneſs ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards impart to all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes; and that <hi>John Baptiſta Contareni,</hi> who was going to <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhould tranſport the Couriers as far as <hi>Otrante. Venieri,</hi> who was for this opinion, afterwards conſidered the Senate would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo great News too late, and thought it would be well taken from him, ſhould they have an account before the Pope. <hi>Humphry Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani</hi> came to him by chance, as he rowled this deſign in his Head. He was a young Officer, very enterprizing, and ready to put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on immediately whatſoever orders were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him <hi>Venieri</hi> no ſooner ſaw him, but he found his deſires ſharpned with a new edge,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:96181:155"/>
and demanded of him whether his Gally was in a condition to part for <hi>Venice,</hi> and he in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to make this Voyage. <hi>Juſtiniani</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, he was ready to receive his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; whereupon <hi>Venieri</hi> put his diſpatches into his hands. This Officer at the ſame time went on board his Gally, and hoyſted Sayl. <hi>Don Jobn</hi> took this Affair far more haniouſly than it deſerved, and his ſpite paſſed ſo far, that he revenged himſelf on the common Cauſe, by giving over his deſign on the Town of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> and that of raiſing Commotions in the <hi>Morea,</hi> for tacking immediately about, he ſtruck out to Sea, to arrive at <hi>Corfou.</hi> All the Fleet were not over much troubled at this change of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; for as well the general as particular Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and <hi>Venieri</hi> himſelf, were more deſirous to return home, to ſhew the Spoils taken from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> to their Countrymen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to them the part which each of them had in the Victory, than to continue the War; and this impatience made them loſe all the Fruit of ſo Glorious an Undertaking. Yet it being ſhameful to remain idle in the midſt of a Victory, 'twas propoſed to attack, by the way, the Iſle of <hi>Leucade,</hi> at preſent called St. <hi>Maure,</hi> after the Name of its Principal Church; and <hi>Proſper Colonni,</hi> a valiant young Captain, was ordered to go before, and view the place. <hi>Venieri</hi> ſecretly traverſed this Project, hoping to carry the place alone, without the help of the Confederates. He ſent, for this effect, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to young <hi>Colonni,</hi> who received the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks Pay, to diſſwade <hi>Don John</hi> from this
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96181:156"/>
enterpriſe, by ſetting before him the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, as well for its numerous Garriſon, as the Situation and Strength of the place. There needed no more to drive off People from an Attempt, when they were fo earneſtly bent to return home. As ſoon as the Fleet were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened at <hi>Corfou,</hi> the Gallies and Artillery gained from the Infidels, were divided between the Generals, each of them having a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Share, according to the charge they had been at. They came afterwards to the dividing of the Priſoners; but <hi>Don John</hi> pretended eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tenth Man belonged to him, on account of his quality of General: 'twas agreed to refer the Arbitrage of that Controverſie to the Pope, who ordered the moſt conſiderable of them ſhould be brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> to exchange them for <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves, and the reſt equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between <hi>Don John</hi> and the other two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. This Holy Prelate was ſtruck with Horror at the Propoſition, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> made him, of cutting the Throats of theſe Wretches; for fear, ſaid they, that when they be redeemed, they uſe the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with greater Barbarity. But <hi>Pius</hi> V. on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecured them in convenient places of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and endeavoured to win them to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion by ways of gentleneſs and good uſage. <hi>Colonni</hi> would not ſuffer <hi>Don John</hi> to part from <hi>Corfou,</hi> till he had co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

earneſt, he abounded mightily in his own Sence, and was too ready and active for a Man of his years. They afterwards went both of them to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> whence <hi>Colonni</hi> parted for <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Don John</hi> to Winter at <hi>Palerma,</hi> where People came from all parts to congratulate him on the Advantages he had obtained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Juſtiniani</hi> charged with Packets from his General, made ſuch good haſt, that he arrived the ninth day at <hi>Venice.</hi> He ſaluted, according to uſual cuſtom, the Caſtles which defended the entrance of the Port, with all his Guns. This noiſe immediately drew down along the Banks of the great Channel, infinite numbers of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, inquiſitive to hear ſome news of the Fleet. At the ſame time a Friggat was perceived ſet forth with <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Colours, the end of which hung into the Sea, at which ſight the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants conceived great hopes, and filled the Air with Shouts of Joy. <hi>Juſtiniani</hi> drawing near the place of St. <hi>Marc,</hi> made ſigns with his hand that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had won a ſignal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                  <p>He put off his long Robe, to march the more eaſily, and immediately landing, went ſtrait to the <hi>Doge</hi>'s Palace through this numerous Crowd. He told <hi>Moceningo,</hi> who advanced to embrace him, That the Confederates had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Infidels near the <hi>Curſolaries;</hi> That the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet had been not only defeated, but wholly ruined, and gave him an account of the number of the Gallies they had taken and ſunk. The <hi>Doge,</hi> without putting on his habit of Ceremony, went immediately to give God
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:96181:157"/>
Thanks for this Victory in the Patriarchal Church, the news of which was ſoon ſpread over the Town. The Citizens left their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Artiſts ſhut up their Shops, and all the Town ran to the publick place. The wideſt Streets were ſo crouded, that ſeveral Senators could not get room to paſs to the Church. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiniani</hi> read in the preſence of the <hi>Doge</hi> and the Senate, <hi>Venieri's</hi> Letters, made them a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relation of the Fight; and received or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give a formal account of it to the People. He ſpake aloud, That the <hi>Turks</hi> were routed; That all the Veſſels which the Sea had not ſwallowed up, were in the Conquerours Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; That there were ſlain Thirty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Barbarians;</hi> That their Admiral <hi>Haly</hi> was killed, and his Gally taken; That <hi>Perteau</hi> eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in a Skiff, accompanyed only with a Slave; That <hi>Siroch, Caracoſſa,</hi> and ſeveral other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Officers had loſt their Lives; That the two Sons of <hi>Hali,</hi> together with <hi>Mahomet Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Negrepont,</hi> were taken Priſoners, with other Perſons of Quality, and that the advantage obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was above what they could either expect or wiſh. He afterwards exhorted them to go and give thanks to Heaven, and entreat with fervent Prayers, they may never do any thing unworthy ſo great a Benefit. Then the publick Joy filling all parts of the City; People em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, as they met, though unknown to each other, with Tears in their Eyes, comparing their preſent State with the Alarms and Fears which put them not long before on fortifying the Capital City againſt the Surprizes of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96181:157"/>
Victorious Enemy. They could not conſider without trembling, that they were loſt beyond repair, had their Naval Army been routed; and the remembrance of their dangers and paſt ſufferings, made their Joy the greater. Some of the Senators endeavour'd to get through the Croud to the <hi>Doge's</hi> Palace, others made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Churches, and afterwards imparted their Joy to their Wives and Children. <hi>Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani</hi> was ſurrounded with an infinite number of People, ſome embraced him, others took him hold by the hand, and all were for hearing from his Mouth the relation of this memorable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Crowd having carryed him to his Houſe, ſo cloſely ſtopt up all Paſſages to it, that his Mother, who came from the Church, could not come near the Door, and had like to have retired with the diſpleaſure of not ſeeing her Son, had not her Tears and entreaties at length obtained way. <hi>Juſtiniani</hi> was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed for ſeveral days, and followed along the Streets with the ſame Croud as at the firſt day of his Arrival. He carryed the Mobile along with him whereſoever he went, ſo that to ſee his Train, a man would think him to be the Head of ſome Seditious Party. Never any Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> received ſo much Honour from all kind of Perſons in the Republick. He was of ſo advantagious a Stature, that he was tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler by the Head than all thoſe that ſurrounded him, and knew to expreſs himſelf ſo freely, that he won the Hearts of all his Fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens by his Eloquence. After the firſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the publick Joy, the Magiſtrates ſent
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96181:158"/>
immediately expreſſes to their Embaſſadours, eſpecially at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> to give them notice of this important News. The Senate aſſembled the next morning to order a day of publick Thankſgiving in all Churches of the City, and eſpecially that of <hi>St. Juſtin,</hi> whoſe Feſtival is kept on the Sixth of <hi>October. Guſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man de Silva,</hi> the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Embaſſadour, who was alſo a Prieſt, Celebrated <hi>Maſs</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, from whoſe hand the <hi>Doge</hi> and Principal Officers of the State communicated. 'Twas ordered by a ſolemn Decree, that for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this Victory, the People ſhould ceaſe from all kinds of Labour on that day of the year for ever, and that the <hi>Doge,</hi> accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Senate and People, ſhould aſſiſt at a Solemn <hi>Maſs,</hi> in the ſame Church of St. <hi>Juſtin.</hi> The private Joy ſucceeded to the publick, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſeveral days. The Feſtivals were ſolemnized with Juſts, Wreſtlings, and ſeveral other Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, which the ſeveral Corporations of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers preſented, in Emulation one of another. Only <hi>Barbarigo</hi> was bewayled in the midſt of this rejoycing; and Praiſes and Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Valour was given to ſeveral other <hi>Venetians,</hi> who periſhed in the Engagement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Tears. Their Families did not ſo much as go into Mourning, for fear of leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the publick Joy by Teſtimonies of private Grief.</p>
                  <p>The Pope, who ſince the departure of the Confederate Fleet, had inceſſantly made Vows and Prayers for the happy Succeſs of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> Arms, expected every day news with an
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96181:158"/>
Impatiency worthy of his Zeal. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadour came in fine to him, with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what paſt; of the entire defeat of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and loſs of their Gallies. This good Pope, animated with a new Fervor, went direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Chappel to return God Thanks, and remained long fixt on his Knees like a Statue. He imparted his joy to the Cardinals, who were then all in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> telling them, that the Bounty of Heaven was greater than he could wiſh or hope for. He afterwards gave order to make ready, againſt the next morning, the great Altar in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate there himſelf the Holy Myſteries, in the Preſence of all thoſe who were to aſſiſt at theſe Sacred Ceremonies. The whole City follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Holyneſſes Devout Example; and the other Churches were filled with Offerings and Prayers. A Thouſand Bleſſings were given to <hi>Pius</hi> V. and 'twas publickly declar'd, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> owed their Victory to the Tears he every day ſhed in the Holy Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs.</hi> In the mean while <hi>Colonni</hi> was ready to arrive at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the <hi>Pope</hi> was for making him a Reception agreeable to his Character, and the Service he came from rendring the Church. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> traverſed this Deſign, ſhewing this would be an Affront to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to pay the General of the Holy <hi>See</hi> ſuch Honours, as were only due to him alone. But the Pope deriding their Proud Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, conſulted no body but himſelf, touching the manner of receiving this Prudent Commander, to whom he had entruſted the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96181:159"/>
Conduct of his Naval Forces. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> extreamly offended, forbad all thoſe of their Nation, and who were their Creatures, from going to attend <hi>Colonni,</hi> and alſo to ſtand where they might behold his paſſage on the day of his publick Entrance. Such a diſdainful procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding encreaſed the deſire, which the <hi>Italians</hi> had of giving him an Honourable Reception. There were choſen Six Thouſand Men amongſt the Citizens, who were ranged under ſeveral Enſigns, and went in good order out of the Town. The Magiſtrates in their Robes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Horſeback this Infantry, accompanyed by the Flower of the Nobility. The Pope hereunto added three Companies of his Guard. His <hi>Major-Dome</hi> in the midſt of his Officers, and ſeveral Cardinals, concluded the Cavalcade. The Captives immediately preceded <hi>Colonni,</hi> mounted on a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jennet. He rode to the Capitol, according to the cuſtom of Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> and came back through the chief Streets of the City to the Palace of the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> His Holyneſs received him in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>'s Hall, in the preſence of ſeveral Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. He made a Speech to his Praiſe, and at the ſame time, for a Token of his Liberality, preſented him with Sixty Thouſand Crowns of Gold. He gave alſo a Rich Abby in the Town of <hi>Bonevent</hi> to his Son <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> with a promiſe of a Cardinals Hat, as ſoon as he ſhould be of Age to be received into the Sacred Colledge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Venieri</hi> finding himſelf alone at the Head of the Naval Army, beſtowed on himſelf the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:96181:159"/>
Honour of the Victory. The Praiſes he continually received, and which he ſhared to no body, ſoftned that rough Humour which he ſhewed in his bad Fortune, and blaſted the Fruit which might have been gathered from the Conſternation of the Enemy. He flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf at firſt, that nothing could be hence forward too hard for him. He reſolves to purſue <hi>Louchali,</hi> into his own Ports; to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs himſelf of the Maritime places of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> and in his own Fancy ſeem'd to threaten <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But his ſlowneſs and unreſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs ruined theſe vaſt Projects. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viditor, <hi>Phillip Bragadin,</hi> an expert Seaman, came and joyned him with fifteen Gallies the next morning, after the fight at <hi>Lepanto.</hi> He inſtantly entreated him to let him have fifty Sayl, to go in ſearch of the reſt of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Fleet, promiſing him to make great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the diſorder of the vanquiſhed, without running into any Hazard. <hi>Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri</hi> approved of his deſign, and commended his Zeal. But he deferred the execution of it, to have no Rival in the Honour, he ſo much thirſted after; and whilſt the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons had him in Hand for the curing of a ſlight hurt in his right Thigh, he would never permit any matter to be undertaken. This jealouſie was very prejudicial to the Republicks Affairs; for had the Victorious Navy only ſhewed it ſelf along the Coaſts of <hi>Greece,</hi> they of the <hi>Morea,</hi> who ſighed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nothing more than Liberty, would have thrown off the <hi>Infidels</hi> Yoak; and the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:96181:160"/>
                     <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might have drawn marvelous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from the Weakneſs and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Turks. Venieri</hi> applyed himſelf chiefly to the deſign of poſſeſſing himſelf of <hi>Leucade;</hi> at the perſwaſion of ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Officers, who repreſented to him, That the place would be eaſily taken. He had hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Don John</hi> from beſieging it, that he might conquer it alone. But <hi>James Sorancio,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Barbarigo,</hi> was not at all of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. He askt him, whether he ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the difficulty of this Enterprize; and whether he pretended, with the Republicks ſingle Forces, to poſſeſs himſelf of a place, which all the Confederates Navy, though ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by their late Victory, could not maſter. He added, that ſuppoſing no urgenter occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they ought not, in ſo doubtful a matter, to hazard the Honour they came now from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining; That they ought to attack places fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtant; That they might beſiege <hi>Leucade</hi> when they pleaſed; and that the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Corfou</hi> would always furniſh them with the means of doing it; That they ought to make a better uſe of ſo favourable a Conjuncture, by ſailing towards <hi>Lepanto,</hi> to fire the Veſſels which had ſaved themſelves in this Port, deſtitute in a manner of both Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Seamen; That afterwards they might advance towards the <hi>Morea,</hi> where the <hi>Greeks</hi> being retained only by Fear, would no ſooner ſee their Enſigns, but would range themſelves under them, and take up Arms againſt the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans;</hi> That afterwards they might ſteer
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96181:160"/>
their courſe along the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and if they could not force their paſſage by the <hi>Dardanel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> they might at leaſt alarm <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> that their greateſt advantage in this War lay in ſhewing the World, That the <hi>Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> having no more Sea Forces, kept himſelf ſhut up in his <hi>Seraglio,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet threatned the Capital City of his Empire; That having made themſelves thus Maſters of the Sea, they might ravage all the Coaſts thereabouts, and carry away whatſoever was to be tranſported to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and other Ports of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for the reparation of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet; That they might burn the Materials laid up on the Sea-Coaſts for the building of the new Gallies; That they might waſt the Iſles, and carry off Slaves for their own Gallies, and by this means, at the ſame time deprive the Infidels of the means of repairing the loſs of their Seamen or Slaves; and that this was the only way to end the War, for to incapacitate the Enemy to ſet out a new Fleet the next Spring. <hi>Sorancio</hi>'s reaſons were approved by the moſt part of thoſe that were of the Council of War; but <hi>Venieri's</hi> Heart was too much ſet upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize of <hi>Leucade,</hi> to change his mind in that matter.</p>
                  <p>There were embarkt then two Thouſand, and three Hundred <hi>Greeks,</hi> with an Hundred and Fifty <hi>Epirot</hi> Horſe, on eight and forty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, for this raſh enterprize. The Iſle of <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade</hi> is ſituated between <hi>Cephalonia</hi> and the Province of <hi>Caramania,</hi> being ſeparated only
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96181:161"/>
by a ſmall Channel, over which there is built a Bridge to ſuccour it, in caſe of need, more commodiouſly from the Land. The <hi>Turks</hi> who thought the <hi>Venetians</hi> fully ſatisfyed with their Victory, and being diſarmed at <hi>Corfou,</hi> did not expect they would undertake any thing at the end of a Campaign; and although they had cauſed to come ſeveral Troops of both Horſe and Foot for the defence of the Iſle of <hi>Leucade,</hi> yet they redoubled the Garriſon of the place, at the firſt news of the <hi>Venetians</hi> defigns, who having made a deſcent, would needs raiſe up a Battery of ſix Pieces of Cannon; but the Infidels falling with great fury from all parts upon them, <hi>Venieri</hi> was the firſt that deſpaired of effecting what he came for. He took Fifty Horſe to view the place; but the <hi>Turks</hi> ſallyed out in greater numbers, and ſo vigorouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred him, that he left ſeveral of his Men dead behind him; the reſt flying towards their Gallies in Confuſion: <hi>Venieri</hi> himſelf had like to have been taken Priſoner. This danger made him open his Eyes, and quit this Siege. As ſoon as he had re-imbarkt his Cannon, he ſent <hi>Sorancio,</hi> with ſix and thirty Gallies, to winter in <hi>Candia,</hi> and in his own paſſage to <hi>Corfou</hi> he loſt a Friggat by the way; and thus this Famous Fight produced no other Fruit but the re-taking of <hi>Supoto,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariti;</hi> whence the <hi>Turks</hi> fled, as ſoon as <hi>Paul Jourdain</hi> appeared near the Walls at the Head of Four Thouſand Men. He raſed it to the ground. Several Captains of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies publickly complained of <hi>Venieri's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,

                  <p>The People of <hi>Venice</hi> have no part in the Government of the State; and the Soveraign Authority reſides wholly in the Body of the Nobility. This Body is divided into two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Factions (a diviſion which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in great Cities) but their hatred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment do only ſhew themſelves in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the great Officers in the State. Each Party forms its Plots and Cabals to exclude one another. But 'tis forbid by Law to carry on theſe Intrigues with any kind of open ſhew, under Penalty of being treated as Diſturbers of the publick Peace. There are reckoned at <hi>Venice</hi> above twenty ancient Noble Families, diſtinguiſhed by the Rank their Anceſtors have held, who reſpect the other Gentry with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and as Perſons newly raiſed to what they are. Theſe laſt hate as much the others, as they diſ-eſteem them, and their number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt, they often times ſufficiently revenge themſelves on the others Pride; and their mutual Enmities are the more violent, by being forced to keep them lockt up in their Breaſts. <hi>Venieri</hi> was of a good Family, but oppoſite to the Faction of the Ancient Ones. <hi>James Sorancio,</hi> one of the Providitors of the Naval Army, was nobly born, and a Perſon very ambitious, who enjoyed a great Eſtate, and lived with greater Splendour than is uſual with People of quality at <hi>Venice.</hi> He was of opinion, that if <hi>Venieri</hi> was called home, he

                     </gap>e put in his place; and in this regard, wrote in cruel terms againſt him. He ſet him forth in his Letters to the Senate, as a Man, whoſe good Fortune had made him inſolent. He accuſed him for his ſluggiſhneſs in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Victory in which he had no ſhare, it being rather the Work of Heaven than that of Men, and ſpoiled all the Fruit of it by his ſoftneſs and indifferency. He affirmed that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieri</hi> had not engaged at all with the Infidels, but to make amends, was ready to fall foul on the Confederates; That his unſeaſonable ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had like to have ruined the Republick; and that had not <hi>Barbarigo</hi> oppoſed his violent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the <hi>Mahometans</hi> had not been defeated; That 'twas well for him and the Republick, that his Avarice had not put him on extending too far his Authority; That <hi>Don John</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad his coming into his preſence; and that it was impoſſible to fight advantagiouſly under the command of a Leader ſo greatly enraged againſt the Republick's General; That inſtead of dexterouſly gaining the favour of a young Prince, environed with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Council, he had drawn his hatred by his Obſtinacy, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of which could not be too ſoon remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe things were at firſt only diſcourſed of amongſt ſome of the ancient Nobility; but they were ſoon after ſpread about the whole Town. <hi>Bernard Tipoly</hi> ventured to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the calling home of <hi>Venieri,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of eaſing him of the Fatigues and Cares of his Office in favour of his great Age, by which means the Republick might prevent the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96181:162"/>
Affront of re-calling him at the purſuit of the Pope and King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Senate was the more enraged at this propoſition, that <hi>Tipoly</hi>'s Brother ſent lately Embaſſadour to <hi>Rome,</hi> a Perſon indeed of great Merit, and much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at <hi>Venice,</hi> was a little ſuſpected to aim at the Generalſhip, or at leaſt the employ of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viditor, if <hi>Sorancio,</hi> who was older than he, filled the firſt place; ſo that they both acted in conſort againſt <hi>Venieri,</hi> although with different Motives. The Friends of this laſt exclaimed againſt ſo terrible a proceſs, and complained that they made uſe of Calumnies and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures to oppreſs an Officer, whoſe Services de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved another Recompence. The Senator <hi>Soriani</hi> having met <hi>Tipoli,</hi> began to ask him, whether he could ſhew more malice and ill will, if <hi>Venieri,</hi> defeated by the Infidels, had been convicted of engaging the <hi>Turks</hi> unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly. The Republick will not puniſh a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen for keeping up the Honour of his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter againſt the Encroachments of a young raſh Prince; and you do not well to conceal (ſays he) the ſecret Envy you bear his Virtues, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the falſe ſhews of a great Zeal for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good. The Senate was angry at <hi>Tipoly</hi>'s Remonſtrances, which ſhewed with what Craft and Malignity he endeavour'd to uphold the intereſt of his Faction, and his Brothers Pretenſions. 'Tis certain he had well enough devined what would happen in the Sequel. For <hi>Don John</hi> declared a while after, he would quit the Command of the Fleet, if <hi>Venieri</hi> was not diſplaced.

the Pope to underſtand that this Old Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was of an inſupportable Humour; and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonni,</hi> who was for making himſelf agreeable to <hi>Don John,</hi> confirmed what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſaid againſt him. <hi>Pius</hi> V. who applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf continually to remove ſuch Obſtacles which might hinder the common good, wrote to the Senate to appoint another Commander. He granted that <hi>Don John,</hi> as well as <hi>Venieri,</hi> were to blame; but he was for complying in ſome meaſure with the extream averſion this Prince had for this Old Officer; and that the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick being more intereſſed in this War, ſhould be the more willing to abate ſome of her Rights; That the Diviſion of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders would ruine the progreſs of their Arms; and that they ought before all things to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the vexatious Miſ-underſtandings of the laſt Campaign, which ſprang only from light occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Remonſtrances lively toucht the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, who were otherwiſe intereſſed than <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieri,</hi> in this Affair. 'Twas a ſhame to expel a Magiſtrate from the chief employ in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, to ſatisfie the paſſion of a Stranger. After ſeveral Deliberations, during which, much was ſaid againſt the Pride of <hi>Don John,</hi> they were forced to buckle, and yield to the deſires of <hi>Pius</hi> V. But they had no regard in their choice of a new Officer, either to <hi>Soran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> or <hi>Tipoli;</hi> and as a Punniſhment to them both, for their Ambitious Pretentions, there was a General choſen out of the oppoſite Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who was <hi>James Foſcarini,</hi> a Perſon of a

bold and enterprizing Spirit, but had never went through the Offices, which ſucceſſively carry a Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> to the general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Naval Army. <hi>Venieri</hi> was left in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> with orders to watch over the Countries of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Gulph; and to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen his Diſgrace, the Senate confirmed to him the Title of Providitor General, and enjoined <hi>Foſcarini</hi> to obey him when they ſhould meet together. This Perſon lived long, as it were, forgotten by Fortune, but ſhe raiſed him at laſt in his Old Age, when he began neither to hope or miſtruſt her Favours. He had conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much Health with all the Fire of his Youth, by a long habit of Labour and Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. He ſpent his firſt years without any employ, and betook himſelf to the Bar, where he pleaded for Money with more Diligence and Honeſty, than Knowledge and Eloquence; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a thing very rare for a Noble <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> to meddle with this Profeſſion, unleſs forced to it by the bad condition of his Affairs. He quitted the Employ of Advocate, to betake himſef to publick Offices, as ſoon as he ſaw himſelf encouraged to enter therein, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted them with more Integrity than Fame. His inclination for Arms made him paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Fellow Citizens for an excellent Captain, although he underſtood nothing in Warlike Affairs. His brisk and fiery Temper engaged him in many Quarrels, as well on his own, as his Friends account, whence he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways came off with advantage.

                  <p>The Infidels commonly diſguiſe the State of their Affairs by ſpreading abroad Reports, which either encreaſe their Advantages, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh their Loſſes. But they could not at this time hinder the true News of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, from being univerſally known at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi> The Inhabitants were ſtruck with as great a Conſternation, as if the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were entring their Gates. And (the like of which was never ſeen before) the <hi>Seraglio</hi> was no leſs alarmed than the Town, by the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Tears of one of <hi>Selims</hi> Siſters, who bewail'd the loſs of her Husband, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of her two Sons. 'Twas for ſeveral days fear'd, that the Victorious Fleet would come with Full Sayl, and attack the Imperial Seat:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:96181:167"/>
wherefore the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> to prevent Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and Inſults, augmented the Garriſon of the <hi>Dardanels.</hi> The People were ſo diſturb'd, that, to keep them within bounds, they were fain to iſſue out very ſevere Orders. <hi>Selim</hi> was then at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> buſied about the <hi>Moſque</hi> and <hi>Kervanſarai.</hi> He returned thence with ſpeed, at the firſt News of the Tumults in the City, for fear it ſhould be yielded to the Conquerors. The ignorant Multitude were ſo terrifyed, that the greateſt part of them gave the choiceſt of their Goods to be kept by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whom yet they treated with the higheſt Contempt, and as kt 'em, whether they might at leaſt be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the free exerciſe of their Religion in paying Tribute. The <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Arrival calmed theſe Storms, and kept the People in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the ſole Fear of Puniſhment. Thus was <hi>Venice</hi> reveng'd of the Alarms given her by the Menaces of an Inſolent Conquerour; and the Fright at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was ſo much the greater, in that the Infidels thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſecure of the Victory. This Turn is a great Example of the Inconſtancy of Humane Affairs, and how little Confidence ought to be placed in Fortune's Favours, which become ſo much the bitterer, the leſs we expect to ſee our ſelves deprived of them.

                  <p>The <hi>Muſulmans,</hi> having a little recovered their Spirits, drew Troops out of the inland places, to ſtrengthen their Garriſons on the Sea Coaſts, fearing, that the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Maſters of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> might make uſe of this Advantage.

incapable to make the beſt of their good Fortune, only amus'd themſelves about taking half-ruin'd Caſtles in <hi>Epirus;</hi> and that <hi>Venieri,</hi> having ill ſucceeded in an Enterprize, was gone to Winter at <hi>Corfou.</hi> The Miniſters of the <hi>Divan,</hi> re-aſſured by this Report, ſet cloſe to the repairing of their Fleet, ſeeing this to be the only means to preſerve the Glory of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Name, and ſecure their Coaſts. It was beſides of extream importance to them, to let all <hi>Europe</hi> ſee, that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> was powerful enough, not only to repair its Ruins, but alſo to put to Sea the next Spring a much more formidable Fleet. <hi>Louchali,</hi> engaged by his own Employ to ſupport his Maſters Glory, with his utmoſt Endeavours advanced the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives of this Deſign. He ſent for Four and Twenty Gallies, left to ſecure the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which had not been in the Fight at <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto;</hi> he diligently drew together all thoſe, that had eſcaped from the Conquerours, and provided them of new Furniture.

This Effort made <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim</hi> conceive a great Opinion of his Power; and with this Fleet ill equipp'd, the <hi>Turks</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to revenge themſelves of their laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat.</p>
                  <p>The happy Succeſs of the Confederates Arms
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:96181:169"/>
could not make the Generals forget their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Quarrels. The Report of the late Fight, already ſpread over all <hi>Europe,</hi> warmed <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi> and made it with reaſon expect a a Series of Victories. But the Hatred and Jealouſie of the Soveraigns, diſappointed ſo great an Expectation. Though there ſeem'd to be a great Accord and Union between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> yet they loved one another leſs, than they hated the Infidels, and their Victory had doubled their Averſion. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> treated the <hi>Venetians</hi> with as much Contempt as Pride. They publiſht, that the others had contributed little to the gaining of the Battel, and that the whole was in a manner due to their Troops and Gallies. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> who could not ſuffer theſe inſolent Diſcourſes, boaſted their Gallant Actions, ſaying, that their Army both began the Fight, and determin'd the Victory. They moreover complained of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Malice, who had let ſome of the Republicks Gallies be taken, when they might eaſily have ſuccoured them.

The <hi>Venetians</hi> in the beginning of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent <hi>Paul Tipoli</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to aſſiſt <hi>Sorancio</hi> in the Negotiations touching the League. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcens</hi> was employed upon the ſame Affair, with the Embaſſadours of the <hi>Catholick</hi> King. The Pope often diſcourſed him in private, gave him ſeveral Marks of his good will, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed him from other Forrein Miniſters, becauſe he was Governour of <hi>Milaneſe.</hi> The Preſident <hi>du Ferrier,</hi> Embaſſadour from <hi>France</hi> to his Holyneſs, a ſenſible and punctual Man, found fault with this Preference, and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſo much earneſtneſs of the Affront done the King his Maſter, whoſe Miniſters had always been more Honoured than the King of <hi>Spains,</hi> that <hi>Requieſcens</hi> fearing, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt might unſeaſonably cauſe a War between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> retired to his Government. <hi>Philips</hi> and the Republicks Embaſſadours had every day ſome new Diſputes in the Preſence of the Pope and Cardinals, aſſembled to Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them touching the Preparatives for the next Campaign, and agreed not upon any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles without his Holyneſſes Interpoſition.

The Pope, all whoſe Cares were employed upon this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Expedition, fear'd the too exact Charge of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the too ſubtile Diſcharge of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and to hinder their Conteſts about the paſt, from prejudicing the preſent Affairs,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:96181:170"/>
forbad the examining any of them, till they had agreed, with what number of Troops, and on what part of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries the War ſhould be carryed on in the Spring. As ſoon as they had ſubmitted to his Holyneſſes Sentiment, the <hi>Venetians</hi> propos'd, that <hi>Greece</hi> ſhould be attackt by all the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Land and Sea Forces. Theſe Troops to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether made a Body of Fifty Thouſand Foot, and Four Thouſand Five Hundred Horſe, not counting the Militia of the Fleet, conſiſting of Two Hundred Gallies, and an Hundred Veſſels of Burden, laden with Victuals and Ammunition. The Emperor was thereupon to be furniſht with the Troops, which Cardinal <hi>Commendon</hi> had promiſed him, to engage him in the League, and put him in condition to attack <hi>Hungary.</hi> And in caſe <hi>Maximilian</hi> was not ſure to put himſelf in the Field, the Army muſt take the way of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> through the Provinces of <hi>Illyrium</hi> and <hi>Epirus,</hi> for to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Enemies Country.

a Neutrality, they pretended, there could not any attempt be made on the Sea Coaſts, unleſs he attackt <hi>Hungary,</hi> a great Diverſion on that ſide being neceſſary, to hinder the <hi>Turks</hi> upon the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> from ſending ſpeedy Relief to any Maritime place the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould aſſault; without which their Efforts would not only be uſeleſs, but alſo dangerous; That it was therefore (added they) more fit in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Emperors Declaration to keep two Hundred Gallies in good Condition, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to act and ſurprize the Enemy according to the occurrence of Affairs, and to rid themſelves of the trouble of the Veſſels of Equipage, whoſe attendance the ableſt Sea-Officers had always ſlighted; That with an Hundred and Fifty Soldiers on each Gally, they might in a moment land Thirty Thouſand Men, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack and take many ſtrong places, before the Enemy could have time to relieve them; That they ſhould no more expect Reſolutions from <hi>Rome,</hi> where neither the Condition of Affairs, nor ſituation of Places was known; but that all ſhould be left to the Prudence and Fidelity of the Generals, by making them abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the whole Fleet.

of the Republick, afterwards took up the Diſcourſe, and anſwered, That it was in vain to deliberate on things already decided: That the Fleets were oblig'd by the Treaty to meet every Year in the beginning of the Spring at <hi>Corfou,</hi> to go and attack the Enemies in <hi>Greece;</hi> That it was no longer to be talkt of leaving to the Generals Diſcretion, what had been regulated by all the Confederates, and that 'twas contrary to good Sence and Reaſon to change ſuch juſt Meaſures; That they ought not to amuſe themſelves about making Shots out of reach at an Enemy, when they might give them Mortal Wounds: But ſuppoſe, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, that in clearing the Coaſts of <hi>Africa</hi> from Pyrates, you reſtore Repoſe to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> by entirely ſecuring the Maritime Places; What Benefit will you get by it, if you give the Infidels time to put forth a new Fleet to Sea, and ſee your ſelves once again expoſed to the Perils, from which you were but juſt now miraculouſly delivered? You will then no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger have to deal with the pitiful Boats of Thieves, whoſe Surprizes to avoid is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; but you will ſee the Coaſt of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> covered with the Enemies Veſſels, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Shelter of which the <hi>Corſairs</hi> will in leſs time be re-ſettled in <hi>Africk,</hi> than you will have been in driving them thence.

Theſe Diſputes took them up two Months without coming to any Agreement: but the Parties referring themſelves to the Pope, he in this manner regulated all theſe Differences. He ordered, that the Fleets ſhould repair to <hi>Corfou</hi> about the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> with all ſorts of Ammunition and Equipage; That the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould add Three Galeaſſes to Six others, which were already in their Navy; and that <hi>Greece</hi> ſhould be invaded on the ſide, which the Commanders ſhould think fitteſt; that the Holy <hi>See</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould ſend the ſame number of Veſſels, as in the laſt Camapign; That there ſhould be embarkt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Two and Thirty Thouſand Foot, and Five Hundred Horſe; That there ſhould ſtay at <hi>Otranto</hi> Twelve Thouſand new-raiſed Men, ready to paſs over upon the firſt Order from the Generals; That there ſhould be Thirty Pieces of Canon with Powder and Ball, enough for each Piece to make a Thouſand Shot; That there ſhould be Twenty Thouſand Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, Thirty Thouſand Swords, Fifteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Partiſans,</hi> Two Thouſand Lances, and Five Hundred Iron Coats, with all ſorts of Utenſils and Inſtruments neceſſary for ſuch an Army. The Pope did not only ſolicite the Emperour to joyn with the Princes of the League; he ſent alſo at the ſame time two Prelates, <hi>Antonio Salviati</hi> and <hi>Paulo Odeſcalchi,</hi> to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> inviting them to contribute every one according to his Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards the defraying ſo Holy an Enterprize: They all promiſed to ſecond his Holyneſſes Zeal. <hi>Gulielmo de Conzaga,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:96181:174"/>
offered Two Hundred Horſe and a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot; the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> engaged to ſend as many; and the Duke of <hi>Urbin</hi> (whoſe Power was much inferiour to that of thoſe two Princes) promiſed only a Regiment of Horſe, compos'd of Two Hundred choice Men; the Republick of <hi>Lucca,</hi> which had not any Troops, taxt themſelves at ſix Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns of Gold a Year; the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> anſwered, that they had lent the King of <hi>Spain</hi> Four Gallies for this Expedition, and that their Militia was embark'd on his Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Fleet. <hi>Philibert</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> offered Two Thouſand Foot, and Four Hundred Horſe, but at the ſame time he beſought the Pope to conſider, that he had much more need for them for the ſecuring of his own State, than againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> being threatned by <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par Coligny,</hi> who had put himſelf at the Head of the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants. The Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> had reaſon to diſtruſt ſo Potent and brave a Man. He had newly, without the Dukes conſent, marryed a Gentlewoman, born his Subject, of one of the beſt Houſes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> exceeding Rich, Lady of many great Caſtles, and who, for the ſake of this Marriage, had renounced the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion. <hi>Coſmo de Medicis</hi> gave five Hundred Horſe, and Six Thouſand Foot, on condition that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the other Confederate Princes, ſhould grant him the Title of <hi>Great Duke of Tuſcany.

the Jealouſie, given him by the Elevation of <hi>Medicis,</hi> with whom he had long been diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about Precedency and Power, and the Offers of this Redoubtable Rival, oblig'd him to make a Journey to the Emperor, to oppoſe the ſettling this new Title. The Pope, who fear'd the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> would divert <hi>Maximilian</hi> from entring into the League, loſt all the good opinion he had of him, and gave apparent Signs of his Indignation againſt this Prince.</p>

                     </gap>ed againſt our Crimes, chaſtiſed us for them by the Death of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth, which happened a few days after. He felt himſelf at firſt aſſaulted by Pains, of which, neither himſelf, nor Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans could Divine the Cauſe. He had no great opinion of their Preſcriptions, being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that all the ſecret Phyſick conſiſted in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from things p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ejudicial to Health, and in a ſimple and frugal manner of living. Hence he had but one Phyſitian, who had a long time been his Servant. Theſe ſharp and continual Pains gave the Phyſitians to underſtand, that he had a Stone in his Bladder. But he could not be brought to uſe the Remedies neceſſary for his Cure, bcauſe they too much offended his Modeſty, and himſelf judged, that his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96181:175"/>
was incurable by the Redoubling of his Pains. He would not then hear of any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but his Salvation, and applyed himſelf, ſick as he was, to continual exerciſe of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He undertook to viſit on Foot, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches, maugre the Prayers and Tears of his Nephews. He employed but a day and an half in this Holy Pilgrimage, though he ſtayed a conſiderable time at Prayers in every Church; but he returned ſo tir'd, that the Phyſitians believ'd, this violent excerciſe, join'd to the cruel pains he ſuffered, and to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he uſed till his death, would ſhorten the days of this Holy Man. He dyed to the great Unhappyneſs of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but to his own Repoſe and Glory, on the firſt of <hi>May.</hi> He was a Perſonage, comparable to the firſt Vicars of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for the Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Holyneſs of his manners, the firmneſs of his Faith, the Ardor of his Zeal for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and who merited no leſs than thoſe, whoſe Memory the Church Solemnly Celebrates.</p>
                  <p>He was born in the Year 1504. near the Town <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in a Village called <hi>le Bois.</hi> His Birth and Fortune were mean enough, though ſome Authors, to flatter him, have written, that he was deſcended of the Ancient and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family of the <hi>Ghiſlieri</hi> of <hi>Bononia.</hi> He was from his Childhood educated in the order of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> of which he took the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and liv'd to the Age of Fifty Years in the moſt Religious Obſervation of St. <hi>Dominicks</hi> Rule. This Uniformity of Conduct gained him the eſteem of a perfect Religious. 'Tis
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96181:175"/>
ſaid, he never had any Office in the Order, and that he was only choſen to govern ſome Houſes in quality of Prior, which Employs he for no other reaſon accepted, but he might not diſobey his Superiors. Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> having been named Soveraign Inquiſitor, heard of his Merit. He ſent him to <hi>Bergamo,</hi> to order the Proceſs againſt certain Hereticks. For beſides his extraordinary Piety, he was very Learned in the Holy Scripture, and in Divinity, which he had a long time taught in his Order with the Title of Doctor. Cardinal <hi>Caraffa,</hi> well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed with his Activeneſs and Fidelity, which were of proof againſt Sollicitations and Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſent for him back to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was very uſeful to him in the ſame Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This Cardinal, being after <hi>Julius</hi> the Third, and <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Second, who both reigned but a very little while, advanced to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Throne under the Name of <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, gave the Biſhoprick of <hi>Nepi</hi> to <hi>Michael Ghiſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri</hi> (ſo was he call'd amongſt the <hi>Dominicans)</hi> and Two Years after honoured him with the Sacred Purple, though Cardinal <hi>Charles Caraffa</hi> his Holyneſſes Nephew, oppoſed his Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He afterwards made him chief of the Inquiſition, giving him far greater Power than any, who had before him filled that place, and extoll'd his Capacity in the preſence of all the Cardinals. He made himſelf many Enemies by Honourably aſſerting the Intereſts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but was nevertheleſs choſen Pope the Fifth day of <hi>January, Anno</hi> 1566. Thoſe, who ſeem'd the moſt contrary to his Election, were
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:96181:176"/>
the firſt to give him their Voices. He ſhewed ſo much indifference therein, that, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Cuſtom, they came to ask him, whether he conſented to what the <hi>Conclave</hi> had done in his behalf, he for ſome time doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether he ſhould accept it, and received the <hi>Tiara</hi> with as much Moderation, as he had teſtified little deſire to obtain it. In the mean time this Man, full of Humility, without Eſtate, without Birth, and without Favour, ſupported only by his Innocency, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of his Intentions, manifeſted no leſs Greatneſs of Soul, than Zeal and Devotion. At his Entrance into the Pontificat, he ſet about reſtoring the Diſcipline, which had been long corrupted. A Work undoubtedly Laborious, but which he Gloriouſly accompliſht, by being himſelf the firſt in diligently obſerving his own Ordinances, and ſeverely puniſhing the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Refractory. By propoſing Recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only to thoſe, who endeavour'd their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was in ſo ſhort a time purged of all the Vices which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured it, that 'twas ſcarce credible he alone ſhould have performed, what ſeveral of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors never durſt attempt. The Reſpect and Veneration that was had for him, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Orders, and every one amended his Manners, through the Sole Fear of diſpleaſing him. The Corruption was grown ſo great in the whole Eccleſiaſtical State, that Wiſdom and Modeſty rendred Men contemptible, and nothing made them valued but Libertiniſm. But <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth took ſuch good order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96181:176"/>
that Virtue regain'd the place, whence Vice had driven her. The <hi>Banditi</hi> were become ſo formidable by their Aſſaſſinates and Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that the Towns themſelves were not ſafe from their Inſults. This Holy Pope cauſed theſe Thieves to be puniſhed with ſo much Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, that his Subjects enjoyed a Calm and Repoſe, the like of which had not yet been ſeen in any State of <hi>Italy.</hi> He had ſo little Ambition to advance his Family, that 'twas only at the Inſtant Requeſt of the Sacred Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that he gave the Hat to his Nephew <hi>Michael Bonelli,</hi> his Siſters Son, who had alſo taken the Habit of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> though he loved him tenderly, as being a Perſon of great Wit and Virtue. He took from him the Office of Treaſurer of the Church, worth ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns a Year, ſome time after he had given him it, and ſold it, to Cardinal <hi>Cornaro</hi> for Four Hundred Thouſand Franks, which were employed in Equipping the Fleet of the Holy <hi>See.</hi> His Nephew willingly parted with it, offering him alſo, whatever was left him of his Benefits, for ſo Holy an uſe as that. He entertain'd a young <hi>Bononian,</hi> that was his Kinſman, named <hi>Paulo Ghiſlieri,</hi> who had a great inclination to the Wars, and could not have fail'd of ſucceeding in it.

                  <p>THE Popes Sickneſs, followed by his Death, interrupted the Courſe of Affairs; and ſtayed <hi>Colonni</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> though all things were ready for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Caſtles and other Lordſhips he held in the Eccleſiaſtical State, too much inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed him in the next Election, to let him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf during the holding of the Conclave. But the Cardinals, ſending for him to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, told him, he muſt not abandon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe in the preſent Conjuncture, and oblig'd him to go and join the Fleet. They gave him Money out of the Churches Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to pay the Troops of the Holy <hi>See;</hi> and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:96181:180"/>
having taken his Leave of the Sacred Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, recommending to them his Intereſts, he went immediately to <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> where he found another occaſion of delay. The Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> not yet knowing how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would go touching the Election, made a Difficulty of furniſhing out the Twelve Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the deceaſed Pope had already hired of him. Cardinal <hi>Ferdinando de Medicis,</hi> his Son, ſeeing the other Cardinals highly diſguſted at this Refuſal, caſt the Blame on his Fathers Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and undertook for the Performance of the Treaty, made with <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth, which was no ſooner ſatisfied, but <hi>Colonni,</hi> ſetting ſail, took his courſe for <hi>Naples,</hi> thence to paſs into <hi>Sicily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cardinals, having (during the nine days deſtined to that Ceremony) paid their laſt Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the departed Pope, entred into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave on the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>May;</hi> and the next day, notwithſtanding the Powerful Competition of Cardinal <hi>Farneſe,</hi> who pretended to the Pontificat, they, at the ſolicitation of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Altemps,</hi> choſe <hi>Hugh Buoncompagno,</hi> who took the Name of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth. He was born at <hi>Bononia,</hi> of a very mean Family: his Father, whoſe Fortune was no greater than his Birth, left nevertheleſs a great Eſtate, which he got by his Induſtry and Frugality. When <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth received at <hi>Bononia</hi> the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown from the Hands of <hi>Clement</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, this Man, who had gotten into Trade, made ſo conſiderable an advantage of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Wares, which the Concourſe of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96181:180"/>
drawn thither by the Pomp of this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, had made dear, that he was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to build Stately Houſes in a Quarter of the Town, call'd <hi>The Street of Hell.</hi> He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all his Children to be carefully brought up in Learning, and engaged his Son <hi>Hugh</hi> in the Study of the Civil Law, in which he made ſo great a Progreſs, that having taken his Degree of Doctor, he for ſeveral years taught publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Univerſity of <hi>Bononia.</hi> Being above Forty years of Age when he loſt his Father, he went ſoon after to <hi>Rome,</hi> hoping to get there both Wealth and Reputation, by following the Profeſſion of the Bar. He there adminiſtred ſome publick Employs with ſo great Probity, and ſuch exact Juſtice, that he ſucceſſively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed almoſt all the Chief Offices of the Town. He paſſed ſeveral Years without riſing to any great Height; but his good Fortune, in fine, declaring it ſelf, he advanced much faſter in his latter days, and was at the Age of Threeſcore and Ten mounted upon the Papal Throne. He was more indebted for his exaltation to the Eſteem, he had acquir'd, of being an Upright Man, and a great Juſticiary, than to Favor or Intrigue. He was naturally ſullen, and ſlow of Speech: but he knew ſo well how to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of theſe Defects, that his Silence was taken for a Mark of ſingular Prudence, and his Sullenneſs for an admirable Strength of Wit.</p>

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96181:181"/>
him his Orders, ſent him again to the Fleet. <hi>Don John</hi> had paſſed all the Winter in Feaſting and Jollity; and this Young Prince, much more ſenſible of the Luſtre, than of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his Victory, had prepared for the Expedition in <hi>Africk,</hi> not doubting, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might engage the Pope and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> in it, by perſwading them, it would not take up much time. But having received Advice, that it had been reſolved at <hi>Rome</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Infidels in <hi>Greece,</hi> he departed with all his Fleet from <hi>Palermo,</hi> and came before <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina:</hi> He ſent ſome Veſſels of Burden to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fou;</hi> and making a ſhew of no ſmall Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at <hi>Colonni</hi>'s ſtay, without whom he could not go againſt the Enemies, he would oblige <hi>Leonardo Contareni</hi> (who was ſent to him from the Republick, with order to ſtay there, and ſee the Navy ſet forth) to go and aſſure the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that he would weigh Anchor, as ſoon as ever <hi>Colonni,</hi> whom he daily expected, ſhould have join'd him with the Popes Fleet. <hi>Colonni</hi> being, in fine, arrived, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> under pretence of ſhewing greater Honour to <hi>Don John,</hi> or to haſten his Departure, ſent from <hi>Corfou</hi> into <hi>Sicily</hi> Five and Twenty Gallies, commanded by <hi>James Sorancio,</hi> to meet him, and repreſented to him, that his delay was highly prejudicial to the Good of the Common Cauſe, and his own Glory. <hi>Don John,</hi> one while ſhewing an extream Deſire to ſecond the Republicks Intentions, and other whiles excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf upon ſome Preparatives, that were yet wanting to the Fleet. <hi>Sorancio</hi> in vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:96181:181"/>
his Inſtances; for <hi>Don John</hi> had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret order from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> not to make War upon the Infidels this year, but to keep his Fleet along the Coaſts of <hi>Sicily.</hi> This he had imparted to <hi>Colonni,</hi> deſiring him to favour his Catholick Majeſties Deſigns, and amuſe the <hi>Venetians. Sorancio,</hi> whom a long experience had rendred very quick-ſighted, diſcovered this Myſtery through all theſe Diſguiſes, and gave notice to his Holyneſs, who complaining of it to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador; that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter preſented to him a Letter from the King his Maſter, in which <hi>Philip</hi> the Second repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Pope, that all <hi>France</hi> was in Arms. That the Admiral <hi>de Coligni,</hi> Head of the Proteſtants in that Kingdom, had got the chief place in the Young Kings Favour; that he had procured a League Offenſive and Defenſive between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> That the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſollicited the <hi>Flemings</hi> to a Rovolt; and made, at his own charge, great Levies in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> And that his Catholick Majeſty was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the Admiral abus'd the <hi>French</hi> Kings Weakneſs, and ſet all manner of Engins at Work, to cauſe Inſurrections in the Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring States, for no other end, than with the greater Facility to attack his: That his Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ought not to be diſpleaſed at the Kings cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling back his Fleet for his own particular ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; beſides that, it concerned all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as much as himſelf, to oppoſe the aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing of ſo Pernicious a Sect. 'Tis manifeſt, the Admiral had uſed all his Endeavours with <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, to induce him to declare
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:96181:182"/>
War againſt <hi>Philip;</hi> having often repreſented in the Council, that there never could be ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable an Opportunity, and that all things promiſed an advantagious Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Letters to his Holineſs put the whole Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in a rage; and the <hi>Venetians</hi> fill'd all <hi>Europe</hi> with Complaints and Murmurings, ſaying, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not only abandon'd <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but deliver'd it up to the Infidels; That the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents and Diviſions of <hi>France</hi> were only Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to make the Republick loſe the Benefit of the Victory of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> by giving the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Leiſure to ſet forth a new Navy. The <hi>French,</hi> that were at <hi>Rome,</hi> uſed the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador <hi>du Ferrier</hi> ſtiled theſe Reports an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture and Calumny, publickly declaring, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> endeavour'd dexterouſly to caſt their Perfidiouſneſs on the <hi>French.</hi> Some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that <hi>Philip</hi> the Second intended by this manner of proceeding, to try the Popes Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with a Deſign to attempt greater matters, in caſe he found him of an eaſie and Flexible Temper. But <hi>Gregory,</hi> without examining, whether the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Excuſe were true or falſe, diſpatcht away two Prelates, <hi>Salviati</hi> and <hi>Ormanet,</hi> the latter into <hi>Spain,</hi> the former into <hi>France,</hi> to prevent the War, that was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to break forth between theſe two Crowns. <hi>Salviati,</hi> being arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> writ him word, that he found no appearance of Diviſion in that Kingdom, and that the King and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters laught at the <hi>Spaniards</hi> abſurd Pretences
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:96181:182"/>
for deſerting their Allies. The Pope in the mean time could not ſuffer ſo open a Violation of the League in the beginning of his Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. His Predeceſſor had granted the King of <hi>Spain</hi> the raiſing of about an hundred Thouſand Crowns a year on his Clergy, on condition to maintain Threeſcore Gallies againſt the Infidels, and of this his Holyneſs demanded the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters anſwered him, they had no orders about it; and Addreſs being made on his behalf to <hi>Don John,</hi> he offered Twenty Gallies, in caſe the Cardinal <hi>Granvelle</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſadour would conſent to it. Theſe two Miniſters, conſulting of this Affair, were of opinion, that inſtead of the Threeſcore Gallies, demanded by the Pope, there ſhould be only Two and Twenty granted to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> on the one ſide, for fear of rendring them too ſtrong, and on the other, to enable them to ſupport and continue the War.</p>
                  <p>They were delivered to <hi>Colonni,</hi> who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately went with thoſe of the Holy <hi>See,</hi> and ſome of the Republicks, to join the reſt of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet at <hi>Corfou.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Subjects were become odious to all the other Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> for having ſo ſhamefully gone back from the League, and abandoned the Common Cauſe, as well as that of the <hi>Venetians. Philip,</hi> having received Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice thereof from ſeveral parts, and amongſt the reſt from <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> re-call'd the natural Inclination, he had for his Honour, and the advancement of Religion, and ſent Orders to <hi>Don John,</hi> to paſs with all his Forces into

                     <hi>Greece,</hi> and to behave himſelf in this War with all the Valour and Fidelity he expected from his Obedience. <hi>Don John</hi> had no ſooner received this Order, but he writ to <hi>Colonni:</hi> But this Letter having been differently repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Original falling into the Author of this Hiſtory's Hands, he thought it his Duty to ſet it down here in its very Words.</p>

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96181:184"/>
                     <hi>Venetians.</hi> Being then arrived at <hi>Cephalonia</hi> and <hi>Zant,</hi> they re-aſſured their Allies againſt the Fright, the <hi>Turks</hi> Fleet had given them, and ſent diſcreet Perſons to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> inhabiting the Mountains of <hi>Morea,</hi> to renew the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and ſtir them up afreſh to Rebellion. Steering towards <hi>Cythera,</hi> now call'd <hi>Cerigo,</hi> they met <hi>Leoni</hi> and <hi>Soriano,</hi> Captains of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies, who were ordered to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Diſcovery. Theſe Two Officers told them, that the Enemy was not far off, riding at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor under the Walls of <hi>Malvaſia,</hi> which is the ancient <hi>Epidaurus</hi> of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> That their Fleet was compoſed of above Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gallies, and many other Veſſels; but that, though this was the greateſt Navy they ever had at Sea, neither their Hulls nor Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was any way comparable to the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and that there was great likelyhood, they would not expoſe themſelves to a Fight. The Confederates Fleet conſiſted of an Hundred and Forty Gallies, Six Galeaſſes, and one and Twenty great Veſſels, fitted for War, though laden with Victuals and Ammunition. The General reſolved the next day to ſeek out the Infidels, and draw them to a Battel: But <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonni</hi> altered this Reſolution, fearing, that if the <hi>Turks</hi> continued in their Poſt, the Retreat of the Great Veſſels might become dangerous, this ſort of Ships not being very ſure in Fight: for, though they are wonderful with the Wind, they become uſeleſs, and even cumberſom, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Calm, and it would be difficult to row them back at the ſight of the Enemies Fleet:
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:96181:184"/>
ſo that 'twas not thought fit to hazard a Battle, being Weaker in Gallies than the Infidels, and having need of theſe Veſſels to cover their Wings. The next day they got towards the <hi>Eaſt</hi> part of the Iſle, and the Fleet drew up in Battalia near certain Rocks call'd <hi>Dragonares,</hi> over againſt the Promontory of <hi>Malea,</hi> as if they really deſign'd to engage the Enemy: the Galeaſſes were on the Right Wing, and the Ships of Burden on the Left, to the end they might come to them with the Favour of the Wind, in caſe it blew from the <hi>South.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> far exceeded the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Gallies, but were much inferiour to them in Marriners, Rowers, and Soldiers, ſince the Battel of <hi>Lepanto;</hi> ſo that their Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping was not <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſerviceable. This Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs obliged <hi>Louchali</hi> only to ſhew his Fleet, and carefully to avoid coming to Blows: he fear'd being diſhonoured, and giving the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> occaſion to glory, by ſtanding too much upon his Guard: And 'twas an Advantage great enough for him to keep the Sea, and his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in Breath. He no ſooner underſtood, that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet was in <hi>Battalia</hi> near the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonares,</hi> but he ſet Sayl, to make a ſhew of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing; and leaving the Promontory of <hi>Malea,</hi> he coaſted the Land on the right hand of this Promontory, as if he neither diſtruſted the Enemies Forces, nor the ill Condition of his own. The Wind blowing hard enough from the <hi>South,</hi> to work the Great Ships, they went with full Sayl againſt the Enemies, who were making towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> believing that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96181:185"/>
they Fled; and they would undoubtedly have engaged in Fight, had not the Wind faln of a ſudden. <hi>Louchali,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> left Wing naked, turned his Prows that way; but <hi>Colonni</hi> ſpeedily detacht the Frigats, which had already ſecured the Ships of Burden. The Two Fleets ſtood a long time facing each other within Cannon Shot, yet without making any Attack. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> fear'd being encloſed, if they left their Gallies and bigger Ships; and <hi>Louchali,</hi> who perceived this Precaution, made the greater ſemblance of Fierceneſs and Readineſs to Fight.

The Negligence of the Officers was ſo great, that the moſt part of the Gallies put in where they pleaſed, not only in ſeveral parts of the Iſle, but even in the Ports of the Continent, without obeying any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But they were chaſtiſed for it by a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Alarm; for not knowing, what Courſe the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet had taken, word was brought them, that they were within eight Miles, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards them.

Sayl, putting the reſt in Battalia as faſt as they came up to the Fleet. Thoſe that were moſt remote, gave little Credit to the Orders and Signals, which they unwillingly and very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed. However, though they were throughly perſwaded that <hi>Louchali</hi> would have defeated them, had he took Advantage of this Diſorder; and though the neglect of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be very deſtructive to an Army, yet was there no example made of the Offenders, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonni</hi> and <hi>Andrada</hi> not daring to puniſh them, becauſe there were ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentlemen amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>The Infidels, veering towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> left the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet, not yet recovered of the Fright, into which they were put by the hazard they had run; and 'twas believed, they were then going to plunder the Iſlands and Frontiers of the Republick, there being then nothing to hinder them. Ours, to prevent ſuch an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, immediately determined to follow them. For this purpoſe <hi>Colonni</hi> choſe out the beſt and ſwifteſt of his Gallies; and taking Equipage and Soldiers out of the others, he would have ſent them into <hi>Candy</hi> with the reſt of the Fleet, with a Reſolution to fall on the Enemies, who were beyond <hi>Zant,</hi> or elſe to ſtay there for <hi>Don John,</hi> in caſe he were not yet arrived, and with him to purſue the Miſ-believers; or, if it ſhould be thought more convenient, to attack ſome Place in <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> being then in Condition to attempt great matters. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General was of the ſame Opinion; but the <hi>Venetians</hi> having debated this deſign amongſt themſelves,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:96181:186"/>
diſapproved the execution of it, though for Reaſons weak enough, on which <hi>Foſcarini</hi> had grounded his Sentiment. They inſtantly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Colonni</hi> to change this laſt Reſolution, and return to his former. <hi>Colonni</hi> granted them this Favour, for which <hi>Sorantio</hi> in full Council thanked him in Terms, repleat with Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The Reaſons, alledged by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> were, that having neither Galeaſſes, nor great Veſſels, they were neither in Condition to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, nor defend themſelves, if they ſhould meet with the Enemy; but in truth they fear'd, leſt <hi>Don John</hi> and his Council, might find ſome new Subterfuge, to make them loſe again this Campaign.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> weighing Anchor in the Night, perceived by break of Day the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet. <hi>Louchali,</hi> who was as well informed of their Motions, as if he had been prefent at their Debates, made all the advantage of this Knowledge that could be expected from a great Captain. Finding himſelf too weak to hazard a Battle, he aimed only to keep them in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Alarm, coaſting always near them, and preſenting himſelf ſometimes in their Front, ſometimes in the Rear, inceſſantly watching to lay hold of any Advantages, that might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by the Generals want of Experience or Diſunion, by the Diſobedience of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Officers, or by the Accidents of Wind and Sea. He rode before the Promontory of <hi>Toenarus,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Metapan;</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> not daring with their heavy Veſſels to keep the Chanel, the <hi>Barbarian</hi> made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:96181:186"/>
them on the Coaſt: Our Fleet drew in Battalia in the ſame order, that is, with the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies between the Galeaſſes and great Ships, the Infidels alſo ranking themſelves as at firſt. In the mean time the two Fleets deſcried afar off a Veſſel coming with full Sayl: 'twas a <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Ship, having aboard it a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Money for payment of the Soldiers, and laden beſides with Powder and other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition for <hi>Candy.</hi> This Veſſel miſtaking the Infidels for the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> made directly to them, and ſome of their Gallies were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy advanced to inveſt it. Ours, perceiving its Error, ſent <hi>Quirini</hi> with the Five ſwifteſt Gallies of their Fleet, to prevent the Enemies, and ſecure this Veſſel. <hi>Quirini,</hi> having boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her, took out the Money, and received <hi>Germanico</hi> and <hi>Mario Savorniani,</hi> two Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> that had taken this opportunity of coming to the Fleet. The Ship ſecurely took her way for <hi>Candy;</hi> and <hi>Quirini</hi> returned, <hi>Louchali</hi> not daring to make to him, for fear of being forc't to accept a Battle. In the mean time the Fleets by little and little approacht each other, the Infidels extending their Front to a great Length. Ours where fain to do the like, leſt the Enemy might fall upon their Flank or Reer; their heavy Veſſels being always on the Wings, according to their firſt order. The Left Wing of the <hi>Turks,</hi> truſting to their Swifneſs and Lightneſs, and contemning the ſluggiſhneſs of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> heavy Veſſels, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced a little too forward on our Right. The Galeaſſes and Ships gave them ſo warm a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:96181:187"/>
that they were glad to retreat in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. <hi>Sorancio,</hi> who commanded this Wing, animated hereby; made a ſign to the other Gallies to fall upon theſe Fugitives, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with incredible ſwiftneſs purſued them. <hi>Angelo Soriano</hi> ſo vigorouſly followed them, that falling into their Squadron, he in ſuch a manner attackt one of their Veſſels, as he was like to make himſelf Maſter of her The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> had undoubtedly gained this day a ſignal Victory, had their whole Right Wing charged at the ſame time as the <hi>Barbarians</hi> began to fly; but except five Veſſels which followed <hi>Sorantio,</hi> not one ſeconded his Bravery. <hi>Colonni,</hi> tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Ardor and Alacrity of the Soldiers, who already ſet forth ſhouts of Victory, advanc'd with the body of his Fleet, not conſidering he left the two Wings behind him. <hi>Foſcarini,</hi> who was in the Head, cried out loud enough to be heard by every one, That we ought to give them Battel; That the Infidels were in Diſorder; and that Heaven declar'd in Favour of the Common Cauſe; but if the Enemies Diſorder drew <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonni</hi> after them, the Reflexion, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this firſt Motion, caſt him into a ſtrange Perplexity. He knew not, whether he ſhould go on, or return to his firſt Poſt; nor was he leſs diſturbed by the hope of Victory, than by the fear of being defeated. He remembred, how diſpleaſing the Honours, he received at <hi>Rome,</hi> at his return from the laſt Campaign, were to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and what ill Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had done him with the King their Maſter; ſo that having no longer the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:96181:187"/>
ſame Protection, he had under the precedent Pontificat, he was ruined with <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, though he ſhould have gained the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; <hi>Don John</hi> having forbidden him to make any Attempt without him. Theſe were the true reaſons which hindred <hi>Colonni</hi> from attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enemies, though he alledged for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that their Retreat was but a Stratagem to divide the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet, by drawing after them the Gallies alone, which would have been defeated without the help of the greater Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. In the mean time <hi>Sorantio,</hi> complaining that he had been abandoned by his, had re-gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Poſt, ſeeing the Infidels recovered, and making a ſemblance to charge him. <hi>Louchali</hi> wondred not at the routing of his Left Wing, and their being purſued by ours; he threatned his People with Death, if they returned not to the Fight, and ordered the Officers to re-ſettle this Diſorder, during a little Relaxation, which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> gave them, foreſeeing, that he ſhould himſelf be engaged by the Fugitives, if the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> knew how to make uſe of their Advantage; he bethought himſelf of a Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, which demonſtrated him to have the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of an able Seaman; he caus'd his Admiral Ship to be inſenſibly towed backward, though ſtill facing the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready at no ſmall diſtance from the greater Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. <hi>Canale,</hi> who commanded the Left Wing, of which many Ships were but in a bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, could not make ſo much haſt as the reſt of the Fleet; and the Enemies, on the contrary, recovered of their Fright, ſayled in good order.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:96181:188"/>
'Twas now the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> turn to be in very great Conſternation, and ſmitten with a ſudden Terror, which preſaged ſome Diſgrace, they kept ſilence, as if they were on the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defeated. Many of the Gallies left their firſt Rank, for to fight only in the Rear, where the Danger would not be ſo great, ſo that the Front was become very thin. <hi>Colonni,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this Diſorder, took a Skiff, and paſſing round the Fleet, employed his Authority, joined with Reaſons and Requeſts, to make theſe Gallies return to their firſt Station: he told their Officers, that they had to do only with the ſame Enemies, of whom they had kill'd above Thirty Thouſand Men in the laſt Battel, and taken almoſt an equal number of Priſoners, though they were then commanded by excellent Generals, their Army being alſo compleat, and full of Confidence and Pride; That they were now Headed by a pitiful Slave, fit only to lead Thieves to a Robbery; That his Fleet was Tumultuouſly Aſſembled, and his Soldiers but Novices; That they need only to return to their Poſt, and the Infidels would be neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fly, to avoid being a ſecond time diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited. <hi>Colonni</hi> endeavour'd by theſe Diſcourſes to re-aſſure thoſe that were moſt alarmed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call their Courages. But the Diſtruſt <hi>Louchali</hi> had of his Forces, hindred his benefiting by this Conſternation; and ſeeking no other advantage, but not to be beaten, he gave <hi>Canale</hi> leiſure to get up with the great Veſſels to the Fleet, whoſe Arrival made the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> take Heart again. Thus theſe Two Generals, as expert as
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:96181:188"/>
they were, committed each of them a Fault, which they could never repair.</p>
                  <p>The Two Fleets, having a long time mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced each other within the reach of Cannon Shot, retired about Sun-Set with mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. The Infidels, who went firſt away, recovered <hi>Metapan,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Cerigo. Sorancio</hi> publickly complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the Officers of the Right Wing, whoſe Diſobedience, he pretended, had pluckt the Victory out of his Hands, and demanded, they might be proſecuted. <hi>Foſcarini</hi> at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt informed againſt them; but the Friends and Credit of the Accuſed ſtopt theſe Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This Impunity encouraged the Soldiers Inſolence, and the Generals rendred themſelves culpable by their Neglect of Diſcipline, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no Aſſurance of any Succeſs in War, as the Republick but too often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented in this.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by the Favour of a ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wind, ſail'd from <hi>Cerigo</hi> to <hi>Zant. Colonni,</hi> thinking to meet <hi>Don John</hi> there, and go after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards againſt the Enemies, found only the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Croſs</hi> arrived, whom this Prince had ſent with Orders to the Fleet, to come and attend him there. They were well pleaſed with their having prevented this Command, and flattering themſelves, that they ſhould ſoon ſeehim, ſent back the ſame Marqueſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to haſten his Departure. <hi>Colonni</hi> had in the mean time, ſome days before, ſent away a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officer, named <hi>Pedro Pardo,</hi> to inform himſelf of the Place, where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:96181:189"/>
were, of the number of their Veſſels, of their Strength, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Being perſwaded that ours was much much Weaker than the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline was not well obſerved in it, he ſo ſtrongly fancyed our being defeated, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving affirmed it to <hi>Bazano,</hi> whom he firſt met with, he made the ſame Report to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who was then at <hi>Corfou.</hi> This Prince immediately prepared to gather up the Remains of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet, taking with him for this Expedition a certain number of choſen Gallies; but being ready to ſet Sayl, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived News quite contrary to what <hi>Pardo</hi> had told him, and underſtood that the Fleet atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him at <hi>Zant.</hi> He changed his Deſign, and ſent <hi>Colonni</hi> Word, to come and meet him at <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> for that he would part from <hi>Corfou,</hi> as ſoon as he ſhould have re-fitted the Veſſels he had diſarmed. They look'd upon themſelves obliged by Reſpect, to go with the whole Fleet as far as <hi>Cephalonia</hi> to meet him, not doubting his being already there: but a contrary Wind ariſing, when he was in ſight of the Iſle, had driven him back to <hi>Corfou.</hi> The too great Credulity of the <hi>Venetians</hi> upon uncertain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, made them commit a Fault of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Importance. They left their Heavy Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:96181:189"/>
at <hi>Zant,</hi> without any Guard of Gallies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Enemy far from them: there was Advice given them on a ſudden, that the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Fleet was ſeen near the Iſle, and that there were Fires lighted in the Cittadel, to give them notice of it; and in effect there was a great likelyhood, that <hi>Loucali</hi> obſerved their March, and cruis'd thereabout to ſurprize them. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> deſpairing to ſuccour their Veſſels, ſent away Friggats in haſt to burn them, for fear they ſhould fall into the Infidels Hands: but this Order having been fortunately negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they underſtood that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were not on the Coaſt of <hi>Zant;</hi> and theſe Veſſels, condemned to the Flames, were thus miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don John,</hi> being returned to <hi>Corfou,</hi> ſent for the whole Fleet thither, as the moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Place for taking Reſolutions. The <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> murmured at all the Courſes they were made to take. They had been made to come from <hi>Cerigo</hi> to <hi>Zant,</hi> from <hi>Zant</hi> to <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> and then to <hi>Corfou,</hi> ſo that their Rowers were even ſpent with inceſſantly towing the great Veſſels, and they juſtly complain'd of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Delays that interven'd, to make them loſe the Benefit of this Campaign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Colonni</hi> alſo teſtified his reſentment of it with ſo much the more Vehemency, in that he was publiſht to be the Cauſe, and was more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over informed, that <hi>Don John,</hi> offended at his not having ſtayed for him at <hi>Corfou,</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>Colonni,</hi> ambitious of the Honour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, had forgot to obey, and had, during this
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:96181:190"/>
whole War, ſhewn a far greater Inclination for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> than for the King of <hi>Spain. Colonni,</hi> incenſed by theſe Diſcourſes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer able to ſuffer the inſupportable Pride of this Young Prince (who, having no greater Authority in the Councel of War than the other Two Generals, would nevertheleſs, though abſent from the Fleet, have it ſteer according to his <hi>Caprichio,</hi> and ſent his Orders to his Collegues, as if they were inferiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers) adviſed the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were no leſs diſpleaſed than himſelf, to ſeek ſome other Expedients for the ſecurity of their Affairs, and no longer to relye on the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

                     <hi>Don John,</hi> fearing, leſt this Retreat might draw an Envy upon himſelf, pacifyed <hi>Colonni</hi> by new Proteſtations of Amity, and promiſed him to live from henceforth with him, as he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done. The <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Don John</hi> had alſo a Diſpute, which <hi>Colonni</hi> by his Prudence terminated. <hi>Don John</hi> offered them <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers to fill up their Companies, and told them, he would not proceed in the War, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were compleat. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> who had already experienced the ill effect of this Mixture, abſolutely refuſed to receive any Strangers amongſt them, ſo that this affair was like to produce bad Conſequences, had not <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonni</hi> found out an expedient, by giving ſome of his Soldiers to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and taking thoſe of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> alledging, that the Iſland of <hi>Corfou,</hi> already much incommoded by the Incurſions of the Infidels, would be entirely exhauſted, if the Confederate Army ſtayed any longer there; a Council aſſembled, where it was reſolved to ſet Sayl. The Fleet, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Second of <hi>September,</hi> arrived not at <hi>Cephalonia</hi> till after eight days Sayl, the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> being very impatient at this ſlow manner of proceeding. Going thence towards <hi>Zant, Don John</hi> learnt by his Spies, that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet was riding before <hi>Navarin,</hi> not ſo much in condition to attack the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves This place is ſituated on the Bay of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> and is very conſiderable through the Commodiouſneſs of its Harbour. The Generals were of opinion to ſayl thither, with
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:96181:191"/>
a Deſign to fight, if the Enemy would accept the Challenge, or elſe to block them up there. Thoſe, who knew the Situation of the Port, aſſured them, that the Caſtle, placed on a riſing Ground to defend it, could not much damnifie the Veſſels, lying before it in the open Sea. A Review was taken of the Fleet, the great Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels left at <hi>Zant,</hi> and the Gallies advanced as far as the Iſles of the <hi>Strophades,</hi> which are in the mid-way between <hi>Zant</hi> and <hi>Navarin,</hi> where they paſſed the Night, to conceal their coming from the Enemy. Their Reſolution was, to go as far as the Iſle of <hi>Sapienza,</hi> not above three Miles from <hi>Modon,</hi> and ſtop that Paſſage, leſt the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould go and ſhelter themſelves in the Port of this laſt place. Had this Deſign, which was ſo well laid, been regularly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they would, without ſtriking a Blow, have made themſelves Maſters of above Threeſcore and Ten Gallies that were at <hi>Navarin;</hi> but the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not being diligent enough, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the placing themſelves in the Poſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Succeſs of this Affair, being the next day after Sun-riſe but over againſt <hi>Prothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> but Ten Miles from <hi>Navarin;</hi> ſo that the Infidels, perceiving them, had time enough to get into the Port of <hi>Modon.</hi> The Blame was laid upon the Admirals Pylot, who, to excuſe this ill Conduct, ſaid, that he thought himſelf obliged to ſlacken his Sayls, during the Night, for fear of running a ground. But whether the Fault were in the Pylot, or whether Heaven was ſtill angry with the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> 'tis evident, that the Confederates miſs'd an opportunity of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96181:191"/>
gaining a compleat Victory over the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> perceiving, that the Enemies haſted away with Sayl and Oar, <hi>Colonni</hi> propoſed to <hi>Don John,</hi> the ſending a Detachment of Gallies to fall upon their Rear, and offered to command this Detachment himſelf. This Deſign was approv'd, and Six and Twenty Gallies gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him for the execution of it: but he was ſcarce got half his way with great hopes of a Glorious Succeſs, when he received Orders to come and join the Fleet. <hi>Don John,</hi> to juſtifie this ſudden Change, told the Officers, that the Infidels made a ſhow of coming to charge him, and that 'twas neceſſary all their Forces ſhould be together, for fear of a Surprize. The moſt clear-ſighted were perſwaded that <hi>Colonni</hi>'s Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, jealous of his Reputation, had done him this ill Office. He went nevertheleſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to view the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> having with him but one Gally more, and offer'd to attack two of their Gallies, which lagg'd behind the reſt of the Fleet; but theſe two being aſſiſted by Six others, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſent out Ten, which <hi>Louchali</hi> no ſooner perceived, but he advanced with the greateſt part of his Fleet, and eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Affront, they were like to receive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Don John</hi> could bring up his to oppoſe them. <hi>Colonni</hi> retreated in good order; and there was in this Rencounter a ſecond opportunity loſt of gaining a great Advantage; for if <hi>Don John</hi> had made Head againſt the Enemy, they would rather have abandoned their eight Gallies, than have fought, ſo weak as they were; but the ſluggiſhneſs of the Confederates facilitated
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:96181:192"/>
their Retreat into the Port of <hi>Modon,</hi> where they were ſecure. <hi>Don John</hi> drew up in <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and preſented himſelf before the Mouth of the Harbor. He a long time defied them with Injuries and Reproaches, and about Evening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in the ſame order. <hi>Louchali,</hi> that he might not be convinced of ſhunning the Fight, came forth out of the Port of <hi>Modon,</hi> and drew up under the Walls of the place. <hi>Don John</hi> returned at the ſame time, and ſounded to Battel. The <hi>Turk,</hi> truſting more to the Walls of the place, than to his Shipping, durſt not come too far off, nor ours approach too near them; ſo that having a long time ſhot at each other, the Enemies returned into their Harbour, leaving the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Maſters of the Sea. The next day <hi>Don John</hi> returned in the ſame order to the ſame place; but none of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ships appearing, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſet Sayl, with the Honour of having forc't the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Pride to yield them the Sea, and went to take in freſh Water at <hi>Coron,</hi> a place of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, not very far off. <hi>Louchali</hi> landed Four Thouſand Foot to drive them thence; but <hi>Paul Sforza,</hi> whom <hi>Don John</hi> had put aſhore with a conſiderable Detachment, ſo vigorouſly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this Foot, which already incommoded our Men, that having ſlain two hundred of them, he put the reſt to Flight. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> on the Two next days again offered the Infidels Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; and <hi>Louchali</hi> was content with putting himſelf a ſecond time in Battalia under the Ramparts of <hi>Modon.</hi>

The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet putting in at the Iſle of <hi>Sapienza,</hi> the moſt experienced Captains were of Opinion, to get an exact Underſtanding of the State, the Town and Port of <hi>Modon</hi> were then in. <hi>Don John</hi> highly approved of this Deſign, went aboard <hi>Colonni</hi>'s Gally, attended by <hi>Foſcarini,</hi> and ſome other Officers, to go and take a view of it himſelf. Having ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently obſered the Strength and Weakneſs of the place, he reſolved to attack the Enemies there, and for this purpoſe ſent for the Great Veſſels from <hi>Zant,</hi> to ſhelter the Gallies from the Fire of the Town: there were two Bottoms joyned together, and covered with great Planks, on which they Built a Fort, and filled it with Earth, for the better ſecuring the Gallies. <hi>Don John</hi> was of opinion, that the Infidels, frighted with this Stupendious Machin, would leave their Veſſels, and fly aſhore; and without doubt this Project would have ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, had the Execution of it been more ſpeedy. But while the Squadron was expected from <hi>Zant,</hi> and the new Building went ſlowly on, <hi>Don John</hi> advanced to <hi>Navarin,</hi> either with an Intentention to ſurprize the Place (though the <hi>Venetians</hi> told him, the taking of it would be of little Importance to them) or becauſe he thought he might more eaſily take in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there, through the Commodiouſneſs of the River. The Enemies, who had already ſeiz'd the Avenues of it, were ill treated by our Canon; and <hi>Sforza,</hi> at the Head of Five Thouſand Men, driving them back into the Town, favoured the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Watring. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:96181:193"/>
Farneſe</hi> attempted to beſiege <hi>Navarin</hi> by order from <hi>Don John,</hi> who gave him Six Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men with ſome Pieces of Canon, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy put in Battery. But the place was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reliev'd by ſo great a number of <hi>Turks,</hi> flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither from all parts, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> got with all ſpeed to their Ships, being glad to be quit with the loſs of their Cannon. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign alſo of ſetting upon the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet in their Harbor, for which all things were ready, was given over by <hi>Don John,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> alarmed by the Uncertainty of the Succeſs, not caring to preſs him any further on it. They afterwards deliberated on the beſieging <hi>Modon,</hi> but 'twas not thought fit to attempt any thing more, the <hi>Turks</hi> keeping themſelves cloſe, and the <hi>Spaniaràs</hi> teſtifying a deſire to end the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign towards the middle of <hi>Autumn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their Impatience to return, made them about the midſt of <hi>October</hi> repreſent to <hi>Don John,</hi> that he had long enough ſerv'd the Republick, and that he ought now to think of returning towards <hi>Sicily;</hi> and this Prince, who was no leſs impatient than they to leave the <hi>Morea,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that he had ſpent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, having ſcarce enough left to carry him into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he was reſolved to put the Fleet into Winter Quarters. He promiſed them to come the next year much earlier, and far better provided, and endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, that they ought to be contented with the Progreſs of this Campaign, and that 'twas no ſmall Honour for them to have forc't the infidels to keep cloſe within their Ports, and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:96181:193"/>
to have held them, as it were, beſieged there. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> more troubled, than ſurprized, at this Diſcourſe, and not able to comprehend that <hi>Don John,</hi> having made them wait for him all the Summer, ſhould come from ſo plentiful a Country as <hi>Sicily,</hi> with not above Fifteen days Proviſion, earneſtly beſought him not to leave the Fleet in the very Moment, that ſeemed to give the Confederates the greateſt hopes of entirely defeating the Infidels, and rendring the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name formidable in all the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea; repreſenting to him withal, that 'twould be very ſhameful for them to ſeparate, without having done any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Exploit; That the Veſſels of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet, agitated by the <hi>South</hi> Wind, which blew violently at that time of the Year, and to which the Harbor of <hi>Modon</hi> was expoſed, would of neceſſity fall foul one upon another, or that their whole Army, which, having exhauſted all the Neighbouring places, began to be in want of Proviſions, muſt either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves from Famine by Flight, or yield without Fighting; That they would oblige themſelves to furniſh him with whatever he wanted; That they daily expected Boats from <hi>Sicily,</hi> laden with Corn; That ſeveral al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were coming to them from <hi>Venice;</hi> and that by delaying a little his Departure, he would return home crown'd with Glory and Honour, would do the Republick a Service, the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereof they ſhould eternally conſerve. Having ſpoken in this manner to the Prince, they complained fiercely to the Principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:96181:194"/>
that the Victory was pluck't out of their Hands, and that the Common Cauſe was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely betrayed, to hinder them from recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Loſſes; That when they might vanquiſh without any danger either from the Sea, or the Enemy, they would retire upon pretence of wanting Proviſions, and let an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my eſcape out of their Hands, which was too weak to make a Defence, and too numerous, by the Auxiliaries they had drawn from all the Inland Places, to ſubſiſt long there. Theſe juſt Complaints ſtayed <hi>Don John</hi> two days longer: He would not provoke the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for fear they ſhould renounce the League; but this little delay being expired, he went aboard <hi>Foſcarini</hi>'s Gally, accompanyed only by <hi>Colonni,</hi> where by Careſſes and fair Pretences of Amity, he got him at laſt to conſent to his Departure. <hi>Colonni</hi> alſo preſſed him to yield willingly to this inſuperable Neceſſity; and <hi>Don John</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him, that, if he met the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Convoy, or that any attempt were made on the Coaſts of the <hi>Adriatick Gulf,</hi> he would come ſpeedily and re-joyn them. He immediately ſet Sayl, and came with the Wind in his Poop to Anchor at the Port of <hi>Gomeniza,</hi> over againſt the Iſle of <hi>Corfou.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Sueſſa,</hi> and <hi>Giovanni Andrea Doria,</hi> who came to meet him with Fourteen Gallies, boarded him at the ſame time; they were of opinion to ſtay ſome days there; but <hi>Don John,</hi> who fear'd the Popes ordering him to paſs the Winter in <hi>Greece,</hi> would not hearken to it; and in effect the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> had ſecretly ſolicited <hi>Gregory</hi> about it,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:96181:194"/>
perſwading him, that 'twas the only way to draw any Advantage from this War. <hi>Antonio Tipoli,</hi> whom the Republick ſent into <hi>Spain</hi> after the Victory of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> had repreſented alſo to King <hi>Philip,</hi> that nothing ſo much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Progreſs of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleets, as their being ſo late before they joyned; but this Prince had rejected that Expedient, not being willing the Fleet, which was the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſo many Realms, ſhould Winter in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo remote, and be expoſed to the Injuries of ſo Tempeſtuous a Seaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don John,</hi> not to be worſe than his Word, offered the <hi>Venetians</hi> Four Thouſand Men to attack ſome places on the Coaſts, and ſtill kept on his way; but they refuſed theſe Re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements, fearing, leſt the Antipathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Nations ſhould rather prejudice than advantage their Affairs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don John</hi> determined to go into <hi>Spain</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after his Arrival in <hi>Sicily;</hi> but the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> foreſeeing, that the farther he went, the later he would return in the Spring, beſought the Pope to ſtay him in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Pope ſent him Order ſo to do by <hi>Claudio de Conzaga,</hi> a young Lord, whoſe Wit and Addreſs obliged the Prince to give his Holyneſs this Mark of his Obedience. <hi>Colonni,</hi> by the Conſent of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> and the Republick, went into <hi>Spain,</hi> to incite the King in their Names to redouble his Zeal for the Defence of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> The greateſt part of his Miniſters were not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much inclin'd to it: ſome were tired with the Length of the War, made in ſo remote a
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:96181:195"/>
Country; and others apprehended, leſt <hi>Don John</hi> ſhould become too Powerful by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſo conſiderable an Army. But <hi>Philip,</hi> thinking 'twould tend to his Diſgrace, to put any Obſtacle to the Succeſs of an Enterprize, managed by the Soveraign Prelat for the Glory of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name, anſwered <hi>Colonni</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably, and they began at <hi>Rome</hi> to enter into Debate about the Preparatives for the next Campaign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Louchali,</hi> who deſpaired of ſaving his Fleet, and lookt upon himſelf as irrecoveraby loſt, whether he ſtaid in his Poſt, fought or fled, had aſſembled the intimateſt of his Friends; and not knowing which would be moſt dangerous for him, to fall into the Hands of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or to appear before <hi>Selim,</hi> was already thinking of making his eſcape into <hi>Africk:</hi> but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the Confederates to <hi>Corfou</hi> having left him the Sea open, he found himſelf, contrary to all apperaance, diſ-engaged from ſo cruel a Perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and returned Triumphant to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> A ſtrange Metamorphoſis! When the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Troops he had ſent for to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the furtheſt part of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching him to his Face, with having impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently hazarded the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Gallies, had reduced him to the utmoſt Deſpondence, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Stupidity on a ſudden changes his ill Fortune: and this Baſſa, who was ready to go and hide himſelf in the Deſarts of <hi>Africk,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf before the <hi>Sultan</hi> like a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, diſſipates all the diſadvantagious Reports, ſpread abroad againſt his Conduct, receives En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:96181:195"/>
and Careſſes from the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> for having protected a Fleet, weakned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the laſt Defeat, though he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways coaſted the Enemies, who, deſparing of ever being able to force them to Fight, were at laſt compelled to abandon <hi>Greece,</hi> without making any conſiderable Attempt. The <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> ſtill amus'd at the Battel of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> thought they had gotten a Glorious Advantage, in that they were not again beaten, but had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained the Preſence of a Victorious Army with unequal Forces. This Joy of theirs was ſo much the more grievous to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in that a few days before a Soldier of their Fleet, going in great haſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> told them, that the Confederates, having worſted the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels in a great Sea-Fight before <hi>Navarin,</hi> were Maſters of the Sea, and the People of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> had made an Inſurrection. The Report of a man, who affirmed, That he was himſelf in the Battel, was eaſily credited; and the Rumor of this falſe news redoubled the Confederates Confuſion. The Impoſtor, who had invented this Tale, only to get ſome Money from the Pope, ſuddenly diſappeared, and we learnt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the certainty of <hi>Don John's</hi> return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sicily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> maugre the Diſtruſt they had of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and all the publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Diſcommodities they ſuffered by the War, had ſo far confided in their Maritime Forces, as to flatter themſelves, they ſhould this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign drive the Infidels out of the Sea, and open themſelves a Paſſage into <hi>Greece.</hi> But
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96181:196"/>
ſeeing all their Endeavors fruſtrated, and the Republick on the one ſide expoſed to the Fury of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and on the other, menaced by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who in their Thoughts ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up their Towns upon the Continent, found themſelves in a very perplex'd Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Antient Magiſtrates, who from the very beginning had no great Inclination either to the War or League, ſaid, There was no longer any Relying on the Aſſiſtance of ſuch Allies; That 'twas now evident, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had no deſire to oppoſe the Infidels, but were even ſorry for the Victory of <hi>Lepanto;</hi> That it not having been then in their Power to reſiſt the Ordinances of Heaven, they had done, what in them lay, to hinder the <hi>Venetians</hi> from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the Benefit of it; That they, for this purpoſe, rais'd a Thouſand Difficulties about Trifles; That they had for no other reaſon lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred out ſo much Time in Preparations, as not to be ready to ſet out till the very end of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but to ruine their juſt and reaſonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; That they had given Ear to ridiculous Projects, during the Execution of which, the Republick was hindred from ſecuring their Iſlands by their own Forces from the Incurſions of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> That having exahuſted their whole Store of ſhuffling Tricks and Artifices, they alledged the pretended Troubles of <hi>France;</hi> That afterwards, on pretence of ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Enterprize, they had made moſt of their Gallies come from the furtheſt parts of <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Corfou,</hi> which Voyage had taken up more time than the War it ſelf; That having ſtayed
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:96181:196"/>
a few days, to make a ſhew, as if they deſired to fight, they had let the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet eſcape, though 'twere much weaker than their own, and might eaſily have been defeated by their keeping their Poſt; That the loſs of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the Ravaging of their Iſlands, the Taking of their Towns in <hi>Epire,</hi> and the Ruining of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,</hi> whoſe Fields and Villages were all laid waſt, even within reach of Cannon-Shot from their fortified Towns, were all Effects of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Perfidiouſneſs, who had neither ſet out in time, nor faithfully performed any one Article of the Treaty; That having many Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies un-employed in their Ports, they had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of the Republick; That <hi>Giovanni An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea Doria,</hi> left in <hi>Sicily</hi> with Fourteen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, could ſcarce find in his Heart to ſet forth time enough to meet <hi>Don John,</hi> as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into Winter Quarters. Then one of the Principal of them, taking up the Diſcourſe, ſaid, <hi>And what? Do you not ſee, that our Fleet, our Generals, and all our Authority are ſubjected to the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Tyranny? and that</hi> Don John <hi>bas by little and little made himſelf abſolute Maſter of the Soveraign Power? That</hi> Colonni, <hi>who has hitherto oppoſed King</hi> Philip's <hi>Intention, now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares for him, letting himſelf be drawn by Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of Intereſt, of which he was not formerly ſuſceptible. That our General himſelf, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſhewing ſome Reſpect to the Prince's Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, lets go his Authority, ſuffering it to be uſurpt by too much Condeſcendence; ſo that this Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous young Man decides Soveraignty, and believes himſelf above the Laws and Conditions of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:96181:197"/>
of Allyance; he ordains, he commands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communicating with his Collegues; he rewards, he puniſhes, whom he pleaſes, and as he thinks good: And he, who could not ſuffer</hi> Venieri's <hi>chaſtiſing according to the Laws of War, three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, that deſerved Death, exerciſes his unjuſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Confederates, without adviſing or conſulting with any one. Our Gratifying his Spleen by re-calling</hi> Venieri <hi>is the Cauſe, that none dare contradict his Sentiments. In vain did the Generals and the whole Fleet beſeech him not to waſt all the Summer in fruitleſs and ſuperfluous running to and fro, he conſtrained them neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to come and join him at</hi> Corfou, <hi>without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them any of the Honours, which a Naval Army is wont on ſuch occaſions to receive; as if ſuch a Concourſe of Troops had aſſembled, and met together in that place, only to acknowledge him, and to give him alone all ſort of Honour and Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Diſcourſes, held amongſt the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt of the State in Derogation to the League, the funeſt Conſequences of which they dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, came to the Colledge of <hi>Ten.</hi> This Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal has Right to decide abſolutely in matters of Peace and War. The Magiſtrates, which compoſe it, being ſecretly aſſembled, began with deploring the Death of the deceaſed Pope, whoſe Vigour and Authority kept in ſome ſort the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to their Duty: and were more ſenſible of their Loſs in that Soveraign Prelate, becauſe they ſaw not the like firmneſs in his Succeſſor. They then reckoned up all their Damages and other Diſgraces; they lookt into the inability of the City to contribute any longer to the exceſſive Expences of the War;
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:96181:197"/>
they conſidered the People of the Continent, as not in Condition to continue the Payment of their Taxes, as appeared by the daily Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints they made to the Senate againſt the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of theſe Exactions; and that, to augment the Misfortune, the Interruption of Commerce had conſiderably diminiſht both the publick Revenues, and private Mens Eſtates: That the great numbers of Mariners, they had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe Three Years made uſe of, had ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſht the Countries of Labourers, that the Land in many places remain'd untill'd; That the Excurſions of the Infidels, even to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gates of the Towns in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> hindred the bringing thither of Convoys, and famiſh'd their Garriſons and Inhabitants; That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Parts of their Iſlands, ſo often ravaged, ſuffered the ſame ſcarcity; That there was no having of Corn from the Neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to feed ſuch a Multitude, without paying very great Cuſtom; and yet this People with their Land and Sea-Forces muſt have a Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; That they were daily ſeeking for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to thoſe great Miſchiefs, but could not find any; That though they ſhould have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Courage enough to ſurmount them, and ſhould want neither Money, Victuals, nor Ammunition, yet would it be impoſſible for them to draw any Advantage thence, as long as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould delay their ſetting forth till the beginning of Autumn, and if, to excuſe themſelves from attacking the Enemy, they ſhould ſtill alledge the ſecret deſigns of the <hi>French</hi> Hugonots, with ſeveral other
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:96181:198"/>
groundleſs Pretences, through which 'twas plainly to be ſeen, they had no other Aim, but to ſpin out the War in favour of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and by this new Stratagem to weaken the Commonwealth; That they had unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contributed to the only Victory, gotten over the <hi>Turks;</hi> and that, in fine, the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick could not forget, what their Embaſſadour with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had written to them on the Subject of this Victory, of which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> had no ſooner receiv'd the news, but he complain'd to his Miniſters of <hi>Don Johns</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, whom he had expreſly forbidden to fight, and hazard his Fleet; ſo that one of his Favourites, taking thence occaſion to praiſe the Severity of that <hi>Roman,</hi> who cauſed the Head of his own Son, though a Conquerour, to be ſmitten off, for having fought againſt his Orders, councelled him to renew ſo terrible an Example; That <hi>Doria</hi> had gain'd the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Kings Favor by declaring againſt the Senates Intereſt; <hi>Colonni</hi> on the contrary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving utterly loſt his good opinion, for being willing to promote it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nicholas Ponti,</hi> one of the Council of <hi>Ten,</hi> then aſſuming the Diſcourſe, ſaid, <hi>To what purpoſe do we tire our ſelves with continual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, which ſhew nothing but our Weakneſs and want of Underſtanding, in delivering our ſelves now, more than ever, to Traitors, that have ſo oſten abuſed us? Why are we tranſported againſt People, who wiſely know how to make advantage of our ſimplicity, and far better underſtand their Intereſt, than we do ours? And in effect, ſince the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:96181:198"/>
defeating of the</hi> Ottomans <hi>will not any way be particularly beneficial to them, they aim, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing the War, to ruine our State, whoſe over-great Potency puts an Obſtacle to their deſigns of invading</hi> Italy. <hi>If the</hi> Turks <hi>are vanquiſht, we confirm the Extent of our Soveraignty; the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>who gains nothing by this Victory, would on the contrary loſe much by the Defeat of the Confederates Army. Underſtanding this, they have nouriſht the War, feeding us with vain hopes, to ſtrengthen themſelves againſt us: And do you not think, Gentlemen, 'twould be much more advantagious for us to imitate this Conduct, than condemn it? They'll willingly ſuffer us to ſtile them perjur'd and perfidious, provided they attain their Ends, and profit by our Reproaches and Injuries: For Good Faith, Religion, and Zeal to advance the Glory of the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Name, are all Specious and Magnificent Words, which they no longer eſteem, than they may favour their Ambition. Having more than once tryed to our coſt the Inequality of our Strength againſt the</hi> Turks, <hi>we now experiment the little Confidence we can put in the Aſſiſtance of our Allies. The Infidels, weakned by the Loſs of a numerous Fleet, and ſcarce daring to appear before us, have had the Confidence to enter the Port of</hi> Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>in Triumph, for having eſcap'd being a ſecond time beaten. What muſt we expect, when they ſhall return the next Spring with new Forces? In the mean time we are enfeebled, and reduced to the deplorable Eſtate, in which the</hi> Spaniards <hi>deſire us, to make themſelves Maſters of</hi> Italy. <hi>Are we become inſenſible to theſe Evils, and neglecting
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:96181:199"/>
what is eſſential and uſeful, ſhall we let our ſelves ſtill be ſeduced by falſe Appearances, and continue a Prey to the Artifices of this Faithleſs Nation? Shall we never get out of this ſhameful Lethargy, and open our Eyes, to ſee our Misfortunes and Diſgraces? 'Tis much more eaſie for us by a dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Management to ſhelter our ſelves againſt the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Power, than to avoid the Ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es laid for us by the</hi> Spaniards.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Reaſons made the Council of <hi>Ten</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to attempt the Accommodation with the Port, not being able to promiſe themſelves any Advantage by continuing ſo incommodious a War. They did not impart this Deliberation to the Senate, for fear of making it too pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, truſting the Secret with none but <hi>Marco Antonio Barbaro,</hi> who was detained Priſoner at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> They charged him to under-feel the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> and conclude a Peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reaſonable Conditions; and in the mean time they conſulted with the reſt of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates about the Subſiſtance of the Troops for the next Campaign.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> had good Garriſons in the Towns of <hi>Dalmatia:</hi> but the Infidels, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Country, very much incommoded them by hindring them from Proviſions. They ſeiz'd of a Tower on the Mouth of the River <hi>Salone,</hi> which was deliver'd up to them by him, to whom <hi>Baglioni</hi> had entruſted the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of it; and by a like Treachery they made themſelves Maſters of a little Caſtle, bearing the Name of a Rock, on which it was built, whence they much moleſted the Town of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latro.</hi>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:96181:199"/>
Theſe Traitors were puniſh'd according to the greatneſs of their Crimes. The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals were ſtrangled, and then hung up by one Foot, (a fit Puniſhment for ſuch Offenders) and their Accomplices were ſent aboard the Gallies. In the mean time the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited a <hi>Turk,</hi> to whom they offered great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to engage him in the ſame Treachery, of which they had juſt made ſo rigorous an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. This Infidel, teſtifying to them ſome deſire of becoming a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> promiſed to ſurrender up <hi>Cliſſa</hi> into their Hands, and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively kept his Word. This Town is the beſt fortified in all <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> full of Inhabitants, and on the Poſſeſſion of which depended that of many Neighbouring Places. The <hi>Turks</hi> had heretofore taken it from the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and were very vigilant in keeping it: the Plague, which then raged there, having driven away almoſt all the Garriſon, the Traitor made uſe of ſo favourable an Opportunity to accompliſh his Deſign: the Execution whereof was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Hector Troni,</hi> who marching in the middle of the day at the Head of 1500. Foot to the Gate, which by Agreement was to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, entred the Town, and made himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of it, with the ſlaughter of a few Soldiers that reſiſted. The War would have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on that ſide, had <hi>Troni</hi> known how to keep his Conqueſt. But thinking, that he rather went to plunder, than to take <hi>Cliſſa,</hi> he went out of it, laden with Spoil, excuſing his not ſtaying any longer there, by his not being ſtrong enough to defend it againſt the Infidels, who
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:96181:200"/>
would not fail to come ſpeedily, and beſiege it. The Senate being highly diſpleas'd at this Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize, <hi>Troni</hi> was recall'd to <hi>Venice,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; but his Credit and Friends appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Magiſtrates Wrath, as is uſually done, when any Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> is queſtioned.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> re-taking <hi>Cliſſa,</hi> derided the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> miſerable Conduct, with ſtinging Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery counſelling them, to renounce the Art of War, and to apply themſelves for the future only to Traffick, Law-Suits, and State In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues. They afterwards plundred the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with ſeveral ſmall Bodies of Horſe, who, approaching the very Gates of the Town, held by the Segniory, carryed Terror and Dread on all ſides. They aimed particularly at <hi>Cataro,</hi> becauſe by driving the <hi>Venetians</hi> out of that Town, they were aſſured of all <hi>Epire.</hi> This place is ſcituated in the bottom of the Gulph, called by the Ancients, <hi>Rizonicus,</hi> there being no coming thither from <hi>Venice</hi> but by Sea. The <hi>Turks,</hi> who had the Fort of <hi>Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novo</hi> on the left hand of the Gulph, to make themſelves Maſters of the Paſſage, built, where the Gulph was narroweſt, a Fort, defended by a Rampart, and deep Ditch, on which they raiſed a Battery of Eighteen Pieces of Canon. This Fort commanded the other ſide of the Gulph, ſo that it prohibited the entrance of any <hi>Venetian</hi> Veſſels. The <hi>Catarians</hi> ſoon felt the Inconvenience of this new Work, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves at the point of being ſtarv'd, ſent to give them notice at <hi>Venice</hi> of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> exceedingly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:96181:200"/>
themſelves for all places on the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Gulph, took ſpeedy care for the Relief of this; and <hi>Venieri</hi> being already returned to <hi>Venice,</hi> Orders were ſent to <hi>Giacomo Sorancio,</hi> that he ſhould part immediately from <hi>Corfou</hi> with Twenty Gallies, to relieve <hi>Cataro.</hi> He obeyed without delay, and Fortune ſeconded his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; for the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Epire,</hi> ſeeing no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in Condition to attempt any thing, was gone to the remoteſt Frontiers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, with what Troops he had, excepting Two Hundred Men, appointed for the Guard of this Fort. <hi>Sorancio</hi> landed Four Thouſand, and after a gallant Defence, made by the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, who were all put to the Sword, took the Fort, which he eas'd, having firſt carryed away the Canon; and thus the <hi>Catarians,</hi> being delivered, recovered the Liberty of the Sea. This Vigorous Action was performed in the year 1572.</p>
                  <p>After the Return of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> with his Fleet into <hi>Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> made very great Complaints againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> beſeeching him to oblige all the Conſederates to labour unanimouſly for the Defence of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi> and to ſupport the Intereſt of the Common-Cauſe with more Vigour, than they had hitherto ſhewn. They at the ſame time repreſented to his Holyneſs, that 'twas in vain to agree upon the Condition of a Treaty, and confirm it afterwards by Solemn Oaths, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of punctually executing it, every one ſhould, either as his Caprichio, or Intereſt might incline him, preſume to explain it
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:96181:201"/>
to his own Advantage; That 'twas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly agreed, the Fleets ſhould be ready to ſail into <hi>Greece</hi> at the beginning of every Spring, and yet the Confederates were ſcarce by the end of the Summer got to the Enemies, in order to fight; that having only ſhewed the Infidels the number of their Veſſels, they reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, without daring to attempt any thing; That but by ſtaying a little longer at Sea, they might eaſily have ruin'd the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet, and driven the <hi>Barbarians</hi> out of the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean;</hi> That <hi>Don John</hi> uſurpt to himſelf all the Authority, contrary to an Article of the League, which ſhares it equally betwixt the Three Generals; That not content with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſole Deciſion of Matters, when he commanded in Perſon, he pretended alſo to have the ſame Obedience paid to his Orders in his abſence; That theſe Contraventions were inſupportable, and that the Republick was in fine weary of bearing them. They had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conferences with <hi>Gregory,</hi> at which they enlarged upon every one of theſe Grievances. In the firſt Aſſembly of the Cardinals and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, held by the Pope, touching the Affairs of the League, <hi>Paulo Tipoli</hi> inſiſted very much on the Expedition into the <hi>Morea;</hi> he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they ſhould ſet forth much earlier, than they had done the two laſt Campaigns, and that an hundred new Gallies ſhould be added to the Fleet; and in effect there was very great apparence, the <hi>Turks</hi> would the next Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer be exceeding ſtrong, conſidering the news they received of the Preparations making at
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:96181:201"/>
                     <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for the ſetting forth a very great Fleet: beſides that, 'twas a piece of Policy in the <hi>Venetians</hi> to ſpread abroad theſe Reports, as being advantagious to them, whether they would conclude a Peace, or carry on a War. <hi>Tipoli</hi> propoſed further, that an hundred Sayl ſhould be choſen out of all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet, to go, as ſoon as the Sea ſhould be Navigable, and ravage the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> Territories, take as many Slaves as they could, and at the ſame time ſecure the <hi>Venetian</hi> Iſles from the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; That a new Adreſs ſhould be made to the Emperor, and whatever he ſhould deſire, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him, to engage him in the League; That Application ſhould be alſo made to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> That Embaſſadors ſhould be ſent to the great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the <hi>Polonians</hi> being then buſied about a new King: In fine, that all Potentates, and all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nations, ſhould be incited to take Arms againſt their Common Enemy. All theſe things were granted <hi>Tipoli;</hi> and 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that the Confederate Princes ſhould be requeſted to give their Agents ſufficient Power, to the end the Conſulations might not be delayed. The Cardinals afterwards propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the Confederates ſhould by the ſame Treaty, engage to have all the ſame Friends and the ſame Enemies. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who found their Advantage in this new Article, willingly accepted it; but the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadour ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely rejected it, ſaying, That the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick would not enter into any new Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that this would put back many,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:96181:202"/>
who had promiſed to ſign the League. <hi>Tipoli,</hi> ſeeing them propoſe Innovations, demanded, that the common Expences of the War ſhould be examin'd. His Holyneſs had been long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd about it; but diſcouraged by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the over exact Reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> had ſtill put off ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult an Account. The <hi>Venetians</hi> affirmed, that they were near Three Milions of Livers afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and pretended to be re-imburſt, what they were out above the ſhare, they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aſſerting the contrary, the Pope could not moderate the difference, becauſe it was to be begun by making an Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of all the <hi>Venetians</hi> had furniſht out from the beginning of the War. However 'twas ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent through theſe Difficulties, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick had expended more than his Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Pope ordered, that, till their accounts could be more exactly ſtated, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould pay the <hi>Venetians</hi> Threeſcore and Two Thouſand Crowns of Gold for the Corn, they had procured of the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Merchants, amounting to that Sum; and this expedient quieted for a time this Contention. Then they treated about the Management of the next Campaign. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to carry the War into <hi>Africk,</hi> reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, that the Rendezvous of the Fleet might be appoinred at <hi>Otranto:</hi> but <hi>Tipoli</hi> oppoſed it, repreſenting, how urgent a neceſſity there was of preventing, at the beginning of the Spring, the Infidels Attempts, who would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Iſlands, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Gandy,</hi>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:96181:202"/>
if the <hi>Chirſtians</hi> were not ſtrong enough to hinder them The <hi>Spaniards</hi> inſiſted no farther on it, and 'twas agreed that the Confederate Fleet ſhould be compos'd of three hundred Galleys, and meet at <hi>Corfou.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> then propos'd, that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were nearer the Rendezvous, and much better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of Gallies, than the reſt of the Allies, ſhould ſet forth ſome for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which his Catholick Majeſty ſhould at his own charge maintain: But on the Republicks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half 'twas anſwered, that 'twas not juſt, they, who were ſcarce able to bear their own part of the Burden, ſhould be loaded with anothers; That ſo Potent a Prince, as the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was Maſter of ſo many Coaſts, Maritime Places, and Ports, could not but have ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary Veſſels; and that not having yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> what they had advanced, 'twas not reaſonable for him to engage them in new Expences. And to prevent the <hi>Spaniards</hi> making any farther Reply, they ſaid, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King ought not to reckon in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Gallies, the Four, that were ſet forth by the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> nor as many more added by the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> ſince they came Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> They ſeemed to make the ſame Reproach to the Pope, in Reſpect of thoſe, ſent by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> that were incorporated into the Fleet of the Holy <hi>See.</hi> The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of all theſe Debates would not deſerve a place in this Hiſtory, were it not to ſhew the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Inſolence and Pride, who, deſiring
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:96181:203"/>
to have the Advantage in every thing, declar'd, that this Expedition having been undertaken only in favour of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the King their Maſter was no further concerned in it, than as having granted them his Protection. The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> in the mean time pleaſed themſelves with framing Difficulties on the ſmalleſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, purpoſely to tire out the Pope, and all thoſe that medled in this Negotiation. But there aroſe a new Diſpute of far greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. An Augmentation of the Gallies had been accorded, becauſe of the prodigious Preparations, making at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> but the time, when they were to meet on the Coaſts of <hi>Greece,</hi> was not agreed on. The <hi>Venetians</hi> deſir'd they might be ready to fight by the Month of <hi>March,</hi> affirming, that the Succeſs of this Campaign depended on their extream Diligence. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> on the contrary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the whole Month of <hi>June,</hi> to put their Fleet in Condition. Every one murmur'd againſt them at <hi>Venice,</hi> when <hi>Tipoli</hi> gave the Senate advice of this unjuſt and dangerous Propoſition. But the Council of <hi>Ten</hi> ſecretly rejoiced at it, becauſe of the Leiſure given them by it to learn from their Embaſſadour at the Port, what hopes there was of Peace, and take a Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuitable to the State of their Fortune. They acquainted <hi>Tipoli</hi> with their ſecret Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> giving him order to conclude nothing at <hi>Rome,</hi> to make no Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Time, by which the Fleets were required to ſet forth, and even to refuſe the Augmentation of the Gallies, he had himſelf
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:96181:203"/>
ſolicited. At his declaring himſelf in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly about this matter, every one miſtruſted ſome Intelligence between the Port and the Commonwealth: Theſe Suſpicions very much cool'd their Negotiations, and matters were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſlowly treated on at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Ten</hi> no ſooner underſtood, that <hi>Tipoli</hi> had, in Obedience to their Orders, perplex'd the Affairs, but they commended this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Dexterity, as having, by his Addreſs, put them in the beſt Condition they could deſire; but one amongſt them, riſing up, ſaid, <hi>Have a care, Gentlemen, of alienating the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates Minds, and breaking with them, before you know what to expect from the Port, and on what Conditions they will grant you Peace.</hi> This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe obliged the Council to enter into new Deliberations, and fearing to ſee themſelves expos'd on every ſide by being diſappointed of a Peace, and at the ſame time breaking the League, they ſent Orders to <hi>Tipoli</hi> to regulate the Conditions, on which he had ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo difficult.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conteſts having taken up all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Pope, in fine, by his Authority ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that his Fleet and the King of <hi>Spains</hi> ſhould meet at <hi>Meſſina</hi> by the end of <hi>March,</hi> whence they ſhould immediately depart to join the <hi>Venetians</hi> at <hi>Corfou;</hi> That they ſhould all ſail together into <hi>Greece,</hi> fight the Infidels, if they met them by the way, and attempt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Generals ſhould judge neceſſary and advantagious for the Common Cauſe; That the Fleet ſhould be compoſed of Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:96181:204"/>
Gallies, Forty Veſſels, and as many Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſes as the Republick could ſet forth; That the Army ſhould conſiſt of Threeſcore Thouſand Men; That Every Gally ſhould carry at leaſt an Hundred and Fifty Soldiers; That they ſhould have Four Thouſand Five Hundred Horſes, for fear the Enemy ſhould attack any of the Confederates by Land; That no new Delay ſhould be granted for the Departure of the Fleets; That the Generals ſhould ſet Sail on the day appointed, with what Veſſels they ſhould have ready; and that the reſt ſhould follow, as ſoon as they ſhould be in Condition to quit the Ports; and that other things ſhould be ordered, as they were in the laſt Campaign. The <hi>Venetians</hi> obtained farther of his Holineſs, That none of the Allies might withdraw his Forces from the Chriſtian Army, ſhould even his own Territories be attackt by ſome declar'd Enemy. All Differences being thus regulated, <hi>Tipoli</hi> preſſed the Aſſembly for the ſpeedy ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth Three hundred Gallies, to pillage the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Iſlands, and ſecure the Republicks. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not daring to oppoſe it, becauſe the Pope approved it, anſwered, that they muſt Adreſs themſelves to <hi>Don John,</hi> to whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had probably ſent Orders about it.</p>
                  <p>There was at the ſame time a Propoſal made to <hi>Gregory</hi> about exchanging of Priſoners. There were ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> ſome conſiderable <hi>Turks,</hi> taken at the Battel of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> whoſe Throats would have been cut in Priſon, had the <hi>Venetians</hi> been hearkned to at firſt: but
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:96181:204"/>
                     <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth abhorring ſuch Inhumanity, they thought beſt to ranſom with them ſeveral <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Officers, who had loſt their Liberty in their Service, for fear leſt, after the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Peace, the Pope ſhould refuſe to put them into their Hands. There was amongſt them two Sons of <hi>Haly</hi> by a Siſter of <hi>Selim's,</hi> one of which dyed at <hi>Rome:</hi> The Mother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the other of <hi>Don John</hi> by ſuch moving Letters, accompanyed with ſuch Magnificent Preſents, that he yielded to her Importunities; her Daughter alſo, who paſſed for one of the Faireſt Perſons in the World, writ to this Prince in Terms ſo full of Tenderneſs, that he eſteemed it an Honour and Pleaſure to himſelf, to ſolicit her Brothers Liberty with the Pope, who granting his Deſire, he ſent him back to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> having firſt treated him like the <hi>Grand Seignior's</hi> Nephew. But his Holineſs thought not fit to give the reſt their Liberty ſo ſoon. One of the Principal amongſt them was <hi>Mahomet Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Negro Ponte,</hi> a Man, whoſe diſpoſition was no way rude and barbarous, and who perfectly underſtood the Manners and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Europeans:</hi> He ſpake <hi>Italian</hi> reaſonably well; and ſome <hi>Romans,</hi> who had been at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> took delight in diſcourſing with him about the Battel: He told them, that two things principally gain'd the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the Day: to wit, their great number of Musketeers, whoſe Arms were much better in a Fight than their Darts or Arrows; and the Boards ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſides of their Gallies, in manner of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapets,</hi> with which their Soldiers being ſhelte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:96181:205"/>
fired on the Enemy with far greater Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: but he hoped, we ſhould not for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have this Advantage over them, ſince the Experiment had coſt 'em dear enough. One ſpeaking to him of the Victory at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> as of a Loſs to the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> far exceeding what he got by the Conqueſt of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> He ſmilingly anſwered, <hi>You have ſhaved our Beard, and the Hair will grow again: But the</hi> Venetians <hi>will never re-join to the Body of their State the Part, which we have cut off. Colonni,</hi> viſiting the Priſoners, taken in this Battel, commanded his Officers and Soldiers to treat them courteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and then turning to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Learn of us to practice Hamanity, you, who ſo barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cruelly treat our Chriſtian Priſoners.</hi> To which <hi>Mahomet</hi> made him this witty Anſwer: <hi>Your Excellency will be pleaſed to pardon our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſince we have been hitherto only uſed to take Priſoners, not having yet been ſuch our ſelves in the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>School.</hi> The Pope in the mean time ſolicited the Crowns to join their Arms to thoſe of the Confederates; and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who came to <hi>Rome</hi> to aſſiſt at the laſt Conclave, had given <hi>Gregory</hi> Hopes that the Allyance between <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> might be broken. This Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Eſteem amongſt the <hi>French</hi> having giv'n him an entire Knowledge of that Kingdoms Affairs, and the Kings true Sentiments; His Holineſs, on ſuch good aſſurance, believed, he might ſucceſsfully endeavour this Diſ-union: He writ about it to <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, who anſwered him, He ſhould willingly enter into the League;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:96181:205"/>
but the great Revolutions which had happened in his Kingdom, permitted him not to join with the Confederates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>France</hi> broken, and ſhattered into different Factions, was expoſed to the Plunder of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and the Invaſions of her other Neighbors. The <hi>Lorrain</hi> Princes, and other Principal Perſons in the Court, retired into the Country, being neither able to ſuffer the Imperious Humour of the Queen, nor ſubmit themſelves to the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> But theſe Princes, being a little after reconciled with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas de Mommorency,</hi> Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> drew the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> into their Party, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him new hopes of recovering his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and of diminiſhing the over-great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Queen Catherine,</hi> and ruining the Projects of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> they entred <hi>Paris,</hi> guarded by their Friends and Creatures, and drove all thoſe of the oppoſite Faction from Court. Thus <hi>France,</hi> becoming the Stage of a Civil War, ſaw more Blood ſhed in moſt of her Towns, than in the Famouſeſt Sieges and Battels of the laſt Age. They no longer amuſed themſelves with Diſputes and Controverſies, the divided Families deciding Queſtions of Religion by the Sword. The firſt Battel was fought near the Town of <hi>Dreux,</hi> the Kings Army being commanded by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the other by the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the Admiral <hi>de Coligni.</hi> The Succeſs was equal on both ſides, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the Conſtable being boht taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> laid Siege to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:96181:206"/>
and preſſed it ſo cloſe, that it was upon the point of yielding, when a Villain came to the Camp, and watching an opportunity for the execution of his Deſign, he ſlew this Prince with a Shot from a Carbine, as he was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from viſiting the Works, attended only by Three Horſemen. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe's</hi> Death was extreamly prejudicial to <hi>France:</hi> beſides his Military Perfections, which rendred this Duke the greateſt Captain in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he had gain'd the Peoples Hearts by ſuch a Charming Sweetneſs, ſuch admirable Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Sincerity, and ſuch Courteous and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Behaviour, that one could not forbear loving him. His Death almoſt ruin'd the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of his Houſe. A Peace was afterwards concluded, but 'twas only to give both Parties leiſure to make Preparation for beginning the War afreſh. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> freed out of Priſon, made great Levies in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſoon got a new Army on Foot. He endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſurprize and carry away the King, as he was returning from <hi>Meaux</hi> to <hi>Paris:</hi> but a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion of Six Thouſand <hi>Switzers,</hi> which guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Court in its March, and repulſed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Attacks by the way, ruin'd this Audacious Deſign. Some time after the Conſtable, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with his Nephews, whom he accuſed of Ingratitude and Revolt, gave them Battel in the Plain of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> routed them, and raiſed the Siege from before <hi>Paris.</hi> The Conſtable, who was near Fourſcore years old, received a Mortal Wound in his Reins by a Piſtol Shot, as he was in the midſt of the Fight, charging

the Enemies with a Vigour, worthy his Name and his Office. The <hi>Hugonots</hi> though van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht, made Peace on what Terms they pleaſed, the Queen being obliged to accept them, as frighted with the great Number of Forreign and Domeſtick Forces, that filled the Kingdom. This Second Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation was alſo but a Ceſſation of Arms, the War breaking forth again with more Fury than before. The <hi>Hugonots</hi> loſt a Third Battel at <hi>Jarnac,</hi> gain'd by the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who commanded the King his Bothers Army, where the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was ſlain upon the Place.</p>

                     <hi>Gaſpar de Coligny</hi> was a Gentleman of a good Family, but much more conſiderable by that of his Mother, who was Siſter to the Conſtable <hi>de Mommorency.</hi> His Unkle, whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He had been employed in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Important Negotiations, by which he had acquired a perfect Underſtanding of Affairs. He was a Man of a thorow Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but cloſe, full of Addreſs, naturally Eloquent, and no leſs a Stateſman than a Soldier, tho' far more cautious, than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent'rous. In the Year 1522. <hi>France</hi> being
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:96181:207"/>
almoſt ruined, there was a new Agreement made.</p>
                  <p>The Admiral at the ſame time negotiated a Marriage between the Princeſs <hi>Margaret,</hi> the Kings Siſter, and <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre. Anthony,</hi> his Father, dyed ſome years before of a Wound, receiv'd at the Siege of <hi>Roan.</hi> The Admiral came to <hi>Paris</hi> to aſſiſt at the Marriage, followed by ſo great a number of Gentlemen and Vaſſals, that the King himſelf could ſcarce have found ſo Magnificent a Train. He was received with extraordinary Teſtimonies of Confidence and Friendſhip: He had often private Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the King; in which, 'twas known, they treated of making War upon <hi>Flanders;</hi> and this, we have ſince underſtood, obliged <hi>Philip</hi> the Second to ſtay in <hi>Italy,</hi> for fear of ſome Surprize from the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time there was a Rumour (whether grounded on Reallity, or invented by the Queen, who was laying a Snare for the Admiral, as her Enemies would have it) that the People, he had without any Order or Permiſſion, brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> under pretence of being preſent at the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Marriage, conſpired againſt the Royal Family. The Queen, whether the better to conceal her Deſign, or really fearing ſome ſecret Plot, cauſed the Guards of the <hi>Louvre</hi> to be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. Whilſt theſe things ware doing, the Admiral, returning from the King to his own Houſe, was wounded in the Right hand
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:96181:207"/>
by a Shot from an Arquebuſh, which was, by ſome People, ſaid to have been done by the Procurement of the Queen, or the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was accuſed, becauſe the Houſe in which the Aſſaſſin had planted himſelf, belonged to one of his Creatures, who had ſome time before left it empty, to prevent the diſcovery of this Action. Theſe Suſpitions were ſtrengthned by the irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Hatred there was between the Prince and the Admiral; and though the King had made them both promiſe him to keep quiet till his Majeſties Return to <hi>Paris;</hi> there was yet great likelyhood that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> attempted to deſtroy him.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that ſuſpected the Queen, ſaid, the Admirals Fortune and Authority created a Jealouſie in this Princeſs; That ſhe began to fear a Man ſhe had raiſed too high; That ſhe deſpair'd of re-ſetling Quiet in the State, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Life of ſo redoubted an Enemy; and that beſide the miſerable Condition of the Kingdom, the Murthers, Battels and Perils her ſelf and Children had been expoſed to, all which ſhe laid to his Charge; ſhe yet fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Force, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Stratagem; That ſhe was as skilful in theſe ſort of Intrigues as he could be; That ſhe had drawn him and the chief of his Party to <hi>Paris,</hi> on the occaſion of her
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:96181:208"/>
Daughters Marriage, the more ſecurely to deſtroy him; That he had been lur'd to Court by the Project of the <hi>Low-Gountry</hi> War, and the fair ſhews of Confidence and Eſteem; That ſhe had conſequently preſſed the young Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to revenge on him his Fathers Murther, to which this Prince was too much inclin'd, having only refus'd to do it for fear of diſpleaſing the King, and loſing the Friendſhip of the Nobility, who would after this Action have look'd upon him, as a Man without Honour or Faith; That the Queen had eas'd him of this Scruple, by repreſenting to him, that he would do a ſignal Service to the State in exterminating its moſt formidable Enemy; That 'twas the greateſt Sign of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he could ſhew the King; And, in fine, that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> engaged not in it, till he had firſt got an Order, written and ſigned by the Princeſſes own Hands.</p>
                  <p>But whether it was the Queen, or the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> or neither of them that were the Authors of this Enterprize, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral was no ſooner carryed into his Houſe, but the <hi>Hugonots</hi> ran thither in Crouds, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Town with Complaints and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs. They had the Confidence to accuſe the King, as well as the Duke, publiſhing, that none 'durſt have committed ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt without his Majeſties Protection; and yet the Queen had ſo carefully concealed it from him, that he knew nothing of it, till News was brought him of the Accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:96181:208"/>
the Admiral. He went preſently with the Queen to ſee him, teſtifying his Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Sorrow, and promiſing to make an exact Enquiry into it, and ſeverely to puniſh this Aſſaſſination. He left alſo his Guards about his Houſe, as well for the Honor, as Security of his Perſon: but underſtanding at his Return to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> ſuſpected him to be privy to it, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly were ſo impudent as to threaten him, he fell into a terrible Tranſport, which the Queen Mother, who abſolutely Govern'd him, diligently fomented; taking hold of this favourable Moment to make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve on a ſuddain Extirpation of his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Subjects, and ridding himſelf of an Enemy, ſo much the more dangerous, in that he was irreconcilable.</p>
                  <p>They were perſwaded at Court, that, as ſoon as the <hi>Hugonot-Lords</hi> were departed, they would begin a new Rebellion, much more Bloody than any of the former, and would call in Strangers to their Aſſiſtance. The <hi>Admiral</hi> himſelf could not forbear let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſlip ſome little Menaces, when the King, comforting him about his Wound, told him, <hi>It was not dangerous: I care not,</hi> anſwered he coldly, <hi>for loſing the uſe of a hand: for, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided I keep my Head, I hope, all will go well.</hi> It was ſaid by ſome, that the King held af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a Council with the Queen, and ſome of their intimateſt Confidents, in which 'twas reſolved no longer to endure
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:96181:209"/>
theſe Inſolencies, but forthwith to diſpatch the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and commit the executing of it to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe;</hi> and that the King, not to awaken their Diſtruſt, ſent him out of <hi>Paris</hi> on pretence of ſome Diſcontent; but he returned, according to Agreement, the One and Twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> at Night, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed by the Duke of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> the Kings natural Brother, glad of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſerving his Maſter, and alſo to Revenge himſelf without fear of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But there went at the ſame time a Report, that the Admirals Friends, aſſembled in his Houſe, had taken very wicked and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reſolutions, he having himſelf, by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pathetical Diſcourſe incited them to riſe up in Arms; That being all animated by the ſame Fury, they cryed out to go immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attack the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and deſtroy the King, the Princes his Brothers, and the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whoſe Death they had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though he were of their own Religion, becauſe the Admiral feared his Wit and Courage. But whilſt he loſes time in being too curious to take his Meaſures, he delivers himſelf up to his ill Fortune; and the King, informed of his Practiſes, haſtens the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Rebellion. Some endeavour'd to make it be believed, that this Conſpiracy was a Story, invented by the Queen Mother, who foreſeeing the Horror, the deſtruction of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> would cauſe, endeavoured
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:96181:209"/>
by theſe Calumnious Reports to mitigate the Peoples Indignation. However it was, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> about one of the Clock in the Morning forc't open the Admirals Houſe. A young <hi>German</hi> Gentleman, who had been bred a Page with the Dukes Father, and was ambitious of the Honor to give him the firſt Blow, entred his Chamber. The Admiral, riſing out of his Bed, conjur'd him to have Reſpect to his old Age and his Infirmities, and grant him his Life. But the <hi>German,</hi> reproaching him with Treaſon and Apoſtaſie, mortally wounded him, and cauſed him to be thrown out at Window to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who guarded the entrance into the Houſe. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Coligny</hi> fell down as dead, but hearing the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> calling to have him thrown out, he made ſome reſiſtance againſt thoſe that went to take him up, and caſt him forth into the Street, deſiring them to let him dye in quiet; whereupon they diſpatcht him. The Rabble, vomiting out a Thouſand Curſes againſt him, dragg'd him for ſome time in the Dirt; they tore him aſunder, and filled the Town with pieces of his Body. A young <hi>Pariſian</hi> cut off his Head, and carryed it on a long Pole into all the Publick Places, and the Trunk of his Body was hung up by the Feet on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gallows.</p>
                  <p>Thus ended <hi>Gaſpar de Coligni,</hi> Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> who was raiſed to ſo great a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that his Court was no leſs than the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:96181:210"/>
King's. He made himſelf redoubted by <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and though he made not War upon King <hi>Philip,</hi> he created him Trouble enough by ſtirring up the <hi>Low Countries</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and under-hand protecting the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> He often impoſed on the King his Maſter a Neceſſity of making Peace and War; but what renders his Memory moſt durable, is, that having been twice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and loſt three Battels, he ſtill kept the ſame Authority with his Party, and never ſhewed more Courage and Conſtancy, than in the midſt of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Diſgraces: yet it is certain, he was rather a cunning, than a valiant Captain, very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in chooſing his Poſt, but diſtruſtful of the Fortune of War in Battels, and not engaging himſelf, but in the laſt Extremity.</p>
                  <p>The Count <hi>de la Rochefoucault, Teligny, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daillan, Clermont, d' Amboiſe,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Hugonots</hi> of Quality were ſlain the ſame Night. <hi>Mongommery</hi> was for ſome time purſued by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who eagerly ſought to kill him; but he fled into <hi>England</hi> at the firſt Report of the Admiral's Death.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hugonots</hi> had ſo highly incenſed the People, that it was impoſſible to moderate their Fury, till they had made a very great and lamentable Slaughter.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor gave always Hopes, that he would ſign the Treaty of Allyance, though he had a very great Repugnance to make War

But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired alſo not to diſcontent the Pope nor the <hi>Venetians.</hi> That, which held them thus in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, was the Paſſion, he had to get the Prince <hi>Erneſtus,</hi> his Son, choſen King of <hi>Poland, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund Auguſtus,</hi> the deceaſed King, having left no Heirs. <hi>Maximilian</hi> conſider'd this Crown, as an Acquiſition, that would much augment his Power. The <hi>Polonians</hi> were then at Peace with the Port; but there was need of great Sums to purchaſe the Principal Electors Suffrages; ſo that the Money and Favour of the <hi>French</hi> prevailing above the Authority of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> was preferr'd before the Emperors Son. In the mean time <hi>Maximilian</hi> treated ſtill with the Pope, ſhewing the greater earneſtneſs, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer he was not to take up Arms. The Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, reſolved to refuſe him nothing, that they might draw him in, and all <hi>Germany,</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him Five Thouſand Foot more than the Troops he had ask'd of Cardinal <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. John Delphini,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Torcello,</hi> the Pope's <hi>Nuncio,</hi> with his Imperial Majeſty, had agreed, That there ſhould be given Five and Twenty Thouſand Foot, and Four Thouſand Five Hundred Horſe, on condition, that <hi>Maximilian</hi> ſhould bring into the Field as great an Army as the Succour of the Confederates amounted to. The Auxiliary Troops were to ſtay in his Service Six Months in the Year, to enter into Winter Quarters with his Army in
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:96181:211"/>
ſuch Poſts, as were moſt commodious, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious for the Progreſs of the <hi>German</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and this Treaty to continue, as long as the War ſhould laſt; the Emperor deſired far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that, whoever of the Confederates ſhould break the League, ſhould be look'd upon as an Enemy, and that the Pope ſhould with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Solemnities iſſue out the greater Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication againſt him; but this laſt Article was refuſed him, and in lieu thereof 'twas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, That for the Payment of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Troops, deſtin'd to his Service, Money ſhould be ſent every Three Months to <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> for which the Richeſt Merchants of the Town ſhould be ſecurity. The Emperor, on theſe Conditions, engag'd this Year to make War on <hi>Hungary,</hi> with a deſign to keep up the League; but he was determin'd to find daily new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences not to enter into the Field, excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſometimes on the Tediouſneſs of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and Diets, and ſometimes on the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of raiſing Soldiers and Money out of the Soveraign Eſtates of <hi>Germany.</hi> As ſoon as <hi>Gregory</hi> underſtood the Concluſion of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Emperor, he ſent for the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadour, to whom he imparted this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able News, giving him Order to aſſure the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of it. The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſend his Fleet this Year into <hi>Greece;</hi> and the Pope, to encourage the <hi>Venetians,</hi> made Preparations to augment that of the Holy <hi>See.</hi> Theſe fair Hopes, which, the <hi>Venetians</hi> well knew, would come to nothing, ſerv'd only to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:96181:211"/>
make his Holineſs take more heinouſly the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks Agreement with the Port.</p>
                  <p>The Spring was now far advanced, and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> vehemently importun'd the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſend their Fleets immediately to <hi>Corfou,</hi> when <hi>Tipoli</hi> received advice from the Senate, that the Peace was concluded at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople. Barbaro</hi> had no ſooner received Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to treat with the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> but he apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ſeriouſly to it. He knew, 'twas the Intention of the Colledge of <hi>Ten,</hi> whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by this means he ſhould gain: He alſo knew the Weakneſs of the Commonwealth, and that he ſhould at the ſame time recover his own Liberty. The <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour at the Port concerned himſelf much in this Affair by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the King his Maſter, and fervently ſollicited <hi>Mahomet</hi> about it: but theſe good Offices ſerved only to render this Miniſter more difficult, becauſe he would not ſhare the Honour or Profit of this Negotiation with any one. <hi>Barbaro,</hi> perceiving it, pretended to be ſick, and ask'd leave for <hi>Solomon,</hi> the ſame <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Phyſitian, he had already made uſe of, to come to him. <hi>Solomon</hi> was no ſooner entred the Chamber, where he was kept, but <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> making him Preſents and Promiſes, conjur'd him to do his Endeavour, to procure an end to his Impriſonment, and Repoſe to his Country, letting him underſtand, that 'twould be no leſs to his Advantage than his Honour, if he brought it to paſs. The <hi>Jew,</hi> leaving <hi>Barbaro,</hi> went to the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> whom the difficulty of ſetting forth a new Fleet rendred
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:96181:212"/>
much more tractable: He ſounded him, to find how he was inclined to an Accomodation, and afterwards propos'd it to him. <hi>Mahomet</hi> at firſt entred into a particular Debate upon the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Peace, demanding, that the Republick ſhould give the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fou,</hi> the Towns of <hi>Cataro</hi> and <hi>Budua,</hi> and fhould pay him all the Charges of the War. <hi>Barbaro</hi> anſwered with a great deal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, that the Republick would part with nothing of what they poſſeſſed before the War, that they would reſtore <hi>Supoto,</hi> and only in reſpect make <hi>Selim</hi> a Preſent of Threeſcore Thouſand Crowns in Gold, who ſhould alſo cauſe the Lands, which the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> to be reſtored. The <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> receded from the Demand of <hi>Corfou,</hi> but inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on the Surrender of <hi>Cataro</hi> and <hi>Budua,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Peace was not to be mentioned but on theſe Conditions, and threatning <hi>Soloman</hi> to have him ſtrangled, if he did not oblige the <hi>Venetian</hi> to yield him theſe two Places. <hi>And what?</hi> added he with a fierce and angry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, <hi>The</hi> Venetians, <hi>to obtain a Peace, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Solyman <hi>the ſtrong fortified Towns of</hi> Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plia <hi>and</hi> Malvafia, <hi>with all they had in</hi> Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus: <hi>and do they now make a Scruple of yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the</hi> Grand Seignior <hi>Two: One weak and half-ruin'd, and the other diſpeopled by the Spoil, the Plague has made in it?</hi> To bring the <hi>Venetian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour to his Bow, he ſpread a Report, That the <hi>Muſulman</hi> Fleet ſhould be compoſed of three Hundred Gallies, and as many ſmall Veſſels, and that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors had never as
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:96181:212"/>
yet ſet forth ſo numerous and formidable an one; That the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> aſſiſted by his Forces of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> would come in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and cover the Earth and Sea with Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Veſſels. But <hi>Antonio,</hi> who knew the Pride of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> fear'd not ſo much theſe ridiculous Menaces, as he did the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Neceſſities of the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>After many goings to and fro, and a very long diſcuſſion, the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> who had certain Information of what was reſolved on at <hi>Rome</hi> for the next Campaign, feared to break the Negotiation, and re-imbark himſelf in a much more troubleſom War, than that, which it was in his Power to end; ſo that becoming much more reaſonable, he agreed on a Peace with <hi>Barbaro</hi> on theſe Conditions: That the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould reſtore <hi>Supoto,</hi> with all the Canon they had taken in that place; That the Inhabitants, who would not ſtay there, ſhould have liberty to depart, and take with them their Moveables and other Goods; That the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> and the Commonwealth ſhould retain the places, of which they were then in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; That the Ancient Limits of the two States ſhould be re-eſtabliſh'd, and that every one ſhould re-enter into the Lands of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, he enjoyed before the War; That the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould pay fifteen hundred Crowns a year Tribute for the Iſle of <hi>Zant,</hi> though they had till that time paid but five Hundred; That they ſhould give the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Thouſand Crowns in ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and Threeſcore Thouſand to his firſt Miniſter
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:96181:213"/>
for his Negotiation; 'Twas added, that the Merchants on both ſides ſhould be ſet at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their Effects reſtor'd; That an Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſhould be made of ſuch as were no longer found in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and that in other things the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concluded with <hi>Solyman</hi> ſhould be executed. <hi>Barbaro</hi> preſenting <hi>Selim</hi> this, to ratifie it by Oath, the <hi>Sultan,</hi> beholding him with a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Look, ſaid nothing to him, but that he would exactly obſerve theſe Conditions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the <hi>Venetians</hi> fail'd not in their Reſpect to him, and gave no Councel nor Aſſiſtance to his Enemies. <hi>Barbaro</hi> immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht his Son to <hi>Venice</hi> with a Copy of this Treaty. The Young Man, who knew of what Importance this Affair was, with which he was charged, made ſuch ſpeed, that he was but Twenty days in going from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> which was more than ever any Courier did before him. He went in his <hi>Turkiſh</hi> habit to the <hi>Doge</hi>'s Palace, where the Council of <hi>Ten</hi> was then happily aſſembled. Theſe Magiſtrates, having read his Diſpatches, were of Opinion, that he ſhould not appear all the reſt of that day, and that his Arrival ſhould be conceal'd, till the Senate was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Concluſion of the Peace. They foreſaw, that ſuch ſurpriſing News would cauſe a very great Rumour and Commotion in the Town. The Council of <hi>Ten</hi> declar'd the next day in full Senate the urgent Reaſons that had forc'd them to an Accomodation with the Port, and procur'd the Peace to be ratified, which was at the ſame time publiſh'd. One
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:96181:213"/>
would have thought this News ſhould have given no little Joy to People, bred up in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and endebted for their Greatneſs to the Exerciſes and Arts, which are cultivated in Peace. In the mean time the People of <hi>Venice,</hi> though diſquieted by new Preparations for War, incommoded by the Interruption of their Trade, and loaded with extraordinary Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were for ſome days in ſuch a Conſternation (ſo little do the Multitude underſtand their own Intereſt) that, to ſee the Dejection and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Inhabitants, you would have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the City to be threatned with utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. The People of the other Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Eſtates, who ſaw not the Commonwealths preſſing Motives, conceived ſuch an <hi>Odium</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that their Subjects, nay their very Embaſſadors (whoſe Character is reſpected amongſt the moſt Barbarous Nations) were not ſafe amongſt them. The Emperor, whoſe ſlowneſs and delays were partly the cauſe of this Agreement, reproachfully ask'd <hi>Giovanni Corario,</hi> the Republicks Embaſſadour, What the Breakers of the Publick Faith merited; and this Miniſter did very Wiſely to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ſome days ſhut up in his Palace at <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and not expoſe himſelf to the Fury of the Vulgar, who were then ready to offer all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Outrage to thoſe, they called <hi>Venetians.</hi> But ſoon after <hi>Maximilian,</hi> underſtanding that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> receiv'd this news with Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference enough, treated <hi>Corario,</hi> who had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to retire to <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſet the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick at difference with him, as civilly as before.
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:96181:214"/>
When the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadour had told <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the Second, That his Maſters had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by their Inability to put an end to the War, this Prince anſwered him calmly enough, That he engag'd in the League only at his Holyneſſes Requeſt; That he believ'd the Senate wiſe enough not to do any thing without mature De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation; That 'twas ſufficient for him to have ſhewn all <hi>Europe;</hi> that he had undertaken and carryed on this Affair with as much Zeal as Conſtancy; and in fine, that 'twas juſt to yield to the Sentiments of the Parties that were chiefly concerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tiepoli</hi> receiv'd about Noon this News by an expreſs Courier, and went immediately to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Holyneſs with it, who was gone to take the Air at <hi>Freſcati,</hi> in the Vineyard of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Altemps.</hi> The Pope ask'd him, ſmiling, What Good News he had to tell him: To which this Miniſter anſwered very ſeriouſly, That he came to communicate to his Holyneſs the Concluſion of a Peace between the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth and the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi> The Pope, ſtrangely ſurprized, interrupted <hi>Tipoli,</hi> forbad him to ſay any more, and commanded him to be gone. The Embaſſadour humby did his utmoſt to pacifie <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Diſpleaſure; but he would hear neither his Reaſons nor his Prayers, and paſſing into another Chamber, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined him to return immediately. <hi>Tipoli,</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leſt the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Soldiers, who paſſed continually to go and embark at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> might offer him ſome Violence, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his Friends in his Palace. He met ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:96181:214"/>
of theſe Soldiers on his way, as he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> who would have done him a Miſchief, had they diſtruſted that he came from confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Reports of Peace, which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpread about the Town. One of his Domeſticks, a Native of <hi>Padua,</hi> being behind his back, when he opened his Pacquets, caſt his Eyes on the Letter, which gave advice of the Peace, and no ſooner ſaw his Maſter on his way for <hi>Freſcati,</hi> but he went to acquaint Cardinal <hi>Cornaro</hi> with the news. The Pope, perplex'd and troubled, returned at Night to <hi>Rome,</hi> and gave order for the Sacred Colledge to aſſemble on the morrow. His Holineſſes ſudden Return made this Matter very publick, and the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo incens'd at it, that if any one would have Headed the People, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour would have been attack't in his Palace, againſt the Doors and Windows of which the ruder ſort began already to throw Stones. The <hi>Venetians</hi> were publickly ſtyl'd forſworn Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ſome of them were outrag'd, and their very Name was for ſeveral days abhorred at <hi>Rome.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Miniſters, who had the greateſt Reaſon to be diſpleaſed, ſhewed nevertheleſs far more Moderation than the Popes Subjects. His Holineſs, deſiring to black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and render them ſtill more culpable, repreſented in full Conſiſtory, that, when the Emperor was at his Requeſt, in fine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to declare War againſt the Infidels; when the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had aſſured him by his Embaſſadors, that he would enter into the League; when he hop'd on certain Conditions
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:96181:215"/>
to break the Alliance between <hi>France</hi> and the Port; when, to compleat their Felicity, he had certain Advice, that the new King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the declar'd Enemy of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Foot a great Army, to invade <hi>Turkie;</hi> and when the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had conceived the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Hopes Imaginable to break their Chains, and exterminate their common Adverſary: the <hi>Vene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ians</hi> had overthrown all theſe great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns by perfidiouſly making a ſhameful Peace with theſe <hi>Barbarians.</hi> He then inveighed very much againſt them, treating them as perjur'd Traitors, and revoking all the Graces, his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors had granted them in conſideration of this War. He even enjoin'd them to reſtore the Money they had levyed on certain Benifices, to which they immediately paid an exact Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He forbad all the Subjects of the Holy <hi>See</hi> to engage without his Leave in the Service of the Repulick, ſhut up the <hi>Granaries</hi> of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glia</hi> and <hi>Marca di. Ancona,</hi> and did them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Diſpleaſures, which, though appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently very grievous, were much leſs terrible, than what the Senate expected from the publick Indignation, and the Wrath of a Soveraign Prelate, who might ſtrike them with all the Thunders of Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadour, who ſaw that <hi>Gregory</hi> affected to appear much ſeverer than he naturally was, feared, leſt in the firſt motions of his Choler, he might carry things to the utmoſt Extremities; but his Holineſs breaking forth only in Reproaches and Menaces he procur'd the <hi>Venetian</hi> Cardinals to intercede
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:96181:215"/>
with him. They beſought him to conſider, that the Deſtruction of the Commonwealth would be no leſs prejudicial to the Holy <hi>See,</hi> than the aggrandiſing of a Foreign Power, which already threatned all its Neighbours: that their Ruine would be fatal to all <hi>Italy,</hi> and draw with it that of the Eccleſiaſtical State. <hi>Tipoli</hi> obſerv'd, that theſe Reaſons had already made ſome Impreſſion on the Popes Mind. He did his endeavour to obtain an Audience; but <hi>Gregory</hi> ſtill refus'd to give him any, telling thoſe that ſollicited it, He would not receive the excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the <hi>Venetians</hi> but in the preſence of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Colledge, and other Witneſſes of the Treaty, which they had ſo baſely violated. In the mean time his Anger by little and little abated, and <hi>Tipoli</hi> knowing that he uſed a great deal of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence on himſelf to paſs for an inflexible Man, propoſed to the Senate the ſending an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Embaſſadour to <hi>Rome,</hi> not doubting but ſo unuſual a Proceeding, might find ſome favour with him. The Senate approved of this Expedient, and <hi>Nicholas Ponti,</hi> who was Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years of Age, was choſen for this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie. He departed immediately, and arrived ſooner at <hi>Rome,</hi> than his Old Age ſeem'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him. He found the Pope reſolute not to give him Audience any where but in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory. In the mean time ſome of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cardinals obtained of the Pope, that he ſhould be receiv'd in the ſame manner as the other Embaſſadours were. <hi>Ponti</hi> with a great deal of Clearneſs and Eloquence laid open the Reaſons and Motives which obliged the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:96181:216"/>
to make their Accommodation with <hi>Selim. Gregory</hi> heard him quietly, and appear'd ſo much the more ſatisfied with his Diſcourſe, as he flatter'd himſelf at the ſight of this venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Old Man, who was Ten years older than His Holyneſs, <hi>That he might live yet ſeveral years;</hi> and this agreeable Thought contributed not a little to the Satisfaction, which the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> receiv'd in this Audience. The Pope complained only of their making a Peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acquainting him with their Intention, and diſmiſs'd the Embaſſadour with Teſtimonies of a perfect Reconciliation. <hi>Ponti</hi> viſited all the Cardinals apart, confirming to them what he had ſaid in publick to his Holineſs, and leaving <hi>Tipoli</hi> in the Functions of his Employ, returned to <hi>Venice</hi> to give an account of the happy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Voyage.</p>
