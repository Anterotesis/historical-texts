            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ A Preface vnto the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Manuel ſo liked me, and the wel accepting of other bookes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I haue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to the ſame purpoſe, ſo pricked me forward, that I thought it requiſite to ſet foorth the ſame in ſuch order as I haue done.</p>
            <p>The rather I tooke this in hand before anie other in the workes of S. Auguſtine, becauſe this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie hath bene annexed in our Engliſh tong vnto thoſe of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, which alreadie I haue tranſlated; and therefore that, as hetherto they haue ben ioined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo hencefoorth they may be, if it ſo like the owners, I thought good to do this afore anie other. Againe, who ſo wil dulie compare this with the other, eſpecialie with S. Auguſtines praiers, ſhal find this to be euen an abſtract in a maner of the reſt, containing ſpecial and piked meditations in few words,
<pb facs="tcp:426:3"/>
which in other bookes be more at large. Finalie, had this booke nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ben ioined, nor yet had ſuch affinitie with the other of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine alreadie in Engliſh: yet, ſo ſingularlie diuine are the praiers compriſed in the ſame, that wel I could not publiſh anie other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this were finiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>This Booke why called a Manuel.</hi>
               </note>I do cal this booke, as alſo the author doth, a Manuel, becauſe my wiſh is, that Chriſtians would vſe, and haue it in their hands, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie when they are at home in their chambers, and ſtudies priuatelie, but alſo when they are abroade in the fields, gardens, and elſe-where idlelie: and that not to dandle, and to handle onlie, but diligentlie, and zealouſlie, as the part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians is, to reade the ſame for their ſpiritual exerciſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Author of this Booke, who.</hi>
               </note>Touching the Author, who hee was, I dare not directlie ſet downe. For in ſome copies I finde, that S. Auguſtine made the ſame, in others it is flatlie denied. Therefore, although it be enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled S. Auguſtines Manuel: yet is it in none other ſenſe applied vnto him, than are diuers Pſalmes
<pb facs="tcp:426:3"/>
in the Pſalter, entituled <hi>Dauid his Pſalmes,</hi> which happelie Dauid neuer ſawe, much leſſe endited. Notwithſtanding, were S.

For the matter it conteineth, is verie ſpiritual, godlie, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie: and wiſe men either do not reſpect the Author, or not the Author ſo much as the matter; nor ſo much who writeth, as what is ſet downe.</p>
            <p>The Argument of this booke is doubtles verie good,<note place="margin">3 <hi>The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Booke.</hi>
               </note> either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie meditations, or praiers: <hi>the one whereof,</hi> which is meditation (as Bernard noteth <note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>The occaſion of making this treatiſe was this.<note place="margin">4 <hi>The occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on why this Booke was made.</hi>
               </note> The Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering

the frailtie of al men in general, and eſpecialie his owne weakenes in particular; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome prop to ſtaie himſelfe from falling, found none ſo ſure à ſtaie againſt the engins of Satan and his limmes, as continual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and praier. And therefore out of the meditations and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the fathers (for ſo he ſaith) he gathered this booke, as à pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious iewel alwaie to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, both to keepe him from ſecuritie, and to enflame the zeale of godlines within him when he waxed colde.</p>

               </note>The methode (for that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtance to be noted in anie booke) is verie exquiſite: for neuer did Goldſmith more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninglie diſpoſe either pretious ſtones in à iewel, or linkes in à golden chaine, than are both the meditations in this Manuel, and the ſentences in each meditation, and each phraze wel-nigh in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſentence.</p>

For it containeth ſtrange, that I ſaie not erroneous doctrine: as that <hi>Vnicuique</hi>

            <p>Againe, another Chapter there is, though not cleane left out, yet applied from an il, vnto a good purpoſe, as the eleuenth Chapter, where that which was ſpoken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſacrifice of the altar, is
<pb facs="tcp:426:5"/>
applied vnto our Sacrament of thankeſgiuing, or of the real and carnal preſence of Chriſt, vnto his ſpiritual being at the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And theſe are the things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in this booke.</p>
            <p>To conclude, whatſoeuer is done either in tranſlating, correcting, quoting, or publiſhing this booke, is al done for thy edification, and to prouoke thee vnto this godlie exerciſe of praier.
