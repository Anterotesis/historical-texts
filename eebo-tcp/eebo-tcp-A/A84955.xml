            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and Perticular
RELATION
Of that Strange, Horrible, and (in <hi>England</hi>)
Unheard-of Murther,
VVhich was Committed on the Body of the late
Famous Dr. CLENCH,
In an <hi>Hackney</hi>-Coach, near <hi>Leaden-Hall-Market</hi>; on
<date>
                  <hi>Monday</hi>-Night, the 4<hi>th.</hi> of this Inſtant <hi>Jan.</hi> 1692.</date>
            </head>
            <p>LAST Night, being <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> Inſtant, about a quarter paſt
<hi>Nine,</hi> Dr. <hi>Clench</hi> went from <hi>John</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe in <hi>Fullers-Rents,</hi> to
his late dwelling-Houſe in <hi>Brown-low Street;</hi> where he had not been
long, before a Meſſenger came to deſire him to come to Two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
who were at the <hi>Devil Tavern</hi> near <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> in order to Viſit a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of conſiderable Account, who was dangerouſly ill; upon which he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
went with the ſaid Meſſenger, not ordering his Coach or Coachman to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him, but being come to the Gentlemen, at the aforeſaid Tavern, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him to take Coach with them, in order to go to this Patient near <hi>White
Chappel;</hi> upon which they paid their Reckoning, and called a Coach to the
Tavern Door; but in their way, between <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> and <hi>Leaden-Hall-Street,</hi>
theſe two Perſons (after the <hi>Turks</hi> manner) moſt Barbarouſly Murthered the
Doctor, by Strangling him; now coming near <hi>Leaden-Hall-Market,</hi> they called
out to the Coachman to ſtop, and gave him <hi>Three-Shillings, Six pence,</hi> and bid
him ſtep into the <hi>Market,</hi> and Buy the beſt <hi>Capon</hi> he could light on; the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
innocently takes the Money, and goes into the <hi>Market</hi> according to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
but he was no ſooner gone, but the <hi>Two Ruffins</hi> made their Eſcape,
and the ſaid Coachman returning ſoon after, with the <hi>Poulterer,</hi> bringing
with them ſeveral Fowls for the Gentlemen to take their choice, but they
were no ſooner come to the Coach ſide, but they found the door of it open,
the two Gentlemen gone, and (to their great ſurpriſe) the Doctor alone lying
dead in the Coach; upon which ſoon after, the Doctors body being brought
to his own Houſe, in <hi>Brown-low-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> Conſtables and Watchmen
were ſent out into ſeveral Parts, in ſearch of the Murtherers; but as yet no
Account can be learnt of them; what induc'd theſe Barbarous Homecides to
commit this Fact is not yet known; tho' its thought it may be an inveterate
Malice, and Revenge, not unlike That of Eſquire <hi>Thynn.</hi> The Doctor was a very
Worthy, Honeſt, and Charitable Gentleman; and is very much lamented by all
that knew him.</p>
            <p>NOW, for the Hainouſneſs of this Sin of <hi>Murther,</hi> I ſuppoſe none can be
ignorant, that it is of the deepeſt Die, a moſt Loud crying Sin.
This we may ſee in the firſt Act of this kind that ever was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<hi>Abels blood cryeth from the earth, Gen.</hi> 4. 10. Yea, the Guilt
of this Sin is ſuch, that it leaves even a ſtain upon the Land where it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
ſuch as is not to be waſhed out, but by the Blood of the Murtherer,
as appears, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 12, 13. The Land cannot be Purged of Blood, but by the
blood of him that ſhed it; and therefore, though in other caſes, the flying to
the Altar ſecured a Man, yet in this of <hi>Willful Murther,</hi> no ſuch Refuge was
allowed; but ſuch a one was to be taken thence, and delivered up to Juſtice,
<hi>Exod. 21. 14. Thou ſhalt take him from the Altar, that he may die.</hi> And it is
farther obſervable, that the only two Receipts which the Scripture mentions,
as given to <hi>Noah</hi> after the Flood, were both in Relation to this ſin; that of
not eating blood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 4. being a Ceremony to beget in Men a greater
horrour of this ſin of Murther, and ſo intended for the preventing of it. The
other was for the puniſhment of it. <hi>Gen. 9. 6. He that ſheddeth man's blood, by
men ſhall his blood be ſhed;</hi> and the reaſon of this ſtricktneſs is added in the
next words; <hi>For in the image of God made he man:</hi> where you ſee this ſin is
not only an Injury to our Brother, but even the higheſt deſpite and comtempt
towards God himſelf; for it is the defacing of His Image, which He hath ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
upon Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
