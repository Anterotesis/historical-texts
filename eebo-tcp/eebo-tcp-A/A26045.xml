            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In regard that the neerer men approach to ſuch excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the neerer (without doubt) do they come unto goodneſſe, to felicyty, and to God himſelfe.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Punctum,</hi> or a Point, is the beginning of things, or a prick ſuppoſed indiviſible, void of length, breadth, and depth; as in the figure following is noted by the Point or Prick A.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Linea,</hi> or a Line, is a ſuppoſed length, or a thing extending it ſelfe in length, not having breadth nor thickneſſe, as is ſet forth unto you by the Line B AD.</p>

                     <head>dem: 8.</head>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Parallela,</hi> or a Parallell Line, is a Line drawne by the ſide of another Line, in ſuch ſort that they may
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44506:6"/>
be equidiſtant in all places. And of ſuch Parallels two only belong unto this work of the plain Scale, that is to ſay, the right lined parallell, and the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Parallell.</p>
                  <p>Right lined Parallells, are two right lines equidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant one from another, which being drawn forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, would never touch or meete one another, as you may ſee in the figure where the line H. I. is Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell unto the line C. E. and the line G. F. is Parallell unto them both.</p>
                  <p>A circular Parallell is a Circle drawn eyther within or without another Circle upon the ſame Centre, as you may plainly ſee by the two Circles B. C. D. E. and X. V. Y. W. Theſe Circles are both drawne upon the Centre A. and therefore are Parallell the one unto the other. There is another kinde of Parallell alſo, which is called a ſerpentine Parallell, but becauſe it is not belonging unto the uſe of this Scale, I will omit it and ſo proceede unto the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Perpendiculum,</hi> or Perpendicular is a Line rayſed from, or let fall upon another Line, making equall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles on both ſides, as you may ſee declared in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, wherin the Line A. C. is perpendicular unto the line B. A. D. making equall angles in the point A.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diameter Circuli,</hi> or the Diameter of a Circle, is a right Line drawne thorow the Centre of any circle, in ſuch ſort that it may divide the Circle into two equall parts, as you may ſee the line B. A. D. is the Diameter of the Circle B. C. D. E. becauſe it paſſeth thorow the Centre A. and the two ends therof do divide the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle into two equall parts, in the two extrems B. &amp; D making the ſemicircle B. C. D. equall unto the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle D. E. B.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Semidiameter circuli,</hi> or the Semidiameter of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44506:7"/>
is halfe of the Diameter, and is contayned betwixt the Centre, and the one ſide of the Circle, as the Line A D, in the Semidiameter of the Circle B C D E.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Semi-circulus,</hi> or a Semi-circle, is the one halfe of a Circle, drawne upon his Diameter, and is contained upon the Superficies, or Surface of the Diameter, as the Semicircle B C D, which is halfe of the Circle B C D E, and is contayned above the Diameter B A D.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quadrans circuli,</hi> is the fourth part of a Circle, and is contayned betwixt the Semidiameter of the Circle, and a line drawn Perpendicular, unto the Diameter of the ſame Circle, from the Centre thereof, dividing the Semicircle into two equall parts, of the which parts, the one is the quadrant, or fourth part of the ſame Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. As for example, the Diameter of the Circle B C D E, is the line B A D, dividing the Circle into two equall parts: then from the Centre A, raiſe the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular A C, dividing the Semicircle likewiſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two equall parts, ſo as A B C, or A C D, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond part of the Scale, is the ſingle Corde

This Cord is in uſe to meaſure any part, or arch of a Circle not ſurmounting 90 degrees: The number of theſe degrees from 1 unto 60, is called the Radius of the Scale, upon which diſtance, all Circles are to be drawne, whereupon 60 of theſe degrees are the Semidiameter of any Circle, that is drawn upon that Radius.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond Line of Longitude is divided into 100 proportionable parts, or into 100 unequall Leagues; and every league is ſubdivided into miles, and halfe miles.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt it is to be underſtood, that by the ſwift motion of the firſt mover, the Moon and all the reſt of the Stars and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, are turned about the World in 24 houres, upon which ſwift motion of the Moon, the dayly motions of the Sea do depend, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sea falleth not out alwaies at one houre,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44506:35"/>
the reaſon therof is, becauſe of the ſwift motion of the Moon in regard ſhe goeth almoſt 13 degrees in 24 houres, and the Sun mooveth ſcarce one degree: which gives every day 12 degrees, that the Moon commeth ſlower to any point in the Heaven then the Sunne: which 12 degrees makes 48 minutes of time for the difference of every full Sea, according unto the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle motion of the Moon, which difference is here ſet downe in this Table for every day of the Moons age. Therfore if you would know the full Sea at any place in the World, firſt you muſt know at what houre it is full Sea at the new or full Moon; which houres and minutes keep in minde, then ſeek the age of the Moon as is before taught, and with the number of her age enter this Table, under the title of the Moons age, and having found her age in the Table, againſt it you ſhall find the houres and minutes which are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto the time that the Moon maketh full Sea in any place, and the whole number of houres and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes is the time that the Moon maketh full Sea in any place upon the day deſired. As for enſample, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know the full Sea at <hi>London</hi> bridge upon the 13 of <hi>July</hi> 1624. the age of the Moon being found as before, is eight daies, then in the Table I finde eight daies, and againſt it 6 houres, and 24 minutes, which being added unto 3 houres, the full Sea upon the change day gives 9 a clock, 24 minutes for the time at the full Sea upon the 13 day of <hi>July</hi> 1624.</p>
