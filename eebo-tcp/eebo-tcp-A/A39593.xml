         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Then are contained in this Treatiſe the Heads of the Advantages which this Art will afford to Navigation, and alſo to the Inhabitants of Places to which Nature affords only Brackiſh Waters.</p>
               <p>To this is added, Firſt, A Letter written by the Eminent Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> by which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts the Sweetneſs and Wholſomneſs of this Water; and that it kept above four Months in his cuſtody without ſtinking.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſaid Mr. <hi>Boyl's</hi> Experiment made before the King, whereby he could diſcover in any Water if there was but one thouſandth part of Salt in it, and yet in this Water could not find any.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A Letter of the Third of <hi>November</hi> 1683. from on Board the <hi>Grey-hound</hi> Friggot, near the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein the Captain writes, that he kept of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees Water, ſome that was given him, in his Ships Hold, from his leaving <hi>England,</hi> to the day before the Date, being four Months; and then, having ſeveral Officers on board him, gave them a taſte of it, pretending it to be of the Spring near <hi>Sally,</hi> where he had watered, and they drank of it as ſuch, till he diſcovered what it was, and then they approved of it to be as good Water as could be drank.</p>

               <head>The ſecond <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> written by Doctor <hi>Nehemiah Grew,</hi> likewiſe Dedicated to His Majeſty, demonſtrates three Propoſitions.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, That Sea-Water may eaſily, ſafely, commodiouſly, and in ſufficient Quantities, be made Freſh for all common Uſes at Sea.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Water ſo made freſh, is as wholeſom to be drunk, and uſed about Diet, as any other Water now in Uſe at Sea.</p>
               <p>To prove which, is ſhewed, that all the ſigns, which either Phyſicians or common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience have given of the beſt Water, are found in this, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Clearneſs, 2. Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 3. Sweetneſs. 4. Softneſs to the Touch. 5. Lightneſs. 6. Durableneſs. 7. Purity and Simplicity.</p>
               <p>In all which Qualities it equals, if not exceeds the beſt Waters about <hi>London,</hi> as was found by nice Tryals made thereof.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, beſides all theſe ſignes, the wholeſomneſs is proved from the Uſe of this Water which has been often drunk by Perſons of Quality and Judgment, with Approbation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The third Propoſition ſhews the Advantages of making Sea-water freſh are great, both as to Profit and Health.
<list>
                     <item>1. As to Profit, by ſaving of Stowage, which is very conſiderable in long Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. 2. By ſaving of Water Casks. 3. By preventing Wear and Tear, and other Dammage of Veſſels and Boats in watering.</item>
                     <item>2. As to Health, moſt Water in long Voyages ſtinking, even Thames-Water, tho it recovers again; and being drank when it ſtinks, or is in its Fermentation, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Bodies of Men to Calentures, Fevers, Dropſies, and other Diſeaſes.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But this Water may alwayes be made freſh, or will alwayes keep ſo, and ſecures from ſcarcity, or want of freſh Water; the firſt of which is dangerous to Mens Health, the laſt mortal. This Water being to be made with eaſe and plenty, will ſerve to freſhen the ſalt Meats, by watering the Beef or Pork in it after ſoaking in Salt Water, as alſo will mend the Diet at Sea; for with freſh Water good Meat may be made with Bisket, Wheat, or Rice, and a little Sugar or Butter; which may prevent Scurvies, Dropſies, and diverſe other Diſeaſes, which a continual ſalt Diet cauſes.</p>

Since which time they have ſet up their Engines at their Office in <hi>Lothbury;</hi> where the Engines and Ingredients may be had at ſo eaſie rates that the Water will ſtand in about one farthing a Gallon.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Inſtruments and Water have been ſeen and examined by moſt of the publick Miniſters of Forreign Princes reſiding in <hi>London,</hi> and by them recommended to their reſpective Princes and States.</p>

               <p>His Majeſty upon good Teſtimonies thereof, hath directed Proviſions to be made of the ſaid Engines and Ingredients for his Navy-Royal, and Forts near the Sea, wanting freſh Water.
